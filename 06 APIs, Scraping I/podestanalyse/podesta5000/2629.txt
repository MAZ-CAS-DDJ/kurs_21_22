The bill passed by the House today will end insurance company abuses like denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, extend affordable coverage to the millions of Americans who do not have it today, and relieve the anxiety of those living one illness away from bankruptcy. This paid-for bill will also make important investments in prevention to keep families healthy, cut waste, fraud and abuse from the system, and rein in costs to put our economy on a path towards a sound fiscal future.\r\n\r\n"Today, history called, and the House of Representatives answered by voting to give hard-working Americans a better shot at the healthy families and financial security they deserve. Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s the Senate\'s turn to do the same."\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\nThe Center for American Progress<http://www.americanprogress.org/> is a nonpartisan research and educational institute dedicated to promoting a strong, just and free America that ensures opportunity for all.
