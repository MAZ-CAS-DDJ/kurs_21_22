john.podesta@gmail.comb'Team \xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n\nSanders is going up tomorrow with significant (1,200-1,600 pts) Ohio and\nIllinois and a small buy in Missouri.  Our plan all along had been to go as\nsoon as he goes, so that\xe2\x80\x99s what we plan to do tomorrow \xe2\x80\x93 with fairly\naggressive buys in the main media markets in those states (up to 2,400\npoints).  We\xe2\x80\x99ll get updated competitives around asap, but along the lines\nof what a group of us discussed the other day, we\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting we\ninitially launch with this battery (combining our basic core message spot\nwith a top-testing narrower approach):\n\n\n\nIllinois: dual track \xe2\x80\x9cBreaking Barriers\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cJohnson Control\xe2\x80\x9d (top\ntesting message in Illinois poll; ad tested well in last week\xe2\x80\x99s groups)\n\nMissouri and Ohio: dual track \xe2\x80\x9cBreaking Barriers\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cValeant\xe2\x80\x9d (top\ntesting message in those surveys \xe2\x80\x93 and top scoring ad in testing).\n\nAnd then we use tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s groups and the online ad-testing to help inform\ntraffic changes for next week \xe2\x80\x93  and whether to stay in a corporate greed\nlane (wham bam), or move to education (as surveys suggested) or a jobs\napproach (perhaps if we\xe2\x80\x99re enthralled in a trade debate).\n\nI think we\xe2\x80\x99re all basically on the same page here, but please flag any\nconcerns.\n\nThanks,\n\nOren\n'
