I realize that you might well be wondering if THIS is a legitimate email, but please be assured that I am NOT asking you to click anything in the email. Indeed, Julie is instructing you NOT to click anything in the email that I am forwarding.\n\nGerry Spann\n\nFrom: Julie O\x92Sullivan <osullij1@law.georgetown.edu<mailto:osullij1@law.georgetown.edu>>\nDate: Wednesday, June 3, 2015 at 4:26 PM\nTo: Girardeau Spann <spann@law.georgetown.edu<mailto:spann@law.georgetown.edu>>\nSubject: <no subject>\n\nHello All:\n\nApologies for this mass mailing but someone has hacked my old email address -- os.julie@gmail.com<mailto:os.julie@gmail.com> -- and is sending emails out supposedly from me.  They will look like they are coming from me.  But if you click on the address information, you will see that the "Reply To" goes to a truly awful fraudster at "arnold.hartman74@gmail.com<mailto:arnold.hartman74@gmail.com>."\nPlease, please do not send anything to my os.julie account now or in future, please do not reply to anything you have received and above all else if "I" am purporting to share something with you (he is using shared dropbox among other things) from os.julie@gmail.com<mailto:os.julie@gmail.com>, DO NOT CLICK ON IT.  I have lost many thousands of dollars to this person.  I am working with law enforcement, and they believe this person is both very sophisticated and very malicious.  If (I am so sorry) you have already clicked on something you received from me, please get hold of your IT professional and have them check.  There is some suspicion that this person put something on my computer that permits him to read my key strokes and that is how he got my gmail password (which was not an easy one). It may be that he wants to download something like that on your computer through the shared link. Please take this seriously.\nThis is my new email.  If you have question about the bona fides of this email (who could blame you), you are on my contact list so presumably you know how to reach me to check by phone.\nIf you have already received one of these "os.julie@gmail.com<mailto:os.julie@gmail.com>" emails from me (or received an email in the last month supposedly from me that seems odd), please let me know at this account.  You will know if it is from the fraudster if you check the "reply to" line and see arnold hartman.\nMany, many apologies.  (I am sending this email to 1,700 people so no need to reply with sympathy if you are not inclined)\nThanks\nJulie O\'Sullivan\n'
