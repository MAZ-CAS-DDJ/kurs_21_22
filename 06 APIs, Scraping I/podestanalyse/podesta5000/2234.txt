The core argument remains\nthat you have the experience to get results while Sanders' ideas are a\nrecipe for gridlock, and Americans can't afford to wait.  As much as\npossible, I've drawn from language that you've used either on the stump or\nin speeches like the Wing Ding or in debate prep, especially lines that got\ngood applause in the past.  This also reflects the conversation I had with\nyour husband yesterday and what he said in NH today. Nick also shared a\nlittle of what you said at your event this evening and I will get that\ntranscript shortly.\n\nThis draft is still something of a work in progress and the rest of the\nteam is reviewing as well, but I know time is short and I wanted to get to\nyou as soon as possible.  So will be standing by for your thoughts and also\ncontinuing to edit back here.\nThanks\nDan\n\n*HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON*\n\n*\xe2\x80\x9cWE CAN\xe2\x80\x99T WAIT\xe2\x80\x9d*\n\n*INDIANOLA, IOWA*\n\n*THURSDAY, JANUARY 21, 2015*\n\n\n\n\n   - Hello, Indianola!  I\xe2\x80\x99m so excited to be with you today.  We\xe2\x80\x99re\n   energized, we\xe2\x80\x99re organized, and we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to go win a caucus!  I want\n   to thank [*name*], our terrific organizer here.  She\xe2\x80\x99s doing a great job.\n\n\n\n   - And I want to thank all the precinct captains, union members, and\n   volunteers who are here.  Raise your hand if you\xe2\x80\x99ve made a phone call or\n   knocked on a door for this campaign\xe2\x80\xa6  You are our heart and soul -- and\n   you\xe2\x80\x99re why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to win on February 1st.\n\n   - I am so grateful to all of you who\xe2\x80\x99ve already decided to support me in\n   the caucus.  If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll fill out one of our blue\n   commitment cards.  If you\xe2\x80\x99re still deciding who to support, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad\n   you\xe2\x80\x99re here and I hope I can earn your vote.\n\n\n   - Democrats have an important choice to make.  You have to decide who\n   will make a real difference in your lives and keep our country moving\n   forward.\n\n\n   - Now, I have a lot of respect for Senator Sanders and Governor O\xe2\x80\x99Malley and\n   we certainly share many of the same goals.  Our differences pale compared\n   to what we see on the other side.  You saw this if you watched the\n   debates last week.  One party is becoming defined by paranoia,\n   prejudice, and greed.  The other is focused on creating good-paying jobs\n   and holding Wall Street accountable.  That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m proud to be a\n   Democrat.\n\n\n   - Republicans want Americans to suffer from collective amnesia.  Well,\n   we\xe2\x80\x99re going to remind people of the facts \xe2\x80\x93 that the economy does a whole\n   lot better when there\xe2\x80\x99s a Democrat in the White House.\n\n\n   - But as much as we respect each other and agree on a lot of things,\n   Senator Sanders and I *do* have some important differences.  We\nhave different\n   records and different ideas about how to drive progress.\n\n\n   - For me, it\xe2\x80\x99s all about what\xe2\x80\x99s going to deliver results that actually\n   make life better for families.  That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my whole life,\n   whether it was working with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to create\n   the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Health Insurance Program that now covers 8 million kids, or\n   securing a treaty with Russia that reduces the threat we face from nuclear\n   weapons.  I\xe2\x80\x99m not interested in ideas that sound good on paper but will\n   never make it in the real world \xe2\x80\x93 what I care about is making a difference\n   in your life.\n\n\n   - As I\xe2\x80\x99ve traveled across Iowa, people have shared their hopes and their\n   heartaches.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the problems that keep you up at night and the\n   dreams that get you up in the morning.\n\n\n   - I met a gentleman the other day in Cedar Rapids who told me that his\n   prescription drug costs had tripled. I met a mom at that same event who\n   said that her son has diabetes and even insulin is getting much more\n   expensive \xe2\x80\x93 insulin\xe2\x80\x99s not some fancy new drug, it\xe2\x80\x99s been around forever.\n   The only reason is greed.\n\n\n   - Last month in Waterloo, a worried husband named Larry told me his wife\n   Brenda spends hundreds of dollars each month on medicine for arthritis and\n   osteoporosis.  When they see hedge fund tycoons buying drug companies\n   and raising prices by 4000 percent overnight, they just want to scream.\n\n\n   - Something is wrong when your paycheck has barely grown in years, but\n   corporate profits and CEO pay are at near-record highs.  Something is\n   wrong when you can do everything right, but still not get ahead.  Like\n   Brandi from Des Moines, who was laid off six years ago.  She went back\n   to school, worked hard, got her degree.  Now she\xe2\x80\x99s a supervisor in a\n   restaurant, but still only makes $9.50 an hour.  That\xe2\x80\x99s not enough,\n   especially with kids.\n\n\n   - Brandi needs a raise.  Larry and Brenda need lower drug prices.  People\n   across Iowa need more good jobs, help with their student debt, a more\n   secure retirement.  These are the problems I\xe2\x80\x99m focused on.  I get up\n   every day thinking about how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make a difference for people\n   and families who really need it.\n\n\n   - I have nothing but admiration for Senator Sanders, but he does see the\n   world a little differently.\n\n\n   - Take health care, for example.  I want us to defend and build on the\n   progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made under President Obama, especially the Affordable Care\n   Act.\n\n\n   - Remember what it was like before Obamacare?  The insurance companies\n   were in charge and free to discriminate against people with pre-existing\n   conditions.  They charged women more for the same coverage.  And 44\n   million Americans didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any coverage at all.\n\n\n   - I don\xe2\x80\x99t think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for taking\n   on this fight and getting the job done.  Today, more than 18 million\n   Americans have been covered and the uninsured rate has dropped below 10\n   percent.  I want to build on that progress.  Keep expanding coverage to\n   more people.  Lower your out-of-pocket costs with a new tax credit.  Cap\n   what you have to pay each month for prescription drugs.  Finally let\n   Medicare negotiate better prices.\n\n\n   - We can get this done without another divisive debate on our entire\n   health care system or giving Republicans an opening to come in and tear\n   down everything we\xe2\x80\x99ve achieved.  We can make real progress right now for\n   people and families who need it.\n\n\n   - Senator Sanders has a different idea.  He wants to start over with a\n   whole new system.  And in theory, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to like about that.  But\n   \xe2\x80\x9cin theory\xe2\x80\x9d isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough. A President has to deliver *in reality*.\n\n\n   - Senator Sanders has been in Congress for 25 years and he\xe2\x80\x99s introduced\n   his health care plan again and again.  But he never got even a single\n   vote in the House or a single Senate co-sponsor.  Not one.\n\n\n   - I believe we can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for a whole new system to be built before we\n   start solving the problems families are facing every day.\n\n\n   - The people I\xe2\x80\x99ve met in Iowa can\xe2\x80\x99t wait. The grandmother who has to\n   choose between paying for medicine and paying the rent can\xe2\x80\x99t wait.  The\n   single mom who desperately needs a raise can\xe2\x80\x99t wait.  The student with a\n   mountain of debt can\xe2\x80\x99t wait.  You can\xe2\x80\x99t wait and neither can our country.\n   We need to roll up our sleeves and start making progress right now.\n\n\n   - My opponent\xe2\x80\x99s ideas are a recipe for gridlock in Washington, not\n   action.  That won\xe2\x80\x99t help anyone.  Except maybe the Republicans who are\n   looking for any opportunity to take us backwards.  We just can\xe2\x80\x99t take\n   that risk.\n\n\n   - We have to defend the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made under President Obama and go\n   even further.  My economic plan will raise incomes and create\n   good-paying jobs right away.\n\n\n   - I\xe2\x80\x99ll fight for more *fairness* in our economy.   Let\xe2\x80\x99s make those at\n   the top pay their fair share.  Because multi-millionaires and companies\n   that ship jobs overseas shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get tax breaks \xe2\x80\x93 *you* should.\n\n\n   - Let\xe2\x80\x99s stop the abuse on Wall Street and make sure that if you break\n   the law, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter who you are, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to jail.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s\n   enforce our trade rules and stop letting countries like China take\n   advantage of American workers and businesses.\n\n\n   - Let\xe2\x80\x99s raise the minimum wage, expand Social Security for those who\n   need it most, and finally guarantee equal pay for women.  Because in\n   America, if you work hard, you deserve to see the rewards.\n\n\n   - And we can\xe2\x80\x99t stop there.  More fairness is essential, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not\n   enough.  We also need more *growth* in our economy.\n\n\n   - We have to invest in advanced manufacturing so we\xe2\x80\x99re making and\n   building things *here*, not somewhere else.  Make it easier to start and\n   grow small businesses.  Create the clean energy jobs of the\n   future\xe2\x80\x94because it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be China or Germany or us, and I want it to be\n   us.  Iowa already gets a third of its energy from renewables, mostly\n   wind.  If you can do it, so can America.\n\n\n   - We can do this.  We can make our economy stronger and our country\n   fairer.  But we have to do it together.\n\n\n   - The truth is, too many people today feel left out and left behind.  That\xe2\x80\x99s\n   not the America we want to be.\n\n\n   - Instead of demonizing hard-working immigrant families, we should be\n   giving them a real path to citizenship.  Instead of a school-to-prison\n   pipeline that keeps communities of color down, we need a cradle-to-college\n   pipeline that lifts people up.\n\n\n   - We have to end discrimination against LGBT Americans wherever it\n   exists.  And I\xe2\x80\x99ll always defend Planned Parenthood.  Republicans may say\n   I\xe2\x80\x99m playing the gender card.  Well, if fighting for women\xe2\x80\x99s health and\n   women\xe2\x80\x99s rights is playing the gender card \xe2\x80\x93 then *deal me in*.\n\n\n   - We also can\xe2\x80\x99t turn our backs on working-class families in struggling\n   rural communities and crumbling Appalachian towns\xe2\x80\xa6 in Coal Country and Farm\n   Country\xe2\x80\xa6 families who for generations worked their fingers to the bone\n   keeping our lights on and our factories running and our crops growing.\n\n\n   - So many are hurting right now.  In a lot of places, people are dying\n   younger than their parents.  The substance abuse I hear about everywhere\n   I go in Iowa and across our country is a big part of it.  But you know\n   what my husband said to me the other day?  He said folks feel the\n   American Dream slipping away -- and *they\xe2\x80\x99re dying of a broken heart*.\n\n\n   - I think Bill\xe2\x80\x99s right.  I hear it in the voices of parents who don\xe2\x80\x99t\n   know how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to give their kids the opportunities they deserve.\n   I see it in the eyes of people who don\xe2\x80\x99t expect anything to come easy\n   but wonder why it has to be quite so hard.\n\n\n   - We\xe2\x80\x99re going to give the American Dream back to them. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to\n   make this economy work for everyone \xe2\x80\x93 the struggling, the striving, and the\n   successful.  That will be my mission as President, from the first day to\n   the last.\n\n\n   - But you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re not just picking a President, we\xe2\x80\x99re also choosing\n   a Commander-in-Chief.  I\xe2\x80\x99m the only candidate on either side with the\n   experience and judgment to keep us safe at home and strong in the world.\n\n\n   - Now, the Republican candidates keep asking about my accomplishments.  So\n   I sent them all a copy of my book, \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices.\xe2\x80\x9d  I figured there were\n   so many of them, they could start a book club.\n\n\n   - They could read about how I got Russia and China to agree to tough new\n   sanctions on Iran.  Or how I brokered a cease-fire between Hamas and\n   Israel that stopped terrorist rockets from falling on Israeli homes.  Maybe\n   they\xe2\x80\x99d be interested in how you push for a global agreement on climate\n   change\xe2\x80\xa6 oh who are we kidding, they don\xe2\x80\x99t care about that at all!\n\n\n   - Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s all in the book.  But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a single thank you note.\n    And based on what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying on the campaign trail, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem\n   like they learned very much.\n\n\n   - Shallow slogans don\xe2\x80\x99t add up to a strategy.  Promising to carpet bomb\n   until the desert glows doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make you sound strong \xe2\x80\x93 it makes you sound\n   like you\xe2\x80\x99re in over your head.  Bluster and bigotry are not credentials\n   for becoming Commander-in-Chief.  And it would be a huge mistake to send\n   U.S. combat troops into another costly ground war in the Middle East.\n\n\n   - Now, Senator Sanders doesn\xe2\x80\x99t talk very much about foreign policy.  But\n   when he does, it raises concerns, because sometimes it sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s\n   hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really thought it through.  For example, he suggested we invite\n   Iranian troops into Syria.  That\xe2\x80\x99s just a bad idea.  It\xe2\x80\x99s like asking\n   the arsonist to be the firefighter.  As terrible as things are in Syria,\n   more Iranian troops are only going to make things worse.\n\n\n   - The world a President has to grapple with is beyond complicated.  That\xe2\x80\x99s\n   why this is the hardest job in the world.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it up close and\n   personal.  And I know what it takes.\n\n\n   - I know how to find common ground and how to stand my ground.  I teamed\n   up with Republicans like Tom Delay to improve our foster care system.  I\n   worked with Lindsey Graham to extend health benefits for our National Guard\n   and Reserves.  We had deep disagreements.  But we found a sliver of common\n   ground.  And that made life better for a whole lot of people.\n\n\n   - I\xe2\x80\x99ll also stand my ground so *you* can gain ground.  That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m\n   taking on the gun lobby in this campaign.  We\xe2\x80\x99re losing an average of 90\n   Americans every day to gun violence.  It\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, it has to stop, and I\n   won\xe2\x80\x99t back down no matter what they throw at me.\n\n\n   - But I can\xe2\x80\x99t do any of this alone.  On February 1st, it\xe2\x80\x99s up to *you.*  You\n   have to decide who you trust to make a real difference in your lives.\n\n\n   - I know how to get things done.  How to build on the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve\n   made.  My opponent\xe2\x80\x99s ideas are a recipe for gridlock, not action.  The\n   American people can\xe2\x80\x99t afford that.  You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait for\n   results.  You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait for lower drug prices.  You\n   shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait for higher wages or help with college loans.  You\n   shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait to start that small business or to enjoy a secure\n   retirement.\n\n\n   - *You* brought our country back from the worst economic crisis in our\n   lifetimes.  Now it\xe2\x80\x99s *your* time to get ahead.  And, you know what?  America\n   succeeds when you succeed.\n\n\n   - It comes down to this: *I need you.*  I need you knocking on doors and\n   making phone calls. I need you caucusing on February 1st.  And I need\n   you standing with me every day as President, working to build that better\n   America.\n\n\n   - So please join me.  You can text JOIN to 4-7-2-4-6 right now.  And\n   then visit hillaryclinton.com.  Talk to your friends and family.  Talk\n   to your neighbors.  Make sure they\xe2\x80\x99re all going to caucus on February\n   1st.\n\n\n   - The pundits might be surprised that this race is close, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not.  I\n   never doubted that I\xe2\x80\x99d have to work for every vote.  I never doubted\n   that I\xe2\x80\x99d face tough attacks.\n\n\n   - I don\xe2\x80\x99t care how hard Karl Rove or the Koch Brothers hit us.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve\n   spent my life working for children, families, and our country\xe2\x80\xa6 from the\n   kitchen table to the peace table\xe2\x80\xa6 working to even the odds for people who\n   have the odds stacked against them.  And I\xe2\x80\x99m just getting warmed up.\n\n\n   - So, I want to thank you and all the people of Iowa.  You\xe2\x80\x99ve taught me\n   so much.  You\xe2\x80\x99ve made me a better candidate.  And I believe thanks to\n   you I will be a better President.\n\n\n   - Iowa, I\xe2\x80\x99m listening to you, I\xe2\x80\x99m fighting for you, and, with your help,\n   as President I\xe2\x80\x99m going to deliver.\n\n###\n"
