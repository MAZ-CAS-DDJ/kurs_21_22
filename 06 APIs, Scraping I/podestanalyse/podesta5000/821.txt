john.podesta@gmail.comb'All, can we please impose on you to take the next 24 hours to go through the three narratives and flag language and ideas that you think could be useful for a next draft.  Would be great to have that by Thursday afternoon.  Then we will compile and recirculate.\nThanks very much.\nDan\n\n\n* Please note my new email address: dschwerin@HRCoffice.com.\n'
