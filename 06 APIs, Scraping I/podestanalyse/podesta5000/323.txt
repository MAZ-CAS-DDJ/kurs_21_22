Barack Obama has\nmaintained a lead and yet . . . his poll numbers still remain in the forties\n. . . why do you think Barack Obama is not doing better? . . .\n\nRUDY GIULIANI: I think he\'s not doing better because I think there\'s a major\nquestion about him that the American people are going to have to answer. And\nthat is his experience . . . probably the least experience in the last 100\nyears . . . we need a person there who has been tested before and we know\ncan handle these things and gives real answers to things . . . John is quite\nspecific about what he\'ll do and we know it from his record.\n\n[ . . . ]\n\nGREGORY: When Sen. McCain talks about the energy crisis in this country,\nthis has been a crisis that Republicans have failed, effectively, to find an\nanswer to in all the time that George Bush has been president.\n\nGIULIANI: This isn\'t about Republicans or Democrats, it\'s about who\'s going\nto be President of the United States. John McCain has been in favor . . . of\ncap and trade . . . before Barack Obama was even in the state legislature.\nSo John has a long history here of supporting the things that he\'s talking\nabout now . . . it\'s the difference between a man who has taken positions, I\nthink usually correct but sometimes even wrong . . . and a person who\ndoesn\'t seem to be able to do it . . .\n\nGREGORY: . . .what is the particular risk of Obama as President . . .?\n\nGIULIANI: . . . this country would be a country that\'s at drift . . . a big\nincrease on taxes . . . a tax on the rich is a tax on the economy . . .\n\n[ . . . ]\n\nGREGORY: Let\'s talk about taxes and let\'s talk about the fact that Sen.\nMcCain is offering himself to the country . . . as the "original maverick,"\nhe\'s the guy that stands up to power, he would stand up to George Bush. But\nyou raised the issue of tax cuts just a minute ago. As recently as 2004,\nJohn McCain had a very different position, and this is what he said on *Meet\nthe Press* . . .\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: I voted against the tax cuts because of the disproportionate\namount that went to the wealthiest Americans. I would, uh, clearly support\nnot extending those tax cuts in order to help address the deficit.\n\nGREGORY: . . . critics would say the maverick who is John McCain back in\n2000, maybe even 2004, that\'s not the John McCain of today. He\'s switched\nhis position n tax increases and tax cuts.\n\nGIULIANI: John is still in a different place on cap and trade than the\nRepublican Party. He was in a different place on Iraq, he was criticizing\nthe administrations policy in Iraq, two, three and four years ago. Turns out\nhe was absolutely right with the surge policy that the President adopted. I\nthink on this tax issue that John realizes that this is not the time to be\nraising taxes, when the economy is in the situation that it\'s in. And then\ncompetitively it\'s not the time to do it, when just about all of Europe has\na lower corporate tax rates than we do and we\'re competing for business . .\n.\n\nGREGORY: But John McCain as recently as 2004 opposed the Bush tax cut. He\nchanged that position. He talked about servicing the deficit. The deficit\nhas ballooned since then. He is now in sync with George Bush on the position\nof tax cuts and he\'s using that as a hammer against Obama, when he\'s where\nObama was effectively four years ago.\n\nGIULIANI: I think that given the realities of our economy, John McCain is\ncorrect in saying that we shouldn\'t be raising taxes right now. But when you\nlook at John McCain\'s overall record including his whole position on energy,\nclimate change, John McCain has always taken the position that he thought\nwas right, even when he thought it put him at odds with the administration.\n\nGREGORY: But whether it\'s the war, whether its taxes, is he too close to\nGeorge Bush to earn the maverick label today, as he did in 2000?\n\nGIULIANI: If you ask Republicans, I think that was one of the major concerns\nwith John, that he was too independent. I don\' think you can use it against\nhim. I mean, the fact that John has been an independent person, making his\nown decisions about things, where he agrees with President Bush, he\'s there\n100% but where he disagrees, as he did on the war, he was a major critic\nuntil they actually changed positions and we went with the surge.\n\nGREGORY: Well, let\'s talk about that. Obviously Sen. McCain did express\nconcerns about the implementation of the war; he backed the war. Is it a\nmistake politically for him to spend so much time debating the wisdom or the\nsuccess of the surge when so many Americans are still asking questions about\nwhy we went to war in Iraq in the first place. That\'s the decision that\nremains unpopular.\n\nGIULIANI: I think what it displays about John McCain, whether you agree with\nhim or not on the war or on the surge, and I do . . . I think it displays\nthe fact that he can take a position. I think Sen. Obama has much more\ntrouble doing that . . . the issue right now is the economy and it\'s energy.\nBut I think you see that same difference. John McCain is willing to say,\n"These are my positions on energy." . . .\n\nGREGORY: Let me ask you about VP candidates. Romney has been mentioned . . .\nis that a good choice for McCain?\n\nGIULIANI: I think John has to make his own choice . . .\n\nGREGORY: . . . in some of the advertisements, Sen. McCain has been relying\non images of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton . . . Paris Hilton has come out\nwith a response of her own . . .\n\n[Paris response ad plays]\n\nGREGORY: Was it a smart idea for McCain to pick a fight with Paris Hilton?\n\nGIULIANI: [laughs] I think she was kind of diplomatic about\x97if anything, I\nthink she\'s supporting John McCain . . .\n\n*Giuliani Talks Iraq Oil Revenues and Touts McCain\'s Energy Plans* (CNN\n08/06/08 4:34pm)\nWOLF BLITZER: [\x85] Shocking general accounting office report that just came\nout, how much money the Iraqis are taking in, thanks to the large -- the\nhigh price of oil. [\x85] and the GAO says that money is in the bank. They\'re\nspending a tiny, tiny bit of it. The United States is still spending about\n$12 billion a month. Here\'s the question, are American taxpayers right now\nbeing played for suckers?\n\nRUDY GUILIANI: Well, I think the reality is that that\'s an opportunity. An\nopportunity for us to work with Iraq to get them to use that money, or more\nof that money for their own infrastructure, to kind of push them in that\ndirection. It\'s kind of silly, though, for Barack Obama to suggest that\'s\nthe cause of our energy crisis. [\x85]\n\nBLITZER: There\'s a lot of oil and they could make that oil available to the\nUnited States at a discount price.\n\nGIULIANI: That would be very nice and that would help. It would also if\nBarack Obama would support offshore drilling, it would help if he would\nsupport nuclear power. It would help if he had a really comprehensive\nprogram instead of saying no to basically everything. It\'s kind of like\ndeflecting.\n\nBLITZER: But you\'re a politician. People hear, the Iraqi\'s have $80 billion,\nsimply lying around. They\'re making a windfall on all this oil they\'re\nexporting. The United States is still footing the bill basically for\neverything they need.\n\nGIULIANI: A great opportunity for us to lean on them more to foot more of\nthe bill.\n\n[\x85]\n\nBLIZTER: Should they start paying the United States back, the $700 billion\ndollars the United States taxpayers have spent since the war started?\n\nGIULIANI: Personally? I think the better way to handle this is for them to\ntake over a much larger percentage of the expenses that are taking place\nright now. I think that would be a very sensible thing to do. There\'s a good\nopportunity for rearrangement of that. It doesn\'t make sense, though [\x85]\n\nBLITZER: The Sons of Iraq, the Sunni former insurgents, about 90,000 of\nthem, they\'re now on the U.S. government payroll. We\'re paying them every\nmonth, according to general Petraeus, about $200 million a year. The United\nStates is paying them to be quiet, to be supportive. Why aren\'t the Iraqi\'s\npaying them?\n\nGIULIANI: Maybe they should. Maybe this is a good opportunity to move that\nover to their side of the ledger and have them pick up more of the expenses.\nIn a way, it shows things are working in Iraq. Let\'s take advantage of that.\nBut the point that I\'m making it, it really is an example of demagoguery to\ntry to make that cause of our issue with credit.\n\nBLITZER: Well, he\'s not trying to make it the cause, but he\'s saying it\'s\none issue that could certainly help the U.S. if the Iraqi\'s made that oil\navailable, either for free or at a discount?\n\nGIULIANI: It kind of gets them off the hook for the bigger issues, where\nhe\'s basically been obstructionist, offshore drilling and nuclear power.\n\nBLITZER: Should Senator McCain, he spoke out about this GAO report today,\nshould Senator McCain be speaking out and telling the Iraqi\'s, you know\nwhat, this is simply unacceptable.\n\nGUILIANI: I think it\'s something that should become part of the dealings\nbetween US and Iraq. I think Iraq should take over more of the\nresponsibility for this. But as I said before, I think it\'s really insulting\nthe intelligence of the American people to kind of make it part of our\nenergy crisis when there are far bigger issues involved.\n\n[\x85] Sure. The guy who voted for the big subsidies for the oil companies was\nBarack Obama. John McCain voted against it when they had a chance to vote.\nThis is, again, part of the sort of faint strategy, this sort of push things\noff.\n\nBLITZER: You\'re referring to the 2006 legislation which President Bush\npushed for, McCain opposed, Obama supported it because it did have what he\ncalled environmentally sound proposals.\n\nGIULIANI: But john McCain was in favor of environmental approach to oil and\ngas before Barack Obama, I think in the state legislature, going back to the\n1990s. This is an issue which I think john McCain is winning the battle.\nHe\'s winning it on energy in general which is why I think Barack Obama is\ndoing this kind of demagoguery.\n\nBLITZER: I guess one of the biggest criticisms Obama\'s making of McCain is\nthe system is broken right now. *There\'s been no serious effort over the\npast 30 years to find -- to make America energy independent, to wean the\naddiction from middle east oil off. He said of the past 30 years, McCain has\nbeen in Washington for 26. And he says McCain has done nothing to ease this\nproblem on the United States.*\n\nGIULIANI: Well, actually, he\'s the one that\'s opposing the things that would\nin fact give us some degree of energy diversity, energy independence. It\'s\ntrue, for the last 30 years we haven\'t licensed a nuclear power plant.\nFrance is 80% nuclear. China is building 40 new nuclear power plants. McCain\nproposes to build 45 nuclear plants, Obama is still thinking about it. He\'s\nthe one who actually wants to take us back to the past. McCain has talked\nabout opening up offshore drilling. Obama opposes that, he\'s the one who\nwould keep us exactly where we are now. *And John has shown the independence\nto disagree with the President when he disagrees and agrees with him when he\ndoes. So I think, actually on this issue, this is the reason why the polls\nare so close and McCain is gaining. I think john McCain is outlining an\nenergy policy that would break us from the past, and I think Obama is\ntalking about the same old thing, basically Dr. No.*\n\nBLITZER: I\'ll ask you the same question I asked Mitt Romney yesterday. Is\nthere anything in the 26 years he\'s been in Washington that you can point to\nsenator McCain that has taken the lead in trying to achieve energy\nindependence?\n\nGIULIANI: Sure. He may be certainly the first republican, one of the first\nsenators to be in favor of cap on trade. Going back to the 1990 s. along\nwith senator Lieberman, he helped craft the legislation that\'s been proposed\nseveral times. John has taken the lead in energy over and over again. Again,\nbefore Barack Obama I think was in the state legislature.\n\nBLITZER: At least you had an answer for that. When I asked Mitt Romney\nyesterday, he said he\'s not a historian. [\x85]\n\n*Fiorina Attacks Obama on 2005 Energy Bill, Outlines McCain\'s Plan *(MSNBC\n08/06/08 1:03pm)\nANDREA MITCHELL: John McCain is going nuclear on the war between his energy\npolicy and Barack Obama\'s by slamming Obama\'s position on nuclear energy.\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: Barack Obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants,\nquote, "doesn\'t make sense for America," unquote. He also says no to nuclear\nstorage and no to reprocessing. I could not disagree more. Nuclear power\nisn\'t enough and drilling isn\'t enough. And we need to do all this and more.\nIt\'s time that the congress went back to Washington and went about the\npeople\'s business.\n\n[ . . . ]\n\nMITCHELL: . . . let\'s talk about Sen. McCain and his energy plan and what he\nsaid. This is what Barack Obama . . . said about McCain\'s energy plan . . .\n\nBARACK OBAMA: Sen. McCain\'s energy plan reads like another Christmas list\nfor oil and gas lobbyists. It\'s no wonder because many of his top advisors\nare former oil and gas lobbyists. The price he paid for his party\'s\nnomination has been to reverse himself on position after position. And now\nhe embraces the failed Bush policies of the last eight years. The politics\nthat helped break. That doesn\'t meet my definition of a maverick.\n\nMITCHELL: John McCain has been describing himself as a maverick in his\nlatest ads. Perhaps that quotation, that part of the speech today . . . has\ncaused you to convert and jump ship?\n\nCARLY FIORINA: No. I find that whole segment you just played kind of\nunbelievable. First of all, it was Barack Obama who voted for the 2005\nBush/Cheney Energy Bill which was packed with giveaways to big oil companies\nover two and a half billion dollars with. John McCain voted against\x97\n\nMITCHELL: A lot of folks say that isn\'t the case when you fact check that\nbill. The bill had a lot for, for, uh, alternative energy but not that much\nfor oil and gas.\n\nFIORINA: Yes, but it absolutely had some things for alternative energy but\nit also had over $2.5 billion worth of giveaways for big oil. Barack Obama\nvoted for that bill. John McCain voted against it. John McCain\'s record as a\nmaverick is long and clear. He has stood up against his party on many\noccasions. Not just the Bush and Cheney energy bill. Uh, let\'s see,\nimmigration reform, campaign finance reform, he stood up against Bush-Cheney\non the prosecution of the Iraq War. The list goes on and on. And by the way,\nit was John McCain who first called or stopping the fill of the strategic\npetroleum reserve. Barack Obama was against it then. It was John McCain who\ncalled for a gas tax holiday to give Ameicans relief. Barack Obama was\nagainst it then, continues to be against it\x97\n\nMITCHELL: A lot of folks say that was a gimmick Carly.\n\nFIORINA: You know, it\'s interesting to me that everyone is decrying the\nprice that Americans are paying at the pump. Barack Obama has even suggested\nthat we need a second stimulus package because the first one was eaten up by\nprices at the pump. And yet, the way to give Americans direct relief at the\npump is to give them a gas tax relief. Barack Obama\'s against it. He\'s\nagainst nuclear energy. John McCain is absolutely right. He\'s against\noffshore drilling. The reality is\x97\n\nMITCHELL: Well, actually, Barack Obama has a much more . . . you might\ncalled it nuanced position on nuclear energy. He has been a big supporter of\nnuclear energy back in Illinois. Exelon, as you know, is headquartered in\nIllinois. Some people have criticized him as being too in much in favor of\nnuclear energy. It\'s not that clear cut . . .\n\nFIORINA: I guess I don\'t really\x97it\'s interesting then that he would attack\nJohn McCain for supporting nuclear energy. I frankly don\'t know what a\nnuanced approach to energy is. I think what John McCain is saying, in very\nclear cut fashion, is we need to do all of the above. If we are going to\nfree ourselves from our dependence on foreign oil, we must invest in\nalternative energy sources. We must invest in green technologies.\nAbsolutely. We must also invest in nuclear power. We must also invest in\ndrilling. We must invest in clean coal, we must invest in natural gas. We\nhave to do all of the above in order to achieve energy independence.\n\n*Fiorina Defends McCain on Energy, Senate Record and Against Dowd *(MSNBC\n08/06/08)\nMITCHELL: You mentioned the 2005 bill. The 2005 bill had more than $18\nbillion dollars in incentives to the nuclear power industry. John McCain has\ntalked about 45 new nuclear plants by 2030. The 2005 bill gave all these\nincentives to the nuclear power industry. And although the price of oil has\ngone up and up and up, nuclear power ought to be more competitive but there\nare so many insurance and liscencing problems. Not a single plant has been\nstarted or given a green light despite what was put in that bill three years\nago . . . isn\'t it going to take a lot longer than John McCain is suggesting\nto get anywhere near 45 new nuclear plants in this country?\n\nFIORINA: Well, I think it will start with a decision and leadership and the\nwill in Washington to say we must achieve energy independence and nuclear\npower is part of the solution and right now, we don\'t have that. A President\nJohn McCain would give us that. 45 nuclear power plants is not only\ncritically important to helping us achieve energy independence but it\'s\nworth about 700,000 jobs. In other words, John McCain\'s energy plan is not\njust about weaning ourselves from foreign oil. It\'s also an important part\nof getting this economy going again and making sure that we\'re creating\njobs. And frankly, that\'s why I find it so, um, odd that Barack Obama is\nclaiming that he has an energy plan, when, in essence what he\'s done is been\nagainst virtually everything. Against offshore drilling, against nuclear\npower. Yes, alternative energies and green technologies are an important\npart of the solution but for him to suggest\x97\n\nMITCHELL: He has certainly moderated his position on offshore drilling, as\nhad John McCain earlier. Let me show you what one of the potential running\nmates had to say, just last night on CNN . . . when Wolf asked Mitt Romney\nwhat proposals, what legislative accomplishments McCain has produced . . .\n\nWOLF BLITZER: Can you cite one legislative accomplishment that Sen. McCain\nproduced during those 26 years in Washington in order to achieve energy\nindependence?\n\nMITT ROMNEY: Well, I\'m not a historian that goes through all of the pieces\nof legislation that John McCain has worked on.\n\nMITCHELL: Carly, don\'t you think that Romney could have had a better\nresponse as a surrogate for John McCain than that he\'s not a historian? It\'s\nsort of reminds people of that old clip of Dwight Eisenhower when asked what\nRichard Nixon had accomplished when he was his running mate.\n\nFIORINA:  You know I found the question frankly a little odd because I think\nthe point of the energy debate going on right now with the American people\nis what must we do now given where we are.  The reason\x97\n\nMITCHELL:  Isn\'t John McCain\'s record in 26 years in the senate also one of\nthe issues people will be using to decide whether or not to support him?\n\nFIORINA:  Absolutely.  And I think John McCain\'s record of 26 years is an\nincredibly rich one; not only of legislative accomplishment, but also of\nreaching his hand across the aisle and achieving those accomplishments in a\nbipartisan way.  And I cited just a few minutes ago many examples of that,\nwhether it was immigration reform or whether it was taking on Jack Abramoff\nand making sure the corruption that was going on in his own Republican party\nwas uncovered and punished. I think if the suggestion is that somehow let\'s\nput John McCain\'s legislative record up against Barak Obama\'s that is a\ncomparison that we would welcome in the McCain campaign.\n\nMITCHELL:  Now John McCain has got the new ad which talks about him as a\nmaverick; the ad that came out yesterday I guess Maureen Dowd in today\'s New\nYork Times says that this is not the John McCain that people remember; she\nspeaks of McCain\'s green-eyed monster quote, "John McCain is pea-green with\nenvy" and she says that\'s the only explanation for why a man that prides\nhimself on honor; a man that vowed not to take the low road in the campaign,\nhaving been mugged by W. and Rove and South Carolina in 2000 is engaging in\na festival of juvenilia; talking, of course, about Paris Hilton and other\nads.  What\'s your response to a lot of the criticism of John McCain;\nsomebody is saying you know, John we hardly knew ya. You\'re not the John\nMcCain of 2000 and you\'ve been rough and tough in this campaign season.\n\nFIORINA: First of all, Maureen Dowd, of course, always has a way with words;\nuh, secondly I think that comparing the Paris Hilton ad to some of what went\non around John McCain and his family in South Carolina in the year 2000, is\nfrankly ridiculous.  Third, I think the ads that John McCain has put out\nhave been humorous, they have been honorable, there is no question that\nBarack Obama is a celebrity, and there is also no question that is\nlegitimate to ask whether he is ready to lead, so I think we\'re proud of the\ncampaign we\'re running and I would just point out that John McCain didn\'t\nmake it through the primaries in 2000, and today, as we speak, this race is\nrunning neck and neck.  So something that John McCain is doing is working a\nresonating with the American people who ultimately, with all respect to\nMaureen Dowd, are going to be the ones that decide this election.\n\n*Rep. Eric Cantor Stumps For McCain\'s Energy Plans* (FNC 08/06/08 5:28pm)\nREP ERIC CANTOR: [\x85] If the question is about Barack Obama\'s attacks on John\nMcCain and whether, somehow his plan was based on suggestions from energy\nlobbyists, I think again, that shows a lack of understanding of what the\nAmerican people are going through. I mean, right now there is a lot of hurt\nout there. Gasoline prices are way too high, families are buckling up under\nthe pressure of paying 60, 70, 80 dollars every time they come into a gas\nstation. John McCain has got in place a plan called the Lexington project,\nwhich is a comprehensive plan to relieve the pain at the pump, and to get us\non the path towards energy independence which will eliminate our reliance on\nforeign oil, especially from regimes that are hostile to us.\n\n*Pfotenhauer Attacks Obama\'s Energy Plan *(MSNBC 08/06/08 11:13am)\nCONTESSA BREWER: John McCain dismisses Barack Obama as just a celebrity,\nlike Paris Hilton. Oh, and Paris Hilton doesn\'t like that . . .\n\n[Paris response ad plays]\n\nBREWER: John McCain says he thinks the ad was HA-larious, but is any of this\nback and forth helping America, for instance, solve the energy crisis? . . .\nwhat did you think of Paris Hilton\'s spoof ad?\n\nNANCY PFOTENHAUER: Well, I thought it was pretty funny. You know, it\'s\ninteresting to note that she must be part of the 70% of American people who\nsupport John McCain\'s all of the above approach to solving the energy crisis\nthat we\'re facing and obviously the contrast here is that Sen. Obama, well\nboth candidates support alternative energy, hydro, wind, electric,\nalternative fuels and are really very supportive of those aspects of a long\nterm plan but only Sen. McCain has the foresight to support increased\ndomestic production in oil and natural gas and nuclear power.\n\nBREWER: Nancy, you just said that both candidates believe in exploring these\nalternative energies. So, why is the McCain campaign trying so hard to make\nObama\'s full energy plan about inflating the tires properly?\n\nPFOTENHAUER: This is the aspect of, what\'d we do right now? How do we solve\nour problem in the short to mid-term, not just the long term? These\nalternative sources we believe all need to be part of the solution, if you\nwill. But in the short term, it\'s just plain irresponsible to not support\nincreased domestic production in oil, natural gas and to take the steps to\nsupport nuclear power. That\'s a zero emission clean source of energy. Even\nPatrick Moore, the cofounder of Greenpeace supports it. That\'s the kind of\nthing that needs to be done. So there\'s a big chunk missing from Sen.\nObama\'s approach and I think it shows very poor judgment on his part.\n\nBREWER: Op-ed columnist, Maureen Dowd wrote in *The New York Times* today,\n"The Arizona senator who built his reputation on being a brave proponent of\nbig solutions is running a schoolyard campaign about tire gauges and Paris\nHilton, childishly accusing his opponent of being too serious, too popular\nand not patriotic enough." Is there a danger here in trying to entertain\nvoters and belittling what people think is a really important campaign about\nreally important issues?\n\nPFOTENHAUER: You can chalk this up as one more time I disagree with Ms.\nDowd. Which wou\x97I don\'t think I\'ve ever agreed with her so that\'s not too\nremarkable. But the American people hear John McCain every day talk about\nreal solutions to the challenges that we\'re facing. And you can talk about\nthe energy aspect of what we\'re facing and he\'s got the all of the above\napproach that the American people support and that\'s warranted by the\nchallenges that we face. Or we can talk about the economy overall where\nyou\'ve got Sen. McCain talking about keeping taxes low and keeping federal\nspending low and pursuing free trade and you\'ve got Sen. Obama raising taxes\nin a weak economy, massive increases in federal spending  and really, the\nmost pretentious candidate, major candidate for president that I\'ve\nwitnessed in a long time.\n\n\nHighlight #2\n*McCain\'s New Strategy Emphasizes Style over Substance *(MSNBC 08/06/08\n6:31pm)\nKATIE COURIC: 90 days now \'til America elects a new president and Democrat\nBarack Obama is holding on to a small lead over Republican John McCain . . .\n\nDEAN REYNOLDS: With John McCain increasingly on offense and Barack Obama\nmore and more on defense, the two candidates appear to be fighting each\nother to a standstill in their attempts to brand the other guy as the wrong\nchoice.

The man who rides the Straight\nTalk Express took no questions from reporters. Some Republicans wonder about\nthe new approach. McCain\'s own mother said that using Paris Hilton in this\ncontroversial ad to insult Obama was, quote, "kind of stupid."\n\n["Celeb" plays]\n\nREYNOLDS: And now it appears mother knows best.\n\n[Paris response ad plays]\n\n[ . . . ]\n\nREYNOLDS: Well, the McCain campaign said, and I think this was tongue in\ncheek, that the Paris Hilton idea of taking suggestions from both candidates\nproves that her energy plan is better than Barack Obama\'s . . .\n\nCOURIC: It keeps getting weirder and weirder . . .\n\n\nHighlight #3\n*The Battle Over Who\'s The Maverick, McCain\'s Status Scrutinized *(CNN\n08/06/08 7:44pm)\nKITTY PILGRIM: The sort of Maverick, everyone looking to take credit for the\nmaverick credential, it\'s because Americans are presumably are so\ndissatisfied with policy.\n\nKEITH RICHBURG: I think the Republican brand, this year, is toxic for a lot\nof people. So McCain has to get back to what he lost last week when he got\nmired in the Britney Spears/Paris Hilton ad. *He\'s got to get back to\nsaying, I\'m not partisan, I\'m a solutions guy, I can reach across the aisle.\nHe lost that a little bit, I think, and he\'s trying to reclaim that.*\n\nPILGRIM: It\'s been kind of bitter back and forth all week.\n\nMICHAEL GOODWIN: But I think for Obama [\x85] it does reflect something that\nmost of the discussions in the last week or so have been on McCain\'s turf.\nThey\'ve been about energy where,  the drilling issue, where McCain  clearly\nhas an advantage. They\'ve been about Iraq. *So I think Obama\'s looking to\nget back into his comfortable turf which is, this is George Bush\'s third\nterm [\x85] trying to link him to Bush again.*\n\nED ROLLINS: There are two big issue which McCain was out of sync with his\nown party. One was the tax issue, one of two republicans to vote against\nBush\'s tax cuts which is heresy in the Republican party. And the\nimmigration, where he basically formed his alliance with Kennedy. But\neverything else, I think he\'s been, he\'s got an 85 percent conservative\nvoting record over his long career. But those are two big fundamental issues\nto which have switched on.\n\nPILGRIM: But Ed, the voting record, many people won\'t bother to examine.\nThey\'ll just sort of take these.\n\nROLLINS: Well, he\'s enjoyed the impression of being, I\'m not beholden to\nanybody, I stand up here, I\'m independent. And that\'s an interesting place\nto be.\n\n\nHighlight #4\n*Begala Highlights Importance of Framing Election As "McCain Is Same As\nBush"* (CNN 08/06/08 5:30pm)\nALEX CASTELLANOS: [\x85] John McCain has an advantage, he\'s been around a long\ntime, I think Paul\'s writing a book about this. And so, we\'ve seen him\ntested. So in a moment of stress for the country, when you need presidential\nleadership, you have a sense hey, I know this guy.  And that\'s why McCain\ncan change positions on an issue and say, you know, well we still know who\nthis guy is. Barack Obama is a little bit like that bright shiny packaging\non a Christmas present, we get all excited at first but eventually you want\nto know what\'s inside and we still don\'t.\n\nPAUL BEGALA: [\x85] I think his campaign has to show the core of John McCain.\nAlex is right, *McCain has a core, it\'s called George W. Bush. At his core\nMcCain is a third term of Bush. If Obama\'s campaign will do more to define\nthat core of McCain as Bush, then I think he\'s got a better chance of\nwinning the election.*\n\nWOLF BLITZER: But he\'s disagreed with Bush on a lot of substantive issues.\n\n*BEGALA: Not a lot, 91 percent of the time over the Bush presidency, 91\npercent of the time. Now if a guy bats right-handed 91 percent of the time\ndo we call him a left-handed hitter? No. 91 percent of the time, I mean,\ncome on.* [\x85]\n\nBLITZER: That\'s one of the main arguments of the Obama campaign, if you\'ve\nlike the eight years of Bush vote for McCain.\n\nCASTELLANOS: Sure, they\'d much rather run against George Bush than John\nMcCain, because John McCain  is hard to beat. Look, there recently was\nsurvey in which they tested Barack Obama running against George Bush, and\nBarack Obama running against John McCain. You know what, John McCain was in\na much, dead heat in that race against Barack Obama. Bush was losing by\nabout 20 points, why, because the American people understand John McCain\'s a\nmaverick, he\'s different, he speaks his own mind, and that\'s the difference.\n\nBLITZER: Do you agree that the Republicans lucked out that McCain is their\nnominee?\n\nBEGALA: He\'s by far their strongest nominee, but this is why it\'s all the\nmore important for the Obama campaign to define McCain. If this campaign\nbecomes only a referendum of Barack Obama, that\'s bad for Barack, he needs\nto make it a referendum of John McCain and George Bush.\n\n*Those Who Don\'t Like Bush Don\'t Seem To Be Equating Dislike with\nMcCain*(CNN 08/06/08 7:05pm)\nBILL SCHNEIDER: Every forecasting model for this election predicts a\ndemocratic landslide. Strange then, when you ask voters to choose between\nBarack Obama and John McCain, the polls show a very close race. Imagine if\nPresident Bush were running for re-election or if Dick Cheney were running\nto succeed him? Can you say blowout? John McCain is a republican but he\'s\nnot part of the Bush administration, as he takes pains to make clear.\n\nMCCAIN: We\'ve disagreed over the conduct of the war in Iraq and the\ntreatment of detainees. Over out of control government spending and budget\ngimmicks. Over energy policy and climate change.\n\n*SCHNEIDER: A whopping 3/4 \'s of Americans believe things are going badly in\nthe country. Voters who feel that way have a very low opinion of President\nBush, but their displeasure does not seem to extend to McCain. They kind of\nlike him.* Barack Obama is new, he\'s young, he\'s relatively inexperienced. A\nlot of viewers see Obama as risky business. [\x85] Obama is promising change,\nthe downside to change is risk. If you want change, you have to take risks.\n[\x85]\n\n*O\'Reilly Looks At Whether McCain is Throwing Bush Under the Bus and If This\nIs Effective* (FNC 08/06/08 8:04pm)\nBILL O\'REILY: Is John McCain throwing the Bush administration under the bus?\n[\x85] *With President Bush way down in the polls the Obama campaign is doing\neverything it can to link the President with Senator McCain. That could be\nan effective strategy.* So the McCain people have a new ad, saying this [ad\nshown]. [\x85] The question for tonight is about McCain\'s strategy, is it smart\nfor him to openly say Washington is broken and by implication criticize Mr.\nBush\'s leadership. I don\'t think that is smart for a number of reasons.\nFirst, some conservatives still like the President and are skeptical about\nMcCain and that\'s not the way to win them over. *Second, McCain\'s emphasis\nshould be on solving vexing problems not assigning blame for what has gone\nwrong. That\'s what Obama is doing. Independent voters, the ones that will\ndecide the next election, want hope not blame. McCain should be giving\nvoters as much hope as possible, while at the same time emphasizing the\ninexperience of his opponent. Again, this election is about Barack Obama,\nyes or no on him. All McCain has to do is provide a steady alternative, be a\nsecure presence.* [\x85]\n\nDICK MORRIS: [\x85] First, let me do a factual correction on the Obama ad. The\nreason McCain didn\'t support tax cuts for a hundred million households was\nthey didn\'t pay any taxes. Those are people that pay zero taxes.\n\nO\'REILLY: But Obama is going to give them money back.\n\nMORRIS: Ok, but it\'s hard to cut what they don\'t pay. I believe this is the\nbest ad McCain has run. And I think it\'s a big mistake for Obama to answer.\nSo I disagree with you on both counts. *On the first part, McCain has got to\nprove he\'s not Bush\'s third term.* He\'s got a 27 percent approval rating,\nBush does. And you need 50 percent of the vote. And he\'s going to get the 27\npercent, those are die-hard republicans, whatever he does. *What he\'s got to\ndo is to show that he is not Bush and that he can reach out to the other\nparty.* That\'s why I believe the greatest move for McCain would be to put\nJoe Lieberman on his ticket for vice president. [\x85] *And I think McCain has\nrecaptured the maverick role that he played in 2000, when everyone saw him\nrunning against George Bush. And by talking about tobacco companies, and oil\ncompanies, and drug companies, he\'s hitting that populist message. Two wings\nto the Republican Party, the country club and the populist.  And he\'s\naligning with the populist against Bush, which is essentially the country\nclub.* [\x85] *People are going to eventually split the difference. They\'re\ngoing to say yeah, he\'s not George Bush but he\'s not a total maverick in the\nmiddle. And that\'s going to be enough for McCain to get the votes that Obama\nalienates.*\n\n[\x85]\n\nYou need to kick Bush to show that you\'re independent. And when you say\nwe\'re worse than we were four years ago, and Washington is broken, that\'s a\ngreat way of telling the voters I\'m kicking Bush, you can trust me to be as\ngood as Obama.\n\n\nHighlight #5\n*McCain\'s Tricky Balancing Act, Trying to Not Appear Too Negative* (CNN\n08/06/08 4:25pm)\nWOLF BLITZER: [\x85] Our brand new CNN Opinion Research Corporation Poll shows\nmany of you think they\'ll both be risky. 57 percent for Obama, 54 percent\nfor McCain. But McCain\'s campaign would surely like those numbers to change\nin McCain\'s favor.\n\nED HENRY: While Barack Obama is trying to build himself as the candidate of\nchange, John McCain is trying to seize that mantle back. A new one, two\npunch from John McCain.\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: The cost of everything is going up and in the face of this\nWashington is on vacation.\n\nHENRY: First McCain is on the attack, charging government is broken and\nBarack Obama is too inexperienced to fix it.\n\nMCCAIN: My opponent, Senator Obama, opposes both storage and reprocessing of\nspent nuclear fuel, he opposes offshore drilling immediately, and he\'s out\nof touch.\n\nHENRY: At the same time McCain is trying to present a positive agenda,\nmaking the case he has better plans to improve the economy and solve the\nenergy problem.\n\nMCCAIN: We need to crack down on those who\'ve abused our credit market and\ncaused this housing decline. We need to take action to support American\nbusinesses so that we can stop jobs from going overseas.\n\nHENRY: A tricky balancing act for McCain, who may come across as too\nnegative. He\'s walking that same fine line in a new ad that again charges\nObama is a celebrity, but with a forward looking twist.\n\n[Ad shown]\n\nThis ad is toned down, no images of Paris Hilton who was in last weeks ad\nand prompted so much outrage in the Obama camp. Nevertheless, the previous\ncelebrity ad has sparked a humorous response from none other than Paris\nHilton.\n\n[Paris Hilton response ad shown]\n\nTrying to go positive and negative at the same time may be a tough balancing\nact for McCain. Whenever he attacks Washington, Obama reminds audiences that\nSenator McCain has been in Washington for 26 years. The challenge for McCain\nis to restore his old reputation as a maverick, not an insider.\n\n\nHighlight #6\n*Carly Fiorina\'s Effectiveness As a Surrogate for McCain Examined* (CNN\n08/06/08 8:49pm)\nCAMPBELL BROWN: [\x85] Carly Fiorina wants women to vote for John McCain. [\x85]\nFiorina had her own trouble staying on message.\n\nDANA BASH: It\'s barely 8am, Carly Fiorina has already flown into Georgia,\nshe\'s in a hurry. [\x85] 18 months ago John McCain asked her to advice him on\neconomics, but her urgent task this day, selling McCain to women voters. A\nroll tailor-made for Fiorina. She was the first female CEO of a high-tech\ncompany, Hewlett Packard. She has lots of female fans. [\x85] Fiorina is using\nher star power to draw women to listen about McCain.\n\nCARLY FIORINA: So I have known him since 2000. In his Senate office, women\nhave both higher positions and are higher paid on average than the men in\nhis office.\n\nBASH: She talks about women\'s issues you don\'t hear much elsewhere.\n\nFIORINA: He was a co-sponsor of the women\'s equal opportunity act. [\x85]\n\nBASH: She is a newcomer to politics, mistakes happen. [\x85] She recently told\nreporters that women ask her why doesn\'t health insurance cover  birth\ncontrol if it covers Viagra. It caught McCain by surprise. [\x85] Fiorina\ninsists her point, that women want a say in choices in health coverage is\nvalid. [\x85]\n\nLooking back, do you think it would have been better, given what happened,\nto talk about meditation and valium as opposed to use the Viagra word in\nthis political situation.\n\nFIORINA: Well, I in some ways, I\'m quite surprised it caused such a flab. I\nmean, all you have to do is watch your network, CNN, and see endless ads, ad\nafter ad after ad, for what we are euphemistically calling male enhancement.\nBut, I understand, it was perhaps too memorable an example.\n\nBASH: But it\'s not just the Viagra dustup. In Ohio recently, Fiorina said\nthat "McCain has never signed on to efforts to overturn Roe v. Wade." But\nthe fact is that McCain calls for Roe v. Wade\'s reversal right on his\nwebsite.\n\nYour critics say, well, you\'re doing  that to try to lure women voters, even\nthought it doesn\'t really represent Senator McCain\'s position.\n\nFIORINA: The reality is we have had seven years of a republican Congress and\na republican President, and Roe v. Wade is still the law of the land. [\x85]\n\nBASH: [\x85] Fiorina tells us about searching for Hillary Clinton voters,\nskeptical of Barack Obama.  She recently met some.\n\nFIORINA: They sent me a message on my website one day, and they said we\nreally want to talk to you.\n\nBASH: But if this former CEO knows anything it\'s data, and polls show that\nwomen are breaking for Obama not McCain. Still, she\'s off to hunt for McCain\nvoters and avoid controversy.\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0cXy6Tkg8s>\n\n\n\n-- \nEvan Whitbeck\nTracker/Media Analyst\nProgressive Accountability Office\nevan@progressiveaccountability.org\n202-609-7677 (w)\n360-480-0786 (c)\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
