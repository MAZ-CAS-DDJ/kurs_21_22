She\'s\nasked that the emails be released and no matter how much Republicans pile\non with investigation after investigation,  when the process is completed\nand they are released they will show that she was a fierce and effective\nadvocate for America and American values across the globe.\n\nOn Wednesday, August 26, 2015, Spahn, Andy <spahn@gonringspahn.com> wrote:\n\n> Thanks but seems like this is part of the problem.
