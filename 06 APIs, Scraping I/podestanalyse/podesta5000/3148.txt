john.podesta@gmail.comb'Good morning Professors,\n\nI\'ve chosen "*Roles & Challenges of Private Counsel in Congressional\nInvestigations: Navigating Waters, Assessing Risks, and Prepping Witnesses*"\nas a topic.\n\nI chose this because I\'ve always been intrigued by the regionally unique\ncongressional investigations bar we have in DC. With most prominent DC law\nfirms showcasing congressional investigations practice groups on their\nwebsites, I\'d like to write about this niche practice and assess the\nchallenges facing counsel in this realm. I\'m particularly interested in\nlearning what role lawyers play in congressional investigations and how\ntheir representation may differ from more traditional court room settings.\n\nSome early questions I plan to pursue:\n\n   - What is considered a victory for the client?\n   - What role does counsel assume? Advocate? Advisor? Coach?\n   - How does witness preparation for a hearing compare to client\n   preparation for trial testimony, or depositions?\n   - What interplay or conflicts may exist with a law firm\'s lobbying\n   activities?\n   - How does a lawyer wear the hat of public relations manager when\n   dealing with client media exposure?\n\n\nI plan to research past investigations and also hope to interview attorneys\nin this area to get a better understanding of what challenges they see\nfacing this practice of law.\n\nI\'m looking forward to getting started and to hearing your thoughts on the\ntopic.\n\nBest,\n\nPhil Beshara\n\n-----\nPhilip E.
