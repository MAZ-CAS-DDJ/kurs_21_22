john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hello John,\n\n\nLiu He meeting now confirmed for Friday morning 9:00am.\n\n\nHis office is requesting meeting "topics" in advance. Some suggestions for the advance list:\n\n  1.  What are his personal views on the potential for US-China cooperation on finance for sustainable development, particularly regarding common standards for AIIB and other new and existing financial institutions? How might such international cooperation best overlap with domestic policy needs that his team is working on for 13th five-year plan -- what types of cooperation would he see as the most beneficial for China\'s domestic objectives?\n  2.  US policy toward China-to-US energy FDI: to what degree is this a priority issue for the Chinese leadership? Is there anything Chinese planners would view as a real \'win\' here that is actually doable?\n  3.  Updates regarding 13th five-year plan\n\nWhat are your thoughts? They may use this to prep so will wait for a green light from you to send.\n\n\nLooping Pete.\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMelanie\n\n\n----\nMelanie M. Hart, Ph.D.\nDirector for China Policy\nCenter for American Progress\nDirect Line: (202) 741-6359\nCell: (202) 294-6118\n'
