john.podesta@gmail.comb'John - \n\nAs President Obama addressed the graduating class of 2014 at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, he said "We must broaden our tools to include diplomacy and development."\n\nHis words are something to consider as diplomats gather in Vienna, Austria to hammer out a long-term agreement to ensure Iran never has the ability to develop a nuclear weapon.\n\nThey have until July 20th to work out a deal, or extend the process, but several Senators are already furiously working to derail the effort.\n\nThey need to hear from us today:\n\nJoin tens of thousands of veterans and military family members and sign our petition calling on the U.S. Senate to allow the diplomatic process to work with Iran.\n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/iran-diplomacy\n\nSadly, it\'s many of the same discredited neoconservative voices pushing for harsher sanctions that will trigger a new arms race in the region.\n\nColonel Lawrence Wilkerson former Chief of Staff to United States Secretary of State Colin Powell said, "To a soldier, the phrase \'seeking a diplomatic solution\' is sweet music."\n\nAnd if the diplomatic talks between Washington and Tehran fall apart, we\'ll have the opportunity to talk about which sanctions to reinstate or intensity. \n\nBut for now, we should all hope that those efforts succeed. \n\nTell Congress: Give Diplomacy with Iran a Chance. \n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/iran-diplomacy\n\nThe question is ... how badly do we want to avoid more war?\n\nThanks for standing with VoteVets on this issue.\n\nJon Soltz\nIraq War Veteran & Chairman\nVoteVets.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/unsubscribe\nPaid for by VoteVets Action Fund\n\n'
