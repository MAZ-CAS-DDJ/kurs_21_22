My post hits the highlights:\n\nhttps://nextgenamerica.org/climate-change/governor-browns-new-years-resolution-more-clean-energy-for-california/\n\nGovernor Brown had hinted at some of these initiatives when he spoke at the California Climate Leadership Forum hosted by NextGen Climate America in mid-December. Jesse Thomas produced a podcast with the key take aways of that event available here:\n\nhttps://nextgenamerica.org/climate-change/listen-to-dan-lashof-explain-how-california-is-leading-the-nation-in-the-fight-against-climate-change/\n\nJust before Christmas Washington State Governor Jay Inslee announced his own package of climate proposals designed to reduce pollution in his state and catapult it into a leadership position.  Aaron Burgess provides an overview:\n\nhttps://nextgenamerica.org/climate-change/christmas-for-climate-protection-in-washington-state/\n\nMeanwhile in Washington DC the 114th Congress convenes today and will begin by debating the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline. How did a tar sands export pipeline which will create only 35 permanent jobs become the GOP's top legislative priority?
