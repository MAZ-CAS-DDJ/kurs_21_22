But Clinton, whose granddaughter was born Sept. 26, canceled and\nsent her husband, former President Bill Clinton, in her place.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy 10-year-old daughter, who got a $1,000 ticket, is crushed,\xe2\x80\x9d\nSanford-Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s mom, Ariana Kelly, a member of the Maryland House of\nDelegates, said earlier yesterday of the former secretary of state\xe2\x80\x99s\nabsence. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad she\xe2\x80\x99s with the baby instead of\nwith us. It says something good about her soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton, who is considering a 2016 Democratic bid for the\npresidency, has nixed several fundraisers for her party\xe2\x80\x99s candidates since\nher daughter, Chelsea Clinton, gave birth Sept. 26. Political operatives in\nboth parties say that, like Kelly, most donors understand when a politician\ncancels an appearance at the last minute for exceptional personal or family\nreasons.\n\n\n\nAnd sometimes, the reserve called off the bench to stand in is good enough\nto satisfy even skeptics in a crowd.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust like middle school, it depends on who the substitute is,\xe2\x80\x9d Matt\nCanter, deputy executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign\nCommittee said, referring to the star power of the former president who\nstood in at the Brown fundraiser.\n\n\n\n*\xe2\x80\x98Frustrates People\xe2\x80\x99*\n\n\n\nRob Jesmer, former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial\nCommittee, said that some big names in politics develop a bad reputation\nfor last-minute cancellations for less-than-pressing matters.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat frustrates people,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. In this case, though, \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton\ncan get away with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe former first lady has been one of this year\xe2\x80\x99s most sought-after\nsurrogates for Democratic candidates across the nation, Canter said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the vast majority of our campaigns, there\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous demand for\nher to be involved in various aspects of the campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nAt last night\xe2\x80\x99s fundraiser, held at the Potomac, Maryland, home of David\nTrone, co-owner of Total Wine & More retail company, Bill Clinton echoed\nrecent remarks by President Barack Obama about the U.S. economy, saying it\nhas been growing stronger, according to a person who attended and requested\nanonymity to discuss a private event.\n\n\n\n*Foster Children*\n\n\n\nIn praising Brown for his work with foster children, Clinton said that his\nwife, a former U.S. senator from New York, had worked with former House\nMajority Leader Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican, on issues affecting such\nchildren when they were both in Congress, the person said.\n\n\n\nMaryland Governor Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, who picked Brown as his running mate\neight years ago and is considering his own bid for the Democratic\npresidential nomination, also attended the fundraiser.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton appeared at a pair of fundraisers for the Democratic\nCongressional Campaign Committee on Sept. 29 in New York, where her\ndaughter lives.

Warren\'s Full NPR Interview On Financial\nRegulation\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.npr.org/2014/10/01/352779367/transcript-sen-warrens-full-npr-interview-on-financial-regulation>*\n\n\n\n[Transcript]\n\nOctober 1, 2014, 5:03 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\n*STEVE INSKEEP: You described what you learned from this report as\ndisturbing. What\'s disturbing about it?*\n\n\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: Well ultimately, this report tells us exactly what we\nalready knew \xe2\x80\x94 that the relationship between regulators and the financial\ninstitutions they oversee is too cozy to provide the kind of tough\noversight that\'s really needed.\n\n\n\n*How is it too cozy? Because of course, we hear the regulators on these\ntapes saying: "There\'s a reason that we\'re trying to have good\nrelationships with banks like Goldman Sachs \xe2\x80\x94 we want to know what\'s going\non, we want to get information."*\n\n\n\nOh golly. So look \xe2\x80\x94 listen, though, to those tapes. For me, there were two\nthings that jumped out. The first was just a basic lack of truthful\nreporting: Supervisors are actually telling examiners not to report\naccurately the damning things they heard from bank executives during\nmeetings. I mean, wow. If there\'s not even an accurate record of what\'s\ngoing on, then the regulators can\'t hope to do their jobs.\n\n\n\nAnd the second thing: Look at how the Fed emphasized talk instead of\naction. You know, the regulators seemed to think that it was a victory just\nto raise an issue, even if they took absolutely no action to address the\nissue. And that\'s the kind of approach that allowed banks to take on\nmassive risks before the financial crisis.\n\n\n\nYou know, think about that: The regulators seemed to think that fussing at\nbanks behind closed doors was their toughest sanction. Does anyone believe\nthat Goldman Sachs is gonna give up a deal that would yield millions of\ndollars because someone fussed at them behind closed doors?\n\n\n\n*The regulators described this particular deal \xe2\x80\x94 that was reported on in\ngreat detail on the tapes \xe2\x80\x94 as a transaction that was legal, but shady. Uh,\nit did seem to be within in the rules. Does that call for a proper \xe2\x80\x94 does\nthat suggest a problem with regulators or the rules?*\n\n\n\nYou know, for me it starts as a problem with the regulators \xe2\x80\x94 and let me\ndescribe it this way: You know, the cultural problem isn\'t just some\nsecondary concern. It\'s the whole ball game.\n\n\n\nWe can keep making the rules tougher and tougher, but it won\'t make an\nounce of difference if the regulators won\'t enforce the rules that are\nthere. If the regulators back down or back off whenever the banks tell them\nto? Then it\'s the banks \xe2\x80\x94 and not the regulators \xe2\x80\x94 who are running the show-\n\n\n\n*Now you mention-*\n\n\n\n-and I think \xe2\x80\x94 yeah, go ahead.\n\n\n\n*Now you mentioned a cultural problem, Sen. Warren. Of course way back in\n2009, five years ago now, there was a report commissioned by the Fed that\nidentified this cultural problem: a reluctance to speak up and a suggestion\nof a too-close relationship with the banks.*\n\n\n\n*But what can you really do about that, given that you need to have\nregulators who, perhaps, have experience in the financial industry, and are\ngoing to get to know the financial industry and the people in it really\nwell?*\n\n\n\nWell you know, the first thing we can do is expose it. I mean, that\'s where\nthis really starts \xe2\x80\x94 that\'s the first step. And that\'s why it is I want to\nsee oversight hearings \xe2\x80\x94 I want to get a complete picture of what\'s\nhappened here...\n\n\n\nBut we need to move on this and move quickly, because the big banks are\njust getting bigger, and they\'re taking on new kinds of risks. We need\nregulators who understand that they work for the American people, not for\nthe big banks.\n\n\n\n*Carmen Segarra, the woman who made these tapes \xe2\x80\x94 and who was fired from\nthe Fed \xe2\x80\x94 sued, and her lawsuit was thrown out. One way to describe the\nreason it was thrown is simply that the whistleblower statutes did not\napply to her \xe2\x80\x94 she had not exposed a violation of regulations, she had\nexposed something short of that that was troubling to her.*\n\n\n\n*Do you think the whistleblower statutes should be expanded in some way?*\n\n\n\nYeah, I think that\'s one of things that ought to be on the table. I mean,\nlook \xe2\x80\x94 we need to look at whether or not we\'ve got the right tools to\nprotect the kind of people who will speak up. But, but what we\'ve got to\nstart with is we\'ve got to expose what happened here, we\'ve got to look at\nwhat the available tools are, but we\'ve got to give the message loud and\nclear to the Fed: Um, this isn\'t gonna work \xe2\x80\x94 you work for the American\npeople, you don\'t for the big banks.\n\n\n\n*I should mention that these allegations have been around for a while \xe2\x80\x94\nCarmen Segarra\'s story has been known for a while \xe2\x80\x94 what is new here is the\ntapes. Was there something, just from the tone \xe2\x80\x94 from listening to the\ntapes \xe2\x80\x94 that you learned that you did not know before?*\n\n\n\nYou know, there is something about listening to those tapes, and hearing\nsomeone say "no, no!" you know, "back up!" almost \xe2\x80\x94 almost a whiny tone\nabout the, the fact that she feels pretty strongly that Goldman is not in\ncompliance with the requirements of the law. And I\'m...\n\n\n\nThat\'s the part, when you hear the tape, there\'s no more "he said, she\nsaid," one person describes it this way and another says no. It\'s that you\nreally do, for a moment, get to be the fly on the wall that watches all of\nit, and there it is to be exposed to everyone: the cozy relationship, the\nfact that the Fed is more concerned about its relationship with a\ntoo-big-to-fail bank than it is with protecting the American public.\n\n\n\n*I suppose if a Goldman official was sitting here, they might point out\nGoldman was complying with the law \xe2\x80\x94 at least according to some of the\nregulators \xe2\x80\x94 and the problem was whether they were doing something that was\naround the edges of the law, so to speak.*\n\n\n\nYeah, but this is partly the role of a regulator. A regulator doesn\'t say\nto a big financial institution: "Hey! Step right up here. Get your toes on\nthe line, and so long as you can make a legal argument that you have not\ncrossed the line then, hey, we\'re \xe2\x80\x94 we\'re all cool here."\n\n\n\nThat\'s not the way regulation of large financial institutions is supposed\nto work \xe2\x80\x94 they\'re supposed to be using judgment. And remember, part of this\njudgment is about whether or not there has been compliance with the law.\nThe fact that Goldman could mount a legal defense here is not really the\npoint of these tapes. The point of these tapes is that the regulators are\nbacking off long before anyone\'s in court making a legal argument about\nwhether or not they came right up to the line or they crossed over the line.\n\n\n\n*Do you think regulators in a situation like that could say, "listen, this\nmay be legal, but I don\'t like it \xe2\x80\x94 don\'t do it"?*\n\n\n\nYou know, I think what regulators can do, is they can remind these large\nfinancial institutions that there\'s a lot of room in there for the large\nfinancial institutions to get themselves into trouble and to get the entire\neconomy into trouble.\n\n\n\nI mean look, that\'s what happened in 2008 \xe2\x80\x94 the regulators stood by as the\nbig financial institutions kept loading up on more and more and more risk.\nThe regulators had the tools to say to the big financial institutions, "hey\nguys, you gotta back off \xe2\x80\x94 you\'re putting the whole system at risk when you\ndo this." And yet the regulators didn\'t do that. They were willfully blind\nto what went on.\n\n\n\nAnd what we\'re seeing here is that same kind of cozy relationship, as the\nbig financial institutions continue to run their operations, taking on more\nrisk, doing what they want to do and brushing their regulators aside.\n\n\n\n*Sen. Warren, this is, uh, something that you\'re clearly passionate about,\nbut it\'s a complicated issue \xe2\x80\x94 bank regulation. What would have to happen\nfor it to be a major campaign issue this fall or in 2016?*\n\n\n\nYou know, I think it already is a campaign issue. The way I see this, for\neverybody who\'s running right now in 2014, there\'s a fundamental question\nof whose side you stand on.\n\n\n\nYou know, the game out there is rigged, and people across this country\nreally get it. And the Goldman Sachs tapes just show it one more time.\nLittle banks have to follow the rules, regular families have to follow the\nrules, but big financial institutions? Somehow they can manage just to push\ntheir regulators aside and go forward.\n\n\n\nThere\'s a \xe2\x80\x94 there\'s a fundamental question about who this country works\nfor. It can\'t just work for those who already have lots of money and lots\nof power. We\'ve got to have a country that works for everybody else.\n\n\n\n*Should Hillary Clinton address this issue forcefully?*\n\n\n\nYou know, I\'d like to see everybody address this issue forcefully. I think\nit is a very important question, and I\'m \xe2\x80\x94 I wanna see everybody in on it.\nBoth parties \xe2\x80\x94 I think we all should be there.\n\n\n\n*Do you think that \xe2\x80\x94 do you think that your party is going to be able to\nmake an issue of this in the general election coming up in a couple of\nyears?*\n\n\n\nYou know, I\'m gonna keep talking about it, and I think there are a lot of\npeople in the Democratic Party who will do the same.\n\n\n\n*Sen.

RandPaul.com is being offered\nfor $125,000.\n\n\n\nBy comparison, the price of other names based on possible presidential\nhopefuls might be considered a steal: ChrisChristiePresident2016.com is up\nfor grabs for $49,000, while TedCruzForCommanderinChief.com is $20,000, and\nElizabethWarren2016.com goes for a mere $3,300.\n\n\n\nJeremy Peter Green shelled out thousands of dollars to amass his collection\nof 180 domain names. The 26-year-old recent law school graduate says\nproudly, "As far as I know, I have a better 2016 collection than anyone\nelse out there."\n\n\n\nGreen\'s bipartisan, eclectic and sometimes long-shot list pairs former\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton with a slew of possible Democratic vice\npresidential picks in domain names such as ClintonNapolitano.com,\nClintonOMalley.com, and ClintonWarner.com, referring to former Homeland\nSecurity Secretary Janet Napolitano, Maryland Gov. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, and\nSen. Mark Warner (Va.). And Green is gambling on former Florida Gov. Jeb\nBush (R) running with Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) for BushAyotte.com.\n\n\n\nThe Maryland native started focusing on 2016 well before the previous\npresidential showdown was decided, buying up domains shortly after\nfinishing college in 2010. The domain name guessing game seemed like a\nnatural fit for the self-professed political junkie, who worked as an\nautograph dealer in college to earn extra spending money.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only political autographs that were really worth money were people\nthat buyers thought might become president soon, or people that already\nwere president, so I had to speculate on who was going to be president and\nthen get things signed by them before they got big,\xe2\x80\x9d Green tells ITK.\n\n\n\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s banking on his Clinton names, saying the former first lady is \xe2\x80\x9cthe\nsingle most likely candidate to be the first name\xe2\x80\x9d on the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99\nticket. Indeed, more than 50 domains based on variations on Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s name\n(including HillaryForPres2016.com for $8,300, HillaryNotPresident.com for\n$295,000, and YesHillaryCan.com for $49,995) are for sale on GoDaddy.com.\n\n\n\nBut Green, like many other Internet entrepreneurs, also attempts to think\noutside the box when he\xe2\x80\x99s buying up domains. He purchased a domain with the\nname of former Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortu\xc3\xb1o (R), saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI just think\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d be a cool ticket add-on for a Republican nominee, even though nobody\nwill ever pick him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s also placing his bets on Vice President Biden making a run again in\n2016, but not for commander in chief: \xe2\x80\x9cI also like ClintonBiden[.com], even\nthough nobody talks about Biden running for vice president again. I still\nthink he\xe2\x80\x99s more likely than any other individual candidate to be picked for\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSince he buys his online acquisitions in bulk, Green pays about $8 a year\nper domain in his cache. Although he has yet to make a profit, he\xe2\x80\x99s eyeing\na big payout ahead of the presidential election.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDefinitely if you happen to have the right two last names that end up on\none of the two tickets, that is worth a lot of money. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth\nlow six-figures if you happen to have one of those.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGreen says his goal is to sell all his domain names as a bundle to make\nmoney sooner rather than later.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would only sell the bundle for tens of thousands, so it would still be a\npretty good amount,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\n\n\n\nBut Bill Sweetman, president of the domain name consulting firm Name Ninja,\nsays dreams of a big payday are likely pie in the political sky.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am aware of hundreds of different examples of people registering these\nnames in the hopes of somebody coming along and buying it from them,\xe2\x80\x9d\nSweetman tells ITK. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of a single instance where a candidate\nor a group bought \xe2\x80\x98Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s name for president.com.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhile \xe2\x80\x9ctechnically not illegal,\xe2\x80\x9d according to Sweetman, snagging domain\nnames in the hopes of selling them to a candidate or campaign \xe2\x80\x9cjust doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\npass the sniff test.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGreen, who works at a labor law firm, says he knows not everyone approves\nof his domain name buying spree.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a kind of bottom-feeding to a lot of people, I think \xe2\x80\xa6 I mean\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything to look down on about it, but I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s\njust the idea of buying something that you don\xe2\x80\x99t plan to use and then\nsitting on it until you can exploit it \xe2\x80\x94 that rubs people the wrong way,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe says.\n\n\n\nSweetman says he appreciates the \xe2\x80\x9cpredicting the future\xe2\x80\x9d aspect of 2016\ndomain name sellers, but contends as a general rule: \xe2\x80\x9cI still don\xe2\x80\x99t think\nyou should do that with political candidates or with people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a gamble, and there are better ways. If you\xe2\x80\x99re serious about making\nmoney and buying and selling domain names, you don\xe2\x80\x99t play that game.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nInstead, the domain name expert suggests researching things, not people,\nthat might be all the buzz in a few years.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you think the world is moving towards solar power, or some new thing\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re learning about \xe2\x80\xa6 and you buy a bunch of those names and hope to sell\nthem down the road, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic," Sweetman says.\n\n\n\nGreen says he has a game plan if his domain names prove to be a tough sell:\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will use them. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make fun of the politicians if I\xe2\x80\x99m unable to sell\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s what Green, a Democrat, did in 2012, turning a domain name\nbased on Rick Santorum into a blog poking fun of the former GOP\npresidential candidate.\n\n\n\nAsked if it ever pains him to plunk down money on domain names involving\npotential nominees on the opposing party\xe2\x80\x99s ticket, Green replies, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, the\nRepublican ones are the easy ones for me to buy because if I can grab one\nof those domains before somebody else does and then charge as much as I can\nto Republican candidates, then I feel good about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGreen pauses before adding, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the Democrat ones I feel a little more\nambivalent about. But I also don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal. Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s going\nto grab them.

In an acknowledgement of the will-she-or-won\'t-she\nquestion that has dogged her life since leaving the post of Secretary of\nState in 2013, she writes, "Over the past year, as I\'ve traveled around the\ncountry once again, the one question I\'m asked more than any other is: Will\nI run for President in 2016?"\n\n\n\nHer answer, naturally: "I haven\'t decided yet."\n\n\n\nSo the presidential frontrunner may have some explaining to do when she\nappears Thursday at Books and Books in Coral Gables to sign copies of "Hard\nChoices." The 3:30 p.m. signing is expected to draw at least 1,000\nvisitors, or to say it more optimistically, 1,000 opportunities to coax a\nclear answer from the former first lady.\n\n\n\nHere\'s what to know before queuing up to visit Clinton:\n\n\n\nExpect to find now-Grandma Clinton in a more buoyant mood this week, as the\nbook signing is her first since the birth of her granddaughter, Charlotte,\nlast Friday.\n\n\n\nAnother possible sign Clinton is warming up for a 2016 presidential run is\nher scheduled stop later that night in Miami, for a campaign dinner for\nFlorida\'s Republican-turned-Democratic candidate for governor, Charlie\nCrist.\n\n\n\nAdmission is the $35 book purchase, available at the bookstore (265 Aragon\nAve.) or at BooksandBooks.com. Clinton\'s security detail will check\nvisitors\' bags, as well, so leave totes and purses in the car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Des Moines Register: \xe2\x80\x9cLate-night comics joke about Iowa and Hillary\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2014/09/30/iowa-politics-jimmy-fallon-snl-hillary-clinton/16493963/>*\n\n\n\nBy Jason Noble\n\nSeptember 30, 2014, 5:40 p.m. CDT\n\n\n\nLate-night comics have rediscovered Iowa.\n\n\n\nThe steady stream of potential 2016 presidential candidates visiting the\nstate in recent weeks has caught the attention of comedians and made the\nstate literally a punchline.\n\n\n\nOn Saturday Night Live over the weekend, faux-news anchors Colin Jost and\nMichael Che noted Hillary Clinton\'s recent visit to the Harkin Steak Fry\nand her "Hello, Iowa, I\'m back!" quip.\n\n\n\n"If I remember 2008 correctly," Che said, as a photo of \'08 caucus winner\nand current President Barack Obama flashed on the screen, "that\'s not as\neffective as saying, \'Hello, Iowa, I\'m black.\'"\n\n\n\nTonight Show Host Jimmy Fallon offered a string of jokes on Monday night on\nthe birth of Bill and Hillary Clinton\'s first grandchild, including one\nwith an allusion to Iowa\'s first in the nation caucuses.\n\n\n\n"Chelsea Clinton gave birth to a baby girl named Charlotte, she\'s already\nsaid her first word: \'Iowa!\'" he said.

But where were the machatonim?\n\n\n\nIn case you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering, machatonim is a Yiddish word that describes a\nrelationship for which there is no equivalent word in English: the parents\nof your child\xe2\x80\x99s spouse. And in the case of the Clintons, the machatonim are\ntwo longtime friends and allies: Marjorie Margolies and Edward Mevzinsky.\n\n\n\nMarjorie is a women\xe2\x80\x99s rights activist and former Congresswoman from\nPennsylvania who served a momentous single term in 1993-95 after her\ndeciding vote for the Clinton budget cost her her seat. She ran but lost in\nthe Democratic primary this spring, despite vigorous support from both\nClintons. Her former husband, Edward Mevzinsky, served two terms in\nCongress from Iowa \xe2\x80\x94 but also served fived years in prison after being\nconvicted of fraud in 2001. They were divorced in 2007. So maybe their low\nprofile is understandable.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are totally delighted,\xe2\x80\x9d Marjorie told TIME. What matters this week,\nanyway, is the relationship of the Clintons and the Margolies-Mevzinskys as\nmachatonim \xe2\x80\x94 surely a more efficient way to put it than fumbling around\nawkwardly with phrases like \xe2\x80\x9cmy daughter\xe2\x80\x99s in-laws.\xe2\x80\x9d If Bill and Hillary\nare newcomers to their heightened status as grandparents, Marjorie and Ed\nare black-belt machatonim. Between their combined eleven children, they\nalready have 18 grandchildren, thus presenting Charlotte with 18 cousins\n\xe2\x80\x9cwho can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to be part of Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s life,\xe2\x80\x9d Margolies says.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s often pointed out that the machatonim often become uncommonly close\nfor two reasons: (1) their shared love for the same grandchildren, and (2)\nbecause they and the grandchildren are united by a common enemy: the\nparents.\n\n\n\nSo now begin the sensitive negotiations that are more than familiar to many\ngrandparents. Which family will Charlotte (and, oh, her parents) visit for\nThanksgiving? Or will they split the difference, Solomonically bolting\nafter turkey dinner to commute to the Other Grandparents\xe2\x80\x99 House for\ndessert? Who gives her the coolest presents? And, most terrifying, which\ngrandparents does she says she loves the MOST? She will say she loves them\nall, of course. After all, at least genetically, all machatonim are created\nequal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Washington Post blog: The Switch: \xe2\x80\x9cMeet Share America, the U.S. State\nDepartment\xe2\x80\x99s Upworthy clone\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/09/30/meet-share-america-the-u-s-state-departments-upworthy-clone/>*\n\n\n\nBy Nancy Scola\n\nSeptember 30, 2014, 4:31 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nThe public diplomacy game is going viral, as Russia has been demonstrating\nof late with its remarkable agility in getting its message out about the\nUkraine conflict in today\'s networked information environment. Eager to\ncompete in what might be called social warfare, the United States has just\nsoft-launched Share America, a new site that looks much like another\nenormously successful vendor of social media fodder, Upworthy.\n\n\n\nAnd what Share America is serving up is bite-sized nuggets of video, photos\nand text, all optimized to be as shareable as possible on the Web. The goal\nis to feed content aligned with stated American values -- "democracy,\nfreedom of expression, innovation, entrepreneurship, education, and the\nrole of civil society," reads the site -- in the ever-hungry maw of\nFacebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social networks.\n\n\n\n"Share America is an effort to take the issues that the United States cares\nabout, and present them in ways that people will find interesting and in\nturn share through their networks," said Macon Phillips, who leads the\nBureau of International Information Programs at the State Department. "As\nI\'ve traveled around to posts all over the world, one thing is clear: We\nuse our social presences as the main way we publish information for\naudiences in those countries. And so we want to create and publish\ninformation that we can provide to our colleagues in the field through\ntheir own social network and to allies around the world who share our\ninterests."\n\n\n\nState Department officials are taking a liberal view of what constitutes\nreflections of American interests. Leading the home page Tuesday was a\nvideo of Steve Jobs\'s 2005 commencement address at Stanford. But other\nposts are more straightforward, such as a White House photo that reveals\nthe Martin Luther King, Jr. quote decorating the Oval Office\'s rug. Each\nShare America story comes equipped with prominent "Share This" and "Tweet\nThis" buttons. And there\'s little hiding the source -- the .gov address is\nbaked into each shared link, even in shortened form.\n\n\n\nAmerican diplomats have long tried to win the information game. And under\nboth previous Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and current Secretary John\nKerry, the State Department has attempted to identify and even amplify the\nnuances of an increasingly horizontal world; the 21st Century Statecraft\npush centered on the idea that there is growing power in peer-to-peer\ncommunications. But now that formal outreach channels like Voice of America\nare competing with thousands, if not millions, of less formal channels, it\ncan be difficult for governments to find traction.\n\n\n\nTom Cochran, the former chief technology officer at Atlantic Media, joined\nthe State Department in March, bringing his knowledge of how the modern,\ndata-driven media environment works. Cochran is helping to drive the\ncreation of Share America. Each post on the site is produced by State\nDepartment staff.\n\n\n\nCochran will be among the first to know whether the world is, indeed, eager\nto share Share America\'s vision of America. But just as the Internet has\nrevealed the world\'s common love of cat photos, officials are hoping that\nit will also reveal its love of American-style freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Daily Beast: \xe2\x80\x9cThis Is How Eva Longoria Is Trying to Win the Midterms\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/01/this-is-how-eva-longoria-is-trying-to-win-the-midterms.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Asawin Suebsaeng\n\nOctober 1, 2014\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] From working behind the scenes in the midterms to making a new\nfarm labor documentary, the former Desperate Housewife has emerged as a\nforce to be reckoned with in liberal politics.\n\n\n\nThese days, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a rising star in Democratic politics, it is downright\nweird if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have Eva Longoria in your corner.\n\n\n\nThe 39-year-old actress starred on the long-running ABC satire Desperate\nHousewives and in more lackluster theatrical fare such as Harsh Times and\nOver Her Dead Body. She\xe2\x80\x99s done commercials for L\xe2\x80\x99Or\xc3\xa9al, and hosted\nSaturday Night\nLive. But her work as an entertainer isn\xe2\x80\x99t what\xe2\x80\x99s earning her the biggest\nheadlines these days\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s her role as a serious political activist and\npowerhouse in Democratic politics.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEva is so much more than a celebrity who occasionally lends her name to\ncauses,\xe2\x80\x9d Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ)\xe2\x80\x94with whom Longoria enthusiastically\ncampaigned during his Senate run last year\xe2\x80\x94told The Daily Beast. \xe2\x80\x9cEva\nimmerses herself in the pursuit of social and political justice. She knows\nthe issues, is a great strategist, and is willing to sacrifice popularity\nfor her larger sense of purpose. When I first met her, I was impressed and\ninspired by the fact that her activism is at the center of her being, and\nit is that authenticity that I believe makes her such a potent force for\nprogressive change.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDuring the 2012 presidential election, Longoria was an Obama campaign\nco-chair and one of the president\xe2\x80\x99s top bundlers, and she delivered one of\nthe more memorable speeches at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.\n\xe2\x80\x9c[Mitt Romney] would raise taxes on middle-class families to cut his\nown\xe2\x80\x94and mine,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, building up to one of the convention\xe2\x80\x99s biggest\napplause lines. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not who we are as a nation, and let me tell you\nwhy: Because the Eva Longoria who worked at Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s flipping burgers\xe2\x80\x94she\nneeded a tax break. But the Eva Longoria who works on movie sets does not.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nLongoria\xe2\x80\x99s impressive dive into politics and advocacy also includes working\nwith first lady Michelle Obama on the anti-obesity Let\xe2\x80\x99s Move! campaign,\ntraveling to Capitol Hill to drum up support for the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Act for\nResponsible Employment (CARE Act), and even trying her hand at endorsing\nstudent body presidents. And when the actress met with Obama in 2012\nfollowing Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to move on immigration reform, she pushed the\npresident to get more productively \xe2\x80\x9cemotional\xe2\x80\x9d and to take swift executive\naction to protect undocumented kids. (Two months later, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what\nhe did.)\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\'ve always been politically active,\xe2\x80\x9d Longoria told The Daily Beast. \xe2\x80\x9cI\'ve\nbeen involved since Clinton ran in \xe2\x80\x9992, volunteering, going door-to-door,\ncanvassing, phone-banking\xe2\x80\xa6And coming from the state of Texas\xe2\x80\x94the country of\nTexas, I should say\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m definitely at the forefront.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHer new role as a leading Latina power broker has brought her glowing\ncoverage:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEva Longoria Is Obama\'s Newest Hispanic Political Power Chip\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe year of the political Latino celebrity, starring Eva Longoria\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan Eva Longoria start a Latino political movement?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEva Longoria Moves From Desperate Housewife to Political Power Player\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nLongoria has been instrumental in building an operation and network\ndedicated to encouraging more Latino and Latina political participation,\nand to getting more Latinos elected to local, state, and federal\noffices\xe2\x80\x94and she isn\xe2\x80\x99t slowing down for the 2014 midterms, or at any point\nin the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had this amazing turnout in 2012\xe2\x80\xa6yet in the midterms, nobody shows up!\xe2\x80\x9d\nLongoria said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s across the board. You can\xe2\x80\x99t elect the president, then\nsit and stay home and not elect the people he has to work with\xe2\x80\xa6I love and\nadore Hillary [Clinton], but I\xe2\x80\x99m definitely not going to be speaking about\n2016 until we can continue to fix what\xe2\x80\x99s on our agenda\xe2\x80\xa6We need to show our\ndisappointment in the midterm elections; [at] this lame-duck Congress that\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t get anything done.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDuring this election season, the actress/activist has been working mostly\nas a behind-the-scenes operator: voter registration efforts, fundraising,\ngetting out the vote, campaign events, and\xe2\x80\x94not so behind-the-scenes\xe2\x80\x94social\nmedia. (She told The Daily Beast that she is supporting \xe2\x80\x9cmany people\xe2\x80\x9d this\nNovember but declined to name a few, so as not to appear to be publicly\nplaying favorites.)\n\n\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s been an active supporter of Voto Latino, an organization geared\ntoward Latino Millennials, since its inception in 2008. When the group\nlaunched its Latinos 2014 project, Longoria was standing by.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEva and her organization the Latino Victory Project kindly jumped on board\nimmediately,\xe2\x80\x9d Maria Teresa Kumar, president of Voto Latino, told The Daily\nBeast. \xe2\x80\x9cNot just reaching out to their networks, but also reaching out to\nother celebrity voices to help us during the [midterms].\xe2\x80\x9d This outreach\nincludes a soon-to-launch photo campaign that will showcase celebrities\nholding up handwritten signs reading, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m asking you: Register to vote.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn 2010, Eva was one of the biggest advocates for United We Win, which\nwent up against the SB 1070 law in Arizona,\xe2\x80\x9d Kumar said, referring to the\nstate\xe2\x80\x99s immigration law. \xe2\x80\x9cEva lent her voice to make sure that didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nhappen [in other states]. She would be up at 5 in the morning hitting\ndifferent radio stations across the country to remind folks to register to\nvote.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd her work with the Latino Victory Project\xe2\x80\x94which includes the Latino\nVictory PAC\xe2\x80\x94runs even deeper. Founded by Longoria and DNC finance chairman\nHenry Mu\xc3\xb1oz, the project focuses on building Latino political power\nnationwide in order to \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutionalize what happened in 2012,\xe2\x80\x9d, as\nLongoria has previously described it. (The Republican National Committee\nhas called the project out as a \xe2\x80\x9cDemocrat[ic] front group.\xe2\x80\x9d) As co-founder,\nshe does everything from approving press releases to sending voter\ninformation to the project\xe2\x80\x99s databases.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have never had a Latina elected to the U.S. Senate. Eva wants to change\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d Crist\xc3\xb3bal Alex, president of the Latino Victory Project, told The\nDaily Beast. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is one of the only people in the country who can\nspearhead an effort, build an organization from scratch, who can do\nthat\xe2\x80\xa6She has been creating a leadership pipeline.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nLongoria and Mu\xc3\xb1oz also co-founded the Futuro Fund, which hauled in more\nthan $32 million from more than 100,000 donors for Obama\xe2\x80\x99s reelection. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\ntwo of them really figured out how to get Latinos to flex their muscle with\ntheir pocketbook, too\xe2\x80\x94not just at the ballot box,\xe2\x80\x9d Alex said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was\ncertainly one of the primary drivers for the fund, one of the key\nspokespeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAlex recounted one of the first times he met Longoria, when the two\nattended a meeting at The Atlantic Philanthropies in New York City at the\nend of 2011. \xe2\x80\x9cThis was the first time I had ever sat in a room with her to\nhave a high-level conversation about strategy and politics, and about how\nto advance immigration reform, and she absolutely ran that\nconversation\xe2\x80\xa6Everyone in the room looked to her on her thoughts on strategy\nand guidance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nLongoria has discussed with Alex the possibility of headlining events to\nengage voters in Texas, her home state and \xe2\x80\x9cthe state with one of the\nlargest numbers of unregistered Latino voters,\xe2\x80\x9d Alex noted. The Latino\nVictory Project has a number of these activities planned for late October\nbut is still hashing out the details.\n\n\n\nAnd though Longoria dreams of one day seeing a Latino or Latina commander\nin chief sworn in, she has shot down any talk about running for public\noffice herself. \xe2\x80\x9cWould I ever run for something?\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote in The\nHollywood Reporter in 2012. \xe2\x80\x9cGod, no. I have more power as a citizen. Once\nyou become a politician, your hands are tied. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have a voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s at least one colleague who hopes she\xe2\x80\x99s changed her mind since then.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure if she weren\xe2\x80\x99t so busy being a movie star, she could be in the\nWhite House,\xe2\x80\x9d Alex said. \xe2\x80\x9cOr governor of the state of Texas, or certainly\nin the Senate. Maybe she\xe2\x80\x99ll be the first Latina senator\xe2\x80\xa6I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that\njokingly. She\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFor the time being, it looks like Longoria doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to consider a\nrunning for office, even if she wanted to. \xe2\x80\x9cNinety-nine percent of my time\nright now is devoted to helping Latinas through educational programs,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid, referring to the Eva Longoria Foundation. She also has her hands full\nwith Eva\xe2\x80\x99s Heroes\xe2\x80\x94a nonprofit she co-founded to help people with special\nneeds\xe2\x80\x94and promoting Food Chains, a Human Rights Watch-endorsed documentary\nthat she executive-produced. The film examines labor in the U.S.\nagriculture sector and the \xe2\x80\x9cimmoral practices\xe2\x80\x9d that affect thousands of\nfarm workers. (Longoria calls agriculture the \xe2\x80\x9cbackbone of America.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are still so many labor laws that are broken daily, and there are so\nmany labor laws that exclude agriculture that we have not changed or\nupdated,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nGoing forward, Longoria and her political allies are, of course, going to\nrenew their campaign for comprehensive immigration reform, a stalled\nambition of the Obama presidency. Longoria says she has not spoken with the\nObama since news broke that he had delayed further executive action on\nimmigration until after the November election. (That political calculation\nnaturally pissed off a lot of Latino activists.) However, Longoria says she\nis not angered by the president\xe2\x80\x99s delay; she\xe2\x80\x99s forming another game plan.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were extremely disappointed that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get immigration reform\ndone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99re still pushing and working on something.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s this optimism that drives so much of her advocacy and action.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t dismiss the growing population, the changing demographics of our\ncountry,\xe2\x80\x9d Longoria noted. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd with that comes exciting times for everybody\nin America.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sec.
