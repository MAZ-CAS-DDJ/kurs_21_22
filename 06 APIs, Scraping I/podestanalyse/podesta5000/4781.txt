john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi All,\n\nUnfortunately, a stubborn McCain volunteer wouldn\'t let our tracker into\ntoday\'s town hall meeting.  But here\'s the good news: we were able to cover\nthe event via online video and web quality clips are available by request.\nBelow are our notes.\n\n*BIG HIGHTLIGHTS:\n*\n\n   - McCain does NOT mention Gramm comments\n   - McCain tells Michigan crowd that \'I have to look you in the eye and\n   tell you you\'re jobs aren\'t coming back\'\n   - McCain reiterated his support for No Child Left Behind and for \'choice\n   and competition\' in schools\n   - When asked about his changing positions on the Bush tax cuts and the\n   environment, McCain repeated in his response, \'I have not changed\n   positions.\'\n   - When asked how he will defend Israel as president, McCain said \'the\n   United States of America can never allow a second Holocaust\'\n\n*Belleville, MI - McCain Town Hall Meeting 07/10/08*\n\n*Speech Highlights:*\n- Town hall meetings are the best way to communicate.  Senator Obama has\nchosen not to participate in these town hall meetings.\n- The town hall meeting I hope to have is one on the economy, but I\'ll\nanswer all questions.\n- I don\'t want to insult your intelligence by tell you that the state of\nMichigan has lost over 70,000 jobs.  8.5% of your workforce is out of the\njob.\n- Families are sitting around the table each night and worrying how to pay\ntheir bills.\n- The price of a gallon of gas is over $4 -- over $5 in California.\n- We got to reform government and keep taxes low.\n- Right now we are gridlocked in our nation\'s capital.  I don\'t know if you\nsaw it or not, but Congress is at an approval rating of 9%.\n- My whole life has been spent putting my country first.  And I promise to\nalways do that.\n- I believe in the greatness of America. I\'m encouraged when I go to places\nin America that are using technology and innovation.\n- My opponent would like to have small businesses have mandatory health care\n-- which means new jobs will not be created.\n- The last thing we need in an economic downturn is to raise taxes.  Obama\nwants to raise a broad range of taxes.\n- If you want a candidate that will raise your taxes, Senator Obama is your\ncandidate.  I am not your candidate.\n- I believe in free trade.  I also believe in fair trade.  And we do have\nmeans for addressing inequalities.  I will be very active in preventing\nabuses.\n- I have to look you in the eye and say I believe in free trade.\n- Let me talk to you about spending.  Government has grown by 60% in the\nlast 8 years.  Spending has gotten out of control.  That is a great failure\nof this President for not vetoing those spending bills.\n- Ronald Reagan used to say -- Congress spends money like a drunken sailor\n... And I got a letter from a former drunken sailor who said he was offended\nby the association.\n- We spent $15 million of your money for asparagus subsidies.  That was in\nthe farm bill.  I voted against that.\n- Any pork-barrel project that comes across my desk, I will veto.\n- I have never asked for or received a pork-barrel project for my state.\nObama has.\n- My friends our single biggest challenge is our dependence on foreign oil.\nWe are sending billions of dollars to countries overseas that don\'t like us\nvery much.\n- We need to embark on a mission -- I\'m calling it the Lexington Project.\nWe need to do wind, solar, nuclear, tide -- all these sources.\n- We can unleash that power -- and we can do that right here in Michigan\nwhere we have some of the most innovative workers in the nation.\n- The lowest income Americans are being hurt most by the cost of gasoline.\n- The point is Americans need relief.  And we should give them a gas-tax\nholiday.\n- It\'s a security issue and an environmental issue.  We need to drill\noffshore.\n- We\'ve got to have nuclear power -- my friends the French.  80% of their\nelectricity is coming from nuclear energy.\n- We need to reprocess and story nuclear power.\n- I\'m proud of my record.  In January, I\'m going to go in there and take\nthem all on.  The Democrats, the Republicans, the Libertarians -- the\nvegetarians.  I\'ll make it happen.\n- I promise to serve -- I did it as a prisoner of war and in Congress.\n- Thank you very much for being here.  I\'ll now take your questions.\n\n*Question and Answer*\n1 Q) You visited my plant 2 years ago.  I donated to your campaign.  You say\nfair trade, free trade.  We want fair trade.  We\'ve lost a lot of our jobs.\nFor job training programs, where are you going to find the teachers?  And\nonce they\'re trained, I can go and hire an engineer for cheaper in China.\nWe want fair trade.\nMCCAIN: I see what your saying.  We have the WTO and other organizations\nthat help make trade fair.  But the innovation and hope lies in America.\nYou can never replace the ingenuity and greatness of the American worker.\nWe are the best.  Bill Gates started in a garage I believe.  I\'ll look at\nyou in the eye again and say there are certain jobs that aren\'t coming\nback.  But with green technology there will be new jobs available.  I am\nconfidant that flex fuels and hybrids are part of the answer.  I understand\nagain that people are hurting.  But they need to have hope and confidence in\nthe future. I do.  And I will keep taxes low.  And I will dedicate federal\nfunds to research and development money.  The right leadership, motivation\nand incentives and we can do this.  The future of the economy is in green\ntechnologies.  I believe that green technologies are going to fuel the\neconomic recovery of this nation.\nFOLLOW-UP: I believe we do need the leadership and the training programs.\nBut where are you going to get the teachers?  And the violations in free\ntrade!  We\'ve all testified before Congress and there\'s not much else we can\ndo.\nMCCAIN: All I can say to you is -- I will exercise every possible means to\nmake sure that trade regulations are not violated by our foreign partners.\nI also believe we can provide the job training programs.  We all know a job\nis more of a job in America -- we know it has to do with pride and family.\nI appreciate this exchange, but to do nothing contradicts what America is\nabout.  And I believe opening markets to our products is the way to go\nbecause we have the best, most innovator worker in the world.  And I\'m not\nafraid to compete.  I have to tell you, I do believe in the overall benefits\nof trade.\n\n2 Q) [Superintendant of schools] We have lots of displaced workers, but a\nlot of them don\'t have the degrees to access our programs.  What can you do\nto help these workers get access?\nMCCAIN: Our job training programs are stuck back in the 1950\'s. We need to\nfix that.  And I want to come to your school and learn what I can do.  I\'d\nlike to come and visit your school, see the programs you have and make sure\ndisplaced workers have access to your programs.\nFOLLOW-UP: Thank you and you are invited.\nMCCAIN: You\'re welcome and I will be in contact with you.\n\n3 Q) [Doctor, candidate for board of education] I\'d like to open up our\neducation system to choice.   How can the government promote school choice\nwithout becoming overly bloated?\nMCCAIN: I agree with you and thank you for your work.  My wife Cindy taught\nspecial education.  And that is another type of education that needs\nattention.  I believe in choice and competition.  I believe in No Child Left\nBehind, but it was a start and it needs to be fixed.  The city of New\nOrleans has many charter schools and the quality of education is on its way\nup.  Cindy and I sent our children to a Catholic school.  We\'re not\nCatholic, but we were thankful for the choice to send our kids to a good\nschool.\n\n4 Q) [Owns flag company] Thank you for your service.  I\'m completely\ncommitted to not voting for Barack Obama.  I\'m trying to get committed to\nvoting for you.  I don\'t like your votes against the Bush tax cuts, some of\nyour environmental votes.  And I see you\'ve changed your positions and are\nright on those now.  However, I\'m not sure.  We want to take you to the\ndance, we\'re just concerned about who you are going to go home with.\nMCCAIN: I hate to tell you, but I have not changed positions.  When we first\nhad these tax cuts, we did not have any restraints in spending.  I haven\'t\nchanged my position -- I wanted tax cuts, but I wanted that coupled with\nrestraints in spending.  And on the environment, I believe we have a\nrespectful disagreement.  Teddy Roosevelt is my hero.  We Republicans are\nfundamentally good environmentalists.  But suppose I\'m wrong and climate\nchange doesn\'t exist -- and we just go ahead and create all these great\ngreen jobs.  But suppose I\'m right -- we risk hurting future generations.\nBut I have not changed positions.\nFOLLOW-UP: I believe drilling is not hurting the environment.\nMCCAIN: Let me chime in.  I believe we do have to drill -- we do have to\nhave to do offshore drilling.\nFOLLOW-UP: If we don\'t drill, other countries are going to -- and already\nare.  We should drill in ANWR.  Everyone is going to be out of the job\nbecause they can\'t travel anywhere.\nMCCAIN: If we build the 45 powerplants that I want to build, that\'s 700,000\njobs.  I think it should still be up to the states if they want drilling off\ntheir coasts.\n\n5 Q) Most of us hold several patents because of the R and D tax credit.  We\nneed that, but it\'s under scrutiny.  We need to have that tax credit to\ncontinue to be innovative.  Very few metal stamping presses left.  A lot of\nthese investments we have made have been possible because of bonus\ndeprecation.  We need that to make certain things possible.  We need\nincentives to keep businesses here.\nMCCAIN: Thank you.  The R and D tax credit for research and development is\none of the big scams in America.  We put it up for a vote every couple years\nso we can go a ring some money out of you every election year.   We need to\nmake that permanent.\nA business tax -- the corporate tax is the second highest in the world.  We\nneed to lower it.  I\'m with you all the way.\nFOLLOW-UP: We need to make sure our customers are investing here.  A lot of\nthe jobs that haven\'t been created in the United States is because we\nhaven\'t been making enough investments here at home.\nMCCAIN: I thank you for your passion and what you\'ve done for America.\nThese have been tough times for you.  We need a plan.  We need to not just\ngo to Congress but to the people and share that plan.  I\'m going to reach\nout my hand to the Democrats and protect intellectual property.  It\'s time\nwe put our country first.  I thank you for what you do.\n\n6 Q) [transportation rep] Transportation and freight issues in the area.\nWould support that -- personally take a look at that?\nMCCAIN: Yes I will personally take a look at that.  We tried to spend\nseveral million to build a bridge to nowhere in Alaska.  That\'s your money,\nyour tax dollars.  It\'s outrageous.  How we spend your money and\ntransportation dollars is not based on any real qualifications.  I will stop\nthis outrageous, corrupt process for how we spend your money.  I\'m proud of\nmy record on the issue.\n\n7 Q) When you are president, what is your commitment to Israel going to be?\nHow do you feel about the unofficial talks between Israel and Syria?\nMCCAIN: On your second question, it\'s a democratic, freely elected nation\nand they have the right to make the decision to speak with who they want\nto.  On your first question, I am very worried about Iran and what they are\ndoing and how that threatens Israel.  Obama wants to sit down with the\nleader of Iran without any pre-conditions.  I\'m not going to do that until\nthey stop killing our soldiers.  I won\'t do it.  I will do everything in my\npower to put sanctions on Iran to get them to stop.  But if the Iranians\nobtain nuclear weapons, there is going to be a huge problem.  We need to act\ntogether with all of our allies.  The United States of America can never\nallow a second Holocaust.\nFOLLOW-UP: As a Holocaust survivor, I thank you.\nMCCAIN: No, thank you.  I am very honored to be in your presence.\n\n8 Q) I\'ve always been a Democrat.  I\'ve lost all respect for Hillary and I\'m\nnot voting for Obama.  I\'m from a military family. my son is serving.  I\ntruly believe you are an American hero.  I want to know where you stand, on\nimmigration.  I\'m behind you on most things, but I don\'t know where you are\non that issue.  I see the people all around me losing their homes and at the\nsame time I see immigrants working.  And it\'s unfair and I think people\nshould be held accountable.\nMCCAIN: Thank you and your son for his service.  I\'d like to give my respect\nfor Hillary Clinton.  Twice now we have attempted comprehensive immigration\nreform.  It is a federal responsibility to secure our borders.  Americans\nwant our borders secure.  We can do that.  I come from a border state.  We\nalso have to have a temporary worker program that includes biometric\ndocumentation so we can track them.  I want to assure you that small\nbusiness people don\'t know if people\'s documentation is real or not.  We\'ve\ngot to address the issue of the 12 million illegal immigrants in this\ncountry.  Two million should be deported immediately because they\'ve\ncommitted crimes.  The rest of them we have to deal with humanely.  As soon\nas I\'m president, we\'ll begin work on this issue.\nFOLLOW-UP: We have allowed people who are not even citizens of this country\nto rally and protest.  It just does not sit right with me.  I see protesting\nall the time and these immigrants.\nMCCAIN: I know -- I see them at my events all the time -- the anti-war\nprotesters I mean.\nFOLLOW-UP: I\'m a true American coming from a military family.  We can\'t\nevent pledge of allegiance in our schools.  Americans need to stand up for\nthe true Americans.\nMCCAIN: I apologize, the federal government has failed you.\n\n*Conclusion*\nThank you for being here.  Michigan is a battleground state and will be\nimportant in determining who is the next president of the United States.  I\nknow you are hurting and I will fix that.  When I was a prisoner of war, I\nwas given the opportunity to go home early.  But I didn\'t accept.  I put my\ncountry first.  And though we may disagree from time to time, I promise you,\nI will always put my country first.\n\n-- \nCammie L.
