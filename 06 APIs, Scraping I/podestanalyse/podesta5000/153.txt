Please contact the Bookstore Course Materials Manager, Paul Concannon, at 0877txt@fheg.follett.com<mailto:0877txt@fheg.follett.com> or at (202) 662-9628<tel:%28202%29%20662-9628> as soon as possible if you are ordering textbooks.  He will need to place a rush order to get the books in time for the start of school.\n\n\n\nIf you are not ordering a required or recommended textbook for the spring, would you please send a quick email confirming your decision to me and Paul so that we can cross your course off the "missing adoptions" list?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nDominique\n\n\nDominique Brown Parker \x81Associate Director, J.D.
