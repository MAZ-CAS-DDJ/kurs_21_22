She spent 3 months in the hospital in recovery, many more months in physical therapy and has had nearly three dozen surgeries.\n\nIn court, we were able to obtain a life sentence for the criminal so he cannot harm any one else every again. But that wasn't going to put Yvette's life back together again.\n\nFor survivors and their families, the bruises and scars may heal, but they carry that burden for life. With Yvette's scars, she chose to do something very positive and speak out and share her story to bring awareness to the epidemic of domestic violence in this country. She has transformed countless lives by traveling across the country to share her story, which is why I'm sharing it with you today.\n\nHer ex-husband exhibited some of the forms domestic violence can take: physical and verbal abuse, isolating her from family and friends, stalking and constantly checking up on her, he engaged in heavy substance abuse and was overly jealous.\n\nFor those who are in abusive relationships like this or at risk, don't wait until it's too late. Tell your family. Tell law enforcement, put together a safety plan and get out of that relationship. There are people who can help you, who care about you and love you. In case of an emergency, call 911. The domestic violence hotline in Anne Arundel County is 410-222-6800 or 301-731-1203 in Prince George's County. Otherwise, you can call the Maryland Network Against Domestic Violence at (301) 429-3601, or use their state-wide helpline at 800-634-3577.\xc2\xa0\n\nI encourage you to share Yvette's story with others and to raise awareness about domestic violence in our communities. Help us educate young men that they can be part of the solution. Help us educate young women that they have options and are not alone.\n\nTo read Yvette's story in her own words, follow the link here at www.iveyforcongress.com/yvettesstory.\n\nLet's work to together in the fight against domestic violence,\n\nGlenn\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n|    Paid for by Glenn Ivey for Congress    |\n---------------------------------------------\n\nGlenn Ivey for Congress\n410 1st Street, SE\nSuite 310\nWashington DC 20003 United States\n\nIf you believe you received this message in error or wish to no longer receive email from us, please http://iveyforcongress.ngpvanhost.com/unsubscribe?mmid=-5769700934254458880&tiid=-2165252255035029504."
