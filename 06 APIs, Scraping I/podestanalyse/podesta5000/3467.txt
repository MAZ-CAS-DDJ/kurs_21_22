Grimaldi and Rebecca Ballhaus\nFeb. 17, 2015 8:30 p.m. ET\n\nThe Clinton Foundation has dropped its self-imposed ban on collecting funds\nfrom foreign governments and is winning contributions at an accelerating\nrate, raising ethical questions as Hillary Clinton\n<http://topics.wsj.com/person/C/Hillary-Clinton/6344>ramps up her expected\nbid for the presidency.\n\nRecent donors include the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman,\nAustralia, Germany and a Canadian government agency promoting the Keystone\nXL pipeline.\n\nIn 2009, the Clinton Foundation stopped raising money from foreign\ngovernments after Mrs. Clinton became secretary of state. Former President\nBill Clinton, who ran the foundation while his wife was at the State\nDepartment, agreed to the gift ban at the behest of the Obama\nadministration, which worried about a secretary of state\xe2\x80\x99s husband raising\nmillions while she represented U.S. interests abroad.\n\nThe ban wasn\xe2\x80\x99t absolute; some foreign government donations were permitted\nfor ongoing programs approved by State Department ethics officials.\n\nThe donations come as Mrs. Clinton prepares for an expected run for the\nDemocratic nomination for president, and they raise many of the same\nethical quandaries. Since leaving the State Department in early 2013, Mrs.\nClinton officially joined the foundation, which changed its name to the\nBill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, and has become a prodigious\nfundraiser as the foundation launched a $250 million endowment campaign,\nofficials said.\n\nA representative for Hillary Clinton referred all questions to the Clinton\nFoundation.\n\nA spokesman for the Clinton Foundation said the charity has a need to raise\nmoney for its many projects, which aim to do such things as improve\neducation, health care and the environment around the world. He also said\nthat donors go through a vigorous vetting process.\n\nOne of the 2014 donations comes from a Canadian agency promoting the\nproposed Keystone pipeline, which is favored by Republicans and under\nreview by the Obama administration. The Foreign Affairs, Trade and\nDevelopment agency of Canada, a first-time donor, gave between $250,000 and\n$500,000. The donations, which are disclosed voluntarily by the foundation,\nare given only in ranges.\n\nOne of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s priorities for 2014-2015 was to promote Keystone XL \xe2\x80\x9cas\na stable and secure source of energy and energy technology,\xe2\x80\x9d according to\nthe agency\xe2\x80\x99s website. Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s State Department was involved in\napproving the U.S. government\xe2\x80\x99s initial environmental-impact statement.\nSince leaving State, Mrs. Clinton has repeatedly declined to comment on\nKeystone.\n\nThe Canadian donation originated from an agency office separate from the\none that advocates for Keystone XL, a Foundation spokesman said.\n\nKirk Hanson, director of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa\nClara University in California, said the Clintons should immediately\nreimpose the ban, for the same reasons it was in place while Mrs. Clinton\nled U.S. foreign policy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that she is gearing up to run for president, the same potential exists\nfor foreign governments to curry favor with her as a potential president of\nthe United States,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nIf she becomes president and deals with these nations, \xe2\x80\x9cshe can\xe2\x80\x99t recuse\nherself,\xe2\x80\x9d added James Thurber, director of American University\xe2\x80\x99s Center for\nCongressional and Presidential Studies. \xe2\x80\x9cWhether it influences her decision\nmaking is questionable, but it is a legitimate thing to focus on by her\npolitical opposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe donations weren\xe2\x80\x99t announced by the foundation and were discovered by\nThe Wall Street Journal during a search of donations of more than $50,000\nposted on the foundation\xe2\x80\x99s online database. Exactly when the website was\nupdated isn\xe2\x80\x99t clear. The foundation typically updates its website with the\nprevious year\xe2\x80\x99s donations near the beginning of the year. All 2014\ndonations were noted with asterisks.\n\nAt least four foreign countries gave to the foundation in 2013\xe2\x80\x94Norway,\nItaly, Australia and the Netherlands\xe2\x80\x94a fact that has garnered little\nattention. The number of governments contributing in 2014 appears to have\ndoubled from the previous year. Since its founding, the foundation has\nraised at least $48 million from overseas governments, according to a\nJournal tally.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates, a first-time donor, gave between $1 million and $5\nmillion in 2014, and the German government\xe2\x80\x94which also hadn\xe2\x80\x99t previously\ngiven\xe2\x80\x94contributed between $100,000 and $250,000.\n\nA previous donor, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has given between $10\nmillion and $25 million since the foundation was created in 1999. Part of\nthat came in 2014, although the database doesn\xe2\x80\x99t specify how much.\n\nThe Australian government has given between $5 million and $10 million, at\nleast part of which came in 2014. It also gave in 2013, when its donations\nfell in the same range.\n\nQatar\xe2\x80\x99s government committee preparing for the 2022 soccer World Cup gave\nbetween $250,000 and $500,000 in 2014. Qatar\xe2\x80\x99s government had previously\ndonated between $1 million and $5 million.\n\nOman, which had made a donation previously, gave an undisclosed amount in\n2014. Over time, Oman has given the foundation between $1 million and $5\nmillion. Prior to last year, its donations fell in the same range.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation has set a goal of creating a $250 million endowment,\nan official said. One purpose was secure the future of the foundation\xe2\x80\x99s\nprograms without having to rely so much on the former president\xe2\x80\x99s personal\nfundraising efforts, the official said.\n\nThe Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Oman donations went to the\nendowment drive.\n\n*Write to *James V.

The increase\nshows up on last year's disclosure for a number of reasons, some of it\nrelated to ongoing programs, some because there was an uptick in foreign\nmoney after she left State and the MOU no longer applied.\n\n Craig and his team have been working with them all day to separate fact\nfrom fiction where they can, and have given them a strong statement about\ndonors\xe2\x80\x99 contributions to the Foundation being a result of the good work it\ndoes, but wanted everyone to have a heads up.\n\n Nick\n"
