We missed you on the January trip and I trust you received the trip report and heard from others about it.\n\n\n\nI'm writing to see if there's any chance for you to meet with Tawfic Khoury & Nick Papandreou March 4, 5 or 6, even for 15 minutes or so.  As you know, Tawfic hosted our delegation for dinner in Dubai and we've continued to cultivate that relationship after your initial discussions.  I'm tentatively planning a dinner on Tuesday, March 4 if you get a free chance for a bite to eat outside  of the office, but I know they would value any time, even a few minutes.\n\n\n\nThe rest of our work is going well - we're all excited about Vikram.  I have a new piece on progressive foreign policy coming out in Democracy next month.\n\n\n\nOur field research on the Islamist project is just about done and we have really fascinating reports on Egypt & Tunisia coming out with another on Syria later this spring.  Plus the Christians in the Middle East conference at Villanova at the end of March is coming together nicely.\n\n\n\nWe miss you and hope you're doing well.\n\nBrian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
