It's a day to put aside politics and differences, and come together to remember those who gave their lives for all of us. But, there's even more to honor today \xe2\x80\x93 those families of the fallen, those who are still sacrificing today, and what a great nation we are that so many give so much for her defense.  I penned a personal piece at the Huffington Post about this day, which I would like to share with you. Please take a moment to read it, and share it with others. \n\n *You can read my piece, here.* [ http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ashwin-madia/reflections-on-memorial-d_b_867990.html ] \n\n\n Thanks for all of your support for America's troops and veterans.  \n\nSincerely, Ashwin Madia\nIraq War Veteran\nInterim Chairman, VoteVets.org  \n\n\n\nPaid for by VoteVets.org Action Fund \n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n\nVoteVets.org \n\n [ http://www.facebook.com/pages/VoteVetsorg/8501031021 ]  [ http://www.twitter.com/votevets ]  [ http://www.youtube.com/votevets ] \n\nYou are subscribed to this list as john.podesta@gmail.com.
