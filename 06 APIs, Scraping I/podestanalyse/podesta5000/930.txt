john.podesta@gmail.comb'I was just talking to Simas (who is putting together a memo for H on 2014\ntake-aways) and he has some really interesting stats that really illustrate\nhow completely different 2014 will be from 2016 (and how dangerous it is to\nread too much into an off year).  All of this will be in his memo:\n\n--In 2009 or 2010, the GOP won a Senate or Gov race in 10 of the 11 2012\nbattleground states.  Obama won 9 of those 11 states in 2012.\n--Of the 3 Senate classes, the one up this year is by far the worst for\nDems.  Obama got 47% of the popular vote in the 34 combined states and lost\n19 of them (56%).  Another way of putting it--of the 24 states Obama lost\nin 2012, 19 are up this year.\n'
