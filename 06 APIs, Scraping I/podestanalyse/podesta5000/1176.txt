John, it was great to see you on Friday - hope you had a good picture!\n\nWe\'re carrying the name and legacy of the Camp David\'s Counselors.  We have two races coming up, the ACLI one on Sunday, May 20, and the Capitol Hill Classic on Sunday, May 17.   Maybe we\'ll see you out there.  John, you need to defend your crown for the Classic!\n\n-Velz\n_____________________________________________\nFrom: Velz, Peter\nSent: Tuesday, March 24, 2015 10:43 AM\nTo: Shelanski, Howard; Lee, Jonathan; Wang, Jenny; Brundage, Amy; Leonard, Clarissa; Kirchhoff1, Christopher M.; Price, Ryan; Allen, Jessica; Stephens, Jeff; Quillian, Natalie\nSubject: RE: Updated ACLI race results\n\n\nHello ACLI race alumni -\n\nI\'ll be creating another team for this year\'s race, which is May 20 and can organize vans and all that.  In consultation with Jenny, we\'re thinking Denis is our team captain since we\'re down our intrepid counselor.  We might as well use last year\'s name "Camp David\'s Counselors."  Teams are capped at five, we need one woman per team, and based on interest and paces, I\'ll divvy people up.  Entry fee is $105, so $21 split per person.\n\nAnd a reminder if you\'re interested in the NCB Capitol Hill Classic 10K, which is 10K: $38 until Friday, May 15th.  You can register here: http://www.capitolhillclassic.com/registration/.  Our team name is also Camp David\'s Counselors.\n\nThanks!\nPeter\n\n_____________________________________________\nFrom: Podesta, John\nSent: Thursday, May 22, 2014 6:23 PM\nTo: Shelanski, Howard; Friedman, John; Lee, Jonathan; DMCOS; Owens, Maurice M.; Quillian, Natalie; Wang, Jenny; Velz, Peter; Brundage, Amy; Leonard, Clarissa; Kirchhoff, Christopher; Price, Ryan; Allen, Jessica; Elhassani, Layth; Stephens, Jeff; randy.maloney@usss.dhs.gov<mailto:randy.maloney@usss.dhs.gov>\nSubject: RE: Updated ACLI race results\n\n\nLooking good.
