john.podesta@gmail.comb'===============================\nLeague of Conservation Voters\nhttp://action.lcv.org/ct/r7zLkNK1zzDK/\n===============================\n\nDear John, \n\nOver the last three months, ExxonMobil brought in $11.7 billion\nin profits - the largest quarterly profit reported by any U.S.\ncorporation, ever.\n\nAll the while, you paid $4 a gallon to fill your car\'s tank -\nand your tax dollars went to fund billions in subsidies for Big\nOil.\n\nAnd now, Big Oil\'s cronies in Congress are pushing for even more\ndrilling. But more drilling won\'t do a thing to lower gas prices\n- it would only increase Big Oil\'s record-breaking profits.\n\nAmerican families have been lining the pockets of Big Oil for\nfar too long. It\'s time for change. That\'s why the League of\nConservation Voters is standing with families and against Big\nOil in the fight of a generation.\n\nClick below to make a contribution and help us fight reckless\nplans to increase drilling.\n\nhttps://secure.ga4.org/01/augdrilling_c4/nC1zLkNKq4tDK?\n\nDrilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, in the Arctic National\nWildlife Refuge, and in other pristine places would do\nirreversible damage to the environment, while doing absolutely\nnothing - nothing - to bring down today\'s gas prices.\n\nWhatever few drops Big Oil can extract will take almost a decade\nto come to market. The answer to high gas prices today is to\ninvest in a greener future - cleaner cars, greater efficiency,\nand more renewable energy sources that give consumers a real\nchoice.\n\nBut Big Oil\'s lobbyists in Washington are working overtime to\nblock these critical steps toward real energy independence and\nlower gas prices. To them, it\'s nothing but, "drill, drill,\ndrill," and "profit, profit, profit."\n\nWith your support, LCV will be able to:\n\n * Generate phone calls to key Congressional offices, urging\nthem to support clean energy solutions, instead of the failed\npolicies of the past;\n * Organize press events and submit letters to the editor in\norder to bring attention to the real solutions to our energy\ncrisis; and\n * Run newspaper and TV ads in important Congressional\ndistricts.\n\nYour gift to LCV now will help us fight the pro-drilling lobby,\nstop Big Oil\'s land grab, and elect pro-environment candidates\nin November.\n\nhttps://secure.ga4.org/01/augdrilling_c4/nC1zLkNKq4tDK?\n\nBig Oil is spending $53 million in advertising to make their\ncase for drilling. We need every friend to step up if we\'re\ngoing to win this battle.\n\nThanks so much for your support.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGene Karpinski\nPresident\nLeague of Conservation Voters\n\n*******************************\n\nTell A Friend!\nTell your friends to sign up for LCV updates today.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/lcv/join-forward.html?domain=lcvorg&r=C1zLkNKq4tDK&\n\nSign up for LCV Updates\nIf you received this message from a friend, you can sign up for\nLeague of Conservation Voters updates.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/lcv/join.html?r=C1zLkNKq4tDKE&\n\nQuestions?\nIf you have any questions about this message or any other League\nof Conservation Voters issue, please click here or call\n202-785-8683.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/ct/rdzLkNK1zzDD/\n\nPolicy\nYou, or someone on your behalf, has subscribed to receive this\ninformation from the League of Conservation Voters.
