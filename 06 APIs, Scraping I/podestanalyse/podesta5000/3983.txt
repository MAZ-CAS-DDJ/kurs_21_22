john.podesta@gmail.comb'Happy 33rd Anniversary in Washington, John McCain\n\nJohn, John McCain is celebrating a big anniversary: His 33rd year in Washington, D.C. \n\nThat\'s a long time to be in Washington, far removed from the needs of Arizona families. We\'re putting together an anniversary card to mark the occasion. Can you add your name to congratulate John McCain on his 33rd anniversary in Washington?\n\nDuring his time in Congress, Mr. McCain has compiled a pretty impressive track record (though it\'s not the kind of "impressive" that Arizona families really need):\n \nMcCain lined his coffers with millions of dollars from special interests. His top three lifetime "contributors" are from Wall Street. \nMcCain has an absentee rate nearly six times higher than the average senator. He\'s missed hundreds of votes, including skipping a defense authorization vote for "Saturday Night Live" rehearsals. That\'s comedy we don\'t find funny.\nMissing votes? No problem. Missing a Sunday talk show appearance? NEVER! McCain appeared on talk shows 88 times in the past few years. \n\nAs a member of Team Kirkpatrick, you know that these values don\'t represent Arizona. Help us send a message by signing his anniversary card.\n\nAnd of course, who could forget McCain\'s "maverick" positions over the years:\n\nMcCain fought against closing the Terror Gap to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns. \nMcCain said that some U.S jobs "shouldn\'t be protected."\nMcCain backed a no-strings-attached bailout for some of the biggest banks on the planet. \n\nEveryone here at Team Kirkpatrick congratulates John McCain on spending the past 33 years becoming the very best Washington insider he could be. Join us and add your name to the anniversary card today. \n\nWith your support, we can make sure that this is John McCain\'s last anniversary in Washington.\n\nThanks,\nTeam Kirkpatrick----\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.\n\nTo unsubscribe, go to: \nhttp://kirkpatrickforsenate.com/subscriptions\n\n\nPaid for by Kirkpatrick for Senate\n\n'
