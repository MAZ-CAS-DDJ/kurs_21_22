Well, the Obama campaign now firing\nback. They parodied, Mr. McCain in the new ad called "Embrace", which has\nbeen embargoed until right now. Here it is in its entirety.\n\n["Embrace" ad shown]\n\n[\x85]\n\nGRETCH CARLSON: My first impression is, actually, that\'s a really upbeat ad\nfor John McCain! I mean, he looks like he has a whole lot of energy and he\'s\nmeeting with all these different people. That\'s just my guy, initial\nreaction. Also, I think the timing is a little off, because this should have\ncome out immediately after the celebrity ad. This is a little delayed.\n\nBRIAN KILMEADE: *It\'s two things. They want to show him with President Bush,\nthat\'s what they feel is going to be successful, all the experts come on and\nsay if I was running against John McCain I would put him with President\nBush.* But the other thing is, that\'s inaccurate, is that it was Barack\nObama who voted for the President\'s energy plan which included tax breaks\nfor the oil companies. It was John McCain that said that this was a party\nfor the oil companies, therefore I\'m not going to vote for it, which got\nRepublicans very mad at John McCain.\n\nDOOCY: I also think it\'s funny that, where it says "John McCain taking the\nlow road", this is an attack ad from Barack Obama. Hello? And Gretchen I\'m\nexactly with you in that it shows John McCain, *you know they\'ve been very\neffective the Barack Obama people, have you noticed that every time they\nhave done an ad in the past they talk about "same old tired politics"\nthey\'re trying to brand in our heads that he is old, and tired, and stuff\nlike that. [\x85]*\n\nKILMEADE: But Barack Obama is right, *John McCain is the darling of the late\nnight shows. He\'s a darling of the talk shows, he\'s probably the number one\nperson that every Republican wants by their side to raise money up until\nthis presidential race. So there, Barack Obama is right, I don\'t know if he\ngot that message across here.*\n\n\n*McCain\'s Celebrity Ad Versus Obama\'s Embrace Ad* (FNC 08/11/08 7:26am)\n[\x85]\n\nJAMAL SIMMONS: John McCain may have a lot of energy, but it looks like where\nhe\'s headed with the country though, is in a pretty bad place. And Americans\nseem to have recognized that. You look to the polls, as you just showed, it\nlooks like John McCain can\'t really get above 42, 43 percent in any of these\npolls, and he\'s one of the people that Americans have known now for ten\nyears. I mean from his 2000 campaign, he\'s a pretty popular guy. *The\nproblem is the John McCain of 2000 wouldn\'t go anywhere near voting for the\nJohn McCain of 2008, cause he\'s sort of sold out all of his positions that\nhe took back in 2000.*\n\n[\x85]\n\nSTEVE DOOCY: I\'m talking about your candidate, how McCain was effective in\ntying Paris Hilton to Barack Obama, and Britney Spears.\n\nSIMMONS: Yeah, I don\'t think it was very effective. *I think that in fact,\nif it was effective at all, it was effective at erasing the maverick label\nfrom John McCain because one thing, I think, republican voters chose John\nMcCain because they thought they were getting an adult who was going to talk\nabout the real issues that we have, the real problems with gas prices, war\nin Iraq, and the economy. People have lost 51,000 jobs in the last month,\nand instead they\'ve got John McCain talking about Paris Hilton. And frankly,\nit just wasn\'t very serious.*\n\nDOOCY: In that same ad, you mentioned gas prices, John McCain is for\noffshore drilling, Barack Obama is not. And that is part of the real message\nof that ad, Paris Hilton/Britney Spears ad.\n\nSIMMONS: *Well you know, we\'ve come to find out that John McCain is sort of\nin the pocket of the oil company. He\'s gotten about two million dollars in\noil contributions.* The democrats have an Exxon/McCain website that we\'ve\njust put up. And I think people realize that, you know, we do want to get\ngas prices down and Barack Obama has a pretty good plan to do it. He wants\nto make sure the oil companies go after oil and the leases they already\nhave. They have millions of acres they could be going after oil in right\nnow, and if the part of the deal to get a comprehensive strategy long term\nto get rid of oil is to have offshore drilling, then Obama\'s open to talking\nabout the offshore drilling. He just doesn\'t think it\'s going to be that\neffective. But let\'s go ahead and do it, he\'s not going to stand in the way\nof getting a real comprehensive deal just because he doesn\'t agree with one\nof the republican ideas.\n\n[\x85]\n\nSIMMONS: [\x85] John McCain\'s plan is to tax American healthcare benefits from\ntheir employers for the first time in history, so if you take a look at\nwhere Barack Obama is and where John McCain is and I think people have\nreally realized that Barack Obama is the one they like.\n\n\n*Tucker Bounds Talks McCain\'s Reform Ability and Maverick Status in Face of\nNew Ads* (FNC 08/11/08 7:34am)\nGRETCHEN CARLSON: How do you feel about the ad that was just sent at your\nman, Senator John McCain? You\'ve must have seen it, moments ago.  [\x85]\n\nTUCKER BOUNDS: It\'s quirky. It doesn\'t fit. It\'s a response to our ad about\nBarack Obama\'s celebrity and I think that the reason why our ad was able to\nbe effective is because Barack Obama was over in Germany, talking to throngs\nof fonding Germans and they\'re fans, they\'re not voters. He\'s shown an\ninability to close down some of those primary states despite having these\nenormous rallies during his primary. *And the difference is John McCain has\na record of being able to reform government, it\'s been since 2004 that he\nactually took on the Abranoff scandal, inside Washington he\'s been beating\ndown doors and changing the way business is done here.* And so, it\'s an ad,\nit\'s quirky, it\'s a response. But I don\'t think it really fits John McCain,\nhis record, or who he is.\n\nSTEVE DOOCY: [\x85] He said that celebrity ad was not effective, but we\'ve seen\nsome of the pollsters say that in talking to voters,  potential voters over\nthe last week or two, it was effective, your ad in tying Barack Obama to\nBritney Spears and Paris Hilton and stuff like that. But when you\'re\nwatching this new ad, if you were watching with the sound down  it would\nlook like John McCain goes to a lot of fun places.\n\nBOUNDS: Yeah, well, he goes to talk directly to voters, he\'s an energetic\nguy, I think that came through even in a negative attack ad [\x85]. It really\nis hard to dampen down John McCain\'s energy, I think that came through in\ntheir ad, but ultimately it just doesn\'t fit the candidate. I mean, this is\nthe same John McCain that was riding around the back of the bus talking to\nanyone he could talk to to try to win the New Hampshire primary, he had no\nmoney, he was traveling around with just a couple people, and it doesn\'t\nreally have any sort of basis in the historical relevance of this race or of\nthe candidate.\n\n[\x85]\n\nBOUNDS: We don\'t have to, I don\'t think, delve into the Mark Penn playbook,\nthat was a different campaign for a different candidate. *We have the luxury\nof having a proven public servant, who has a history of working for change\nin this country, and reforming Washington. We\'re going to run on that.*\n\n\nHighlight #2\n*Huckabee On McCain\'s Relationship With Evangelical Voters* (FNC 08/11/08\n7:49am)\nBRIAN KILMEADE: Is Senator John McCain making some progress in the\nevangelical vote?\n\n*MIKE HUCKABEE: I think he\'s making some, I think there\'s ground yet to be\nmade.* I would also, maybe include the term "values voters" rather than\nevangelicals, because the larger interest here is not just evangelicals, it\nincludes Catholics, it includes people who may not be necessarily religious\nbut are very pro-life. And I think that one of the mistakes that some people\nmake is to assume that being pro-life means that you\'re anti-abortion. The\nreal focus is not what we\'re against, it\'s more about what we\'re for. And\nit\'s the idea that people have intrinsic worth and value and that there\'s a\nsense of respect for the dignity of every person.  And that\'s what\'s driving\na lot of passions right now. Obama is reaching out to this group, and he\'s\ndoing it with the view, I don\'t think he believes he\'s going to get the\nendorsement, but I think he wants to maybe tamp down the enthusiasm of\nopposition. And he\'s done a lot to reach out to that group.\n\n[\x85]\n\nGRETCHEN CARLSON: At the same time [\x85] some are fearing the left principles\nof Barack Obama and so some of the center and some of the right coalescing\nnow behind John McCain. You remember, of course, you remember more than\nanyone, that a lot of those people did not like John McCain. What\'s\nhappening there.\n\nHUCKABEE: [\x85] He also does not have the same adherence to the idea of\ntraditional marriage one man, one woman as John McCain does. And the\nscariest thing for many of the value voters comes down to the appointment of\njudges which could have a huge impact, not just for the next four to eight\nyears but for the next 50 years. *That\'s what is driving many conservatives\nto say look, McCain may not have been our first choice but he is the best\nchoice we have got.*\n[\x85]\n\n\nHighlight #3\n*Rick Davis Interview, Part I: Tries To Answer, If McCain Thinks This\nCountry Is Worse Off That It Was Four Year Ago, Then Who Exactly Is\nResponsible?* (FNC, 08/10/08 6:06pm)\n[\x85]\n\nWALLACE: But again, when you have a nonpartisan group saying that, in fact,\nfor the exact group that you\'re talking about, people making $37,000,\n$40,000 a year, that Obama would cut their taxes more than McCain...\n\nDAVIS: Then Obama should put that in an ad. We\'re going to talk about the\nthings Obama has said and done in the United States Senate and on the\ncampaign trail, and that includes his vote to increase taxes on people\nmaking $42,000 a year.\n\nWALLACE: You think that people should be held accountable...\n\nDAVIS: Absolutely.\n\nWALLACE: ... for what their votes are in the Senate.\n\nDAVIS: Look, politics isn\'t bean bag, Chris. And if he has a record, it\'s a\nvery short one, because he has very little experience as a legislator. But\nwe ought to look at the experience he has, and he is a tax increaser.\n\nWALLACE: All right. We\'re going to \x97 I\'m asking you that because we\'re going\nto come back on McCain votes as well. Let\'s take a look at another McCain\nad. Here it is.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Does Senator McCain really believe that, that this country is worse\noff than we were four years ago?\n\nDAVIS: Sure. All along the trail, John McCain campaigns around real people.\nHe goes to town halls and he hears what they have to say to him. You don\'t\nhave to be in very many town halls, Chris, to understand that people are\npinched by the increase in gas prices. They\'re losing jobs because of some\ndownturn in manufacturing. And the economy as a whole has been very hard on\nthe American family. That\'s what John McCain\'s referring to. He doesn\'t have\nto go very far every day to find those kinds of examples.\n\nWALLACE: Given that, I want you to respond to this clip from an Obama ad.\nTake a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: In fact, Mr. Davis, Senator McCain is understating it. Last year,\nhe voted to support Bush legislation 95 percent of the time. Given that, if\nthe country\'s worse off, isn\'t both the president and John McCain \x97 aren\'t\nthey both responsible?\n\nDAVIS: Well, look. If you want to talk about history, then you can make all\nthe cases you want to make...\n\nWALLACE: But you\'re talking about history. You talk about the last four\nyears.\n\nDAVIS: Exactly. And what I\'m talking about, though, right now is what the\nfuture holds and who\'s got a plan to cut taxes and get the economy moving\nagain, because growth is the only way we\'re going to improve people\'s\nsituation, whether it\'s in a family or small businesses. And so John\nMcCain\'s got a plan for growth. *Let me remind you, too, there\'s been never\na bigger maverick in this town than John McCain. I mean, we talk about how\nmany times you voted for Bush or against Bush. But you\'ve been in this town\na long time. Who was the biggest irritant to this administration for the\nlast 10 years or last eight years? John McCain. He sided with Democrats when\nhe thought they were doing the right thing for the country, and sided with\nthe Republicans when he thought they were doing the right thing for the\ncountry. So you can say all you want about the record, but who is the one\nproven commodity in this town who\'s willing to put his country first and\ntake strong positions, sometimes against the current administration or his\nown party, in order to do what\'s right?*\n\nWALLACE: But I\'ve got to come back at...\n\nDAVIS: And that\'s been McCain.\n\nWALLACE: But I\'ve got to come back at you. If you say the country is worse\noff than it was four years ago, clearly the president has got to bear some\nof the responsibility. And by his own record, by his own admission, John\nMcCain voted with the president last year 95 percent of the time.\n\n*DAVIS: Sure. But I mean, how many of these things actually had anything to\ndo with the current economic conditions or where we are in other places?\nLook, trade\'s a good example. John McCain\'s voted with George Bush for trade\nmany times in the past and will support trade in the future.* Democrats have\nopposed that. What\'s better for the economy, trade or no trade? It\'s very\nsimple. It doesn\'t mean everything George Bush has done in the economy has\nbeen bad. But look, everybody \x97 it\'s a pox on everyone\'s houses. Why do you\nthink the public has a low approval rating of the current administration and\nCongress? Because they figured out that no one person is responsible for\nwhat we\'re doing. They\'re all at fault. And you have the one guy who\'s been\nscreaming about spending by Congress and trying to get George Bush to veto\nsome of these measures. Who\'s the one guy who stood up in the middle of that\ncrowd and said we\'ve got to fix this problem? John McCain.\n\n\n*Rick Davis Interview, Part II: Answers Questions on DHL and Lobbyist\nConnections* (FNC 08/10/08 6:15pm)\nWALLACE: [\x85] why is John McCain inviting the vice president to the\nconvention?\n\nDAVIS: Because I think John McCain believes that the only way we\'re going to\nchange the culture of this town, the only way we\'re actually going to ever\nstart getting anything done, is if we stop putting our own self-interests\nahead. *You know, if he wanted to make a point and, you know, strike out at\nthis administration, it would have been very easy to do that. But he is not\nthat kind of candidate. He\'s the kind of man who says, "Look, we\'ve got to\nget everybody on board in order to get progress made in this country. I\'m\nnot going to, you know, take retaliation or retribution against anybody,\nwhether they\'re Democrats or Republicans."* If we are going to move forward,\nthis culture has to change. The only guy who\'s been able to do that in this\ntown for the last eight years is John McCain. Barack Obama has never sided\nagainst his party\'s interest on any important issue. He\'s never joined with\nRepublicans across the aisle like John McCain has with Democrats. We have an\nad out that shows a lot of Democrats, leaders in Congress, saying great\nthings about John McCain. Of course, that was before there was a political\ncampaign. *You\'ll never find John McCain changing his stripes just because\nof an election.*\n\n[\x85]\n\nWALLACE: Is there any chance that Senator McCain will pledge to serve only\none term as president and that there will be no politics in the White House?\n\nDAVIS: Well, first of all, if you know John McCain, you know there\'s not\ngoing to be much politics in the White House anyway. I mean, he doesn\'t\ngrade any of his decisions either as a senator or in the future as president\non what the political dynamic is. You look at his history, whether it\'s\ncampaign finance reform, or opposing this administration on detainee abuse\nand things like that, he does what he thinks is right for the country, and\nhe\'s going to do that throughout his career no matter what office he holds.\n\n[\x85]\n\nWALLACE: You\'re not ruling it out.\n\nDAVIS: I\'m not talking about it at all.\n\nWALLACE: Finally, the Obama camp, I don\'t have to tell you, is pounding you\nfor your work as a lobbyist. In 2003, you lobbied Congress, and Senator\nMcCain in his job as chairman of the Commerce Committee helped you to allow\nthe German-owned DHL buy Airborne Express. You made from this German-owned\ncompany about $600,000 in lobbying fees. The Democrats are making a big deal\nof the fact that DHL is now talking about taking 8,000 jobs out of the state\nof Ohio. Are you and Senator McCain going to do anything to try to prevent\nthat?\n\nDAVIS: Well, first of all, let me correct you. Senator McCain did not help\nme do anything. I represented Airborne, which was the incumbent in that\nlocation in Ohio, and they wanted to be bought by DHL. And there were people\nin Congress who didn\'t want to have that happen. John McCain has always\nbelieved that foreign investment in this sector is fine, and unless there\nwas something that was inappropriate about the deal it should go forward.\n\nWALLACE: Well, that\'s how he helped you, is to agree that...\n\nDAVIS: Well, but he didn\'t help me. He helped the people in Ohio, because\nthose jobs were probably going to be lost if they didn\'t get taken over\nbecause of the competitive nature of this business.\n\nWALLACE: But now DHL is talking about taking...\n\n*DAVIS: I haven\'t represented DHL or any of their entities since 2005 when I\ncompletely got out of the lobbying business. So what you have here \x97 and\nfrankly, a typical situation by the Obama campaign, to try and change the\ntopic.* John McCain has only the most, you know, kind things to say about\nthe people there. He just came from a town hall with the people affected\nthere. Barack Obama won\'t go there and hold a town hall, especially not now,\nbecause one of the women who voiced her concerns about this transaction is\nnow a star in the Obama radio ad that\'s up in that area, and she\'s asked\nthem to take it down because he is portraying her as against John McCain,.\nand she\'s not. In fact, she\'s had some very nice things about \x97 to say\nlately about the fact that John McCain came to town, listened to those\npeople, talked to them about the need to be able to find, you know, a way to\nkeep as many jobs there as you can. But most importantly, she\'s asked them\nto take that radio ad down, and they refused to do it.\n\n\n*Rick Davis Interview, Part III: Comments on McCain\'s Plan For Lost DHL Jobs\n* (FNC 08/10/08 6:20pm)\nWALLACE: Directly, can you, will you, or Senator McCain, try to do anything\nto get DHL not to take those 8,000 jobs away?\n\nDAVIS: Oh, sure. Senator McCain in the town hall with the people affected\nmost by this told them that he would do what he could do, look into the\ntransaction. By the way, this is a different transaction than had occurred\nalmost four years ago. So it has nothing to do with any of the things he\'d\never done before. And he didn\'t really have the level of detail he need and\nhe\'s going to look into it.\n[\x85]\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
