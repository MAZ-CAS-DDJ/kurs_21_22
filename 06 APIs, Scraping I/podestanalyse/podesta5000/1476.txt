In the affluent suburbs and well-heeled urban enclaves where this game is principally played, it is not about whether you go to an elite school. It\xe2\x80\x99s about which one you go to. \n\nThis system is exacerbating inequality, retarding social mobility, perpetuating privilege, and creating an elite that is isolated from the society it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to lead. \n\nOur latest cover story, by William Deresiewicz, highlights the need for our education system to mitigate the class system, not reproduce it.\n\nSubscribe to The New Republic to read the issue instantly on your iPad. <http://link.newrepublic.com/5343ea4df9c510f432d4912c1or65.14mq/U8gg7-YQW_ZjUC4wKabe1> \n\nPlus, you'll save 82% off the cover price and get a full year of the printed magazine and unlimited web access.
