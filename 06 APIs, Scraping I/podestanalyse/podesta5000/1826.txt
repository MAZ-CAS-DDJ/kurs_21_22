john.podesta@gmail.comb'John --\n\nOn Wednesday President Obama nominated Judge Merrick\nGarland, a highly qualified, dedicated public servant, for\nthe Supreme Court.\n\nAnd as expected, Republicans on the Judiciary Committee\ndoubled down on their pledge to refuse to do their jobs and\ngive the President\'s nominee a fair hearing.\n\nTheir pledge is based on nothing but partisan politics. Some\nof these same senators have praised Judge Garland in the\npast. Some even voted to put him in his current seat as a\nfederal appeals court judge.\n\nFor example, in 2010, Senator Orrin Hatch described Judge\nGarland as a "consensus nominee," and that there was "no\nquestion" that he would win Senate confirmation with\nbipartisan support.\n\nThe American people deserve better than this kind of\nobstruction from our leaders. Our Supreme Court should never\nbe subjected to the day-to-day partisan politics of\nWashington, and it\'s up to us to demand better.\n\nJoin the thousands of OFA supporters who are speaking up to\ncall for a fair, timely hearing for Judge Merrick Garland:\n\nhttps://my.barackobama.com/A-Fair-Hearing-For-Judge-Merrick-Garland\n\nThis is the same kind of obstruction that\'s stood in the way\nof President Obama\'s legislative agenda his entire term in\noffice. It\'s the same obstruction that shut down the\ngovernment and threatened to default on our nation\'s credit.\nAnd it\'s the same obstruction that has repeatedly questioned\nthe President\'s legitimacy.\n\nIf these Senate leaders are successful, they may permanently\ndamage the Supreme Court nomination process.\n\nIn the first 24 hours since the President announced Judge\nGarland\'s nomination, over 100,000 people spoke up with OFA\nand called for a fair hearing. They spoke up because our\nSupreme Court is important -- they rule on the issues OFA\nsupporters care about, rulings that could impact our country\nfor generations.\n\nMake sure your voice is heard:\n\nhttps://my.barackobama.com/A-Fair-Hearing-For-Judge-Merrick-Garland\n\nThanks,\n\nJack\n\nJack Shapiro\nDirector of Policy and Campaigns\nOrganizing for Action\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for Action\n\nContributions or gifts to Organizing for Action are not tax deductible.\n\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo update your address, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/change-address?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe from these messages, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscription\nOrganizing for Action, P.O.
