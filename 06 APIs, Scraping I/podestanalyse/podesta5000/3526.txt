john.podesta@gmail.comb'Here is the text of a note I sent to a very high level official of the Obama\nAdministration, which understates my views.  I would add that he could\nwell do to Hillary Clinton what he accomplished with Democrats losing\ncontrol of the House, the Senate, major governorships and state legislatures\non his watch.\n\nHere is my note to the high level official, and if I seem bitter and angry I \nam because more terror attacks on American soil are coming:\n\nTonight the president took up space in the Oval Office on national television\nto say nothing, praised himself for a job well done, promised to stay the course, vowed to do more of the same, was eloquent in saying we can win a war\nby bombing alone, subcontracted the prevention of any coming terror\nattacks on American soil to Middle East despots and Vladimir Putin, and\nto demonstrate the gravity of the situation about which he addressed the\nnation in the Oval Office, he then proceeded to the Kennedy Center Awards\nceremony for his most important business of the evening.\n\nThroughout the day his White House was putting out the word that the\npurpose of addressing the nation was to educate the American people who\ndo not understand what a great job Obama is doing against ISIS and in Syria,\nand to reassure the nation that the president is on top of events, and should\nnot be worried after Americans were attacked by terrorists again on his watch.\n\nPerhaps he should be president of the Kennedy Center?\n\nSent from my iPad\n\nSent from my iPad'
