john.podesta@gmail.comb"Team,\nThere will be two meetings wtih HRC on Tuesday--the first will be about\ndebate prep program and timeline and the second will be to discuss our\nlatest thinking on strategic imperatives and message (agenda below).\nJoel is going to send us a revised strategic imperatives document today to\ndiscuss on our call tomorrow morning.  This will also help with our media\nplanning, per Jim's comments yesterday.  Joel and Anzo--it would be helpful\nto have as much insight as possible from the IA and NH polls on\ndemographics and vulnerabilities to inform imperative(s) related to the\nprimary.  I assume these imperatives will evolve slightly after we have\nmore time with the data.\nAfter our discussion tomorrow morning, Joel is going to work with Jen and\nDan on a draft message document for HRC.  They're going to circulate for\ncomments, but for efficiency and sanity, we're going to want them to drive\nthis.\nLet me know if there are any questions or flags--otherwise, I'm looking\nforward to our discussion tomorrow and the meeting Tuesday!\n\n\nTUESDAY AGENDA\n1. Feedback on post-launch stump\n2. Discuss draft strategic imperatives and message docs\n"
