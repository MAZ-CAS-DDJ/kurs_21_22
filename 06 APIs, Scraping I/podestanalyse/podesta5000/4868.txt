Did you want to\nget together at Dulles to just get together or so we could pick-up\nMetaxia...did she want to come here on Saturday?  Depending upon the time,\nGlenn could pick-up Metaxia at Dulles.  He has plans until around 12:30.\n\nThe church service Sunday will be identical to your mother's...except I\nbelieve the service starts at 10:30 instead of 10:00.  We'll have lunch at\nour house after the service.\n\nTo get to the church...if you take Rt 7 into Winchester, take I-81 North to\nthe Rt 11-37 intersection - 1 exit north.  Turn left at the exit...move to\nthe right hand lane so you will be traveling on Rt 37.  Exit at Rt 50 East\nand travel toward Winchester.  The church will be on the lefthand side, a\ncouple of blocks past the hospital.\n\nLook forward to seeing you!  Patti  \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Tony Podesta [mailto:tpodesta@podesta.com] \nSent: Thursday, February 21, 2008 7:44 PM\nTo: paulecarres@comcast.net; asneathern@hotmail.com\nCc: larissalpcs@gmail.com\nSubject: What are plans for sunday\n\nWe are going to dulles sat am.
