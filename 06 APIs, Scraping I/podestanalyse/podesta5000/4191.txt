The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (ACES) passed\nthe House by a vote of 219-212.  This action signals that Americans want to\naddress the challenge of climate change by transforming our economy and\nrewarding investments in clean, smart energy production.   This bill will\ncreate jobs and allow us to reap the economic and environmental benefits of\na new energy economy.  We can now move forward with the transformation of\nour energy policies that will reduce global warming pollution and mitigate\nthe worst impacts of climate change.\n \nLast week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\'s (NOAA)\nreport on climate change impacts in the United States underscored that our\nclimate is already changing across the country-altering our water cycle,\nincreasing floods and droughts, and threatening the quality and quantity of\nour drinking water.  This damage could be compounded if our energy choices\ncontinue to draw significantly from our water sources, while polluting what\nremains.  \n \nPassage of this bill is a move in the right direction, but is not our\ndestination.  \n \nClean Water Action will continue to mobilize for an even stronger companion\nbill in the U.S. Senate, and will work with our allies to require more\nmeasures to reduce global warming and achieve the clean energy\ntransformation we need to boost our economy and to protect our water and\nother natural resources. \n \nClean Water Action believes the next steps on the path are clear: \n \n*        Create more clean energy jobs with stronger renewable energy and\nenergy efficiency provisions;\n*        Increase investments that help foster a fair and effective\ninternational agreement;\n*        Prepare for the impacts of climate change on natural resources and\nvulnerable communities, changes that can no longer be avoided;\n*        Provide strong, effective oversight by the US Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) to ensure the program meets its goals; \n*        Develop a requirement that global warming polluters pay for their\npollution, generating funds for initiatives that assist consumers and\nsupport efficiency, renewables and other clean energy programs;\n*        Halt all investment of limited public resources for energy sources\nthat continue to waste and pollute water resources - including coal and\nnuclear power.\n \n\nClean Water Action commends Representatives Waxman and Markey on their\nforesight and leadership on this issue, and hope that similar principals\nemerge in the Senate as our country gets down to the real work of developing\nsolutions to this great challenge.  We are at a crossroads in our history.\nPassing the American Clean Energy and Security Act provides the signpost we\nneed to continue in the right direction.\n\n \n\nClean Water Action is the nation\'s leading grassroots environmental campaign\norganization, with more than 1 million members nationwide.  For over thirty\nyears, Clean Water Action has been a leader in protecting America\'s waters,\nthe public health and empowering people to take charge of their\nenvironmental future. www.cleanwateraction.org\n<http://www.cleanwateraction.org/> \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n****************************************\n\nElise Annunziata\n\nNational Deputy Political Director \n\nClean Water Action\n\nwww.cleanwateraction.org <http://www.cleanwateraction.org/> \n\n \n\n913 Elm St., Suite 506\n\nManchester,  NH  03101\n\n(603) 622-8151\n\n(603) 622-2661 Fax\n\n \n\n***************************************\nThis message (including any attachments) is intended only for the use of the\nperson(s) to whom it is addressed, and may contain information that is\nprivileged, confidential, and exempt from disclosure under applicable law.\nIf you receive this message in error, please notify me immediately by email,\ntelephone, or fax, and delete the original message from your records.
