Much appreciated!\r\n\r\nWe\'ve let her know this call is similar to the ones her dad has done and is meant as a quick update on policies and sort of a substantive briefing, since so much has changed in the last few weeks.\r\n\r\nShe has a modified version of the q&a which I worked on with Kristina C (so it\'s in her voice and substantively makes sense for her, as opposed to her mom).\r\n\r\nShe\'s pretty well read on the policies of course but because things have changed since Sanders has released his pay fors and health care plan - and the tone has changed - would be great to highlight for her where contrasts should be made and where we want to ease based on how things have changed.\r\n\r\nON that: her format is town hall style. She gets asked at every event "what\'s the difference between Sanders and your mom on XYZ" or "why should we vote for your mom over Sanders" and that\'s where she\'s made contrasts previously.  She will make contrasts when asked to do so, so suggesting staying in affirmative isn\'t going to work. That said, if there are good ones you want her to make, it\'d be great to communicate that here. If there are ones we are staying away from, it\'d be helpful to explain that as well (so long as the answer isn\'t that you don\'t want her to be substantive because she will be!)\r\n\r\nNotably, we don\'t want this call to be any kind of course correction or critical because really her q&a sessions are going great! But I do want to give her an opportunity to hear from you on where policy contrasts or distinctions are helpful as well as anything sensitive or big that\'s changed in the last few weeks since she started campaigning for her mom.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how WJC\'s have gone but doubt she\'ll pepper you with questions off the bat, so may be most helpful to run through the top policies you want to highlight in closing weeks.\r\n\r\nSorry for the long email! Let me know if you have any questions\r\n\r\nErika\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVC Prep Call\r\nScheduled: Friday, Jan 22, 2016 from 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM\r\nLocation: 1(718) 839-6957 // no pin\r\nInvitees: John Podesta\xe2\x80\x8c, slatham@hillaryclinton.com\xe2\x80\x8c, mfisher@hillaryclinton.com\xe2\x80\x8c, mharris@hillaryclinton.com\xe2\x80\x8c, erika@chelseaoffice.com\xe2\x80\x8c, awoolheater@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:awoolheater@hillaryclinton.com>\r\n'
