But if It happens on Sunday, news on\nMonday will be the interview anyway.  And I think most important\nconsideration is that she is prepped and confident and not sure that can\nhappen by Sunday.\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Aug 7, 2015, at 5:04 PM, Robby Mook <re47@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\nOne thought on her doing press on Sunday vs Monday: whether the press wants\nto cover it or not, we have pretty hefty policy to roll out on Monday, so\nif we get this out of the way Sunday, the policy gives us a nice way to\nmove forward.  We could even have her come out against Keystone on Monday\nas well (not sure where that stands), which will solicit criticism but that\nmight help distract from emails.  Kind of like bundling taxes, health, and\nemail last Friday.\nIn any case, I would vote for having her address this Sunday, so we can\nlegitimately claim she's trying to move on and address what voters care\nabout on Monday.\nJust a thought.\n\n\nOn Aug 7, 2015, at 4:58 PM, Kristina Schake <kschake@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nJust talked to Podesta - we are thinking we shouldn't put out the statement\nat this point because it is so late in day on a Friday the press is bound\nto respond negatively and it will defeat our purpose in framing this.\nThink we should send it out tomorrow morning.\n\nOn Fri, Aug 7, 2015 at 4:51 PM, Jennifer Palmieri <\njpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\n> Plus Kristina to this chain.\n>\n> Okay - Dan can you add the questions line on and send back to the plane so\n> we can get  her to sign off on it and out as soon as possible?\n>\n> Huma - what should we do about getting  options to her?
