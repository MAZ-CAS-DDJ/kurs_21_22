But that's just the beginning <http://www.ericgarcetti.com/veterans_day> when it comes to caring for our men and women in uniform. We must make sure those who served us in the armed forces are served by society when they leave the military and come home for good.\n\nAs a Councilmember and Navy reserve officer, I have focused on seeking ways we can better care for our veterans, from housing services to integrating social workers into job centers that serve veterans.\n\nRecently, I proposed creating a Veterans Coordinator in the City of Los Angeles. Los Angeles is home to hundreds of thousands of veterans. They have diverse needs and interact with a diverse array of federal, state and local agencies and service providers. Anyone would have trouble navigating their way through this red tape. For veterans struggling with homelessness, substance abuse, health issues or joblessness, it can be impossible.\xc2\xa0\n\n>From a practical standpoint, unless our cities become strategic in dealing with federal and state veterans agencies, we end up paying the full price in our neighborhoods and in our budgets.\n\nPlease join me <http://www.ericgarcetti.com/veterans_day> in encouraging the city to approve my Veterans Coordinator proposal. It's the right and prudent thing to do.
