Neera offered the\n> south side of the first floor, on H Street. We have enough space for\n> everyone on our team according to our 2014 budget plan. She\'ll charge us a\n> third of the build-out cost. This is a good option for us for right now.\n> However, in the current configuration, there isn\'t a spot for you near us,\n> which is a downside from our perspective.\n>\n>  Neera said we will need to choose between growing and staying within\n> CAP, if growing will require that we find space outside the building.\n> The three-year plan I sent you has plans for additional staff, but time\n> will tell whether we actually think growing is the right step, whether\n> space opens up in the building that would work, or if your return changes\n> her perspective. It\'s at least good to have clarity on CAP\'s thinking.\n>\n>  Best,\n> Heather\n>\n>   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n> Heather Boushey\n> Executive Director and Chief Economist\n> Washington Center for Equitable Growth\n> 1333 H Street, NW, 2nd Floor\n> Washington, DC 20005\n>\n>  hboushey@equitablegrowth.org\n> www.Equitablegrowth.org\n> Desk: (202) 741-6247\n> Twitter: @hboushey\n>\n'
