Updated attached.  A little shorter. And tightened that bite:\n\nSo I will fight for comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship for you and for families across our country.  I will fight to defend the executive actions that protect Dreamers from deportation.  And, if Congress refuses to act, as President I will do everything possible under the law to go even further.  Parents of Dreamers and others with deep ties and contributions to our communities deserve a chance to stay.  We can get this done.  We must get this done.\n\nOn Mon, May 4, 2015 at 9:55 PM, Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com<mailto:jbenenson@bsgco.com>> wrote:\nDan,\nSorry this is late but the \x93news\x94 part at the end about the people we\x92re addressing has to include their \x93service and contribution\x94 to the country, i.e. serve in the military, attending college etc \x96 otherwise there is no picture of who these folks are that actually make them \x93sympathetic,\x94 which is what we need to make this relevant and popular.\n\nJoel\n\nFrom: Dan Schwerin [mailto:dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com>]\nSent: Monday, May 04, 2015 7:11 PM\nTo: Joel Benenson; John Podesta; Kristina Schake; Mandy Grunwald; Robby Mook; Huma Abedin; Jennifer Palmieri; Jake Sullivan; Brian Fallon; John Anzalone; David Binder; Jim Margolis; Teddy Goff; Oren Shur; Tony Carrk\nCc: Marissa Astor\nSubject: Re: Immigration remarks\n\nHere's a revised topper for tomorrow.
