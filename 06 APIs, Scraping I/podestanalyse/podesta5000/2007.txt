And wondering where in the world the summer has gone....\n\n\nThis quick note is to make sure you've heard about conversations underway on whether/how to honor President Clinton as we celebrate this 20th anniversary on September 12th.  It is late in the game to focus on this, but I've talked with a few people about creating an annual WJC award for the best AmeriCorps Member of the Year.  Nominations would come through state commissions (broad involvement) and criteria would emphasize getting things done.  \n\n\nIt's a modest honor -- nothing as bold as naming the volunteer fund after President Bush.  But it is something where nothing exists now.  And if President Obama liked the idea, his announcing it would elevate its significance.\n\n\nDo you think this is worth pursuing?  If so, can you help?\n\n\nWarm regards,\nPhyllis\n"
