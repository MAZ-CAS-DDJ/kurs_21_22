john.podesta@gmail.comb'Trying not to brag about being so proud of our NM affiliate, but this\nreally is great work (and helps us elevate teh discussion and weave\nthe narrative more simply).\n\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\n\n\nOctober 18, 2012\n\nContact: Pat Davis, (505) 750-0012\n\n\n\n*STATEMENT OF PROGRESSNOW NM ON NEWS THAT CONGRESS EXPANDS VOTER\nSUPPRESSION INVESTIGATION INTO NEW MEXICO*\n\n\n\nAlbuquerque - ProgressNow New Mexico\'s Executive Director Pat Davis issues\nthis statement on the news that a Congressional committee has expanded its\ninvestigation into voter suppression into New Mexico after ProgressNow NM\nexposed improper training of poll challengers by a GOP official and\nimproper coordination between the party and non-profit True The Vote.\n\n"We thank Congressman Cummings for recognizing the important challenge\nefforts like those we exposed, and others exposed across the country, are\nhaving on our elections.  This is welcome news coming on the heels of\nAttorney General King\'s announcement of a similar investigation announced\nlast week.  Though Congressman Pearce has said he endorses these illegal\ntactics, we encourage the rest of our congressional delegation to stand up\nfor fair elections and support this important inquiry.  We also continue to\nimplore Governor Martinez, as our state\'s highest ranking elected\nRepublican, to repudiate these tactics and support these investigations,\nespecially now that voters have already begun voting."\n\n\n\nProgressNow New Mexico made national news when it released secretly\nrecorded video<http://www.progressnownm.org/blog/2012/10/gop-trains-poll-workers-to-suppress-votes.html>\nof\na Republican party official training poll challengers in illegal voter\nchallenge techniques.  The video has been viewed more than 50,000 times.\n Just days later, we returned to another training\nsession<http://www.progressnownm.org/blog/2012/10/update-true-the-vote-teams-up-with-gop-for-secret-training.html>\nand\nwere denied entry by True The Vote\'s state leader telling us, on tape, that\nthe training was only open to Republicans.  Non-profit organizations, like\nTrue The Vote, are not permitted to work on a partisan basis.\n\nWe contacted Cong. Cummings office and shared these videos after learning\nof his investigation.  Cummings specifically cites ProgressNowNM\'s work as\njustification for expanding the investigation.\n\nNew Mexico Attorney General Gary King announced an\ninvestigation<http://www.progressnownm.org/blog/2012/10/attorney-general-launches-voter-suppression-investigation-after-progressnownm-exposes-poll-worker-tr.html>\ninto\nvoter suppression in New Mexico after we released these videos.\n\nDespite these investigations, True The Vote released additional training\nvideos<http://www.progressnownm.org/blog/2012/10/true-the-vote-trains-voter-suppression-in-nm.html>\nthis\npast weekend. They continue to teach improper poll challenger tactics to\nparticipants.\n\nA copy of the Congressional News Release is included below.\n\n  *From:* Oversight Committee Democrats Press Office\n*Sent:* Thursday, October 18, 2012 12:13 PM\n*To:* Oversight Committee Democrats Press Office\n*Subject:* RELEASE: Cummings Ramps Up Investigation of Voter Suppression\nAllegations****\n\n** **\n\n[image: cid:image001.png@01CD6C08.8887ED00]****\n\n*FOR IMMEDIATE\nRELEASE\nCONTACT: Ashley Etienne*\n\n*October 18, 2012\n\n                                      (202) 226-5181*\n\n** **\n\n*Cummings Ramps Up Investigation of Voter Suppression Allegations*\n\n*Calls on True the Vote to Produce Documents on*\n\n*Plan to Challenge Voters on Election Day*\n\n** **\n\nWashington, DC (Oct. 18)\x97Today, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, Ranking Member of\nthe House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent a new\n*letter<http://democrats.oversight.house.gov/images/stories/2012-10-18.EEC_to_TTV.pdf>\n* to Catherine Engelbrecht, President and Founder of True the Vote,\nrequesting documents relating to the group\x92s plan to deploy hundreds of\nthousands of personnel across the country on Election Day to challenge\naccess to the polls for people they believe should not be allowed to vote.**\n**\n\n** **\n\n\x93There have been reports from multiple states during the past two years\nthat your organization is targeting predominantly minority communities and\ncoordinating with the Republican Party in an attempt to intimidate\nlegitimate voters,\x94 wrote Cummings.****\n\n** **\n\nCummings\x92 letter follows a *previous\nletter<http://democrats.oversight.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5791&Itemid=104>\n* on October 4, 2012, requesting documents relating to allegations that\nTrue the Vote and its affiliated organizations have been challenging the\nregistration of thousands of legitimate voters across the country based on\ninsufficient, inaccurate, and faulty evidence.  Cummings\x92 letter notes that\nTrue the Vote has declined to produce a single document.****\n\n** **\n\n\x93If you are truly committed to transparency in our nation\x92s voting\nprocess\x97and if you continue to deny that your organization is challenging\nthousands of legitimate voters across the country for partisan political\npurposes\x97then you should have no reason to withhold documents from Congress\nabout your activities,\x94 wrote Cummings.****\n\n** **\n\nCummings\x92 letter details new information raising questions about whether\nTrue the Vote is hiding its true agenda.  For example, after a\n*report<http://www.irehr.org/issue-areas/tea-party-nationalism/tea-party-news-and-analysis/item/436-abridging-the-vote>\n* was issued last week documenting how the group is deploying personnel in\npredominantly African American and Hispanic communities in North Carolina,\nTrue the Vote appears to have shut down access to its internal website\nabout where its personnel will be deployed on Election Day.****\n\n** **\n\nCummings\x92 letter also provides new information about voter suppression\nallegations in Texas in 2010.  Contrary to claims by True the Vote that\nthere were no instances of voter intimidation, Harris County Senior\nAssistant County Attorney Doug Ray reported to Cummings\x92 staff that \x93King\nStreet Patriots and True the Vote volunteers were *not* fully exonerated\nfor acts of intimidation while serving as poll watchers in 2010.\x94  ****\n\n** **\n\nRay said \x93there were in fact several incidents in which voters complained\nthat True the Vote volunteers were \x91hovering,\x92 and standing too close to\nvoters to allow them to cast a confidential ballot.\x94  When Ray visited True\nthe Vote\x92s offices in Harris County, he found maps on the wall with push\npins indicating that the polling places True the Vote was targeting were\nprimarily in minority precincts.****\n\n** **\n\nCummings\x92 letter also raises new questions about \x93mounting evidence\x94 that\nTrue the Vote is coordinating closely with Republicans.  It cites *financial\ncontributions<http://www.southernstudies.org/2012/10/nonpartisan-true-the-vote-gave-5000-to-republican-state-leadership-committee.html>\n* to the Republican State Leadership Committee, *admissions by\nEngelbrecht<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiUxV8TYkRk&feature=related>\n* that she is working to supply the Republican Party with volunteers, and\nreports that True the Vote officials in New Mexico are conducting *secret\nvoter training programs<http://www.progressnownm.org/blog/2012/10/update-true-the-vote-teams-up-with-gop-for-secret-training.html>\n* that exclude Democratic volunteers.****\n\n** **\n\nCummings asked Engelbrecht to provide documents by October 31, 2012,\nrelating to where True the Vote is targeting its personnel, voter roll\nlists that it plans to use to challenge voter eligibility, and materials\nthe organization uses to train its volunteers.****\n\n** **\n\n###****\n\n\n\n\n-- \nAniello Alioto\nNational Political Director\nAniello@ProgressNow.org\n502.664.2420\n\nCA: Courage Campaign\nCO: ProgressNow Colorado\nFL: Progress Florida\nGA: Better Georgia\nIA: Progress Iowa\nMA: ProgressMass\nMI: Progress Michigan\nMN: Alliance for a Better Minnesota (ABM)\nMO: Progress Missouri\nNC: Progress North Carolina\nNE: Bold Nebraska\nNH: Granite State Progress\nNM: Progress New Mexico\nNV: ProgressNow Nevada\nOH: ProgressOhio\nPA: Keystone Progress\nTX: Progress Texas\nUT: Alliance for a Better Utah\nVA: Progress Virginia\nWA: Fuse Washington\nWI: One Wisconsin Now (OWN)\n\nTwitter: @ProgressNow\nFacebook: ProgressNow\n\nwww.ProgressNow.org\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to dubois.sara@gmail.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
