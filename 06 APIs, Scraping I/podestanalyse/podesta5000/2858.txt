john.podesta@gmail.comb'*Gene Karpinski*\nPlease call when you can. (in your email)\nCell: (703) 568-4958\nWork (assistant Rachel): (202) 454-4591\n\n*NOTE: from Jared Mueller (Political) *\n"Tiernan from LCV called back to register that she, Gene and their lead\nboard members feel strongly that anything short of open press side-by-side\nremarks with HRC, LCV (and representatives of NRDC/EA as available) is\nunacceptable.\n\nI explained there is consensus on our side around the clutch/photo/topper\noption, and reiterated how compressed our schedule is over the next two\nweeks given the hearing. She took a polite but strong stance that this\nformat "would not work for them" and that they would not push NRDC to\nendorse more quickly unless there are dedicated open press endorsement\nremarks. She mentioned that Stephanie Cutter is consulting for them and is\nalso pushing them to hold out for an open press event.\n\nCan give more context any time (my cell is  <312.618.7224>312.618.7224\n<https://www.switch.co/launch?phone=3126187224>) but sounds like a\nJohn/Gene conversation may be the next step, or we go back to the drawing\nboard on the event structure or date."\n\n*Mary Pat Bonner*\nCan you give me a call today please?
