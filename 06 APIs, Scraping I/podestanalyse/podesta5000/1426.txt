When health care reform was on the ropes, I was at the forefront of the fight for the public option.  When BP tried to duck responsibility for the oil spill, I helped lead the effort to guarantee a thorough investigation to hold them accountable.  I\'m doing everything I can to repeal "Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell."\n\nBut taking on the usual right-wing bullies means they will surely come after me.  I need help from 500 donors before July 31 to make sure I can fight back.\n\nClick here to make a contribution today of $250, $500, or more to my campaign.  Even a small contribution from you helps show the extreme right wing that we\'ll never back down.

They don\'t have a real plan for getting Americans back to work and moving this country forward.\n\nTheir only response to any problem is to figure out what Democrats are for, and then rant and rave about repealing it.  That\'s not leadership.  That\'s just flat-out obstruction.\n\nSo instead of real ideas for creating jobs or finally doing something about climate change, we get the right-wing media running sideshow stories 24/7.  Their only interest is making Democrats look bad and scaring us into backing down from the values we hold dear.\n\nThey don\'t scare me, and I\'ll never give up our core principles.  I need your help before the end of the month to show them once and for all: we\'re sick of their scare tactics, and we\'re fighting back.\n\nClick here to make a contribution of $250, $500, or more to my campaign.

But the truth is that hearing the radical right say some nasty words about me is nothing compared to the struggles New Yorkers face every day trying to put food on the table and to give their kids a better life.\n\nThat\'s who I\'m fighting for.  I know I can count on you to stand with me every step of the way.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKirsten Gillibrand\n\n--\n\nPaid for by Gillibrand for Senate\n\nTo unsubscribe please click here\nhttp://www.democratsenators.org/o/44/unsubscribe.jsp?Email=john.podesta@gmail.com&email_blast_KEY=16551&organization_KEY=44'
