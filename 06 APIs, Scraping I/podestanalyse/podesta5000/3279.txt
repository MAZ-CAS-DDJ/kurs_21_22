Bush and a fellow at the conservative Hoover\nInstitute, to make the case that he has a bias against Mrs. Clinton.\n\nAnd the newly assembled Clinton campaign team is planning a full-court\npress to diminish the book as yet another conservative hit job.\n\nMr. Schweizer and a spokeswoman for HarperCollins, which is owned by News\nCorporation and is publishing the book, declined to comment.\n\nThe timing is problematic for Mrs. Clinton as she begins a campaign to\nposition herself as a \xe2\x80\x9cchampion for everyday Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>From 2001 to 2012, the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 income was at least $136.5 million, Mr.\nSchweizer writes, using a figure previously reported in The Washington\nPost. \xe2\x80\x9cDuring Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s years of public service, the Clintons have\nconducted or facilitated hundreds of large transactions\xe2\x80\x9d with foreign\ngovernments, he writes. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of these transactions have put millions in\ntheir own pockets.\xe2\x80\x9d\nContinue reading the main story\n\nThe Clinton Foundation has come under scrutiny for accepting foreign\ndonations while Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state. Last week, the\nfoundation revised its policy to allow donations from countries like\nGermany, Canada, the Netherlands and Britain but prohibit giving by other\nnations in the Middle East.\n\nMr. Schweizer\xe2\x80\x99s book will be released the same day former President Bill\nClinton\n<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/bill_clinton/index.html?inline=nyt-per>and\nthe Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 daughter, Chelsea, will host the Clinton Global Initiative\ngathering with donors in Morocco, the culmination of a foundation trip to\nseveral African nations. (A chapter in the book is titled \xe2\x80\x9cWarlord\nEconomics: The Clintons do Africa.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\nThere is a robust market for books critical of the Clintons. The thinly\nsourced \xe2\x80\x9cBlood Feud,\xe2\x80\x9d by Mr. Klein, at one point overtook Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nmemoir \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices\xe2\x80\x9d on the best-seller list.\n\nBut whether Mr. Schweizer\xe2\x80\x99s book can deliver the same sales is not clear.\n\nMr. Schweizer writes mainly in the voice of a neutral journalist and\nmeticulously documents his sources, including tax records and government\ndocuments, while leaving little doubt about his view of the Clintons.\n\nHis reporting largely focuses on payments made to Mr. Clinton for speeches,\nwhich increased while his wife served as secretary of state, writing that\n\xe2\x80\x9cof the 13 Clinton speeches that fetched $500,000 or more, only two\noccurred during the years his wife was not secretary of state.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn 2011, Mr. Clinton made $13.3 million in speaking fees for 54 speeches,\nthe majority of which were made overseas, the author writes. Among the\nconnections he tries to draw is a $750,000 speaking fee to Mr. Clinton by\nthe Swedish telecom company Ericsson and a State Department list of new\nsanctions on Iran that did not include telecom.\n\nMr. Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute, is the\nauthor of the 2013 book \xe2\x80\x9cExtortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy\nVotes, and Line Their Own Pockets,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThrow Them All Out\xe2\x80\x9d about elected\nofficials receiving insider stock tips.\n\n-- \nJosh Schwerin\nSpokesperson\nHillary for America\n@Josh Schwerin\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "HRCRapid" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n'
