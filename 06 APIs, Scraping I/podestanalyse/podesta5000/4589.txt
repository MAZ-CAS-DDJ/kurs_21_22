I do, however, think this article is significantly overstated.  It is the product of Ann Ravel\x92s endless desire to be portrayed in the press as a profile in courage.  A few observations:\n\n1.  Earlier this year the Dept. of Justice brought a criminal case against a campaign manager for violating the coordination rules.  And, even more recently, DOJ indicted Sen. Menendez based, in part, on contributions to a superpac that they believe were bribes.  There is every reason to think DOJ will increasingly police the campaign finance laws.\n\n2.  The statute of limitation is 5 years and the composition of the FEC will change in the next two years due to turn over at the Commission.  Remember--in 2004 people said the same thing about the FEC not policing 527s.  By 2006 the composition of the FEC had changed and most of the 527s from 2004 payed sizable fines.  This is not lost on the GOP lawyers advising the groups.  It doesn\x92t mean that they won\x92t push the line, but I have not seen any conduct that suggests the law is simply being ignored.\n\n3.  Every time a GOP candidate does something even close to the line, they are hit by a complaint.  Multiple complaints have been filed against Jeb Bush over his relationship with superpacs.  Most recently Sen. Paul was hit with a complaint over receiving an advance briefing on the hit-job book.  These come from a  variety of sources \x97 good government groups, CREW, and a new group set up by David Brock.\n\n4.  Per John\x92s question below \x97 there is one legal tool we could use that might slow them down.  The law has a little noticed or used provision that says that if a complaint has been filed and it is either dismissed or not acted upon within 120 days the entity that filed the complaint can sue the FEC to force it to proceed with enforcement.  If the FEC fails to move forward, then the complainant is permitted to bring their own lawsuit to enforce the law directly.  IF it were announced that this was the path we intended to take, it would both make news and perhaps give pause to the groups.  Is this something we want to push forward?  If so, would we want the DNC to do it?  The campaign?  Or would we prefer it be done externally?  It would be hailed by the reform groups, but is a significant step in legal escalation and will certainly result in similar action against Priorities et al.\n\n\nLet me know if you want to discuss any of these options.\n\n--\nMarc E.

I think we focus hard on raising as much as we can and then throw the kitchen sink at everyone who we believe steps over the line, understanding that has limited impact.\n\nOn May 3, 2015, at 5:55 PM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>> wrote:\n\nI have no magic solutions other than execution. Elias may have some legal ideas to slow them down. We have 3 things we have to do. Raise the primary $ by expanding the bundler network. Get Priorities functional. Use this to scare our people into giving bigger sums. We may need to get WJC into the mix sooner. We should also ask BHO to do more in light of this, although they are kind of prissy about how they approach this.\n\nOn Sunday, May 3, 2015, H <hdr29@hrcoffice.com<mailto:hdr29@hrcoffice.com>> wrote:\nIn light of this predictable statement of the obvious, what do you suggest we do?\nhttp://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/us/politics/fec-cant-curb-2016-election-abuse-commission-chief-says.html[mobile.nytimes.com]<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__mobile.nytimes.com_2015_05_03_us_politics_fec-2Dcant-2Dcurb-2D2016-2Delection-2Dabuse-2Dcommission-2Dchief-2Dsays.html&d=AwMFaQ&c=XRWvQHnpdBDRh-yzrHjqLpXuHNC_9nanQc6pPG_SpT0&r=mJZthOcamSml7FV7KXYLE6P2EQrjV525p9lKVucDNWI&m=crrUrXDe9XioPucokl9PI52uLkL-PsAUA9Ki309BouA&s=ctsOW7hgBsZmuZGZqBE5MGKLjTqRY1fv1T7geqxPb0o&e=>\n\n________________________________\n\nNOTICE: This communication may contain privileged or other confidential information.
