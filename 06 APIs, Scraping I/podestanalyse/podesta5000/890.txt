john.podesta@gmail.comb'John -- \n\nThis fall, there\'s a lot at stake.\n\nFor two years, the Republicans have said "no" over and over to legislation that would help Americans -- no to extending unemployment benefits, no to creating jobs, no to the Recovery Act.\n\nBut that\'s not enough -- if the Republicans take back Congress, they\'ve pledged to repeal health insurance reform and pursue policies that would end Social Security and Medicare as we know them.\n\nThey\'re convening in Washington, D.C., with Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin this weekend. Palin has said that the plan for keeping taxes low for the middle class so they can stimulate the economy, while repealing fiscally irresponsible tax cuts for the wealthiest 2%, is "idiotic." And Beck said last week of some of those who are unemployed, "you\'d be ashamed to call them Americans."\n\nThese are the folks that the Republican party draws its energy and ideas from. But we have a much better source -- you.\n\nThat\'s why, this weekend, OFA volunteers are going door to door across the country to make sure your voice is heard.\n\nThere\'s an event near you this Saturday -- and I hope you can join us:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/MAFevent8?slug=gpfltl\n\nWe\'re talking to folks in small towns and big cities, focusing on voters who turned out for the first time in 2008 to cast their ballot for Barack Obama.\n\nAnd we\'re going to make sure as many as possible of these voters commit to going to the polls again this fall.\n\nWe\'ve got an ambitious goal -- 200,000 doors knocked across the country.\n\nBut to meet that goal, we need 39 more volunteers in D.C.\n\nHere are the details for the event in Washington. Can you make it?\n  \n    What: D.C. to Virginia canvass\n\n    Where: 430 South Capitol St. SE \n    Washington, DC 20003\n\n    When: Saturday, August 28th\n    1:00 PM\n\nYes, I\'ll be there: http://my.barackobama.com/MAFevent8?slug=gpfltl\n\nNo, but I want to help: http://my.barackobama.com/MAFCantMakeIt7\n\nNo, but I\'d like to find another event near me: http://my.barackobama.com/MAFevent8\n\nYou see the progress we\'re making every day: as new provisions in the Affordable Care Act take effect, as federal funding saves the jobs of police officers and firefighters in the District, and as the brave men and women of the armed forces return from Iraq.\n\nBut to continue this progress, we need to elect Democrats who will stand with the President and fight for change that matters, not Republicans and extreme Tea Party leaders who want to repeal all our hard work.\n\nJoin us to help us reach out to Virginia voters about the importance of voting this fall:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/MAFevent8?slug=gpfltl\n\nLet\'s get to work,\n\nJeremy\n\nJeremy Bird\nDeputy Director\nOrganizing for America\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for America, a project of the Democratic National Committee -- 430 South Capitol Street SE, Washington, D.C. 20003.
