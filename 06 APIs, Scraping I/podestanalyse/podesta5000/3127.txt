I thought you might find it useful to have some answers to share\nwith your friends if they ask about all these news stories out there about\nmy email habits when I was Secretary of State.  So I want to take some time\nto try and explain it to you directly, in one place, at one time, as best\nas I can.\n\n\n\nPlease bear with me because parts are confusing, and like many of you, I\ndon't understand all of the technological aspects.  [But when you hear all\nthe facts, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll agree that all the political noise over this\nissue is just that \xe2\x80\x93 political noise.]\n\n\n\nIn 2007, when I was a U.S. Senator, I got my first Blackberry. I used it to\nkeep up with the news, with friends & family - and yes, I also got my fair\nshare of unsolicited forwards that sometimes made me laugh and sometimes\nmade me want to throw it away.  In short, I used email like most people.\n\n\n\nFast forward to 2009.  One of my husband's staff members bought the domain\nname clintonemail.com so his team could switch from the various email\nproviders they were relying on to one consolidated system.  I joined them.\n\n\n\nThis was all before I started my new job as Secretary of State. Had\nPresident Obama not asked me to join his team, if I had stayed in the U.S.\nSenate, I still would have switched to this new email.\n\n\n\nAnd when I did get to State, \xe2\x80\x8e it seemed simpler to have just the one\naddress. After all, my predecessors at State had not relied on Department\nemail.  In hindsight, though, this has proven anything but simple.\n\n\n\nThat's the explanation - but it's no excuse. There's a difference between\nallowed to do and smart to do. I shouldn't have done it this way. I should\nhave set the standard that others\xe2\x80\x8e were expected to meet. To do it all\nagain, I would have used two email addresses.\n\n\n\nBut I can't do it all again. I can only tell you it was a mistake, regret\nit, explain it, and help State and others fix any challenges it caused.\n\n\n\nThat's what I did. Now I want to explain what I didn't do.\n\n\n\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep my email secret. Whenever I emailed, it was from my address.\nWhenever people emailed me, it was to \xe2\x80\x8emy account. Work, personal,\nwhatever. And yes, I continued to get my fair share of unsolicited forwards.\n\n\n\nI also didn't do this to skirt rules.  And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it to avoid having\nmy records preserved.  When State asked former Secretaries of State who\nserved in the era of electronic communications to help fill out the\narchival record, I did so, printing 55,000 pages of email including\nanything related to my work at the State Department. To get a sense of how\noutdated some of the government\xe2\x80\x99s archiving practices are, we had to print\nall 55,000 pages because that's what the rules demand. Believe me, printing\nmore than 30,000 email instead of handing them over electronically isn't\nsomething anyone does by choice.\n\n\n\nThat's 30,000 more emails than every other former Secretary produced\ncombined .\n\n\n\nAnd yes, there were 30,000 more messages that were completely personal and\nhad nothing to do with official business.\n\n\n\nI do believe transparency in government is important. And by this point,\nthere isn't much you don't know about me. My finances are out there. My\nmedical history is out there. You know how much I've made, where I've gone,\nwhat I'm allergic to.\n\n\n\nBut what wasn't work wasn't the government's business. \xe2\x80\x8eSo I didn't keep\nthose emails.  I didn't print them. I knew no matter what I decided to do\nwith them, I was in for criticism. So I chose to keep a modicum of privacy.\nI hope you can understand that.\n\n\n\nNow I want to address the most serious aspect.\n\n\n\nWhen it came to classified information, I certainly never used my\nBlackberry.  And that had nothing to do with using a personal email\naddress. If I had been hillaryclinton@state.gov I could not have used it\nfor classified information either. At the State Department, mobile devices\naren't used to communicate secrets.  Almost everything of a classified\nnature was presented to me via paper or in person. When I traveled,\nelaborate steps were taken. \xe2\x80\x8eSecure phones were set up, secure tents were\nconstructed. More than once when a tent was set up in some far-away hotel,\nI was told to read the classified material with the blanket over my head.\nNo, that's not a joke. I took my responsibilities in safeguarding our\nnation's secrets seriously. So did my team did. Everyone at the State\nDepartment did .\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x8eThis process of looking backwards to see if something should have been\nclassified at the time is fine. I don't want anything released to the\npublic that puts us at risk. And we\xe2\x80\x99re all learning that different agencies\nhave very different views and procedures about what should be classified\nand what shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. What's not fine is to criticize people \xe2\x80\x93 especially\ncareer officials who have devoted their lives to serving our country -- for\nhandling what they didn't know might be deemed classified years later by\nanother part of the government. That's an impossible standard to meet.\nMembers of Congress and their staff also handled some of these messages.\nSome articles being written about this issue today contain classified\ninformation. Should someone sending that article to a colleague be told in\n2020 that they broke the rules? I hope not.\n\n\n\nAs for the security of my email, \xe2\x80\x8ein more than a little bit of irony, every\nday we learn of a new hack by the Chinese, by the Russians. That millions\nof Americans' personal information has been stolen.\n\n\n\nAs Secretary I was proud of what we accomplished. I was proud of the\nthousands of people who've dedicated themselves to public service\xe2\x80\x8e -\nincluding those who came into State with me and left with me. I was proud\nof them then, I'm proud of them now.\n\n\n\nI wish that a video was enough to address this. I know it isn't though. But\nI wanted to try to put everything in one place.\n\n\n\nAlong those lines, after nearly a year of offering to come up at any time\nanyplace, in October I'll be on Capitol Hill before the committee looking\nat the tragic events of September 2012 in Benghazi, Libya. They wanted to\ntalk to me behind closed doors, but I insisted on all of you being able to\nsee what I was asked and how I answered.\n\n\n\nI'm sure this issue will come up. It's unclear to me how it will help us\nunderstand what happened in Benghazi or how to help prevent future\ntragedies - but I'm going to do my best to answer whatever they ask.\n\n\n\nAnd while I can't predict the future, let me finish by taking a stab:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x8e\xe2\x80\xa2 There will be many more email to pour through.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Some will be serious, some will be embarrassing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x8e\xe2\x80\xa2 You know I'm not great with a fax, but you're also going to learn my\nsecret salad dressing recipe and who sent me LinkedIn requests. (And whose\nI didn't accept!)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 There will be more dramatic leaks and assertions that prove to be untrue.\n\n\n\nBut at some point, you're going to have them all. And if you suffer through\nall 55,000 pages, you'll be able to judge for yourself.\n\n\n\nWhich is how it's supposed to work.\n\n\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you for watching.\n\n\n\nThis email is intended only for the named addressee.
