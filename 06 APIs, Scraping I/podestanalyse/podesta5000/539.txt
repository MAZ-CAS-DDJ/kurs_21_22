Just a brief note to let you know that one of mine is joining you! The fantastic Cara Bernard, first generation Liberian American is beyond ecstatic to work with HRC in Human Resources. She\xe2\x80\x99s a recent AU Grad, has honed her chops with the likes of NPR, Steny Hoyer, the DSCC and even Vincent Gray. Though she will be too self-conscious about this to share, she\xe2\x80\x99s the grand niece of Liberia\xe2\x80\x99s Madame President, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf!   Please say hi if you see her, or in other words, HAZE HER! She can take it.\n>  \n> Missing you all and sending blessings, light and love,\n> Marlene\n>  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n> Marlene Cooper Vasilic \n> Vice President of Outreach and Special Events \n> Center for American Progress \n> 1333 H Street, NW \n> Suite 1000 \n> Washington, DC 20005 \n> Office: 202.481.8102 \n> mobile: 202.725.4867 \n> www.americanprogress.org\n> @mcvasilic\n>  \n>  \n'
