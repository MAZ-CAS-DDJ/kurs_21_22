If I do not hear from you on this, I'll ask again on Friday\nwhile you're on your way back up to NYC)\n\nHeather let us know you are going to the Russell Sage Lunch on Monday July\n13 from 12:30 - 1:30 pm.  Because your Acela was booked through CAP's\nAmTrav agency, we do not have the flexibility to call and change on a\nwhim--need about an hour\xe2\x80\x99s notice at least, but they'd prefer to change now\nbecause of rising prices.\n\nRussell Sage office is in Lenox Hill, and in traffic, it can be up to 23\nminutes to get from there to Penn Station.  *If the meeting runs even\nslightly long, you likely would miss the 2 pm train option. Which train do\nyou want to switch to on Monday?*\n\n\n-2:00pm Acela, Arrives WAS at 4:53pm\n\n-There is no 2:30 pm NE Regional option (rather, it is inexplicably at 2:05\npm)\n\n\n-3:00pm Acela, Arrives WAS at 5:53pm\n\nYou can, of course, change your ticket at the station, but last minute\nchanges will be difficult if you need them. Please let us know what you\nwould like to do.  CAP will allow Acela because you are not costing them\nany lodging, and because it\xe2\x80\x99s you.\n\n-- \nEryn M. Sepp\nCell: 818-456-2881\n"
