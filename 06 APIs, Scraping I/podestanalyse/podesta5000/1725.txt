john.podesta@gmail.comb'John, I\'m asking for your urgent support. Here\'s why:\n\nFor those of you who missed yesterday\'s debate, I want you to know that Barbara Comstock\'s positions could not have been more offensive to the voters of her district. Let me explain:\n\nShe never once mentioned the importance of education in her district, and she has voted to slash state funding for education by $620 million dollars in one year.\n\nWhen challenged with her baffling "no" vote on Governor McDonnell\'s transportation funding, which truly benefits our traffic congestion in northern Virginia, all she could say was that someone else voted the same way she did.\n\nShe had no defense for voting to overturn the "one gun a month" law in Virginia, making it easier for our state to become a gun trafficking venue for criminals.\n\nShe also thinks it\'s OK to bring guns into bars and restaurants that serve alcohol.\n\nShe is a danger to our children and families. And she voted against restrictions on bazookas and grenade launchers in this state. What is she thinking? (The NRA puts a lot of money into her campaign.)\n\nAs far as immigration is concerned, the only thing she can say is "secure the border." She has no compassion or concern for immigrants and their families. John agrees we should secure the border, but she refuses to discuss any further steps.\n\nAnd, as on OB-GYN, I am appalled that all she could say about voting for trans-vaginal ultrasounds and wanting to overturn Roe v. Wade, is that she doesn\'t want to fight about it. She wants to take away our right to access to birth control (allowing your employer to decide whether to cover your birth control) and your right to choose, and then take away your voice to speak up about it. No way, Barbara!\n\nI am asking for two things: first is to tell everyone you know in the district to get out and vote for John on November 4th.\n\nSecond, John must stay up on TV this week to get the message out, and your donation will go a long way towards making that happen. Please donate below, and thanks so much for supporting John Foust for Congress!!\n\nMarilyn Jerome Foust\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/foustq42014?refcode=em_FR_2014.10.27_b1_mj_ldnd&amp;recur_weekly=true&amp;amount=25&amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=DC&amp;zip=20016&amp;phone=2162818851&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=\n\n\nThis message was emailed to: podesta@law.georgetown.edu\n\nTo unsubscribe from this email list, please paste this URL into your browser: \nhttp://act.foustforvirginia.com/unsubscribe\n\nPaid for by John Foust for Congress\n\n'
