I just wanted the punchline to put Sanders in opposition to 195 countries == which seems more unreasonable than just opposing the President.\n\n\nBut it\'s your soundbite!\n\n\nMandy Grunwald\nGrunwald Communications\n202 973-9400\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>\nTo: Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com>\nSent: Tue, Dec 15, 2015 5:14 pm\nSubject: Re: Possible debate moments\n\n\nI\'m in a different place on climate. We\'ll be separating from him on Middle East. This is a place we can hug his leadership and go back to our original message that she looked good by being in service to him and the country\n\nOn Tuesday, December 15, 2015, Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com> wrote:\n\n\n\n\nThanks Ron.\n\n\nI like these topics/moments, but have a few comments on the specific language:\n\n\n1.  In "Don\'t Lecture Me" -- I don\'t like the change you\'ve made in the issues (education in AK, guns).  The original list was focused on powerful adversaries and a big arena, and I think that\'s needed (taking on Rx drug/insurance companies for health care; standing up for women in Beijng; against oppressive leaders around the world over human rights abuses etc.)  \n\n\n2.  "Can\'t take yes on Climate Change" - I\'d take Obama out of the soundbite. It feels like we\'re asking why Sanders is opposing Obama, instead of opposing the agreement. Why not something like "195 nations have come together for the first time in history to start to combat climate change\xe2\x80\xa6why can\'t you take yes for an answer."\n\n\n3. On the middle class tax cut. I wouldn\'t say "I\'ve been in their homes" -- HRC has not really done a lot of that this year.  Also, there is something pejorative about "the \'these" in "these people don\'t need a tax hike"\n\n\n4.  On GOP rhetoric, this line feels a little too Jesse Jackson for HRC He\xe2\x80\x99s not working to make American great \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to turn Americansto hate    \n\n\n5.  On Obamacare, I think you\'re missing something on "putting everything we\'ve worked so hard for at risk"\n\n\n6. On Wall Street, I don\'t think you need "dead in its tracks" -- I liked the original soundbite, "My agenda will be to stop their agenda"\n\n\n7.  I think punchline on guns should be "America is waiting for action."\n\n\nthanks!\n\n\nMandy Grunwald\nGrunwald Communications\n202 973-9400\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Ron Klain <ron.klain@revolution.com>\nTo: Jake Sullivan <jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com>; Jake Sullivan <jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com>; karen.l.dunn <karen.l.dunn@gmail.com>; Karen Dunn (KDunn@BSFLLP.com) <KDunn@BSFLLP.com>; John Podesta (john.podesta@gmail.com) <john.podesta@gmail.com>; Jennifer Palmieri (jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com) <jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com>; Sara Solow (ssolow@hillaryclinton.com) <ssolow@hillaryclinton.com>; Kristina Costa (kcosta@hillaryclinton.com) <kcosta@hillaryclinton.com>; Tony Carrk (tcarrk@hillaryclinton.com) <tcarrk@hillaryclinton.com>; Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com>; Jim.Margolis <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com>; jbenenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com>; ha16 <ha16@hillaryclinton.com>; Robert Barnett (RBarnett@wc.com) <RBarnett@wc.com>\nCc: Ron Klain <ron.klain@revolution.com>; rklain <rklain@aol.com>\nSent: Tue, Dec 15, 2015 1:55 pm\nSubject: Possible debate moments\n\n\n\nAs we discussed at the end of the session on Sunday, I have prepared the attached set of debate \xe2\x80\x9cmoments.\xe2\x80\x9d  These are NOT complete answers.
