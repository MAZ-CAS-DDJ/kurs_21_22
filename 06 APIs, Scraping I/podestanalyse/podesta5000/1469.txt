john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John,\n\nI am excited to give you the opportunity to  meet the newest Senator\nfrom the great state of Hawaii, Senator Brian Schatz.  On May 9th, LCV\nAction Fund will host a breakfast with Sen. Schatz and a very  special\nguest, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. I hope you will\njoin us.\n\nSen. Schatz was appointed to Hawaii\'s open  U.S. Senate seat in late\nDecember 2012 to fill the vacancy created by the  passing of Senator\nDaniel Inouye, and he is running in a Special Election in  November\n2014 to complete the term. He has proudly identified climate change as\none of his top issues and has the credentials to back it up. In his\neight years  in the Hawaii House of Representatives, and most recently\nas Hawaii\'s  Lieutenant Governor, Sen. Schatz helped create and\nimplement one of the  strongest plans for clean energy in the country\nwith an aggressive goal to meet  70% of Hawaii\'s energy needs through\nenergy efficiency and renewable energy by  2030.\n\nAs the "clean energy czar" under Governor  Abercrombie, Sen. Schatz\nadvanced investment in smart grid technologies and  facilitated\nrenewable energy projects, including the largest wind energy  facility\nin the state. He is now bringing his expertise to the whole country as\na member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural\nResources.\n\nI hope you will join us on May 9th to meet  Sen. Schatz and Secretary\nAlbright in person and support the Senate\'s newest  environmental\nchampion. Please click here  to make a contribution to Sen.
