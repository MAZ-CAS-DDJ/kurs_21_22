While I will be guiding graduate students in the research, it is a big project.\xa0 I\'m very hopeful (and expect that) the results will be useful to HRC. \nThat being said, I\'m totally devoted to our cause and want very much to make this commitment.\xa0 I just need to evaluate whether I can do both (in addition to other stuff on the plate).\xa0 A conversation would be terrific.\xa0 I\'m free this afternoon (Pacific time) and all day tomorrow.\xa0 \nThanks --\nJMG\n\n\nSent from my iPad\n\nOn Jan 4, 2014, at 7:54 AM, "John Podesta" <john.podesta@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n> I had a good conversation with Jennifer yesterday about Priorities.\xa0 She\'s reflecting on her capacity to make the commitment and wants to have further conversations about time obligation.\xa0 \n> \n> Sean, would appreciate if you could take the initiative in setting up a call for you three soon to follow up.\n> \n> Thanks,\n> JP\n'
