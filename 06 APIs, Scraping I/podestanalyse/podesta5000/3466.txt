john.podesta@gmail.comb" \nMonica Langley has a call into me as well, I assume about this, which I\nhave not returned.\n \nChris, I assume that if someone says something, it should be as\ninnocuous as the following:\n \n-- Senator Obama is mindful of the seriousness of the issues and is\ndoing what he believes is responsible with regard to transition\nplanning.\n \n-- [On background:  John Podesta is leading that effort.  We don't\nexpect the candidate or the campaign to say anything further about this\nat this point.]\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: Jason Furman [mailto:jfurman@barackobama.com] \nSent: Monday, September 22, 2008 3:36 PM\nTo: Chris Lu; Froman, Michael B [CAI]; william.m.daley@jpmchase.com\nSubject: FW: Query from WSJ re transition planning affecting Treasury\n\n\n\nAny view on how to handle? I also don't have time to call before 5pm so\nany ideas on who could call him. Maybe a quote for a spokesman? At least\nshould have something generic about how we're mindful of the seriousness\nand Obama wants a smooth transition...\n\n \n\nFrom: Nick Shapiro \nSent: Monday, September 22, 2008 2:50 PM\nTo: Jason Furman\nSubject: FW: Query from WSJ re transition planning affecting Treasury\n\n \n\nCan you call him?\n\n \n\nFrom: Power, Stephen [mailto:Stephen.Power@wsj.com] \nSent: Monday, September 22, 2008 1:27 PM\nTo: Nick Shapiro\nSubject: Query from WSJ re transition planning affecting Treasury\n\n \n\nNick-\n\n \n\nI'm trying to pull together a story tonight about what steps are being\ntaken by both presidential candidates to ensure a smooth handoff at\nTreasury, in light of the significant expansion in the agency's powers\nand responsibilities that would accompany the administration's proposed\nfinancial rescue package. \n\n \n\nHere's my question:\n\n \n\n1. Has Senator Obama taken any steps to ensure a smooth transition at\nthe Treasury Department, should he win the election -- for example, by\ndrawing up a list of likely or potential nominees for key Treasury\nposts, setting staffing goals (dates by which he'd like to have x% of\npositions filled, etc).\n\n \n\nIf you could try to respond by 5 pm, I'd appreciate it. \n\n \n\nThanks.\n\n \n\nWith kind regards,\n\n \n\nStephen Power\n\nStaff Reporter - Energy and Environmental Policy\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\n1025 Connecticut Ave., NW \n\nSuite 800\n\nWashington, DC \n\n20036\n\nOffice phone: (202) 862-9269\n\nCell phone: (202) 258-7949\n\nEmail: stephen.power@wsj.com\n\n \n\n \n\n"
