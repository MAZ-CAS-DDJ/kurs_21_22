The establishment in the GOP has seemingly given up in an embrace of Donald Trump and the voices of darkness. I'm fearful that if we don't take Trump and his supporters seriously we could be heading down a dangerous path.\n\nRepublican candidates are now wearing their hatred and bigotry as a badge of honor, and it is maddening to see many Americans become attracted to this rhetoric. We can't let hope, love, peace, equality, and justice be drowned out by the politics of fear and hate. We need to elevate a better kind of politics that pushes for a tolerant America that will never return to the hateful climate that created internment camps during WWII.\n\nBut I can't do this alone. I never have. I need your help to raise $10,000 from online contributions before midnight on Sunday. Can you give to our campaign, so I can return to Congress and fight against Donald Trump and the forces of darkness and hate?\n\n\n\nDONATE $10 secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/jan2016_eom_honda?refcode=em20160125-trump&amount=10&recurring=yes\n\nDONATE $25 secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/jan2016_eom_honda?refcode=em20160125-trump&amount=10&recurring=yes\n\nDONATE $50 secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/jan2016_eom_honda?refcode=em20160125-trump&amount=10&recurring=yes\n\nDONATE $100 secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/jan2016_eom_honda?refcode=em20160125-trump&amount=10&recurring=yes\n\nDONATE $250 secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/jan2016_eom_honda?refcode=em20160125-trump&amount=10&recurring=yes\n\n\nThe idea that someone holding the highest and most powerful position in the world could maintain the hateful believes of Donald Trump is frightening. And the truth is, I don't know if he can in November, but I know if he does, I want to be in Congress fighting against every hateful, bigoted piece of legislation he tried to advance through Congress.\n\nStand me today, so I can stand up to Trump if he actually gets elected. secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/jan2016_eom_honda?refcode=em20160125-trump&amount=10&recurring=yes\n\nIn solidarity,\n\nMike Honda\n\nPaid For By Mike Honda for Congress\n\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.
