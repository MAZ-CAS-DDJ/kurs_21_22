[ http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=3837&tag=email.20100709.oil ] Congress must use its authority to deal aggressively with BP and with the oil spill disaster in the Gulf. Communities suffering the impacts of this disaster need to be made whole, and responsible parties must be held accountable for the full economic and environmental restoration costs. \n\nWe can act now to prevent another disaster like the spill in the Gulf from ever happening again - by passing a national energy policy and climate solutions that make water protection a litmus test for sustainability. Tell your legislators that we can't continue to support these dirty energy sources. [ http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=3837&tag=email.20100709.oil ] \n\nIt is time to end our addiction to polluting fuels and the dirty energy source of the past. Clean Water Action is campaigning hard for a clean energy future that replaces technologies that degrade and deplete the nation's water resources with those that preserve and protect our water. Your help could make all the difference. [ http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=3837&tag=email.20100709.oil ] \n\nThank you for doing your part at this critical moment!

After nearly 3 months of the BP disaster in the Gulf it may seem like there is nothing you can do. By urging your Senators and Representative to ensure a clean energy future for us all [ http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=3837&tag=email.20100709.oil ] you will be making a positive impact.\n\n\n----------------------\nTell a Friend\nDo you know someone who might be interested in learning about our work? <http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/t/201/tellafriend.jsp?tell_a_friend_KEY=3263>Tell them!\n\n\n\nDonate\nSupport Clean Water Action by <https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/t/9935/content.jsp?content_KEY=6304&tag=email.passiveask>making a donation today.\n\n\nConnect\n<http://www.facebook.com/pages/Clean-Water-Action/22907478728?ref=nf> Join us on Facebook\n<http://twitter.com/cleanh2oaction/> Follow us on Twitter\n<http://www.youtube.com/cleanwateraction> Check out our YouTube channel\n\n\nUnsubscribe\nYou are receiving this message because you or someone using your e-mail address, john.podesta@gmail.com, gave us permission to send it.\n\nNot interested anymore? <http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/unsubscribe.jsp?Email=john.podesta@gmail.com&email_blast_KEY=1184858&organization_KEY=2155>unsubscribe in one step.\n\n\nContact Us\nNational Office\n1010 Vermont Ave NW, Ste. 1100\nWashington, DC 20005-4918\nTel: 202-895-0420\nFax: 202-895-0438\n<mailto:cwa@cleanwater.org>e-mail us\n"
