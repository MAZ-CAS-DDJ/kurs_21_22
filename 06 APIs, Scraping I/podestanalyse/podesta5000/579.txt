He is very talented, hard-working and politically sophisticated. He led JDC\xe2\x80\x99s government affairs area. He is interested in joining Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s campaign on a full-time basis in the Jewish outreach area, and has talked to several people noted below. Herbert is well-known throughout the Jewish community and would be a great asset to the campaign. I have absolute confidence in him.\n>  \n> Best wishes,\n>  \n> Stu Eizenstat\n>  \n> P.S.

A few people had suggested me for that role and I have been in touch with Amanda Renteria, Brynne Craig and Jared Mueller in the Political Department at the Clinton campaign.
