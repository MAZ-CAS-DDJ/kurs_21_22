john.podesta@gmail.comb"Dear John,\n\nI was at the CAP/AFSCME event yesterday.  It was right up my old alley of\nurban policy and all the issues we dealt with when I was mayor of Santa\nMonica.  Neera was great and Hillary was at top form. I was sitting in the\nsecond row, right behind you but you seemed too busy for me to bother you.\n\nAfter the panel, Hillary saw me and came over to me immediately.  We hugged\nand she did say she wanted me in the campaign somehow.  So I am just\nsending this message on to you so you can continue to ponder how I might\nbest serve.\n\nWhen Hillary gave me her hug, her first question was about my health.  What\na dear, caring friend.  Really, I'll do anything.   SO let me know.\n\nYou looked well and I hope to get to chat with you the next time.\n\nThanks and thanks again,   Ruth\n"
