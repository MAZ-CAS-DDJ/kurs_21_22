john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John,\n\nLet\'s get real - a lot of people have talked about making a run for the U.S. Senate in New York, with Harold Ford Jr., being the latest. But there\'s only one candidate who has the progressive values we care about - and the record to match: Kirsten Gillibrand.\n\nNot one of the current contenders - Democrat or Republican - has consistently supported a woman\'s right to choose like Kirsten has. Not one has made an unequivocal stand in support of marriage equality, and not one has worked tirelessly to repeal the unfair and discriminatory "Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell" policy - except for Kirsten.\n\nAt a time when so many issues in the Senate are being decided by just a few votes, we can\'t afford to go backward! It\'s time to show the pundits and the naysayers that New York wants a progressive champion as its senator.\n\nClick here to make a donation of $250, $500, or more to Kirsten\'s campaign, and send a powerful message to her opponents that we intend to return her to the Senate in 2011.\n\nhttps://secure.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/827/p/wfc/dscc/senators/gillibrand/donate.sjs?donate_page_KEY=6125\n\nIn just one year in the Senate, Kirsten has shown herself to be a leader who has the courage to fight for what\'s right. I remember how proud I was when she raised her voice loud and clear against the Stupak Amendment - one of the most dangerous threats to women\'s reproductive rights in decades - and helped defeat the Senate version. Her active support of marriage equality and fair treatment of gays in the military shows her unwavering dedication to equal rights for all.\n\nWith so much at stake, we need to be very clear that we support candidates who share these ideals- and have shown that they will act on them! That\'s why we\'ve got to stand firmly behind Kirsten, because she\'s proven her commitment. There\'s no time to waste. We need to act now to speak up and make clear that she\'s our candidate.\n\nPlease make a donation today of $250, $500, or more to Gillibrand for Senate, and show your support for a progressive, committed United States Senator. \n\nhttps://secure.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/827/p/wfc/dscc/senators/gillibrand/donate.sjs?donate_page_KEY=6125\n\nOver the past year, Kirsten has always been there for us. Now it\'s time for us to be there for Kirsten.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAnn F. Lewis\n\n--\n\nPaid for by Gillibrand for Senate\n\nTo unsubscribe please click here\nhttp://www.democratsenators.org/o/44/unsubscribe.jsp?Email=Gavrie@annelewisllc.com&email_blast_KEY=12112&organization_KEY=44'
