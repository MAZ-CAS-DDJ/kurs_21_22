It\xe2\x80\x99s\n2006 all over again.\n\n\n\nThis year\xe2\x80\x99s midterm election is shaping up to look a lot like the 2006\nversion, but with the parties reversed. In 2014, it\xe2\x80\x99s Democrats, not\nRepublicans, who are in trouble, which adds another complication to\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s delicate planning ahead of a likely second presidential run.\n\n\n\nClinton will headline a rally Thursday evening in downtown Philadelphia for\nPennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf, her first public fundraiser\nof the year. The day before, she attended a closed-door fundraiser in\nChicago for Gov. Pat Quinn.\n\n\n\nWhy the difference? It might have to do with the fact that Wolf is\ncurrently ahead by double digits, while Quinn is hanging on for his life.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately for Democrats, there are a lot more Quinns this year than\nWolfs. So while there plenty of eligible winning candidates for Clinton to\nback in 2006, it\xe2\x80\x99s trickier now. She needs thread the needle of helping\nDemocrats while not contaminating her political standing with their losses.\n\n\n\nAnd Clinton doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to look far to see the risk.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, before she really got back into politics, Clinton made\nan exception for Marjorie Margolies, who was running in a Democratic\ncongressional primary in Pennsylvania. Not only is Margolies Chelsea\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s mother-in-law, but she cast a painful vote for Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\n1993 budget during her first stint in the House, which ultimately cost her\nher seat and won her a debt from the Clintons.\n\n\n\nMargolies lost her race this year, leading to a spate of negative media\ncoverage and Republican attacks about the apparent withering of the Clinton\nbrand. If she can\xe2\x80\x99t win a congressional primary, the argument went, how can\nshe win a presidential one?\n\n\n\nMargolies herself captured the predicament the Clintons face in an\ninterview with CNN back in May. \xe2\x80\x9cWe always knew that if they came in too\nmuch we would be blamed for their coming in too much. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t come in\nenough that people would would say they didn\xe2\x80\x99t come in enough,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re kind of damned if you do, damned if you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhen expectations are as high as they are for anything she does, Clinton\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t afford to be seen backing a loser. At the same time, Clinton wants to\nhelp her party and needs to be seen doing it, lest she get accused of\nlooking out only for herself.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s solution, tucked away in the campaign scheduled revealed to\nPolitico last week, seems to be this: Mostly private fundraisers for a\nlimited number of key races where she can make a difference and \xe2\x80\x93\nimportantly \xe2\x80\x93 where the Democratic candidate has a good shot at winning.\n\n\n\nClinton is intervening in most of the key Senate and gubernatorial races\nthis year, but not all.\n\n\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s not, for instance, backing West Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s Natalie Tennant, nor\nLouisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, nor Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor, though her\nhusband has campaigned for all three. Nor is she supporting Alaska Sen.\nMark Begich, one of the party\xe2\x80\x99s most endangered incumbents. All four are\ncurrently underwater in the polls.\n\n\n\nThe candidates she is supporting, like Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s Alison Lundergan Grimes\nor North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, face very difficult battles, but are\ngenerally in stronger positions.\n\n\n\nEven so, she has avoided public events this far. Some advisers have\nencouraged her to get out with voters more this year, both to combat\nimpressions that she\xe2\x80\x99s remote, and to warm up for a presidential bid. She\nenjoys these interactions, they insist, and gleans information from them\nthat she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t find in polls or from consultants. During the \xe2\x80\x9clistening\ntour\xe2\x80\x9d of her first Senate campaign, aides often scheduled an hour after\npublic events for Clinton to mingle with locals.\n\n\n\nBut there\xe2\x80\x99s little glad-handing so far this campaign season. Closed-door\nevents may just be safer, as the privacy helps insulate Clinton from\npotential losses.\n\n\n\nAnd to be sure, Clinton is invaluable to her party at these kinds of\nevents. In 2006, Clinton raised millions for party committees, and her\npersonal leadership PAC doled out almost $2.5 million to other Democrats,\neven though she had her own re-election campaign to worry about.\n\n\n\nClinton did work the rope line after her speech at the Iowa Steak Friday last\nmonth, and was well received, but the event mostly honored retiring Sen.\nTom Harkin, rather than a specific candidate.\n\n\n\nClinton can stride confidently on stage Thursday in Philadelphia knowing\nthat Wolf is a shoo-in to oust unpopular Republican Gov. Tom Corbett (the\nlatest poll has him down 17 points) in the key presidential swing stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*CNN: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton on Congress: \'Do they just not care?\'\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/09/politics/hillary-clinton-congress/>*\n\n\n\nBy Dan Merica\n\nOctober 9, 2014, 10:41 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton lit into members of Congress on Wednesday night in Chicago,\nquestioning their resolve to legislate as opposed to their desire to play\npolitics.\n\n\n\n"The basic problem is we have lost leaders on both sides of the aisle,\nparticularly at this point in history, on the other side of the aisle, who\nare more interested in governing than in posturing, more interested in\nproblem solving than in partisanship," Clinton told an audience of business\nleaders at The Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday night.\n\n\n\nClinton, the former senator from New York and Democrats\' presidential\nfavorite, said this became clear for her during the 16-day partial\ngovernment shutdown in 2013, when President Barack Obama had to cancel his\ntrip to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bali, Indonesia. At\nthe time Clinton was secretary of state.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t care what party you are, Democrats never did that to George W.\nBush despite our deep differences with President Bush on taxes, on Iraq, on\nso many other things," Clinton said. "We never did it."\n\n\n\nClinton\'s remarks were more stepped up than in the past, questioning not\nonly Congress\' resolve, but their commitment to doing their jobs.\n\n\n\n"You have to ask yourself, do these particular members of Congress really\nunderstand the world? Understand what it means for the United States to\nlead and to be perceived as a leader? Or do they just not care," Clinton\nposited. "Do they just have a whole other agenda that enables them to say\nwhatever they want to say and spout whatever rhetoric they want to spout?"\n\n\n\nClinton has been outspoken in her longing for political leaders who could\nnegotiate and cut deals. Her stump speech regularly includes lines that\ndecry partisan politics.\n\n\n\n"It is deeply distressing to me that we have people running for Congress,\nboth House and Senate, who proudly go around their districts and their\nstates proclaiming that you should send them to Washington because they\nwill never compromise," Clinton said, pulling a line from previous speeches.\n\n\n\nClinton urged the 900 well-heeled business leaders and philanthropists in\nthe room to make their disapproval known.\n\n"That is why it is imperative that you have people in business and other\npositions of responsibility basically say... \'Get out there and do your\njob. Stay off the talk shows. Get back to the Congress. Legislate and solve\nAmerica\'s problems.\'"\n\n\n\nShe added later, in an apparent appeal to independents, this call: "The\nonly way to solve this is for the American people, the American voters...\nwho constitute the great middle of the American political system, to just\ncall a halt to it."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Associated Press, via The Kansas City Star: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton to campaign\nfor Peters, Schauer\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.kansascity.com/news/government-politics/article2633767.html>*\n\n\n\n[No Writer Mentioned]\n\nOctober 9, 2014, 11:04 a.m.\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton plans to visit Michigan next week to campaign for\nU.S. Senate candidate Gary Peters and gubernatorial candidate Mark Schauer.\n\n\n\nThe former secretary of state, senator and first lady is scheduled appear\nat a public event Oct. 16.

The poll\xe2\x80\x99s authors are pretty adamant about the use of \xe2\x80\x9clikely,\xe2\x80\x9d\ntoo, seeing as less than a quarter of millennials are expected to actually\nturn out this November, according to a Harvard University poll.\n\n\n\nFusion\xe2\x80\x99s poll also provides insight into the party leanings of millennial\ndemographic groups. Hispanic and black voters, it shows, are more likely to\nvote for Democrats, as are women. White voters, meanwhile, are more likely\nto support Republicans.\n\n\n\nAccording to the data, the economy is a top issue driving young voters to\nthe polls this November\xe2\x80\x94which is good news for the White House, which just\nlaunched a emoji-laced social media campaign about the economy aimed at\nmillennials. Other issues that are getting young voters riled up include\nterrorism and national security as well as education.\n\n\n\nThe millennials surveyed by Fusion also hint at who they would like to see\non the ballot in 2016\xe2\x80\x94for Democrats, the favorite is Hillary Clinton, and\nfor Republicans the largest chunk of likely voters don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but more\nwould vote for Congressman Paul Ryan than anyone else.\n\n\n\nThe poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.83 percentage points. It\nwas conducted via phone interviews Sept. 12 through Sept. 22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Des Moines Register: Matthew Patane: \xe2\x80\x9cLuntz: Rubio could beat Clinton in\n2016 debate\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-politics-insider/2014/10/09/frank-luntz-marco-rubio-hillary-clinton-2016/16971393/>*\n\n\n\nBy Matthew Patane\n\nOctober 9, 2014, 12:00 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio would stand the best chance against Hillary Clinton in a\nprospective 2016 presidential election debate, pollster and political\nconsultant Frank Luntz said today.\n\n\n\nThe Florida Republican would benefit from his age and "brilliant" debate\nskills, Luntz said.\n\n\n\n"Marco Rubio will do to Hillary what Barack Obama did to John McCain," he\nsaid after being asked which Republican stood the best chance of debating\nClinton.\n\n\n\nA contributor to Fox News and CBS, Luntz was the keynote speaker at the\nIowa Association of Business and Industry\'s Advanced Manufacturing\nConference in Ankeny.\n\n\n\nLuntz also said Clinton, should she choose to run, would win the Democratic\nnomination for president no matter who runs against her.\n\n\n\nAs for the GOP, Luntz said it is far too early to tell who would win the\nnomination in the crowded field of prospective 2016 Republican candidates.\n\n\n\n"I\'ve never had any fear of making projections, (but) there\'s no way to\nknow," Luntz said.

Pritzker, Ms. Clinton\'s\nfriend and the co-chairman of her 2008 presidential campaign. They took\npart in a Q&A during the event at the Fairmont Hotel at Millennium Park.\n\n\n\nMs. Clinton, whose daughter Chelsea gave birth to a daughter just a few\nweeks ago, chuckled and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d but her son-in-law, Marc\nMezvinsky, is changing diapers and that\'s \xe2\x80\x9cgenerational progress.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe line drew laughs from the crowd of nearly a thousand. Seen in the\nballroom or noted on the program as attending were Duchossois Group Inc.\nCEO Craig Duchossois, Commonwealth Edison CEO Anne Pramaggiore, PrivateBank\nCEO Larry Richman, Grosvenor Capital Management LP consultant Eric Whitaker\n1871 CEO Howard Tullman and Ingredion Corp. CEO Ilene Gordon, who recently\ntalked about becoming a grandmother, too.\n\n\n\nThere was no discussion about Ms. Clinton\'s plans to run -- or not -- for\npresident in 2016, though she did talk about some issues of the day and her\nfamily, the Chicago Tribune noted.\n\n\n\nThe event capped off a day of public appearances in Chicago by the former\nU.S. secretary of state.
