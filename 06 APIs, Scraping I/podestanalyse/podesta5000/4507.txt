All eyes will be on their fundraising totals to see if they have what it takes to fight back against the onslaught of outside money coming their way. \n\nPlease give what you can right now. Sunday is the day -- now let's make it count. Contribute now to Cheri Bustos.\nhttp://action.cheribustos.com/june25-1\n\nKarl Rove and the Koch Brothers have tried this all before -- but it won't work. Not with you in the game.\n\nThanks,\n\nJames\n\n\n\n\nThis message was emailed to: john.podesta@gmail.com\n\nTo unsubscribe from this email list, please paste this URL into your browser: \nhttp://action.cheribustos.com/unsubscribe\n\nPaid for by the Friends of Cheri Bustos\n\n"
