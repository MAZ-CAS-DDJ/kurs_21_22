I believe that if Seth can raise the requisite funds, he can win.\n\nSo as you probably guessed when you read the first sentence of this letter, I am asking you to consider donating to Seth's campaign. Individual donors can give up to $1,000 per calendar year and couples up to $2,000 per calendar year. \n\nIf you are interested, you can go to www.SethMagaziner.com and donate.\n\nI would greatly appreciate your serious consideration of this request.\n\nThanks\n\nIra\n"
