(AP Photo/The Santa Fe New Mexican, Luis Sanchez Saturno)\nTHE BIG IDEA:\n&#8212;\xc2\xa0On paper, Susana Martinez makes lots of sense as a potential running mate for the eventual Republican nominee. She\xe2\x80\x99s a Latina in a party that struggles with Hispanics and women, a former district attorney in a moment when the public yearns for security and a conservative who got reelected in a blue state last year with 56 percent of the vote.\nIn practice, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association has become a punch line among some GOP elites in D.C. She\xe2\x80\x99s gotten a reputation within corners of the consultant class as Palinesque: gaffe-prone, not intellectually curious, and not up for the rigors of a national campaign.\nMaking it in Santa Fe is not the same as making it in Washington. New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s population is, after all, just 2.1 million.\n&#8212; The latest setback for any future aspirations Martinez might have came yesterday when the tape of a police officer\xe2\x80\x99s belt recorder was released publicly. The governor sounds intoxicated as she speaks with the cop about a noise complaint in her hotel room and a report that bottles had been thrown from the balcony. The officer then discusses what to do about her with a security guard from the Eldorado Hotel and Spa.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve only really been working here for like a month and a half,\xe2\x80\x9d the guard tells the cop in the exchange around 1:30 a.m. the Sunday before last. \xe2\x80\x9cSo this actually is my first run-in with this sort of thing. \xe2\x80\xa6 I would never expect the first time to be the governor. I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do in this situation because I can tell that she\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\xa6 kind of \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cInebriated,\xe2\x80\x9d the cop finishes.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d the guard replied.\nSusana Martinez stands in front of a state map of drunken-driving deaths during a news conference in Albuquerque on Dec. 7. The incident in question happened Dec. 13. (AP Photo/Russell Contreras, File)\nThe governor\xe2\x80\x99s office told local press that it was snowballs, not bottles, thrown from the room. And her office said yesterday that she only had a drink and a half. Apologizing for telling a police dispatcher not to send officers, the governor told the Albuquerque Journal last Friday that she was \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely not\xe2\x80\x9d drunk during the episode.\xc2\xa0Listen to the 4-minute audio here.\n&#8212; Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, both sons of Cuban immigrants, are obviously in the top tier of the GOP contest. But if the nominee is looking for a Hispanic from the west to join the ticket, Nevada Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval might be a safer bet, especially after this hotel episode. The former federal judge was also easily reelected last year.\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\nHillary Clinton mingles with Iowa voters yesterday at a high school in Keota. (Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n&#8212; Hillary asks Bernie supporters to join her once she&#8217;s the nominee. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard for me to believe that anybody who would support Senator Sanders would want to see any of the Republicans elected president of the United States,&#8221; Clinton said in Iowa last night.\xc2\xa0&#8220;I would just ask that when this nomination is wrapped up that they come and join with us to make sure that we don&#8217;t turn the White\xc2\xa0House back over to the Republicans.&#8221;\xc2\xa0After incorrectly claiming during Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s debate that ISIS shows videos of Trump to lure recruits, Clinton\xc2\xa0also tweaked her line of attack to say that videos of Trump are being shown on \xe2\x80\x9cArabic television\xe2\x80\x9d to incite jihadists.

(AP Photo/Santi Palacios)\n&#8212;\xc2\xa0Shot: Americans support barring Syrian refugees from the U.S., 51 percent\xc2\xa0to 43 percent,\xc2\xa0according to Quinnipiac polling released this morning.\xc2\xa0\nChaser:\xc2\xa0Thirteen more refugees, mostly children, drowned\xc2\xa0overnight off the coast of a Greek island while trying to sail\xc2\xa0in a makeshift\xc2\xa0boat from Turkey to Europe.\xc2\xa0\n&#8212; More from this morning&#8217;s Q poll: Americans\xc2\xa0oppose Donald Trump&#8217;s plan to ban all Muslims from coming to the country by a more than 2:1 margin (66 percent to 27 percent).\xc2\xa0The partisan divide on the issue, however, is sharp. Democrats would accept Syrian refugees (74-22) while Republicans (82-13) and independents (51-42) would ban them. All three groups oppose barring all Muslims: Dems (79-18); Republicans (51-41) and independents (67-22). A majority (55 percent) of Americans believe domestic extremists are a bigger threat than foreign radicals, while 55 percent think Islam is a peaceful religion. Americans also support (50-42) sending ground troops to fight ISIS.\nOn other issues:\xc2\xa0Americans want the next president to fight climate change, 69 to 23 percent, while a narrow majority, 50 to 27 percent, oppose new gun control laws. But a large 89 to 9 percent majority back background checks for purchases at gun shows and online. (Full breakdown here.)\n&#8212; On the economy, a new Pew survey shows 45 percent of Americans rate the economy as &#8220;fair,&#8221; compared to 27 percent who see it as &#8220;excellent&#8221; and 28 percent who rate it as &#8220;poor.&#8221; Americans are less optimistic about the economy next year than they were a year ago. Last December,\xc2\xa031 percent believed the economy would improve over the next\xc2\xa0year. Only 20 percent do right now. While\xc2\xa041 percent say\xc2\xa0that plenty of jobs exist in their communities, the highest level in eight years, 68 percent of those with incomes of less than $30,000 feel they&#8217;re falling behind. And 73 percent of total respondents support raising\xc2\xa0the minimum wage.\n&#8212;\xc2\xa0A new CNN/ORC poll continues to show Trump dominating the GOP field: He wins Republican and GOP-leaning voters with 39 percent, with Cruz finishing a distant 2nd with 18 percent (up 2 points since last month). Ben Carson and Marco Rubio lost some traction, both coming in at 10 percent. Trump smashes his competition on who can best handle the economy, illegal immigration and ISIS.\n&#8212; Squeezing the vice on Vladimir\xc2\xa0Putin,\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0Treasury Department barred businesses from dealings with dozens more Russian companies and\xc2\xa0individuals.\xc2\xa0It&#8217;s\xc2\xa0part of ongoing U.S. sanctions against the Russian energy sector and came\xc2\xa0one day after the U.N. extended sanctions against Russia for another six months over its illegal invasion of Ukraine.

He has written more extensively about his spiritual awakening than almost any other modern president, addressing it in two books before he was elected to the White House and in more than a dozen speeches since.\xc2\xa0His faith had been central to his identity as a new kind of Democrat who would bring civility to the country\xe2\x80\x99s political debates by appealing to Republicans through the shared language of their Judeo-Christian values.\xc2\xa0With just one year left in his second term, Obama now holds a different distinction: No modern president has had his faith more routinely questioned and disparaged. Recent polls show that 29 percent of Americans and nearly 45 percent of Republicans say he is a Muslim. &#8230;\xc2\xa0Throughout his political career, Obama has described his faith as one that acknowledges doubt and man\xe2\x80\x99s inherently sinful nature. &#8216;He has a very stoic and fatalistic view of mankind,&#8217; said Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.) &#8230; For Obama, faith is a means to move from that dire reality \xe2\x80\x94 the world as it is \xe2\x80\x94 to the promise of the world as it ought to be. This idea of faith as an ennobling struggle runs through virtually all of his most ambitious speeches.&#8221;\nIs Obama too concerned about collateral damage? &#8211;&gt; \xe2\x80\x9cAs bombing in Syria intensifies, a debate about the rules of engagement,\xe2\x80\x9d by Missy Ryan and Karen DeYoung: \xe2\x80\x9cPresident Obama\xe2\x80\x99s order to intensify air attacks in Syria has led to new internal debate over whether to loosen tight restrictions on strikes against Islamic State targets that risk civilian casualties &#8230; But so far, at least, the White House has resisted proposals to change the rules of engagement for the bombing. Each strike &#8230; is weighed against likely collateral damage and must be individually approved by top officers at the coalition operations center in Baghdad. \xe2\x80\xa6 In Iraq, local commanders have publicly complained about U.S. reluctance to strike targets in populated areas. According to new figures released by the military Tuesday, about 56 percent of all coalition aircraft return from \xe2\x80\x98strike missions\xe2\x80\x99 without having used their weapons, either because of bad weather or a judgment that the risk of civilian casualties is too high.\xe2\x80\x9d\nUnintended consequences of ethics rules\xc2\xa0&#8211;&gt;\xc2\xa0&#8220;Meet the author of \xe2\x80\x98The Revenant\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 except you can\xe2\x80\x99t because of his federal job,&#8221; by Ben Terris: &#8220;When &#8216;The Revenant,&#8217; the highly anticipated new film adapted from Michael Punke\xe2\x80\x99s book, had its big opening in L.A. \xe2\x80\x94 an evening featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Oscar-winning director Alejandro Gonz\xc3\xa1lez I\xc3\xb1\xc3\xa1rritu \xe2\x80\x94 the author was nowhere to be seen.\xc2\xa0He was 10,000 miles away in Nairobi, putting the finishing touches on an international trade agreement enacting a $1.3 trillion trade deal covering GPS devices, semiconductors and touch screens.

For one officer, it was his fourth.\xc2\xa0The findings concerned many law enforcement experts, who said most officers never fire their weapons on the job. The analysis also exposed another gap in the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s oversight of fatal police shootings nationwide: the absence of a system for tracking multiple shootings by individual officers.\xc2\xa0The 55 officers were identified as part of a Post project tracking all fatal shootings by police in the line of duty in 2015. It is the first nationwide attempt to determine whether fatal police shootings are isolated events in an officer\xe2\x80\x99s career or whether some officers repeatedly fire their weapons in deadly encounters.\xc2\xa0The Post also found that another 45 officers had previously been involved in non-fatal shootings.&#8221;\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT SCHLONG-GATE:\xc2\xa0\nDonald Trump (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio)\nTrump defended his use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cschlonged\xe2\x80\x9d to describe Clinton&#8217;s 2008 Democratic primary loss, saying he did not intend\xc2\xa0it &#8220;in a vulgar way.&#8221; (Jose A.

Florida, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada all notched notable gains in population. &#8216;These states were already important in terms of electing the president\xe2\x80\xa6it just means they\xe2\x80\x99re going to become more important,&#8217; said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution in Washington. &#8230; In general, Democrats see a 2016 advantage in the fact that many of these states are gaining minorities who traditionally lean disproportionately toward Democratic candidates.\xc2\xa0But after 2020, Republicans may benefit because red states, led by Texas, are projected to gain a chunk of electoral votes during the once-a-decade reapportioning of House seats and Electoral College votes.&#8221;\n&#8212; Politico, \xe2\x80\x9cSolar blowback hits Reid&#8217;s Nevada,\xe2\x80\x9d by Esther Whieldon: \xe2\x80\x9cHarry Reid\xe2\x80\x99s home state dealt a lethal blow Tuesday to rooftop solar power \xe2\x80\x94 the latest skirmish of a nationwide green energy battle that has pitted the Senate Democratic leader against his favorite target, the Koch brothers. The move by Nevada\xe2\x80\x99s utility regulator, which voted to slash the economic incentives for homeowners to install solar panels, was most immediately a showdown between billionaires Warren Buffett, owner of the state\xe2\x80\x99s largest power company, and Elon Musk, whose SolarCity is the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest installer of panels that create electricity from the sun. But it also served as a proxy fight in a national struggle about states\xe2\x80\x99 green energy programs, in which free-market groups backed by industrialists Charles and David Koch have fought to roll back incentives that they argue distort the marketplace and force some customers to subsidize other people\xe2\x80\x99s power choices.\xe2\x80\x9d\n&#8212; Roll Call, \xe2\x80\x9cBoehner-backed candidate bows out of race to replace him,\xe2\x80\x9d by Warren Rojas: \xe2\x80\x9cButler County Auditor Roger Reynolds\xe2\x80\x99 abrupt withdrawal last week from the 16-way contest to fill the vacancy created by John Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s retirement is another sign of how little conservatives think of the former speaker. Reynolds was seen as a favorite among the 14 Republicans in the race and was believed to have Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s backing. But that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work in Reynolds\xe2\x80\x99 favor among some conservatives. \xe2\x80\x98It is pretty clear that Boehner is behind Roger Reynolds,\xe2\x80\x99 Lori Viars, a board member of the Conservative Republican Leadership Committee, told Cincinnati.com in October. And that, she hinted, might not be such a good thing. \xe2\x80\x98While Boehner is a big fish in Butler County, a lot of conservatives who vote in primaries have not been happy with him,\xe2\x80\x99 she warned.\xe2\x80\x9d\n&#8212; BuzzFeed, \xe2\x80\x9cHow earthquake scientists In Missouri stumbled on military blasts in Iraq,\xe2\x80\x9d by Dan Vergano: \xe2\x80\x9cIraq is girded by a network of 10 seismic monitoring stations that were set up in 2005 following the U.S. invasion, tied to a central facility in Baghdad first erected in the 1970s. Iraqi universities \xe2\x80\x94 using U.S. military funding \xe2\x80\x94 established these seismic monitors to map small earthquakes and watch for any signs of nuclear tests next door in Iran. But a team of American scientists report that the seismic data also includes a treasure trove of blast signatures in the strife-torn region. Lead scientist Ghassan Aleqabi of Washington University in St. Louis, who helped establish the Iraq network &#8230; stumbled on the data after correlating it to news accounts of car bombs and large explosions.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHOT ON THE LEFT\nRepublican state rep\xc2\xa0says\xc2\xa0gun-toting citizens should &#8220;help clean our society of these scumbags&#8221; after a man shot someone at a mall in Wisconsin.
