john.podesta@gmail.comb'John --\n\nI wanted to make sure you saw Lindsay\'s email from yesterday \n-- and I\'d like to point something out: \n\nYesterday\'s debate over this invasive legislation showed us \nonce again that we\'re up against some elected officials that \nlack a foundational understanding of science. One congresswoman, \nafter watching the debate, said she wondered whether high \nschool biology should be a requirement for running for office.\n\nIt really makes you wonder what these politicians are thinking \nwhen they try to put themselves between a woman and her doctor \nwhen it comes to health care decisions. \n\nStand up for women\'s health. Add your name and say you\'ll help \nkeep lawmakers out of these private decisions:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Stand-Up-For-Womens-Health \n\nThanks,\n\nJon\n\n----------Original Message----------\nFrom: Lindsay Siler, BarackObama.com\nSubject: I can\'t believe this just happened:\n\nFriend -- \n\nThis just actually happened:  \n\nThe House of Representatives passed one of the most unbelievable, \nunconstitutional attacks on women\'s health in a long time. \n\nIt\'s a bill written by Republican Arizona Congressman Trent Franks, \nwhich would ban abortions after 20 weeks, except in extremely \nlimited circumstances -- a direct legislative challenge to Roe v. Wade.\n\nAnd 228 members of Congress just voted for it. \n\nMaybe they weren\'t paying attention to the reaction of Americans \nacross the country  last year who rejected candidates who wanted \nto restrict a woman\'s access to safe, affordable health care.\n\nThat\'s a message they need to hear loud and clear right now -- if you \nthink politicians have no right to get between a woman and her health \ndecisions, add your name and say you won\'t stand for it:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Stand-Up-For-Womens-Health \n\nThis bill made it out of the House Judiciary Committee thanks to the \nvotes of 23 Republicans -- all men, of course. \n\nAnd Rep. Franks objected when opponents tried to raise the issue of \nrape, saying, "...you know, the incidence of rape resulting in \npregnancy are very low."\n\nWomen made their voices very clear last year when it came to the \nextreme positions that some elected officials took on women\'s health. \nBut that hasn\'t stopped conservative politicians from trying to repeal \nObamacare, block the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act, \nand push an agenda that uses terminology like "legitimate rape."\n\nMaking progress on smart health policy isn\'t easy, but when \nCongress is spending its time actively trying to chip away at a \nwoman\'s rights, it feels impossible. \n\nWe can\'t just sit back and hope it goes away -- we need to \nspeak up. \n\nOFA supporters are going to be on the front lines reminding \nCongress we\'re here and we care about women\'s health. \n\nJoin the fight today:\n \nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Stand-Up-For-Womens-Health\n\nThanks,\n\nLindsay\n\nLindsay Siler\nNational Director of Issue Campaigns\nOrganizing for Action\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for Action.\n\nContributions or gifts to Organizing for Action are not tax deductible.\n\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo update your address, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/change-address?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe from these messages, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscription\nOrganizing for Action, P.O.
