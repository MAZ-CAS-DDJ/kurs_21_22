Tea Party extremists are endangering our economy by threatening a government shutdown if they don't get their way.\n\nA government shut-down would be a disaster for our economy, but John Boehner is letting the inmates run the asylum. This won't be the last time these guys play chicken with your jobs, your retirement and your children's futures. The House extremist caucus is going for broke - literally.\n\nWe need to remove these guys from power before they do more damage to our country. If that process doesn't start now, we won't win. Help me protect this seat. Help me take back the House.\n\nRight-wing extremists are pulling John Boehner's levers - can you give $25 right now to remove them all from power?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/seanmaloney?refcode=20130917-d&amounts=25,35,50,100,250,500,2600\n\nYour support in the fight to take back the House could be the difference between continuing positive economic growth and a total shutdown that would cripple our recovering economy.\n\nWe're all in this together. It's your devotion and support that keeps me motivated every day.\n\nBest,\n\nSean\n\n\n\nContribute -- https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/seanmaloney?refcode=20130917-d&amounts=25,35,50,100,250,500,2600\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.\nTo unsubscribe from the Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress email list, please click here: http://action.seanmaloney.com/unsubscribe\n\n\nPAID FOR BY SEAN PATRICK MALONEY FOR CONGRESS\n\n\n"
