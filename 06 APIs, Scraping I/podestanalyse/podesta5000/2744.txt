And they say they believe most other G20 HoS are going also, straight from G20 meeting taking place on June 18-19 in Los Cabos, landing in Rio on June 19 evening. They say Calderon is pushing it as host of G20. It's a long way off and things could change but could be interesting for WJC to go to Rio since he has an invitation to do the CCI/C40 announcement on June 19 evening. If WJC doesn't go, Bloomberg will do the event anyway and take all the credit for the cities' work. The Swedish postcode folks also invited WJC to do a climate event (basically a book launch) with Nobel laureates on Rio on the 19th - I asked them to email us more details. I defer to others, just sharing what I heard. Thanks, Ami\n"
