john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John,\n\nI am writing with some very exciting news. For days, tracking\npolls in Pennsylvania have shown that not only has veteran Joe\nSestak ? one of our endorsed candidates ? gained momentum in his\nprimary race to unseat Arlen Specter, but Sestak has taken the\nlead!\n\nHELP PUT JOE SESTAK OVER THE TOP BY DONATING HERE!\nhttp://www.actblue.com/page/vv_sestak\n\nFor years, you?ve helped veterans, like myself, with the\nresources it takes to run effective campaigns. I can tell you\nfrom firsthand experience that every single dollar matters. Now,\nwe need you to step up to help Joe Sestak close out this race.\nThe election is on May 18, just days away, and we want him to\nhave enough to maintain his lead, and go to the Senate.\n\nThis primary has been brutal. ?Snarlin? Arlen Specter has pulled\nno punches, even stooping low enough to swift boat Joe Sestak,\nby attacking his honorable service. Now, voters in Pennsylvania\nare pushing back, saying they?ve had enough of the low-ball\ntactics Arlen Specter learned from the most odious conservative\npolitical hacks. It?s up to you to give Joe Sestak what he needs\nto win!\n\nDONATE TO JOE SESTAK AND HELP HIM WIN HIS RACE AGAINST SPECTER,\nHERE! - http://www.actblue.com/page/vv_sestak\n\nJoe Sestak spent most of his adult life in service to the United\nStates in the Navy, most recently in the war in Afghanistan.\nHe?s served as a trusted advisor to President Clinton, and\nleader in the Navy. While others may have retired and lived\nquietly, Joe Sestak put everything on the line to run for\nCongress and serve America, again. That?s the kind of person we\nneed in the Senate, fighting for us. Let?s show him that we?re\nthere for him!\n\nThank you for all of your support.\n\nSincerely,\nJ.
