After his aircraft was shot down by enemy fire in North Vietnam, he spent nearly eight years as a prisoner of war.  One of the highest-ranking officers to be taken prisoner in Vietnam, he endured torture, starvation, and years of solitary confinement with extraordinary fortitude.  The valor that he and his fellow POWs displayed was deeply inspiring to our nation at the time, and it continues to inspire our brave men and women who serve today.  As Senator, he served as a strong advocate for our national security.  He leaves behind a legacy of heroic service to his country, and Michelle and I send our condolences to the Denton family.\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe<http://messages.whitehouse.gov/accounts/USEOPWHPO/subscriber/new?preferences=true>\r\n\r\nThe White House \xc2\xb7 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \xc2\xb7 Washington DC 20500 \xc2\xb7 202-456-1111\r\n'
