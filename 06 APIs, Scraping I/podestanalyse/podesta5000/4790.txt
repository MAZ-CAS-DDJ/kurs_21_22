Their gift of $5\nmillion is the largest gift from living donors in Knox\xe2\x80\x99s 177-year\nhistory.\n\nYou will receive this news shortly this morning in the President's\nCircular, and I will make the campus announcement sometime after noon\nat the luncheon for Admitted Student Days.\n\nYou should all know that this gift is the result of extraordinary work\nby Mark Wilson, who has built a special relationship with the\nWhitcombs over the years.  I have met with them twice in the company\nof Mark, and can attest to their genuine fondness for him and their\nlove for Knox.\n\nStay tuned for the President's Circular!\n\nTeresa\n\n\n-- \n*************************************\nTeresa L.
