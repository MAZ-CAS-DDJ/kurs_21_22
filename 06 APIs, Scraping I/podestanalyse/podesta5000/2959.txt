Thank you, Matthew. Thank you for being\nhere, pal. Great to see you.

My\nfriends, we have to drill offshore. We have to do it! *Oil executives say\nwithin a couple years we could be seeing results from it. So why not\ndo it?*We need to do it.\n\nAnd I was pleased to note that*, in case you missed it, when the President\nannounced that we were lifting the Federal moratorium on offshore drilling\nthat the price of oil went down ten dollars a barrel. *So it does, if\nAmerica can show as we move into this energy independent era, that we have\nsignificant oil and gas reserves and we aren\'t dependent on foreign oil, it\nwill have an effect on the price of a barrel of oil. So it can have a\nbeneficial effect in the short term, as well as the long term.\n(Town Hall Meeting; Rochester, NH 07/22/08)\nTO VIEW: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--aqFz9ubMU\nTO DOWNLOAD: http://issuealliance.box.net/shared/wtxxj5fsww\n\nMcCain: "Obama Would Rather Lose A War In Order To Win A Political\nCampaign."\nJOHN MCCAIN: I had the courage and the judgment to say that I would rather\nlose a political campaign then lose a war. It seems to me that Senator Obama\nwould rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign.\n(Town Hall; Rochester, NH 07/22/08)\nTO VIEW: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZfQx7u2Sh0\n\nMcCain Slips Up on "Czechoslovakia" a Third Time, Explains the Gaffe\nQUESTIONER: Russia, question mark?\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: First of all, Mitt has been a tremendous help to my campaign.\nHe has been on television, he does a better job for me than he did for\nhimself. [...] Our party is united and we have a lot of energizing work to\ndo. But we are united.\n\nI\'m very concerned about Russia. Very concerned that just recently *because\nthe Czechs agreed with us on a missile defense system, that they cut the gas\nsupplies, the oil supplies to the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Remember,\nexcuse me, Czech Republic. I used to call it, [laughs]. The Czech Republic,\nas you know is been a very staunch and aligning friend. And as you know, the\nCzech Republic and Slovakia split years ago, from time to time, some of us\nmistake and say Czechoslovakia. Where the fact is it\'s the Czech Republic.*\n\nAnd so, they are staunch allies. And so the questions in response to their\nagreement on missile defense, the Czech\'s have had their oil supplies\nreduced. And that\'s not the way we expect Russia to behave. There are plenty\nof enormous pressures on Georgia. They have not agreed with us and helped us\nin trying to restrain the Iranian progress towards the acquisition of\nnuclear weapons.\n\nSo the Russian behavior is more and more autocratic. And the internal\nstifling of dissent is of great concern. And by the way, our friends the\nCzech\'s have been our friends for a long time. They were behind the Iron\nCurtain, as you know. And both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have been\ngood friends of ours since they split. So we need to make sure that we can\nhelp them. In particularly, point out that the Russian behavior, basically\nblackmailing their neighbors is not something that\'s acceptable in the world\ntoday.\n\nSo I worry about Russia. *I don\'t think there\'s going to be a return to Cold\nWar,* that\'s not what I\'m talking about. But Russian behavior becomes less\nand less in the interest of us throughout the world, frankly, then we had\nhoped and anticipated when the Berlin Wall came down.\n(Town Hall Meeting; Rochester, NH 7/22/08)\nTO VIEW: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1za-EXX_Yd4\n\nPot Calling the Kettle Black: McCain Says Rewards From Big Tobacco Prevent\nProgress In The War Against Cancer\nPAULA ZAHN: [...] *Are you essentially saying that those members of Congress\nare being bought and sold by the tobacco lobbies and that\'s why this issue\nwon\'t move forward?*\n\nMCCAIN: I believe that the reason why we failed in enacting the legislation\nthat passed through the Commerce Committee that I was chairman of, with one\ndissenting vote, that the reason why we failed was because of the influence\nof the tobacco companies, yes. And any objective observer would tell you\nthat.\n\nZAHN: So as president what would you do about that? How do you stop that?\n\nMCCAIN: I would lead America. I would lead America, and I would tell the\nAmerican people to clean up this mess. My friends, how many people just were\nshocked when they filled up their gas tank? You know what Congress is doing\ntoday to try to address our energy problems? They\'re in gridlock. Gridlock,\ndoing nothing. We\'re doing nothing. It\'s time American\'s put our country\nfirst and our party second. [...] *If you asked anyone who observed our\nefforts to enact this legislation at the time, they will tell you that it is\nwas the influence of the tobacco company. *Now there were many members of\nCongress, and I don\'t know which ones that had honestly held views about in\nopposition to the legislation that we reported out of the committee that I\nchaired. And I respect those honestly held views, but I also believe that\nthe tobacco companies played a very big role in making sure that legislation\ndid not pass the United States Senate.\n\nZAHN: *So what is it that members of Congress are afraid of in going up\nagainst the tobacco lobbyists?* I mean obviously we know the kind of money\nthat is contributed to campaigns. Above and beyond that, what is their fear?\n\nMCCAIN:* I\'m not sure that they\'re fear-- I think that they\'re rewarded.*\n\nZAHN:* Rewarded in what way?*\n\nMCCAIN:* Campaign contributions, many other ways. There\'s many ways that\nthat happens in Washington.*\n\nZAHN: And how do you stop that?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, the American people are sick and tired of being sick and\ntired. And they want Washington cleaned up. And I will lead that effort. I\ndidn\'t win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate again this year\nbecause I took on the special interests, I\'ve taken on the special\ninterests. I\'ve joined with Russ Feingold with campaign finance reform, I\nhave joined with Ted Kennedy on immigration reform. [...] So, I\'ve taken on\nthe special interests and I\'ve fought against them. And as President of the\nUnited States I think I can be much more effective. I think that\'s what\npresidents can do.\n(Speech / Forum; Columbus, OH 07/24/08)\nTO VIEW: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tha-_R8aoL4\n\nMcCain: We Need To "Concentrate" V.A. Care on Wounds "Directly the Result of\nCombat"\nQUESTIONER: [...] Sir, I\'m a disabled Iraq war veteran. Myself, along with\nother disabled veterans have been having difficulties receiving benefits\nfrom the VA. The issue is from the adjudication process that hasn\'t been\nchanged since World War I. When you become president, and I do mean when you\nbecome president, will you facilitate change in the adjudication process\nthat is 90 years old?\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: We did make some improvements in legislation that was recently\npassed by the Congress. We need to do more. But I think you would agree,\nfirst of all I thank you for your service. [...] Thank you, we have veterans\nof all wars here and of course you continue to inspire all of us. Uh, look,\nI carry with me usually a little card and a quote from General George\nWashington in 1789. That\'s why I mention our greatest generation being here\ntoo. And basically what he said in 1789, and I\'m not as eloquent, he said\nthe willingness with which young Americans will serve their country in time\nof war will be directly related to how the veterans of previous wars were\ntreated by their fellow countrymen. Those words are as true today as they\nwere then.\n\n"I think we have great people working for the VA, I think you would agree\nwith that. We have wonderful, dedicated people. I was recently down at the\nPhoenix VA, and met with them, some of them. And they\'re doing a great job.\n\n"But we also know there\'s not enough facility, and there\'s not enough care.\nSo here\'s my idea. And it\'s not originated with me, but I\'ve consulted with\nso many, Paul, and Griff, and so many others who are here. *Look, we need to\nconcentrate our efforts to handle those wounds and those disabilities that\nare directly the result of combat. We need to expand our ability to treat\nPTSD. PTSD is going to be tough in this war, you know that. *And we need to\ntreat the combat wounds. We need to have increased ability to do so and\nright now, unfortunately, there are people who are, now drive a long way and\nthey stand in line, and they have a routine healthcare need. And they stand\nin line, and they stand in line, to get an appointment, to get an\nappointment.\n\n"Now my friends, we need to give those veterans who have routine healthcare\nneeds a plastic card and say take that to the doctor, the healthcare\nprovider of your choice and get the care you need. And meanwhile,\n[interrupted by applause] concentrate on our ability to treat PTSD, those\nwounds. The good news is, as you know, we\'re getting the wounded more\nquickly to medical care than ever before and we\'re saving so many lives.\n(Town Hall; Rochester, NH 07/22/08)\nTO VIEW: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEhS-5KW0II\nTO DOWNLOAD: http://issuealliance.box.net/shared/2ql1auko44\n\nMcCain Says He Still Believes in McCain-Feingold\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Now that you\'re the Republican nominee for President of\nthese United States, do you have any second thoughts on McCain-Feingold\ncampaign finance reform?\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: This meeting is adjourned. [crowd laughs] I do not. I believe\nthat today, still, the influence of special interests in Washington [has]\ncrowded out the interests of the average citizens of the United States of\nAmerica who are not represented by big money interests in Washington. Before\nwe passed our legislation, it was routine for a trial lawyer, a union leader\nor a corporation executive to be called by a powerful member of Congress and\nsay, I need a 6-figure or sometimes 7-figure check from you, and by the way,\nyour legislation is up before my committee next week. And that\'s where all\nthis earmarking and pork-barrelling also that corrupted us.\n\nCorruption. I don\'t use that word lightly, my friends. We have former\nmembers of Congress residing in federal prison. If that isn\'t corruption, I\ndon\'t know what is. So, we tried very hard. And I\'ll continue to try very\nhard to reduce the influence of special interests.\n\nLook at the energy bill. I voted against the energy bill. Senator Obama\nvoted for it. Look at the farm bill. [...]\n\nSo I\'ll continue to work to try to clean up and reduce--maybe never\neliminate, but reduce the influence of special interests in Washington, DC.\nAnd I\'d like to tell you that I think that in Washington today that your\ninterests are uppermost. And I don\'t think they are in a lot of the\nlegislative business that we do. So we\'ll have to continue to work to try to\nmake sure that we can eliminate some of these very terrible practices that\nhave become commonplace. And I also will count on some of our citizens to\nexercise their voice at the ballot booth.\n(Town Hall Meeting; Wilkes-Barre, PA 07/23/08)\nTO VIEW: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwOkulZlr_k\nTO DOWNLOAD: http://issuealliance.box.net/shared/gifj5tp40c\n\nAudience Member Uses Four-Letter Word, Criticizes McCain\'s Staff Members\nMCCAIN: There\'s a phone, er, microphone. Call me? [laughter]\n\nQUESTIONER: [...] You are, without a doubt, a true American hero. Senator\nMcCain, you are the man that we want as President of the United States. I\'m\ngoing to do a little straight talk. You\'re a straight talker and so am I.\nVery much. I\'m a diehard Yankee and I\'m a straight-talker.\n\nMCCAIN: I could never tell from your accent.\n\nQUESTIONER: Mine\'s not really a question, it\'s a statement. It\'s a statement\nabout a lot of your campaign staff members. *And I\'ll tell you right now, I\nknow, I\'m going to be right at the top of their shit-list. But I could care\nless.*\n\nMCCAIN: *shhh!*\n\nQUESTIONER: You have a lot of people here, I\'m one of your volunteers that\nhas been doing work for you since I met you in October. There are a lot of\npeople here that are volunteering their time. You got two people sitting\nright here next to me, [names them], they have done more work for you\nvolunteering than a lot of your paid staffers have.\n\nMCCAIN: A lot of them are on work-release programs.\n\nQUESTIONER: And a lot of your signs outside today, they were put up by us\nnot by your staff people.\n\nMCCAIN: I understand and I thank you.\n\nQUESTIONER: You gotta make some changes.\n\nMCCAIN: I\'m going to put you in charge.\n\nQUESTIONER: I think you should put [names] in charge. They\'ve done some good\nwork for you, you got thousands and thousands of people who love you, admire\nyou, respect you greatly, and we want you as our next President of the\nUnited States.\n(Town Hall; Rochester, NH 07/22/08)\nTO VIEW: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMhLjjlB8Iw\nTO DOWNLOAD: http://issuealliance.box.net/shared/sztp5f1kog\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
