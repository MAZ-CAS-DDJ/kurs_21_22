In the next few weeks, volunteers in your neighborhood are hosting an Action Planning Session -- and you should be there.\n\nThis is your chance to get in on the ground floor of planning what OFA will do over the next few months. \n\nHere are the details -- can you make it?\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Action-Planning-Session\n\n     What: Action Planning Session\n\n      \n\nRSVP now:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Action-Planning-Session\n\nYou'll be able to sit down with neighbors and help lay the foundation for your prospective OFA activities -- organizers will provide materials to guide the conversation, but they'll be turning over the brainstorming, creative thinking, and ambitious planning to you.\n\nWhether you've been a part of the local grassroots movement in your community for years or you're just getting involved now, you have something to contribute to the conversation. Don't miss out on this opportunity to have a say in what happens next.\n\nRSVP now for the Action Planning Session near you:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Action-Planning-Session\n\nThanks,\n\nSara\n\nSara El-Amine\nNational Organizing Director\nOrganizing for Action\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for Action\n\nContributions or gifts to Organizing for Action are not tax deductible.\n\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo update your address, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/change-address?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe from these messages, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscription\nOrganizing for Action, P.O.
