Larry\xe2\x80\x99s going to make\n> some comments from the legal point of view, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll chime in on what\n> I\xe2\x80\x99ve been observing in the states.  Thanks for taking time out of what must\n> be a crazy schedule to join us at this week\xe2\x80\x99s board meeting.   Sue\n>\n>\n>\n> *From:* Tierney, Susan\n> *Sent:* Monday, March 07, 2016 1:47 AM\n> *To:* Larry Kramer; Carol Larson; Pamela Matson; Kristian Parker; John\n> Podesta (John.podesta@gmail.com\n> <javascript:_e(%7B%7D,'cvml','John.podesta@gmail.com');>); Charlotte Pera\n> *Subject:* the upcoming Marth 18th ClimateWorks Board meeting in San\n> Fran: one relatively urgent matter, and a few other items.\n>\n>\n>\n> Hi everyone \xe2\x80\x93\n>\n>\n>\n> As you probably recall, the next Board meeting will take place in San\n> Francisco, and will follow up on the Funders Table meetings that will also\n> take place there that week.   I have a few requests of all of you ahead of\n> the meeting.  The first is relatively urgent; the others less so.\n>\n>\n>\n> First, another board member:  What would you think of inviting Christiana\n> Figueres to join the Board?  It\xe2\x80\x99s a little unorthodox that I would make\n> such a suggestion by email, but here\xe2\x80\x99s the backstory:  Charlotte was in\n> Europe this past week, where among other things she participated in a\n> discussion with Christiana and others about her (CF\xe2\x80\x99s) next steps, after\n> she leaves her position in July.  That conversation got Charlotte thinking\n> about moving relatively quickly to discuss amongst ourselves (within our\n> CWF Board) the possibility of approaching Christiana about a spot on the\n> CWF board.  Charlotte and I talked about it today.  I personally think that\n> Christiana would be a fabulous addition, and we\xe2\x80\x99d be lucky to have her.\n>  You may have other perspectives, so I\xe2\x80\x99m inviting you to weigh in.  The\n> reason I\xe2\x80\x99m bringing this up by email rather than in Executive Session at\n> the Board meeting itself is timing:  Christiana will be in San Francisco\n> during the week of the Funders Table, and will likely be leaving town by\n> Friday.  (She has a scheduling conflict and had to decline our invitation\n> to join our dinner on Thursday.)   If we thought that it were a good idea\n> to raise the topic with CF, Charlotte would be able to do so during sidebar\n> discussions prior to our meeting.  That would only happen, though, if we\n> all think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea in general and if we think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to\n> jump so quickly.  If you think it might be a good idea but you\xe2\x80\x99d like time\n> to discuss it, then of course we will take whatever time is needed to have\n> that discussion.  And some of you may have reasons to think it\xe2\x80\x99s not a good\n> idea at all, so please speak up.  In any event, this is a\n>\n>\n>\n> Second, please get your toasts ready!  This will be Bill Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s last\n> board meeting as \xe2\x80\x98Emeritus Chair\xe2\x80\x99 (after which he\xe2\x80\x99ll transition to being\n> invited to special events but will not attend regular board meetings).  At\n> the dinner on Thursday evening ahead of the Friday Board meeting, we\xe2\x80\x99ll\n> have a chance to celebrate his service to ClimateWorks from its Day One.\n> I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping that each of you might be willing to say a very brief word of\n> two to honor him.  Carol, if you think it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate to mention\n> something about his prior service at the Packard Foundation, feel free.\n> And John, if you think there\xe2\x80\x99s something special to say about his\n> government service, feel free to add that too.  The Board dinner will also\n> include representatives from the Funders Table foundations, so I think\n> we\xe2\x80\x99ll want to make these relatively brief but still memorable comments.\n>\n>\n>\n> Third, at our Board meeting, we\xe2\x80\x99re anticipating two possible topics to\n> discuss informally during lunch.  John: would you be willing, once again,\n> to share your thoughts about the current state of affairs on the various\n> stumps?  And John and Larry:  would you comment on the implications of the\n> Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s stay of the Clean Power Plan?  I\xe2\x80\x99ll chime in with my own\n> two cents after you, but I think it would be really interesting to hear\n> your legal perspective, Larry, and then your policy/political view, John.\n> I\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to share what I know/hear about from the perspective of\n> states\xe2\x80\x99 actions.\n>\n>\n>\n> Ok, that\xe2\x80\x99s it.
