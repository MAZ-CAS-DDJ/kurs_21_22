Nationally we are seeing clean energy starting to\n> compete head-to-head with fossil fuels \xe2\x80\x94 and win. In the first half of\n> 2015, renewables account for more than two-thirds of new electricity\n> generation across the United States. On a level playing field, these\n> renewable resources are already in many cases the cheapest electricity\n> options for new installations. This is fantastic news for consumers, but\n> even better news for American jobs. In 2014, the solar industry was the top\n> job creator in the whole energy sector. And accelerating the shift to clean\n> energy would lower electricity bills and add millions more well-paying jobs\n> right here in the United States.\n>\n>\n>\n> The clean energy revolution is finally happening but in order to lead\xe2\x80\x94or\n> even be competitive\xe2\x80\x94we need leaders who are willing to keep pushing the\n> envelope and accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy.\n>\n>\n>\n> That is why we\xe2\x80\x99re calling on candidates and elected officials to\n> demonstrate bold leadership and lay out a clear and concrete plan to\n> achieve at least 50 percent clean or carbon-free energy by 2030. Reaching\n> this goal would more than triple renewable energy in our country\xe2\x80\x94putting us\n> on the pathway to a 100 percent clean energy economy by 2050 and millions\n> of new jobs.\n>\n>\n>\n> This goal, which should serve as the minimum starting point for candidates\n> and elected officials truly committed to accelerating America\xe2\x80\x99s transition\n> to a clean energy economy, will give our businesses the tools they need to\n> do what they do best\xe2\x80\x94innovate, create, and lead the world.  More\n> importantly, it will show the American people that our leaders are getting\n> serious about climate change and finally standing up for our kids.\n>\n>\n>\n> The leadership we have already seen from many of you encourages us, but\n> now is the time to double down. American business is ready. Voters are\n> looking for solutions. Today, we call on all candidates from both political\n> parties, up-and-down the ballot, to put forward their own concrete,\n> detailed clean energy plans so that the American voters can decide for\n> themselves who has the best solution to grow our clean energy economy and\n> address climate change.\n>\n>\n>\n> Sincerely,\n>\n>\n>\n> Wendy Abrams\n>\n>\n>\n> Linda Rosenberg Ach\n>\n>\n>\n> Gary Arabian\n>\n>\n>\n> Doug & Leslie Ballinger\n>\n> James Balog\n>\n> *Founder and Director, Earth Vision Institute and Extreme Ice Survey*\n>\n>\n>\n> Janice & Matt Barger\n>\n>\n>\n> Kathleen C Barry, PhD\n>\n>\n>\n> Anne Bartley\n>\n>\n>\n> Andrew A.
