WJC said he'd help and he asked them to send us a memo with more details on how much they want to raise, what they want the money for, who they're targetting; and WJC said he'd make some calls. He mentioned Gates, Buffett, and Wal-Mart Foundations. WJC suggested they focus their pitch around STEM education and Morehouse's assistance for Haitian students. \r\n\r\nMorehouse also invited WJC to give their commencement talk on May 20. WJC said he'd like to. \r\n\r\nAndy Young asked WJC to come to Atlanta for his birthday sometime in March or April or May. WJC said he would, and he said to focus on April. \r\n\r\nWJC said we could consider inviting these folks to CGI America, since there was a Commitment last year focusing on STEM education, but he said let's wait and see the memo they send us. \r\nHope this helps,\r\nAmi"
