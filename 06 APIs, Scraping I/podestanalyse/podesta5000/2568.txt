Since we first announced that Speaker Boehner's buddies were going on TV with a $12,OOO,OOO ad blitz attacking Democrats in the tightest races, we've been AMAZED at how many people have stepped up.\n\nIN FACT, we're just 800 donations away from meeting our four-week-out budget deadline. If we meet this, we will be able to stand up and go toe-to-toe with Boehner and his ultra-wealthy GOP allies. If not, we could fall behind.\n\nCan you click here and contribute before it's too late? Even a small contribution will go SUCH a long way. \n\nIf you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:\n\nDonate $3 instantly >>\n\nDonate $15 instantly >>\n\nDonate $25 instantly >>\n\nOr donate another amount instantly >>\nThanks,\n\nDemocratic Alerts\n\n\n\nContributions or gifts to House Majority PAC are not tax deductible\n\nPaid for by House Majority PAC. www.thehousemajoritypac.com.
