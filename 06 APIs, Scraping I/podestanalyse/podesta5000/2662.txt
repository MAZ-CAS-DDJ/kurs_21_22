No on Prop 4"\nbanner to fly over Palin rally today\n<edenjames@gmail.com>\n\n*PRESS RELEASE\n*\n\n*FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n*\n\n*October 4, 2008*\n\n*CONTACT:*\n\n Todd Beeton, (323) 440-3350\n\n Rick Jacobs, (310) 245-6660\n\n\n\n*"Courage" to Take Flight over Sarah Palin rally in Carson Today *\n\n*The Courage Campaign - an Online Organizing Network - Launches Aerial\nAdvertising Blitz with "Sarah Palin - Thanks, But No Thanks! No on Prop. 4"\nAirplane Banner*\n\nCARSON, CA - The Courage Campaign Issues Committee, the ballot measure\ncommittee that is part of the Courage Campaign family\'s online organizing\nnetwork of nearly 100,000 members, today launched an aerial advertising\nblitz featuring an aircraft towing a banner stating "Sarah Palin - Thanks,\nBut No Thanks! No on Prop. 4".\n\nThe message is a result of an online contest asking Courage Campaign members\nwhat they wanted to say to McCain running mate Sarah Palin as she attended\nan outdoor rally at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California.\n\nDuring an interview with CBS News, Katie Couric asked "If a 15-year-old is\nraped by her father, you believe it should be illegal for her to get an\nabortion. Why?" Palin\'s reply was "I am pro-life. And I\'m unapologetic about\nmy position..."\n\n"Unbelievable. Sarah Palin is \'unapologetic\' about denying a 15-year-old\ngirl the fundamental right to choose, even if the girl has been raped by her\nown father," Rick Jacobs, chair of the Courage Campaign Issues Committee,\nsaid. "With such extreme views on reproductive rights and the health and\nsafety of our teens, Palin is clearly out of step with Californians,\nespecially on Prop 4."\n\nProposition 4, which will be on the California ballot in November, threatens\nteen safety by mandating parental notification prior to a minor\'s\nterminating a pregnancy. While parents should be involved in their\nteenagers\' lives, in the real world laws like this don\'t work. Prop 4 can\'t\nforce teens to talk to their parents, but it may force them to do something\ndesperate and dangerous. Having failed twice, this is the third time in the\nlast four years that the right wing has used the initiative process to try\nto repeal women\'s and family\'s rights.\n\nJacobs said Palin has a history of supporting measures like Prop 4. In late\n2007, the Alaska Supreme Court struck down a parental consent law as\nunconstitutional, ruling on a 3-2 vote that it infringed on a girl\'s rights\nto reproductive freedom. Governor Palin called the decision "outrageous" and\nthen appointed a conservative judge to the court, shifting the balance of\npower. That decision earned her praise from Alaska Right to Life, the\nstate\'s leading pro-life group.\n\n"Last Thursday\'s performance on CBS proved the issues important to\nCalifornians are over Sarah Palin\'s head, so we figured the best way to\nreach her was to literally go over her head," added Jacobs, describing the\ninspiration for Saturday\'s action. "Our people-powered campaign leading to\nSaturday\'s fly-over at the Home Depot Center provided us a way to reach a\ncaptive audience of thousands in the stadium and literally millions of\nSouthern Californians."\n\nThe winning message was selected from more than 2,200 online entries from\nCourage Campaign members throughout the state.
