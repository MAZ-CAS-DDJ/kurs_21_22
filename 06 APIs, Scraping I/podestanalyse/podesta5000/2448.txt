john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\n\n\n\nHope things are well with you and things are not too hectic. I am writing\nto ask for your help. A DAS job has opened up in the Political-Military\nAffairs Bureau here at State and I have thrown my hat in the ring as a\ncandidate and was hoping you might weigh in on my behalf.\n\n\n\nThis would be a great move for me and one that I believe I am very\nqualified for. I am currently working on these very issues (arms sales and\nsecurity assistance) as the advisor to U/S Rose Gottemoeller responsible\nfor the PM portfolio. I also previously worked as a senior advisor to\nformer PM A/S Andrew Shapiro. So I know the bureau, both its issues and\npersonnel, inside and out. The PM Bureau is also about to lose its top\nthree officials (A/S, PDAS, and this DAS job) so having someone who can hit\nthe ground running with such little time left in the Administration is\ncritically important.\n\n\n\nThis is also a job that I would want to continue with into the next\nAdministration (assuming you all pull it out!). Given that this portfolio\ndeals with a lot of sensitive arms sales transfer issues, particularly with\nthe Israelis, it might be beneficial to have some continuity during the\nbeginning of a new Administration.\n\n\n\nI am pushing internally for the position and have already interviewed with\nthe Deputy Chief of Staff Jen Stout, who handles personnel at State. Rose\nis also pushing for me as well. But I know the White House will develop a\nseparate slate of candidates as well and I was hoping you would be willing\nto weigh in on my behalf with the White House. I believe the two most\ndirectly involved with personnel are:\n\n\n\nValerie Green, Director of PPO:  Valerie_E_Green@nsc.eop.gov\n<http://redirect.state.sbu/?url=mailto:Valerie_E_Green@nsc.eop.gov>\n\n\nChristopher Le Mon, responsible for the National Security jobs at PPO:\nChristopher_J._Le_Mon@who.eop.gov\n\n\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything else I can provide.  Also congrats\non a great past week for the campaign!\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nMax\n'
