john.podesta@gmail.comb'Friends:\n\nI am sending this to a very special and select group of friends and\nsupporters who have stepped up in a big way to support my campaign for\nmayor.  You are getting this email because when I needed you, you answered\nthe call and donated $1000 to my campaign.  *Thank you for being such an\namazing friend.*\n\nSince you donated, however, the City of Los Angeles Ethics Commission\nincreased the maximum campaign donation to $1300, which means you can\ndonate an additional $300 to my campaign.  I am writing you today to ask\nyou to click here <http://bit.ly/donateEric> and donate an additional $300\ntoday, *just four days before our fundraising deadline.  Y*ou just put\n"$300" in the "other" box, put in your credit card and personal information\nand hit "process donation".  It\'s that easy.\n\nThe good news is after donating an additional $300, I won\'t bother you\nagain to donate any more money :-)  The even better news is that your\ndonation will keep us out in front as the campaign with the enthusiasm,\nideas, and people that will propel us to victory in the Spring.\n\nWe have had an incredible beginning to this campaign, and every poll shows\nme poised to make the runoff after the March election if I can raise the\nresources necessary.\n\nSince launching the campaign:\n\n* We have been on top in fundraising for both of the previous fundraising\ndeadlines\n* We have visited over 80 of the 99 neighborhoods in Los Angeles for living\nroom conversations with everyday Angelenos and voters\n* We have released more than 1000 endorsements of community leaders\n* We have hundreds of volunteers who have already helped the campaign get\nits message out more than five months from the election\n\n*All of this has been possible because of you.*\n\nAmazingly, over 70 percent of our donors are new to LA politics, which\nreflects an unmatched level of grassroots support and enthusiasm.\n\n*I need to ask your help one more time: can you please donate $300\ntoday--visit our donation page <http://bit.ly/donateEric> right now and\nensure that we stay on top in this race.  *With your help, we will inspire\nLos Angeles to be a great city again.\n\nI\'ll be following up this email with individual emails to each of you\nbetween now and the September 30th deadline--that\'s in just four days, so\ndon\'t delay or put it off\n.  And I hope I will get the chance to write to each of you, but in case I\ndon\'t get to you, understand that I am working 7am to 10pm 7 days a week\ngetting the word out about this campaign (this weekend we put 300 miles on\nthe campaign car visiting 15 neighborhoods in two days for campaign events,\nthrew in a flight to SF for a fundraiser on Saturday night, picked up the\nendorsement of three prominent elected officials, held six fundraising\nevents, and I even got to do some policy work!).\n\nYou have been amazing--thanks again for all of your help before our Sunday\ndeadline.\n\nLet\'s go win this race and put LA back on top again.\n\nWarmest regards,\n\nEric\n\nP.S. I wrote this myself, so forgive any mistakes.  As always, let me know\nhow you are doing and any suggestions you might have for me.\n\n-- \nERIC GARCETTI\ncheck out my City Hall work at http://www.cd13.com\nlearn more about my campaign for Mayor at http://www.ericgarcetti.com\nto donate to my campaign: http://bit.ly/donateEric\nto follow me on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ericgarcetti\nto visit my Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/garcetti\n'
