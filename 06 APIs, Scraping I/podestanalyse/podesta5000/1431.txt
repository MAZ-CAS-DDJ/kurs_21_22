Ed and he are connecting and off to a good start opening up the blog to new voices and we are more staffed up to better help Brad do what he does even better. He\'s doing a brown bag for us tomorrow and people are looking forward to it.\n\n\nSent from my T-Mobile 4G LTE Device\n\n\n\n\n\n-------- Original message --------\nFrom: John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>\nDate: 05/21/2014 12:16 PM (GMT-05:00)\nTo: Heather Boushey <HBoushey@equitablegrowth.org>\nSubject: Re: Special issue of the Washington Monthly + quick update\n\n\n\nSounds great. Might be worth getting Jason to do a piece for the Monthly cribbing from the speech he gave post Picketty.  How is Brad doing?\n\nOn May 21, 2014 8:32 AM, "Heather Boushey" <HBoushey@equitablegrowth.org<mailto:HBoushey@equitablegrowth.org>> wrote:\nHello John,\n\nIt was nice to see you last week and I enjoyed your Wait, Wait appearance. Nice!\n\nBack in October, you connected me with Paul Glastris from the Washington Monthly. We now have a plan to move forward on a special issue and I wanted to share it with you. Ed is going to start reaching out to potential authors in the coming weeks and if you have any thoughts or reactions, please let me know.\n\nIn other news, things are going well. A few highlights:\n\n  *   We will soft-launch the re-launch of the webpage next week and we have a number of columns/issue briefs by steering committee and RAB members, along with some in-house work.\n  *   We have an event with Atif Mian and Amir Sufi a week from tomorrow, as well as a lunch with policy makers and the two authors.\n  *   Brad is in town this week and we\'re working with him to put together some ideas for Piketty momentum follow up; Elisabeth and I are meeting with Jason and Betsey next week to discuss this and other ideas.\n  *   Elisabeth Jacobs is a wonderful (wonderful!) addition to the team - we had 12 people at our team meeting this week and we feel like an actual organization. Woo hoo!\n  *   The senior team is doing a management retreat today to focus on how we will work as a team to achieve the 2014 goals we\'ve laid out, which I\'m very excited about.\n\nThat\'s all for now.\n\nBest,\nHeather\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nHeather Boushey\nExecutive Director and Chief Economist\nWashington Center for Equitable Growth\n1333 H Street, NW, 2nd Floor\nWashington, DC 20005\n\nhboushey@e<mailto:hboushey@americanprogress.org>quitablegrowth.org<http://quitablegrowth.org/>\nDesk: (202) 741-6247<tel:%28202%29%20741-6247>\nTwitter: @hboushey\n'
