In a speech to the Conservative\nPolitical Action Conference in the morning, Bush plans to say that the\nnominee of the party will be a strong conservative, according to excerpts\nreleased by the White House tonight.\nhttp://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/02/07/bush_signals_support_for_mccai.html\n\n*The GOP Votes for Safety (Real Clear Politics, 2/8/08)*\nOn Super Tuesday, John McCain secured the Republican nomination. How did\nthat happen? Simple. In the absence of a compelling conservative, the\nRepublican electorate turned to the apostate sheriff. \x85 \x85 But there\'s an\neven more profound reason why no Reagan showed up this election cycle and\nwhy the apostate sheriff is going to win the nomination. The reason is\nGeorge W. Bush. He redefined conservatism with a "compassionate" variant\nthat is a distinct departure from classic Reaganism.\nhttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/02/the_gop_votes_for_safety.html\n* *\n*Romney Out, McCain Looks Ahead (Washington Post, 2/8/08)*\nSen. John McCain effectively sealed the Republican presidential nomination\nyesterday when former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney abruptly left the\nrace. The senator from Arizona immediately turned his attention to repairing\nrelations with disgruntled conservatives and to opening the general election\ncampaign with a sharp critique of his Democratic rivals.\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/07/AR2008020704239.html?hpid=topnews\n*Link to video Washington Post\'s Dan Balz analysis of events at CPAC: *\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/video/2008/02/07/VI2008020703393.html?sid=ST2008020800120\n* *\n*McCain Dances With His Own Party (The Page, 2/8/08)*\nKarl Rove on Thursday donated $2,300 via the Internet to McCain\'s\npresidential campaign \x97 maxing out with symbolic authority.\nhttp://thepage.time.com/2008/02/08/mccain-dances-with-his-own-party/\n*Link to video of analyst discussing top GOP contributors to McCain\'s\ncampaign:*\nhttp://thepage.time.com/video-halperin-discusses-mccain-support-on-fox/\n* *\n*Romney exit sets McCain\'s course (USA Today, 2/7/08)*\nJohn McCain moved closer to locking up the Republican nomination for\npresident after his best-financed opponent ended his campaign Thursday, but\nthe Arizona senator still faces the task of winning over skeptical\nconservative activists.\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-02-07-romney_N.htm\n* *\n*McCain\'s Veep Options (Wall Street Journal, 2/8/08)*\nWhile congratulations are still premature, with Mitt Romney dropping out of\nthe race yesterday it is now very likely that the Republican Party will\nnominate Sen. John McCain for president. If that happens, the GOP will, for\nthe first time since 1976, select a candidate at odds with a large portion\nof its conservative members to be the standard bearer. At the same time, the\nparty is more estranged from independent swing voters than it has been for\ndecades. This will pose a twin challenge for Mr. McCain. To meet it, he will\nhave to become the champion of the brand of economic conservatism that has\nwon national elections for Republicans since 1980.\nhttp://online.wsj.com/article/SB120243266768552299.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries\n* *\n*GOP Plaudits for McCain -- and a Few Olive Branches (Washington Post,\n2/8/08)*\nJohn McCain returned to the Senate yesterday to collect backslapping\ncongratulations from fellow Republicans, who rallied around their party\'s\nlikely presidential nominee even though many have opposed their maverick\ncolleague in Congress and on the campaign trail.\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/07/AR2008020702674.html?sid=ST2008020800120\n\n*McCain gets his party\'s cold shoulder (LA Times, 2/7/08)*\nWith John McCain racking up delegates on a steady march toward the\nRepublican presidential nomination, deeply conservative voters are at a\nloss. They don\'t like McCain. They\'ve tried, and failed, to stop him. So it\nwas with growing frustration, and an unaccustomed sense of impotence, that\nmany conservatives surveyed the electoral map Wednesday.\nhttp://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-right7feb07,1,2964167.story\n\n*Cheney passes up chance to talk up McCain at conservative convention (Raw\nStory 2/7/08)*\nVice President Dick Cheney predicted Thursday that the next president would\nbe a Republican but steered clear of commenting on John McCain\'s\nfront-runner status or efforts by some conservative activists to deny him\nthe GOP nomination.\nhttp://rawstory.com/news/2008/Cheney_passes_up_chance_to_talk_0207.html\n\n*Rove flubs on Romney; Is Fox getting its money worth? (Raw Story 2/7/08)*\nAs rumors circulated that Mitt Romney would end his presidential campaign,\nthe network turned to Rove on Thursday afternoon for remarks based on\nconversations between "Bush\'s Brain" and his supposedly well-placed sources.\nAnd moments before the Associated Press released clips from Romney\'s speech\nbefore the Conservative Political Action Conference indicating that he would\ncertainly end his candidacy, it did not appear Rove\'s privileged insights\nwere as well-developed as other commentators in the world of political news.\nhttp://rawstory.com/news/2008/Is_Fox_getting_their_moneys_worth_0207.html\n\n*Challenged: McCain\'s Conservative Authenticity (ABC, 2/7/08)*\nRomney Is Out, But McCain Now Faces Even Greater GOP Challenge\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/print?id=4259246\n\n*McConnell Endorses McCain for President (Roll Call, 2/7/08)*\nSaying his Senate colleague has wrapped up the Republican Party\'s\npresidential nomination, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) on Thursday\nthrew his support to Sen.

The Romney we once knew could have made a credible case for the\npresidency: a smart, data-driven, can-do executive who wouldn\'t let ideology\nget in the way of pragmatic solutions. This pitch could have appealed to\nvoters weary of destructive politics and hungry for progress. It also would\nhave had the benefit of being true.\nhttp://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2008/02/08/romney_exits/\n\n*Fallout over Romney\'s exit: \'Didn\'t connect\' (USA Today, 2/8/08)*\nMitt Romney seemed to have it all: good looks, perfect family, money and a\nr\xe9sum\xe9 that practically screamed presidential contender.\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-02-07-romney-fallout_N.htm\n\n*Romney will suspend campaign so that he does not \'aid a surrender to\nterror\' (Raw Story 2/7/08)*\n"If I fight on in my campaign, all the way to the convention, I would\nforestall the launch of a national campaign and make it more likely that\nSenator Clinton or Obama would win. And in this time of war, I simply cannot\nlet my campaign, be a part of aiding a surrender to terror," Romney said in\na speech, excerpts of which were first published by the Associated Press.\nhttp://rawstory.com/news/2008/AP_Romney_to_suspend_his_presidential_0207.html\n* *\n*HUCKABEE*\n*Evangelical leader endorses Huckabee (AP, 2/7/08)*\nJames Dobson, one of the nation\'s most prominent evangelical Christian\nleaders, backed Mike Huckabee\'s presidential bid Thursday night, giving the\nformer Arkansas governor a long-sought endorsement as the Republican field\nnarrowed to a two-man race.\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-02-07-dobson-huckabee_N.htm\n\n*Huckabee vows to continue campaign (CNN, 2/8/08)*\nMike Huckabee said Thursday he will continue his quest for the Republican\nnomination, and directly appealed for support from backers of Mitt Romney\'s\nnow suspended presidential bid.\nhttp://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/02/08/huckabee-vows-to-continue-campaign-2/\n* *\n*Romney Out; What Will Huckabee Do? (Mother Jones, 2/8/08)*\n\x85 Romney\'s message to the conservatives today was this: I\'m your Reagan. He\nand they may just have to wait a few more years before those pesky\nRepublican primary voters get it. One key question now is, what will Mike\nHuckabee do? Recently, he\'s become the anti-Romney spoiler--sweeping up\nnon-McCain voters and preventing Romney from becoming a competitive\nalternative to McCain. It seemed that Huckabee and McCain had an\nimplicit--if not explicit--nonaggression pact, and this has even fueled talk\nof a Mack-Huck ticket. So with no need any longer for him to block Romney to\nhelp McCain, what\'s Huckabee\'s role in the race?\nhttp://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2008/02/7150_romney_out_what.html\n* *\n*GENERAL ELECTION NEWS*\n*Live CPAC Updates: Romney, McCain, Cheney Gather At Conservative Political\nAction Conference (Huffington Post, 2/8/08)*\nAfter facing whithering attacks from conservatives, presumptive GOP\npresidential nominee John McCain addressed party activists on Thursday at\nCPAC (after Mitt Romney dropped out).
