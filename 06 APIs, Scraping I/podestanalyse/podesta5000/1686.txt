And are we going with Tho-mah, or Thom-as?\xe2\x80\x9d Three academics stood nearby, clutching wineglasses. They had assembled as part of a welcoming party, but no one knew how to pronounce the name of the guest of honor, the French economist Thomas Piketty. \xe2\x80\x9cHow about Dr. P.?\xe2\x80\x9d Chase Robinson, the interim president of the Graduate Center, suggested.\r\n\r\nDr. P. was in town to deliver a talk about his new book, \xe2\x80\x9cCapital in the Twenty-first Century,\xe2\x80\x9d which has been credited with providing the hard numbers behind the slogans of the Occupy Wall Street movement. The seven-hundred-page volume has created so much international buzz that its American publisher released it a month early. The CUNY talk sold out weeks in advance, so the university had set up live streaming online. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m the most powerful person in the city,\xe2\x80\x9d Tanya Domi, a CUNY official in charge of the event\xe2\x80\x99s logistics, said. \xe2\x80\x9cJournalists have been sending me their r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9s, begging to be let in. This never happens.\xe2\x80\x9d She tallied the Nobel laureates in the house: Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, and Edmund Phelps. Earlier in the day, Piketty had been at the United Nations, lecturing on income inequality. The next day, he would set off to visit three more American cities.\r\n\r\nIt was a lot of media glare for a group used to data sets and multilettered equations, and the social scientists were enjoying it. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re really capturing the Zeitgeist here!\xe2\x80\x9d Robinson said. Janet Gornick, the director of CUNY\xe2\x80\x99s Luxembourg Income Study Center, said, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter Occupy Wall Street, people were calling us to ask about the one per cent, and we had nothing to say. Meanwhile, Piketty was quietly building his data. Now he can thank the Occupy people for the book sales!\xe2\x80\x9d One of the novelties of the book is that it quotes directly from the tax returns of the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest one per cent, an undertaking that is a bit like staring at the sun. \xe2\x80\x9cMy Ph.D. thesis was on this subject; it was published forty-five years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d Stiglitz said later. \xe2\x80\x9cBut those articles were not part of the mainstream conversation then, because there was no mainstream conversation on income inequality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe room began to fill up, and Piketty still hadn\xe2\x80\x99t arrived. In walked two more economists\xe2\x80\x94Branko Milanovic, a dapper Serbian, and Steven Durlauf, an American, in from Wisconsin. Krugman took Milanovic\xe2\x80\x99s hand and apologized for suggesting, in The New York Review of Books, that Piketty was the only living economist who was literate. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen was the last time you heard an economist invoke Jane Austen and Balzac?\xe2\x80\x9d Krugman had written. Milanovic feigned indignation. \xe2\x80\x9cI used Jane Austen in my book, too\xe2\x80\x94and Tolstoy! \xe2\x80\x98Anna Karenina\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d he protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy Jane Austen?\xe2\x80\x9d Durlauf asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAusten has a lot of details about income and money,\xe2\x80\x9d Milanovic said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Anthony Trollope has many more,\xe2\x80\x9d Durlauf replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife made me read Jane Austen,\xe2\x80\x9d Milanovic said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then I actually realized that I could use it for my own work. Mr. Darcy had ten thousand pounds! Also, I use Balzac. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t cite it in my book, but I did all the calculations. I have it on my Excel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPiketty appeared in the doorway, looking dazed. He is forty-two and trim, with a head of wavy dark hair, which put him in the top one per cent, hairwise, in the room. Sartorially, he looked to be on the cutting edge as well, turned out in a slim charcoal suit, with an open white shirt. There was a momentary hush, then a salvo of introductions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about time!\xe2\x80\x9d Krugman said. \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone I know only by repute!\xe2\x80\x9d The two squared off, Krugman asking, again, the pronunciation question. \xe2\x80\x9cPeek-et-tee,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve all been wrong! Incredible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPiketty to Krugman: \xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99re moving to CUNY?\xe2\x80\x9d Krugman had recently announced that he\xe2\x80\x99d be leaving his post at Princeton. \xe2\x80\x9cWonderful, a public institution,\xe2\x80\x9d Piketty said.\r\n\r\nA guest asked him, \xe2\x80\x9cHow does it feel to be the brains behind Occupy Wall Street?\xe2\x80\x9d Piketty\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Julia, who is also an economist, interceded with a sly smile. \xe2\x80\x9cThomas is too modest for such questions,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nAfter thirty minutes of happy commiseration, Dr. P. seemed fortified. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, the aristocracy in France in 1789 was about one per cent of the population,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Then he corrected himself: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, between one and one and a half per cent of the population.\xe2\x80\x9d With the proper data, you could, at last, \xe2\x80\x9cmake comparisons\xe2\x80\x9d between then and now. The Bastille was no longer an abstraction.\r\n\r\nThe group made for the elevators. The masses were waiting downstairs. \xe2\x99\xa6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKayo Sumisaki\r\nExecutive Assistant\r\nSandler Foundation\r\nksumisaki@sandlerfoundation.org<mailto:ksumisaki@sandlerfoundation.org>\r\n\r\n'
