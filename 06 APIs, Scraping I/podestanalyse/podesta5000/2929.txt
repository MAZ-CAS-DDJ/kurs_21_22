john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi John -- We have a seat for you on the charter plane to Iowa this weekend.\n\nThe current plan is that we will be departing from Westchester County\nAirport at approximately 10:00am en route Iowa.  After we land in Iowa at\napproximately 11:30am local time, we would spend most of the afternoon at\nthe hotel in debate prep.\n\nIn term of the return, HRC will be flying home on Sunday at approximately\n5:00pm after a day of campaigning.  If you would like to fly home\ncommercially, the campaign will pay for your return flight (asking that you\nkeep within reasonable travel parameters/cost).\n\nPlease let us know what you would like to do with regard to the return,\nideally by tonight if possible.\n\nThank you!\n'
