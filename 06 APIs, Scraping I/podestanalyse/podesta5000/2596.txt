john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\n\nIt\x92s the same kabuki dance over and over again.\n\nTea Party extremists in the House are threatening to shut down the government. Even their Republican colleagues have warned that this is a terrible idea that would devastate the economy.\n\nIt\x92s time to end the madness. The obstructionism that has crippled our government for years must stop now. But these folks are determined. They need to be overwhelmed by public opinion \x96 it\x92s the only way to stop a government shutdown.\n\nThese extremists are living in a bubble that we need to pop. Let\x92s do our part to show them that Americans won\x92t be held hostage to their ideological crusade.\n\nClick here to automatically add your name to our petition: Demand that House Republicans stop the obstructionism that\x92s hurting our country and our economy. No government shutdown!\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/end-to-obstructionism?refcode=20130823-d&amounts=25,35,50,100,250,500,2600\n\nNo matter what some people in Washington think, this isn\x92t a game. Shutting down the government would have real-life consequences for every American. The private sector can\x92t grow and prosper if the public sector can\x92t get its act together.\n\nMake your voice heard \x96 tell House Republicans to stop the obstructionist games.\n\nWe are heading into a critical moment. Thank you for not sitting on the sidelines while a band of extremists holds our economy hostage.\n\nSean\n\nContribute -- https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/end-to-obstructionism?refcode=20130823-d&amounts=25,35,50,100,250,500,2600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\nPaid for by Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n\nSean Patrick Maloney for Congress\nPO Box 270\nNewburgh, NY 12550\n\nTo unsubscribe from this mailing list, click here - http://images.myngp.com/unsubscribe.aspx?crypt=Casv%2frrJxGAq9DTl%2f1OHiH48yChwDJHfKlbRogcRbNk%3d\n\nPowered by NGP VAN, Inc.\n\n'
