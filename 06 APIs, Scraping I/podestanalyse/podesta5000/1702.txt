john.podesta@gmail.comb"Glen,\nI am so sorry for my delay. We absolutely want to take you up on this\noffer.  Attached is our quite limited list of Toyko based donors (from 2008\nand now 2016).  We only have two major donors in Toyko - Allan Smith and\nTony Miller.\n\nAdditionally, I have included the list of Asian based American Abroad\nHillraisers that you may know.  Tony Miller should be brought in\nimmediately on this - I know that you have already connected with Robert.\nWenchi Wu also suggested that Kathy Matsui may be good for this. Do you\nknow her?\n\nDo you want to have a call this afternoon/evening on this?\n\nWe are so excited that our full time staffer for Americans Abroad is also\nstarting on Monday! She will be a great resource to help you make this a\nsuccess.\n\nThank you for your help!-\nKathy\n\n\n\nOn Fri, May 29, 2015 at 11:24 AM, gsf1280 <gsf1280@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n> Kathy,\n>\n> We don't have much time to prepare for the fundraiser in Tokyo on June 9,\n> so I would appreciate your early response to my emails of Tuesday and\n> yesterday.
