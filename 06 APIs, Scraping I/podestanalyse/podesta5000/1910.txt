This year our conference aims at continuing to provide a global platform for government, inter-government, non-government, business leaders, academic experts and other delegates to exchange their new ideas, valuable works and ongoing research to take actions for rebuilding a clean world.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLow Carbon Earth Summit (LCES), as a high-level international conference for the world, was first launched in 2011. Until now, it has been successfully held for four times. Experts from China and more than 50 other countries have attended previous conferences and delivered speeches. The conference has carried out deep and productive dialogues and exchanges in the aspects of the low carbon related fields. Besides, it has played an active role in the promotion of cross-regional large-scale projects cooperation, facilitation of investment and trade, as well as the realization of regional common development. It has become an important platform for the enhancement of mutual understanding and the expansion of mutually beneficial cooperation among countries in the world.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow please kindly find the Five Symposiums included in this summit:\r\n\r\nSymposium 1: Low Carbon City, Transport and Building\r\n\r\nSymposium 2: Low Carbon Economy and Carbon Trade\r\n\r\nSymposium 3: Climate Change Adaption & Mitigation\r\n\r\nSymposium 4: Low Carbon and Clean Technologies\r\n\r\nSymposium 5: Best Practice of Low Carbon Industry\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition to be the starting point of the Silk Road Economic Belt, Xi'an is also the capital of Chinese history and culture, and it is the film of Chinese history and the name card of Chinese culture with its generations of grace, elegance, learning, wisdom and grand atmosphere. In September, Xi\xa1\xafan will embrace the guests from all around the world with new image displaying the natural landscape and urban landscape, the ancient area and the new district, as well as the human resources and technology resources.
