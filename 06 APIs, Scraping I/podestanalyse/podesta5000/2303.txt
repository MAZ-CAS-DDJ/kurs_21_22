John\n<http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/m000303/>  McCain\nchampioned legislation that will let an Arizona rancher trade remote\ngrassland and ponderosa pine forest here for acres of valuable federally\nowned property that is ready for development, a land swap that now stands to\ndirectly benefit one of his top presidential campaign fundraisers.\n\nInitially reluctant to support the swap, the Arizona Republican became a key\nfigure in pushing the deal through Congress after the rancher and his\npartners hired lobbyists that included McCain\'s 1992 Senate campaign\nmanager, two of his former Senate staff members (one of whom has returned as\nhis chief of staff), and an Arizona insider who was a major McCain donor and\nis now bundling campaign checks.\n\nWhen McCain\'s legislation passed in November 2005, the ranch owner gave the\njob of building as many as 12,000 homes to SunCor Development, a firm in\nTempe, Ariz., run by Steven A. Betts, a longtime McCain supporter who has\nraised more than $100,000 for the presumptive Republican nominee. Betts said\nhe and McCain never discussed the deal.\n\nThe Audubon\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/National+Audubon+Society?ti\nd=informline>  Society described the exchange as the largest in Arizona\nhistory. The swap involved more than 55,000 acres of land in all, including\nrare expanses of desert woodland and pronghorn antelope habitat. The deal\nhad support from many local officials and the Arizona Republic newspaper for\nits expansion of the Prescott National Forest. But it brought an outcry from\nsome Arizona environmentalists when it was proposed in 2002, partly because\nit went through Congress rather than a process that allowed more citizen\ninput.\n\nAlthough the bill called for the two parcels to be of equal value, a federal\nforestry official told a congressional committee that he was concerned that\n"the public would not receive fair value" for its land. A formal appraisal\nhas not yet begun. A town official opposed to the swap said other Yavapai\nRanch land sold nine years ago for about $2,000 per acre, while some of the\nprime commercial land near a parcel that the developers will get has brought\nas much as $120,000 per acre.\n\nIn an interview, Betts said there is "absolutely no" connection between his\ncontributions to McCain\'s presidential bids and the deal involving rancher\nFred Ruskin and the Yavapai Ranch Limited Partnership. While his company\'s\npossible involvement was discussed casually before the bill\'s passage, Betts\nsaid SunCor did not sign on to the project until afterward. "At no time\nduring the consideration of this legislation was there any involvement by\nofficials of SunCor," McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said in a written\nresponse to questions.\n\nBetts is among a string of donors who have benefited from McCain-engineered\nland swaps. In 1994, the senator helped a lobbyist for land developer Del\nWebb Corp. pursue an exchange in the Las Vegas area, according to the Center\nfor Public Integrity. McCain sponsored two bills, in 1991 and 1994, sought\nby donor Donald R. Diamond that yielded the developer thousands of acres in\ntrade for national parkland.\n\nIn the late 1990s, McCain promoted a deal in Arizona\'s Tonto National Forest\ninvolving property part-owned by Great American Life Insurance, a company\nrun by billionaire Carl H. Lindner Jr., a prolific contributor to national\npolitical parties and presidential candidates.\n\nWith the federal government owning vast stretches of Arizona land, and with\npressure to meet increasing housing demands, McCain now views land swaps as\nbeneficial, Rogers said. "He certainly recognizes that there have been\nwell-documented abuses of legislative land exchanges, but every land\nexchange bill introduced by Senator McCain has been written with the highest\nregard for the public interest."\n\nAs McCain positions himself as a champion of environmental causes, observers\nof the Yavapai Ranch swap say it shows a paradox in the senator\'s positions.\nAt times, he has fought to protect the delicate desert ecosystem. But when\nwildlife concerns have thwarted development, his loyalties have shifted.\n\n"When the public trust intersects with private interests, basically, he has\nfavored land development . . . in every case," said Rob Smith, director of\nthe Sierra\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Sierra+Club?tid=informline>\nClub\'s Arizona affiliate.\n\nMcCain also has been critical of government\'s "revolving door," which allows\nformer government officials to position themselves as influential lobbyists.\nRogers said that McCain does not recall being lobbied by his former staff\nmembers on the land swap and that "no lobbyist influenced Senator McCain on\nthis issue."\n\nThe Yavapai exchange idea surfaced a decade ago as area land values soared.\nRuskin and his siblings for years have used the inherited property as a\ncattle operation.\n\nDevelopment was complicated, because the land was intertwined with federally\nowned forest, creating what land management officials call "the\ncheckerboard." Ruskin\'s ranch and the federal property comprise alternating\nsquare-mile plots across swaths of northern Arizona.\n\nFor the U.S.\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/USDA+Forest+Service?tid=inf\normline>  Forest Service, the tangle of public and private property posed a\nmanagement headache. For Ruskin and his family, it became an opportunity.\n\nRuskin said he spent months researching federal land exchanges, and decided\nthe regular process used by the Forest Service would be too complicated to\never get done. The trade he wanted would involve three cities, three\nnational forests, two counties and 15 land parcels. He persuaded then-Rep.\nJ.D. Hayworth (R-Ariz.) to draft a bill proposing the exchange of 35,000\nacres of ranch property for 21,000 acres of federally owned Arizona land.\n\nRuskin set his sights on prime development property astride a major\ninterstate, land adjacent to the Flagstaff airport and a contiguous stretch\nof the ranch that would allow housing development. He estimated that the\nranch land, if subdivided and developed, would easily sell for more than\n$250 million -- and that had to be calculated into any swap.\n\nAt first, the trade appeared to have broad support, but opposition soon\ndeveloped. Clarkdale Mayor Doug Von Gausig, whose house overlooks the Verde\nRiver, said he feared that development would overtax an already fragile\nwater source.\n\nOther critics included a national taxpayer group that questioned the land\nvalues. "It was just a bad deal -- a rip-off to the public," said Janine\nBlaeloch, who heads the Western Lands Project, another opponent of the\nlegislation.\n\nMcCain initially withheld support for Hayworth\'s bill, which failed in 2002.\nRuskin saw McCain\'s restraint as an obstacle. He said Senate staff members\nwarned him that the senator was wary of a swap because "he spent some\npolitical capital and got some bricks thrown at him" over the Tonto National\nForest deal.\n\nRuskin, who is a pediatrician by training, said he realized he needed to\nhire lobbyists "to open communications with McCain\'s office."\n\nHe turned to some of McCain\'s closest former advisers. In 2002, he sought\nout Mark Buse, McCain\'s former staff director at the Senate commerce\ncommittee, which the senator chaired.\n\n"I had gone to him to see if he had any advice as to how to deal with\nMcCain," Ruskin said. "We had a couple of meetings and I paid him a little\nbit." Buse\'s federal lobbying records do not list the ranch as a client.\n\nThat year, lobbying records show, Ruskin also paid $60,000 to Michael\nJimenez, another former McCain aide. Wes Gullett, who had worked in McCain\'s\nSenate office, managed his 1992 reelection bid, and served as deputy\ncampaign manager for his 2000 presidential run, also lobbied on the bill,\ndocuments show. The watchdog group Public\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Public+Citizen+Foundation?t\nid=informline>  Citizen lists Gullett and his wife, Deborah, as bundlers who\nhave raised more than $100,000 for McCain\'s White\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/The+White+House?tid=informl\nine>  House bid. Ruskin also hired Gullett\'s partner, Kurt R. Davis, another\nMcCain bundler and member of the senator\'s Arizona leadership team, to work\nwith local officials and "to help with McCain if we needed help." Buse,\nJimenez and Gullett did not return calls seeking comment.\n\nDavis said that he and Gullett were not hired just to win over McCain. "Each\nmember has issues that are more important to them. You have to be able to\naddress their individual concerns. We had familiarity with the issues\nimportant to McCain." In this case, Davis said, "Senator McCain was very,\nvery engaged and concerned about water issues."\n\nIn April 2003, McCain introduced his version of a land-swap bill. But he\nremained reluctant about the exchange, speaking to opponents and organizing\nmeetings in towns that would be most affected.\n\nFlagstaff Mayor Joseph C. Donaldson, a supporter of the swap, said McCain\'s\nhesitation stemmed from his "insistence that the environment be protected."\nBut opponents were baffled by the senator\'s seemingly contradictory\npositions. Said Blaeloch: "The bizarre thing to me regarding McCain is, we\nspent a lot of time with his staff, and we all seemed to be on the same page\nabout the problems with this swap. But somehow, John McCain kept pushing it\nforward."\n\nRuskin said a "crucial meeting" occurred on Aug. 4, 2004, when McCain added\na provision aimed at appeasing many opponents. It created a management group\nthat would monitor water reserves and document any danger to the Verde\nRiver.\n\nThe legislation also was revised to mandate that the parcels in the exchange\nbe of "equal value." Forest Service officials say they can adjust the amount\nof property given to Ruskin to ensure that each side gets an equal share of\nland. Blaeloch and some other opponents remained concerned that appraisals\ncould still be manipulated. The language helped win Senate passage on July\n16, 2005.\n\nRuskin said he first engaged in confidential discussions with SunCor in\n2003. Betts said the company was not "really interested in spending a lot of\ntime on it until we knew if the legislation would pass."\n\nRuskin said SunCor officials formally expressed interest in October 2005, a\nmonth before President\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/George+W.+Bush?tid=informli\nne>  Bush signed the bill into law.\n\nIn Arizona, SunCor is a subsidiary of Pinnacle West, the state\'s largest\npower company. Betts, as Ruskin described him, "politically is a very\npowerful guy in the state."\n\nOfficials from the company and its subsidiaries have accounted for $100,000\nin contributions to McCain\'s political campaigns over the years, records\nshow.\n\nSunCor is now working directly with the Forest Service to complete the swap,\nwhich has been delayed by administrative glitches.\n\nAs for McCain, some in the Verde Valley say they counted on him to broker a\ndeal that would protect their precious river. Von Gausig now heads the water\nmanagement commission that McCain added to the bill to gain community\nsupport. The Congressional\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/U.S.+Congressional+Budget+O\nffice?tid=informline>  Budget Office estimated it would cost $8 million over\nfive years to fund water studies. But to date, none of that money has been\nbudgeted.\n\nResearch editor Alice Crites contributed to this report.\n\n \n\n'
