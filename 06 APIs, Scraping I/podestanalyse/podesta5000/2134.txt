How does this look to you guys?\n\n\xc2\xb7      Right now, the super-wealthy and big corporations are using every\ntrick in the book to game the system and avoid paying billions in taxes.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, and it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for our economy. We can\xe2\x80\x99t have one tax system for\nthose at the top and another one for everyone else.\n\n\n\n\xc2\xb7      So today, I proposed adding a new \xe2\x80\x9cfair share surcharge\xe2\x80\x9d on\nmulti-millionaires and closing loopholes to make it harder to game the\nsystem.  I\xe2\x80\x99m also pushing for the Buffett Rule, which sets a minimum rate\nfor those at the top, and other reforms like closing the carried interest\nloophole that allows some hedge fund managers to pay a lower rate than a\nteacher or a nurse.\n\n\n\n\xc2\xb7      When it comes to taxes, there\xe2\x80\x99s a clear choice in this election.\nRepublicans candidates are promising huge new giveaways to the wealthiest\nAmericans.  And on the Democratic side, I am the only candidate pledging to\nraise middle class incomes, not middle class taxes.\n\n\n\n\xc2\xb7      You know, Senator Sanders, Governor O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, and I share a lot of\nthe same values and goals.  We both want to make the economy work for\neveryone, not just those at the top.  And the differences between us pale\ncompared to what we see on the other side.  But we *do* have differences.\n\n\n\n\xc2\xb7      I\xe2\x80\x99m a progressive who likes to get things done.  I measure every\npolicy by whether it\xe2\x80\x99s going to actually make life better for working\nfamilies.  And I\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out how I\xe2\x80\x99m going to pay for everything I\xe2\x80\x99m\nproposing by making the wealthy pay their fair share.\n\n\n\n\xc2\xb7      Senator Sanders has a different approach.  His agenda would add 18\nto 20 trillion dollars in new federal spending, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t explained how\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d pay for it.  That\xe2\x80\x99s a big risk, because it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to make the\narithmetic add up any other way than a big tax increase on middle class\nfamilies.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the right choice when incomes for most\npeople have barely budged in years.\n\n\n\n\xc2\xb7      I like and respect Senator Sanders quite a lot, but I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned\nthat some of his ideas run the risk of hurting rather than helping.  So I\nlook forward to debating these differences in the campaign.\n"
