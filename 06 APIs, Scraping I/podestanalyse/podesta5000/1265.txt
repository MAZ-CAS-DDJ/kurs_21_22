john.podesta@gmail.comb' \n \n\n\nFrom: Bruce Darling\nPlease CALL Senator Harkin\'s Office NOW to  and urge him to support people \nwith disabilities and home care  workers\n\nMore Info\nTell the Senator to support Senator Johanns\'  amendment !\n\n\nTAKE ACTION NOW!\n\nCALL Senator Harkin at  (202) 224-3254.  Tell the Senator\'s  staff:\n\nSenator Harkin has  always been a friend to the disability community.  So I \nam calling to  support Senator Johanns\' amendment in the Appropriations \nCommittee to the  Department of Labor appropriation that would prevent the \nDepartment of Labor  from finalizing, implementing or enforcing changes to the \nCompanionship  Exemption that would hurt people with disabilities and the \nworkers who  provide us with services and supports to live independently in the \n community!  Without this amendment there will be devastating effects in  \nNew York, where we have no one on the Appropriations Committee to represent  \nus.  Please urge the Senator to support this amendment.\n\nThe  Department of Labor (DOL) has proposed changes in federal labor rules \nthat  will hurt people with disabilities and attendants who support our  \nindependence. These changes will most seriously impact people who have the  \nmost significant disabilities and rely on Medicaid services to live in the  \ncommunity and their attendants.\n\nIn short, the proposed changes  will:\n- Force seniors and people with disabilities into  institutions;\n- Cut the take-home pay of  attendants;\n- Reduce the attendant  workforce;\n- Force people with disabilities to cut the hours  of trusted attendants \nand bring strangers into their homes;  and\n- Devastate consumer directed attendant  programs.\n\nMany national disability organizations -- including ADAPT,  the National \nCouncil on Independent Living (NCIL), and the National Council  on Disability \n(NCD) -- have raised concerns about these proposed changes and  urged the \nDepartment of Labor to work with the disability community to  resolve them.  \nInstead of acknowledging the issue and working with the  Disability Community \nto resolve it, the Department of Labor has continued to  push ahead with \nthese changes.  (You can learn more about this issue at  www.DOLoffMYbody.org)\n\nTODAY, Senator Johanns will be submitting an  amendment to the Department \nof Labor\'s appropriation that prevents DOL from  finalizing, implementing or \nenforcing these changes until concerns about the  proposed rules have been \naddressed.\n\nSO PLEASE TAKE ACTION, call  Senator Harkin at (202) 224-3254 and tell the  \nstaff:\n\nSenator Harkin has always been a friend to the disability community.   So I \nam calling to support Senator Johanns\' amendment in the Appropriations  \nCommittee to the Department of Labor appropriation that would prevent the  \nDepartment of Labor from finalizing, implementing or enforcing changes to  the \nCompanionship Exemption that would hurt people with disabilities and the  \nworkers who provide us with services and supports to live independently in  the \ncommunity!

We live in a  state where \nwere about to get our IHSS cut 4.4% which is the others shoe  dropping from \nthe 8% that was cut last year and the 20% cut to IHSS that the  governor \ntried to cut but was stopped by the courts. The IHSS workers and  consumers will \nget less money to live on this month and would get far less  money if the \ngovernor had his way. If you read the letter which I will  repost here from \nthe National Association of Medicaid directors none of the  cash-strapped \nstates could afford this overtime pay. They are currently  slashing Medicaid \nbut it just and throwing seniors and people with  disabilities into budget \njunk health plans that don\'t even have their  specialties to cut money. \nPublicly funded IHSS services are not open-ended.  They are finite and determined \nby the revenues that the state collects that  year. Instead of paying \novertime, the governor\'s administration announced in  an Olmstead meeting that they \nwill cap IHSS provider hours to 160 hours per  consumer to avoid paying \novertime. Trailer bill language was already  prepared to that effect.\n\nIf  the D.O. L. really wanted to make this a better job for providers it \nwould  provide robust experienced backup services for IHSS consumers so their \nlives  are not thrown up in the air when their providers are sick, that way \nIHSS  workers could have paid sick leave and paid vacations like they have \nin New  York. By cynically asking for overtime pay which they know in \nstate-funded  Medicaid IHSS programs can not pay, all it does is give the unions \ntwo or  three union dues out of a house were they used to get one, as families \nand  people have to hire one and two more providers. If the DOL instead \nmade the  job better with quality backup services, sick pay, and vacation pay \nthis  would cost a fraction of overtime pay, and would have a real chance of \nbeing  provided.\n\n70%  of California providers are family providers who will see their family \n income radically cut from 280 hours 160 hours. I was on a phone call with  \nTony Anderson of the ARC of California, saying that the family providers \nare  greying and they are not professional providers who want to go out and \nget  two and three jobs to supplement the cut they will receive an hours \ntaking  care of their family member. And if they have to leave the house to get \nthat  income than they will not be able to take care of their disabled family \n member. There were people on that call who are severely disabled with \ntheir  providers with relationships that would be severed in the providers hours \n were cut almost in half.\n\nWe  live in the real world and this will be the real fallout of the passage \nof  his D.O.l laws as written, with no consultation to the disability \ncommunity  or in-depth talk with the possible ramifications to their own \nrank-and-file  providers, which is why we must stop these rules and insist that  \nrank-and-file providers and the disability community he consulted to work  out \na compromise. The ADAPT (American Disabled for Attendant Programs Today)  / \nNCIL (National Council on Independent Living) compromise called for an  \nelimination of the companionship exemption in privately funded third-party  \nagencies while leaving government-funded Medicaid IHSS out of it. This is  why \nwe need to call and get our friends to call Senator Harkin now and tell  him \nnot to hurt people with disabilities and home care providers by  approving \nthe D.O l Department of Labor rules as they are written now it  will really \nhurt those of us on Medicaid publicly funded IHSS. And that  instead they \nshould wait for a compromise that is reach by consulting with  all parties and \nis harmless to all.\n_7 hours ago_ \n(https://www.facebook.com/groups/IHSS.ConsumersUnion/permalink/483831198361611/?comment_id=484144901663574&offset=0&total_comments=6)   \xc2\xb7 \n_Edited_ (https://www.facebook.com/groups/IHSS.ConsumersUnion/#)   \xc2\xb7 \n_Unlike_ (https://www.facebook.com/groups/IHSS.ConsumersUnion/#)   \xc2\xb7 _3_ \n(https://www.facebook.com/browse/likes?id=484144901663574) \n\n\n\n\n\n \n (https://www.facebook.com/paulas.jafra) \n \n \n (https://www.facebook.com/groups/IHSS.ConsumersUnion/#) \n \n \n_Paula  Herman_ (https://www.facebook.com/paulas.jafra)   Bump\n_6 hours ago_ \n(https://www.facebook.com/groups/IHSS.ConsumersUnion/permalink/483831198361611/?comment_id=484174611660603&offset=0&total_comments=6)   \xc2\xb7 \n_Like_ (https://www.facebook.com/groups/IHSS.ConsumersUnion/#) \n\n\n\n\n\n \n (https://www.facebook.com/philipericbennett) \n \n \n (https://www.facebook.com/groups/IHSS.ConsumersUnion/#) \n \n \n_Philip  Bennett_ (https://www.facebook.com/philipericbennett)   Hello,  \nLinda L R Roberts. I have been a home care worker for close to 37 years. I\'m  \ntouched that you want to end my \n"exploitation"  by putting more money into the system.\nMy  question is: where will the money come from? From the federal \ngovernment  which  is sixteen trillion dollars in \ndebt?  From the states which are struggling also and, like the home care \nagencies,  are under no obligation to pay \novertime  (outside of emergencies) as long as they can split up workers\'  \nhours?\nYour  Facebook page indicates that you are in the business of providing \nlegal  services. So I don\'t have to explain the \nFair  Labor Standards Act to you. If the money\'s not there to pay at \novertime rate  after the fortieth hour, our hours will be reduced. How does that \nhelp  us?\nPerhaps  you think we\'re being exploited because we work long hours. Yes, \noften we  do, and I\'m very thankful for that \nbecause,  at our low hourly wage, that\'s how we can support ourselves. I \nalways prefer  a case with many hours and the \nvast  majority of my fellow home care workers feel the same. You see, \nLinda, it\'s  not like we\'re constantly on our \nfeet  lifting people in and out of bed every minute of the day. Once we \nperform  the important tasks of the job as well as the not so important chores \nwhich  help the person we assist have a comfortable and productive life and, \nas  long as we\'re ready to stop what we\'re doing whenever we\'re asked by \nour  consumer, we can relax with a book, with a computer (which I\'m doing now  \nwhile on the job), watch TV, or whatever. Unless we\'re working a case that  \nrequires constant attention or with a very demanding and emotionally taxing \n consumer, this is a dream job!\nSo,  in light of the fact that, without the millions or even billions of \ndollars  required to pay this pie-in-the-sky overtime, we workers, as well as \nthe  people we assist, will be royally screwed, please explain why you \ndisagree  with my petition. Perhaps, instead of pie-in-the-sky, you can work \nreviving  the Community Choice Act or increase our hourly wage so we\'re on par \nwith  nursing home workers or assure that all home care workers get extra \nvacation  and sick pay. I look forward to your response, _Linda  L R Roberts_ \n(https://www.facebook.com/lindalr.roberts) .\n_4 hours ago_ \n(https://www.facebook.com/groups/IHSS.ConsumersUnion/permalink/483831198361611/?comment_id=484200498324681&offset=0&total_comments=6)   \xc2\xb7 \n_Unlike_ (https://www.facebook.com/groups/IHSS.ConsumersUnion/#)   \xc2\xb7 _3_ \n(https://www.facebook.com/browse/likes?id=484200498324681) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour  email settings: Individual Email|Traditional \n_Change  settings via the Web_ \n(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/CDR-MembersXchange/join;_ylc=X3oDMTJmbjFvb29pBF9TAzk3NDc2NTkwBGdycElkAzI5MDEwOTQEZ3Jwc3BJZ\nAMxNzA1OTU5ODQyBHNlYwNmdHIEc2xrA3N0bmdzBHN0aW1lAzEzNzM1NzAyOTA-)  (Yahoo! \nID required) \nChange settings via email:  _Switch  delivery to Daily Digest_ \n(mailto:CDR-MembersXchange-digest@yahoogroups.com?subject=Email Delivery: Digest)  | \n_Switch  to Fully Featured_ \n(mailto:CDR-MembersXchange-fullfeatured@yahoogroups.com?subject=Change Delivery Format: Fully Featured)  \n_Visit  Your Group _ \n(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/CDR-MembersXchange;_ylc=X3oDMTJkN2loaHUwBF9TAzk3NDc2NTkwBGdycElkAzI5MDEwOTQEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1OTU5ODQy\nBHNlYwNmdHIEc2xrA2hwZgRzdGltZQMxMzczNTcwMjkw) | _Yahoo!
