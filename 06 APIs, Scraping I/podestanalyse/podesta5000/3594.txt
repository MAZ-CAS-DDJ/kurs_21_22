john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John:\n\nLove this article. Baker nailed it. \n\nBut one important omission: no mention of when you intervened to "let Lanny be Lanny." I know somewhere there are buttons to prove that historical fact. Lost mine. \n\nHard to believe the math -- 2015 - 1970 (Duffy campaign) -- I think that is 45 years we have known each other. \n\nWhile I have loved and admired you and your brother thru all these years, I must say the Podesta I think about the most is your mom. Why she loved me and hugged me - I have no clue. But I sure loved her. I know she and my mom are in heaven with naches for both of us. \n\nHope we can get together soon. \n\nLanny\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/16/us/politics/for-hillary-clinton-john-podesta-brings-a-right-hand-with-punch.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&smid=nytcore-ipad-share\n\nJohn D. Podesta, a veteran infighter who has galvanized the struggling Clinton and Obama White Houses, is preparing to bring his strong hand to Hillary Rodham Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\nSent from my iPad'
