I am outraged by Roanoke Mayor David Bower\xe2\x80\x99s call for Syrian Americans to be rounded up and interned. \n\nHaving spent four years in a Japanese internment camp as a child, I have experienced first hand what happens when we choose fear and anger over compassion and understanding. We cannot let the Paris attacks drive us toward the same misguided actions. \n\nMy childhood was shaped by racial prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership. I will not stand by and watch the same thing happen to future generations. Our anger towards the radicals and their unjust attacks won't lead us to turn our backs on those needing refuge from violence and fear. \xc2\xa0\n\nSign my petition and tell Congress that closing our borders, denying thousands of women and children the refuge they need, and repeating the mistakes of the past is a step in the wrong direction: http://bit.ly/DefendSyrianRefugees\n\n\nDemocratically yours,\n\nCongressman Mike Honda\n\nP.S.
