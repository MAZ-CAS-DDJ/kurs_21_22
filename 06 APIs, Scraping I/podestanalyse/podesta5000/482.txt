They went home sterilized. The story of immigrant mothers who sued county doctors, the state, and the U.S. government after they were pressured into sterilizations while giving birth at the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center during the 1960s and 70s. Led by an intrepid, 26-year-old Chicana lawyer and armed with hospital records secretly gathered by a whistle-blowing young doctor, the mothers faced public exposure and stood up to powerful institutions in the name of justice.\nThis online event is free and open to the public, but registration ( http://www.geneticsandsociety.rsvp1.com/s1fa49mi2Zox ) is required!\nFeel free to forward this invitation to your friends and colleagues, and join the Twitter discussion at #TalkingBiopolitics ( https://twitter.rsvp1.com/s1e889mi2ZoA ).\n\nLooking forward,\n\nMarcy Darnovsky, Executive Director\nCenter for Genetics and Society ( http://geneticsandsociety.rsvp1.com/s12908mi2ZoC )\n( http://www.geneticsandsociety.rsvp1.com/s1eb49mi2ZoD )\n\nAbout the Filmmakers\n\nRenee Tajima-Pe&ntilde;a, Producer/Director\nAcademy Award-nominated filmmaker whose directing credits include the nationally televised documentaries Calavera Highway (PBS), "The Mexico Story" of The New Americans series (PBS), My Journey Home (PBS), Labor Women (PBS), My America...or Honk if You Love Buddha (PBS), The Last Beat Movie (Sundance Channel), The Best Hotel on Skid Row (HBO), and Who Killed Vincent Chin?
