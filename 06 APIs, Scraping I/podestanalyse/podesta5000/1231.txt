As I spent most of my career in the Foreign Service, this is the very first Presidential campaign In which I have worked.  It has been a great experience and I am proud to support HRC.\n\nI'll be on leave from the Kennedy School for the next five months at Stanford (trying to write a book on U.S. global leadership).  I've told the campaign that I am happy to speak anywhere you need me.\n\nAll best for 2016.\n\nNick\n\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Jan 3, 2016, at 2:29 PM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>> wrote:\n\nWishing you a happy New Year. 2015 was challenging, but we ended in a good place thanks to your help and support. Look forward to working with you to elect the first woman President of the United States.\n\nHave a great New Year.\n\n-John\n\n"
