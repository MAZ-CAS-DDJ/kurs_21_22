Jeanne has submitted a work plan for the post-election period\nand is seeking sign-off to move forward. I've communicated to our three\nteams that we need to make decisions regarding the campaign staff before we\ncan finalize plans.\n\nAlso, I've connected with Bob on the ethics memo, and we will have something\nto share tomorrow morning. He agrees that a two-year look back period on\nregistration would be difficult.\n"
