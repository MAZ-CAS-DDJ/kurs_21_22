john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hello,\n\nI am writing to introduce myself and to see if you are interested in a complimentary review of your 401(k) retirement account. Like many people, your 401(k) account may be one of your most valuable assets and may be the primary means of funding your retirement. We believe it\'s important to take a thoughtful approach to managing this important asset.\n\nOur firm provides a broad array of financial planning and investment management services to attorneys in the DC area. Our experience suggests that attorneys are often too busy building and managing their practices to give their personal finances the attention they deserve. We strongly believe that good financial planning lays the foundation for independent financial futures. Our clients appreciate the proactive and comprehensive services we provide and the confidence that comes with it. You can learn more about our services for legal professionals here: http://www.krekelerbrowerwa.com/p/attorney-specialty-group\n\nPlease call or e-mail if you\'d like to take advantage of my complimentary consultation.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[cid:image008.png@01CECA6C.4D8C1D70]\nDavid J.
