John let me know if that\'s not what you meant.  Cheryl and I talked offline and we\'re going to keep the first sentence as it was originally.  So here\'s where we are.  Everyone ok with this?\n\n"Secretary Clinton has already turned all of her work emails over to the State Department, and the Department has been responsive to the committee, and will continue to be.  Representatives of Secretary Clinton\'s office have been in touch with the committee to make clear that we want to make everything public, we call on the committee to do so as soon as possible, and that she\'s ready and willing to come and appear herself."\n\n\n\nFrom: Cheryl Mills <cheryl.mills@gmail.com<mailto:cheryl.mills@gmail.com>>\nDate: Thursday, March 26, 2015 at 9:27 PM\nTo: NSM <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com<mailto:nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>>\nCc: John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>, Philippe Reines <pir@hrcoffice.com<mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com>>, Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com<mailto:huma@hrcoffice.com>>, Jacob Sullivan <Jake.sullivan@gmail.com<mailto:Jake.sullivan@gmail.com>>, David Kendall <DKendall@wc.com<mailto:DKendall@wc.com>>, Jennifer Palmieri <jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com<mailto:jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com>>, Kristina Schake <kristinakschake@gmail.com<mailto:kristinakschake@gmail.com>>, Heather Samuelson <Heather.samuelson@gmail.com<mailto:Heather.samuelson@gmail.com>>\nSubject: Re: Tomorrow | Gowdy\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Mar 26, 2015 at 7:28 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com<mailto:nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>> wrote:\nCan everyone take a look at this and provide thoughts on what our on the record response will be tomorrow?  Note that our language has changed notably from what I sent around last week in 2 places.
