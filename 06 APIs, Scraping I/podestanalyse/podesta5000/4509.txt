john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear Friend,\n\nA just-released Quinnipiac poll (and we now believe the final poll to be released before the polls open tomorrow) has the race:\n\nSestak 42% - Specter 41%, with 16% undecided.\n\nQuinnipiac\'s pollster said "the race is too close to call!" We need your help, this race is so close!\n\nContribute: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=emay17link1\n\nBoth the NY Times and Pittsburgh Post Gazette this morning called our grass-roots campaign "relentless" for its passion and drive against a 30-year incumbent who is backed by the Washington and Pennsylvania establishments.\n\nAnd CBS News is out with its own report: "Why is Joe Sestak surging over Arlen Specter: The Answer in one day of campaigning":\n\n"It was only one day in a long campaign, but it showed the sharp differences in style between upstart Joe Sestak and incumbent Arlen Specter ?\n\n? on Friday, it was Sestak who was doing most of the retail campaigning, making 11 stops around Philadelphia starting at 6:30am, handing out business cards, and even telling one man he encountered that he would try to help his wife who was arrested the night before (he was eventually passed off to a staffer).\n\nSpecter, by contrast, stood at a podium most of the day with the usual cast of political characters."\n\nWhile our campaign IS relentless and energetic, Politico just reported "Pennsylvania\'s Democratic Senate primary remains balanced on a knife\'s edge a day before the election".\n\nWe need one final contribution from everyone - as much as you can afford - to win this race!  Please help us!\n\nContribute: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=emay17link2\n\nLet\'s have no regrets, on Wednesday morning, what might have been!\n\nLet\'s bring it on home!\n\nBest regards,\nRich Sestak\nCampaign Director\n\nP.S. Over the weekend our "relentless" army of passionate and dedicated volunteers (over 5,000 and growing) contacted over 30,000 Democratic households as we launched our "Get-Out-The-Vote" operation (the last stage of "Operation True Democrat", our designed strategy initiated 59 days ago to elect Joe). Let\'s win this!\n\nContributions are not tax deductible.\n\nContribute: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=emay17linkb\n\nVolunteer: http://JoeSestak.com/volunteer\n\nUnsubscribe: http://JoeSestak.com/unsubscribe \n\nSestak for Senate\nPO Box 1936 Media, PA 19063\n\n(610) 891-8956\n\nPaid for by Sestak For Senate'
