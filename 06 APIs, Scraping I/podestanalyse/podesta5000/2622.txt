I'd be grateful if you could get any feedback on this matter. My position is very clear..........I do not want to pursue this if advised otherwise. I count you as my well wisher and I would be happy to hear your counsel. Many thanks.\n\nBest, Osman.\n\n\n\nAmbassador M.

As you may recall, during President Obama's first term, my name was forwarded by Secretary Clinton to the White House for the position of special envoy to the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC). The White House appointed Rashad Hussain instead. It is my understanding that the position might be open again.\n\nFrankly speaking, I do not know if and how I should let the White House know of my interest in that position. I would be greatly obliged if you could kindly let me know the right course. I will act as per your suggestion............follow through or drop it!\n\nPlease find attached my information. Many thanks.\n\nWarmest regards, Osman.\n\n\n\nAmbassador M.
