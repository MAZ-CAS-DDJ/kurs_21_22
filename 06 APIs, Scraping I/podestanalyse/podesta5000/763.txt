john.podesta@gmail.comb'Couple options w NALEO -\nIt was in Nevada.  First four.\nWe have no other ability to meet with these kind of organizations and\ntheir leadership. They don\'t have the structure like labor in states\nand an exec team in DC.  So we didn\'t have an option to do an exec\ncouncil and/or chapter meetings.\nWe are just starting to do bigger events but focused on the first four.\n\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Jun 18, 2015, at 11:02 PM, Huma Abedin <ha16@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n>\n> Plus Lona and Alex\n> You are keeping us busy Nikki!\n>\n> Sent from my iPhone\n>\n>> On Jun 18, 2015, at 4:15 PM, Nikki Budzinski <nbudzinski@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n>>\n>> Good evening everyone\n>> Attached is tonight\'s updated spreadsheet.

Need to discuss/confirm NEA requests post-RA decision.  Also, NEA has reached out twice frustrated by HRC attending NALEO and not the RA (given our conference position).  It would be helpful to have a response to NALEO question and feedback back on their other requests.\n>> -RA Video\n>> -Teletown Hall with members and HRC (July)\n>> -Walk a Day event (August-September)\n>> -2016 RA attendance\n>>\n>> From our email last night, I have connected with Kari in NH regarding the RA and any Sanders activity.

Alliance for Retired Americans Convention has requested a Senator surrogate to their conference.  HRC is unable to attend.  A video is not a option.  Are we interested in asking a friendly Senator to surrogate?  Sanders and Pelosi are confirmed to attend.\n>>\n>> 4.  The UAW has started to engage in a endorsement process and invited HRC to their Executive Board meeting in Detroit August 11-13th.  UAW has big 3 bargaining this year, FYI.\n>>\n>> 5.  AFT teletown hall with members regarding 2016 endorsement last night went "very well".\n>>\n>> 6.  Current confirmed attendees to John\'s home:  Trumka, Saunders, J. David Cox (AFGE), Perrone (UFCW), McGarvey (BCTD).\n>>\n>> Trade Update:\n>> TPA passed House and the labor campaign has moved to the 14 Democratic Senators that voted for TPA/TAA.  Almost all of the 14 said that they would only vote for TPA with TAA.  This is the leverage point labor is trying to work.  The 14 Democratic Senators met with the White House today and reports back were not positive for the WH.  A cloture vote could happen in the Senate as early as tonight with a final TPA vote potentially happening on Tuesday next week.  In the House CBC Chairman Butterfield along with four other CBC members signed a letter to the Senate saying that if they attach TAA to African Growth Opportunity Act they can\'t count on their votes for it in the House.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>> --\n>> Nikki Budzinski\n>> Labor Outreach Director\n>> Hillary for America\n>> 646-854-1442 (direct)\n>> <6.18.15.xlsx>\n'
