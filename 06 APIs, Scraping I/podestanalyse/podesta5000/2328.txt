john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hey John -- As we now know, climate change is fueling extreme weather, but so far the major news networks have failed to provide substantive coverage of the issue. If the news media continue to ignore the climate crisis, it will be more difficult to build public support for meaningful action to reduce global warming pollution.\n\nWill you help us pressure the evening news programs at CBS, NBC, and ABC to make climate science central to their extreme weather coverage this year? Please take a moment to sign our petition here: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=Pb33XNYBBjiR8yiPE19K8A .\n\nThanks so much,\n\nVanessa\n\n**********\n\nTell the executive producers at the ABC, CBS, and NBC evening news programs to provide more frequent, accurate coverage on climate change: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=5x_AdNHLmmEhagb7hMarZg .\n\xa0\n\nJohn,\n\nTell NBC, CBS, and ABC to give us the facts on climate change: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=gfkDHdbocOf7aJ5QqNBeEw .\n\nThis is ridiculous.\n\n>From record-breaking heat waves and massive wildfires to historic droughts and Superstorm Sandy, we\'ve seen with our own eyes the increasing severity and frequency of extreme weather events this past year.\n\nYet in reporting on these disastrous events, the nightly news programs at the major broadcast networks have largely ignored what is fueling this extreme weather - climate change.\n\nAs the effects of climate change cause hardship for families across America, we need better coverage if we want people to connect the dots and demand real action to curb global warming pollution.\n\nThat\'s why we\'re launching a petition to the executive producers of ABC, CBS, and NBC\'s evening news programs, demanding more -- and better -- news coverage on climate change this year. Will you add your name to help us reach 60,000 signatures in the next two weeks?\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3RLubyBgtHWas0ho0WGjug\n\nA recent Media Matters for America study found that ABC\'s nightly news program did only one segment about climate change last year. Meanwhile, NBC\'s nightly news show did only four and CBS devoted just seven segments to this critical issue.\n\nWhat\'s almost worse is that when these networks have covered global warming, they have often treated climate change as a "two-sided debate" rather than what it really is: an issue in which there is overwhelming scientific consensus. By bringing on climate-denying politicians and pundits, and giving them as much "expert" status as actual climate scientists, the networks perpetuate the false debate that polluter-funded think tanks have instigated to cast doubt on whether we should take action to address the climate crisis at all.\n\nWe need news programs that will provide the American public the facts: global warming is not a disputed "theory," it\'s a reality.\n\nI know we can persuade these networks to give us that coverage, but first we have to show that their viewers are demanding it.\n\nWill you join us in calling on the major news networks to put science center stage in extreme weather and climate coverage this year?\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=zAxWrMlof3QdFcUdQcaBGg\n\nProviding better coverage of the climate crisis and extreme weather events is not only necessary, but shows like PBS NewsHour have already shown that it\'s doable.\n\nLast year, PBS NewsHour devoted 23 segments to covering climate change -- almost twice as many segments as the other networks combined! PBS NewsHour\'s coverage included interviews with 29 climate scientists, including NASA scientist James Hansen, who shared his findings that climate change has increased the probability of heat waves, wildfires, and other extreme weather.\n\nThese segments were compelling and informative, and rightly treated climate change as a reality rather than a political issue up for debate.\n\nWe can get ABC, CBS, and NBC to follow suit, but only if you take a stand today.\n\nTell the major news networks: Don\'t let the new year bring the same old coverage on climate!
