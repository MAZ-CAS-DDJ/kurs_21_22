So we're coming directly to you.\n\nWill you step up before it's too late?\n\nhttp://go.turnoutpac.org/Donate\n\nThanks for your support,\n\n- The Progressive Turnout Project----\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.\n\nTo unsubscribe, go to: \n  http://go.turnoutpac.org/unsubscribe\n\nPaid for by Progressive Turnout Project and not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.\n\n"
