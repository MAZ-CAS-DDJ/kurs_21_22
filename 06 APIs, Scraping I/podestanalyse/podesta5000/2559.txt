There is probably a list I'm on they bought. After you go through all the anti-union, anti-moveon, anti-Reid/Pelosi crap there is a single line where they rant about multiculturalism. If that isn't fancy racism I don't know what is. When they pounce we can have a little counter-campaign waiting for them.\n\nThey are also soliciting checks from corporations which may get them legal cross-wise.\n"
