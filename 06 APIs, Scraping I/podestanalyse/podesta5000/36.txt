john.podesta@gmail.comb'John, we were hoping you might be able to take a quick glance at these two\nexcerpts from HRC\xb9s book dealing with climate change and energy.  We\xb9re\ntrying to finalize the text and get it to the publisher, and want to be sure\nwe\xb9re not stepping on any unforeseen land mines here, especially in terms of\nfracking, keystone, etc.\n\nMany thanks\nDan\n\n\n'
