Unfortunately,\nplans to fund the bill would break important promises to seniors and\nthe disabled. Closing corporate tax loopholes offers a better solution\nand could pay to fix our roads, replace our crumbling bridges, and\nmuch more.

Voters also believe in a science-based approach to\ndecision making when it comes to these safeguards. For example, more\nthan 70 percent of voters surveyed said that scientists at federal\nagencies should work with the public to decide which animals and\nplants should be protected under the Endangered Species Act. Just 18\npercent believe this power should belong to Congress.

John Thune\'s (R-SD) bill would eliminate the deadline for\nrailroad companies to adopt important accident-prevention technology.\nThe bill would also permit the rental of recalled cars that haven\'t\nbeen fixed yet - including those with faulty airbags responsible\nfor at least eight fatal malfunctions. Both provisions would make\ntrain and rental car travel more risky for Americans across the\ncountry.

The case, filed by the Center for\nEnvironmental Health, Beyond Pesticides, and Physicians for Social\nResponsibility, points out that the EPA already has the authority to\nrequire industry to disclose hazardous pesticide additives, even if\nthey\'re not designated as the main, "active" ingredients in a product.\n\nRead more.\n\nhttp://community.foreffectivegov.org/site/R?i=ID3dP5i5dEL5JaAepV_HyQ\n\nSocial Media Shareable:\n\nhttp://community.foreffectivegov.org/site/R?i=FuumMFbB8ho5toNC89_tNw\n\nTake Action\n\nhttp://community.foreffectivegov.org/site/R?i=O5D6ZCMtad_mykzHyPdO4Q\n\nhttp://community.foreffectivegov.org/site/R?i=N0Ko3IivriQ886Lsrfentw\n\nConnect With Us\n\nhttp://community.foreffectivegov.org/site/R?i=FWeuT7JAxfECNIKfqbFeNQ\nhttp://community.foreffectivegov.org/site/R?i=caeRr5uW7LzoSYc7UC5MEw\nhttp://community.foreffectivegov.org/site/R?i=xVhAHJ1A5pGav4OqxFRIrw\nhttp://community.foreffectivegov.org/site/R?i=47SDy0tRxtLp6xRXPq29iQ\n\nIn the News\n\n"More American kids now live in poverty than before the Great\nRecession," Sky Valley Chronicle, July 21, 2015\n\nhttp://community.foreffectivegov.org/site/R?i=GfouIdsSuLHTTVsmLfPWBA\n\n"Toxic battle - Congress should choose kids," op-ed, Santa Fe\nNew Mexican, July 20, 2015\n\nhttp://community.foreffectivegov.org/site/R?i=6J-AG1KabTuGyMgmpoJwYQ\n\n"People power prevails: Wisconsin records still open to the public,"\nop-ed, WisOpinion, July 13, 2015\nhttp://community.foreffectivegov.org/site/R?i=XQbVZYC0wziN5u1MEYGW5g\n\n"Will New Rules Do Enough to Douse the Dangers of Train Fires Like\nMaryville\'s?"
