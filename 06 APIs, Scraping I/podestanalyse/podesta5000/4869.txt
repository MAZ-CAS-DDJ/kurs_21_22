john.podesta@gmail.comb'John:   May not get over to CAP tomorrow for briefing.   Heading to California Wednesday for rest of week and pile of things to get done before.   If I can\'t come,  I\'ll send someone to take good notes and listen to as much as I can.\n\nHave been giving a good deal of thought to Day One topic - "new type great power relationship".   Very much looking  forward to trip/Dialogue.\n'
