What\nwould you say about a man who endorsed a radical abortion ban, and\nsays he even\nopposes a woman\'s right to choose if she is raped? What would\nyou say about a\nman who believes Social Security should be run by Wall Street, and\nthe\nDepartment of Education should be abolished?\n\nYou\'d say he\'s crazy. And you\'d say he\'s too\ncrazy for\nColorado. But all of these extreme right-wing ideas, and more, are the\nwords of\nWeld County District Attorney Ken Buck.\n\nThere has never been a more critical time to fight for the\nbasic values we as progressives can all agree on. There has not been a\nmore\nfundamental crossroads than what Colorado faces this fall. And we need\nyour\nhelp to hold Ken Buck accountable for his radical views-before\nit\'s too late.\nPlease join the fight with your donation of $50 or more to\nProgressNow Colorado.\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=m9E4UtMEc4Xc_3tm4pw0NA..\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=JtLLVr_oz6r_Fer8dW4YKA..\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=PBdcrQg4tpY00yzbUYsl8A..\n\nYesterday, a coalition of progressive organizations held a news\nconference outlining some of the reasons why Ken Buck is too crazy\nfor\nColorado. Here\'s an excerpt from the Associated Press story on our\nevent:\n\nThe coalition - dubbed the Campaign for Strong Colorado -\nincluded Planned Parenthood and ProgressNow Colorado, and it planned\nto use\ncomments Buck made in his primary campaign against him. Early\nammunition\nincluded Buck\'s opposition to abortion rights, even in cases of rape\nand\nincest, and Buck\'s argument for deep cuts to the federal departments\nof\nEducation and Energy. Buck has called for completely cutting off\nfunding for\nthe U.S. Postal Service and Amtrak.\n\n"How can he represent what Colorado\'s all about and say\nthese crazy things?" said Ellen Dumm, executive director of the\ngroup.\n\nThe answer is simple: he doesn\'t. And we have a chance now\nto make sure every Colorado citizen gets the word about Buck, and hold\nhim\naccountable for an agenda that would harm our state for years to come.\nThe\nchoice has never been clearer, and there\'s no time to lose.\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=VKeuGztWjFWVsNZ-Pn-iMw..\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=erQARBk11oemJLrlG0DbaA..\n\nThank you. It is times like these when what we have done\nhere at ProgressNow Colorado since 2003 matters most. And working\ntogether,\nwe\'re going to show the whole country that Coloradans still\nvalue what\nBuck wants to destroy: they are the things that matter most.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKjersten Forseth\nProgressNow Colorado\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa9 2010 ProgressNow Colorado.
