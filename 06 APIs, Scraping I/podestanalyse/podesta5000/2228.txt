John Campbell (R-CA) would\nlike\n<http://taxdollars.freedomblogging.com/2009/10/20/car-dealers-want-to-ev\nade-thumb-of-new-consumer-protection-agency/40259/#more-40259> .\nAmericans for Financial Reform and the Consumer Federation of America\n<http://www.consumerfed.org/>  joined with consumers from Virginia and\nCalifornia to detail the deceptive practices auto dealers use to scam\nbuyers by jacking up the cost of their loans and the need for these\ndealers to be included in the Consumer Financial Protection Agency.\n\n \n\nSusan Weinstock, Director, Financial Reform Campaign, Consumer\nFederation of America: "We are very supportive of the Consumer Financial\nProtection Agency because its sole mission will be the oversight of\nfinancial products and services - things like credit cards, overdrafts,\nthe terrible stories we\'ve heard today about car financings. And it\'s\ngoing to cover unchecked lending abuses that have been a problem for\nconsumers for many years. This is an agency that would write rules that\nwould make sure the market place is fair."\n\n \n\nRosemary Shahan, President, Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety:\n"A majority of car dealers\' profits are derived not from the sales of\ntheir cars, but from the finance and insurance departments which are\nmuch less transparent...Dealers have engaged in numerous practices to\nmaximize their profits including charging excessive dealer markups.\nThese are akin to the fees that brokers get for raising interest on home\nloans. It\'s not as regulated. It\'s not as transparent even as that\ntransaction. \n\n \n\n"Two of the consumers who are on the call today are victims of very\ncommon, pervasive, deceptive practices that many, many dealers engage in\n- yo-yo financing and unpaid car liens. With yo-yo financing they offer\nyou an interest rate that seems competitive ... and then they switch you\nto a higher rate. And if you balk at that higher rate, they do things\nlike report your car as stolen.... With the unpaid liens... the dealer\npromises to pay off the lien and then doesn\'t.... We\'re really hoping\nCongress will reject the Campbell amendment."\n\n \n\nStephanie Feliciano, consumer from Roseville, CA: "When I turned in my\n\'98 Toyota Camry...I bought from them a \'99 Seven Series Beamer. I still\nowed $5,000 on \'98 Toyota Camry and they said, no problem, we\'ll just\nadd it on to the loan and we promise to pay off your trade in.... And a\nfew months later, I applied for an apartment and the landlord there said\nI had a repossession on my credit report which was a shock to me because\nthat was the first time I learned that the dealership had not paid off\nmy \'98 Toyota Camry."\n\n \n\nKeyAnn Gladden, consumer from Norfolk, VA: "I had purchased a vehicle\nfrom a local reputable dealership...was trading in a \'99 Buick\nRendezvous... They gave me the keys. They gave me the 30-day tags. They\nalso had given me a contract for the vehicle. They approved my loan and\nI left. A month went by and I made my first payment. And I get a call\nsaying I need to come into the dealership and sign another contract\nbecause they had made a mistake on my original contract... They said we\ndid not put all the terms on your account that needed to be on the\ncontract so we redid it and it came out higher with a  higher interest\nrate, but it\'s not that bad - only $100 difference. I disputed that with\nthem... I said can I look at the old contract to make sure everything\'s\nthe same on the new contract except for the interest rate? They said we\ndon\'t have your old contract, we already sent that over to headquarters.\nThey kept coming up with all these excuses as to why they couldn\'t\naccommodate me.... I ended up leaving in my new vehicle that I had the\nfirst time I left. I had already made a payment for that vehicle. I\nalready had a contract on that vehicle. \n\n \n\n"At that point I started getting rude phone calls from them...the\nmanager was calling threatening me if I don\'t bring the vehicle back. I\nrefused to bring the vehicle back. I went and got a lawyer.... Two weeks\nwent by, and I was at work. They came up to my job with a tow truck and\nthe police department and wanted to arrest me for grand theft auto....\nThey showed me the warrant for my arrest.  \n\n \n\n"My vehicle, I haven\'t been able to drive it. I\'ve been paying every\nmonth. The payment is almost $600 ...I have a problem getting jobs\nbecause of what was on my background check due to the grand theft auto\ncharge.... It\'s ruined my life.
