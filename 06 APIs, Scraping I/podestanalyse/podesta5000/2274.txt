At any time, before the meeting, you can test your browser for Adobe Connect compatibility at:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>https://admin.adobe.acrobat.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm<\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may be required to install a small browser "add in" - it is recommended that you install this add-in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 - At the meeting start time browse to your meeting room URL.  Please use the link provided (>http://usccollege.adobeconnect.com/r1zn9895ri6/<) to access Adobe Connect before the meeting begins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 - Choose "Enter as a Guest" and enter your first name and your location. For example: John (Los Angeles)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 - You will enter the room and be able to see/hear the presenters. We will not being using the chat function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 - If you have trouble, you can email cts@college.usc.edu<mailto:cts@college.usc.edu> or contact Lauren Portillo at lportill@usc.edu<mailto:lportill@usc.edu> or (909) 731-5511.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'
