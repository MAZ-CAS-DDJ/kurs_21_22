john.podesta@gmail.comb"Our Chicago super-volunteer. He's a pretty smart guy and some of the\nsuggestions here on lower $ fundraising are worth considering. Very\nnegative on LGBTQ hire. I reported on my last Chicago visit that there is\nalso a lot of ethnic agitation there. Probably a place Biden will try to\nplay so we should pay some attention.\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: *John West* <gardens@jwlandscapes.com>\nDate: Sunday, October 11, 2015\nSubject: Feedback Letter\nTo: John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>\n\n\nDear Chairman Podesta,\n\nFirst of all, I just want to thank you and the team for all you are doing\neveryday for our party and our Champion, Hillary :)  It's assuring to see\nall the social media activity from the campaign staff from top to bottom,\nbottom to top, working so hard and sharing such a strong message of support\nand enthusiasm.\n\nThe grassroots\xe2\x80\x99 volunteers have been working really hard with Adam\nParkhomenko. His responsiveness and attention to what we can only imagine\n-- an endless number of questions and inquiries/requests which has been\njust stellar. I wanted to express my gratitude upfront. The conference\ncalls and letting us know what's in the works is appreciated and I know\nmore tools to empower the grassroots are forthcoming.\n\nI'd like to begin with my concerns on the LGBTQ hire that was recently\nannounced.  This is my personal opinion and feeling; though these\nfeelings/concerns are shared by a number of activist friends, who are also\nsupporters of Hillary.\n\nAs you know, this summer was a big deal for marriage equality and the LGBTQ\ncommunity; and it seemed like so much opportunity was lost when no director\nor team of LGBTQ outreach/coordinators were hired.  We were left waiting\nand wondering until the end of September when the hiring of Mr. Lowell was\nannounced. No doubt he is wonderful person and looks to have some solid\nwork experience, but at the same time his hire is confusing and\nunderwhelming. Where was Hillary on this hire?  It feels and looks like she\nhad no part in this hire and that is extremely upsetting!\n\n\xc2\xb7  This is a hire we would expect for a Senate or Governor\xe2\x80\x99s race, not for\nan important & #Herstoric candidate like Secretary of State Clinton. Coming\non the heels of the most important ruling for LGBTQ civil rights in the\nhistory of our country, while the LGBTQ community is splintering into\nprogressive equality movements of race, immigration, transgender, women's\nissues, and other forms of discrimination facing everyone else, except for\nthe exclusive white and affluent gay male community that dominates the\nLGBTQ D.C based organizations.  The optics of this hire are highly\nproblematic within a rapidly changing political environment in the LGBTQ\ncommunity.\n\xc2\xb7 The feedback from my friends, many of whom are highly involved in the\ndiscussions and debates that are currently happening along the lines of\ngender, race, immigration, homeless youth, HIV, Trans-persons, etc. view\nthis hire with cynicism, reacting with \xe2\x80\x9ceye roll\xe2\x80\x9d and accompanied by\nsignificant disappointment over the lack of any boldness in this choice.\n\xc2\xb7 The feedback about this hire from my friends who are donors is deep\ndisappointment because he appears to lacks requisite gravitas expected when\nsoliciting political support and money from a highly sophisticated\ncommunity.\n\xc2\xb7 Optics \xe2\x80\x93 of this hire evokes the exclusionary white male dominated Human\nRights Campaign. Even at the HRC gala this past weekend in D.C people, were\nexpressing their disappointment to outright anger with respect to the\naudience, which had very little diversity present.\n\xc2\xb7 Where are the 'movement' hires? Surely there were folks with credibility\nand breadth of experience who applied for this very important hire? I know\nfrom a grassroots perspective, many of us have experience working with Jeff\nCampagna. Even my contacts in Labor and Equality California seemed behind\nMr. Campagna, so I'm confused as to why someone like Jeff would be\noverlooked. Was this an oversight? I'd think if Hillary was serious about\nthe LGBTQ community she would have had a role in this very important hire,\nand it feels and looks like she had no part in this hire and that it was\nleft to perhaps the talent director and that doesn't feel or look good.\n\xc2\xb7 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t a campaign task force for the LGBTQ community with a strong\ndirector at the helm be more appropriate to aggressively court and tie in\nthe various components to build and consolidate community support for\nHillary? I see no evidence of this reality.  It must happen.\n\n3: Second concern:  The figure of $1,700 is the AVERAGE campaign donation\nfrom Illinois, reported for last quarter.  That is a PROBLEM! As a\ngrassroots organizer and a max donor and someone who helps raise money and\nhas also attended a number of the high dollar events, it's my observation\nthat these events are missed opportunities and leave a considerable amount\nof money on the table. These events should be opened up to:\n\xc2\xb7 10 $1,000 spaces (this would allow for greater diversity at these events);\n\xc2\xb7 5 spots for local volunteers/ college leaders/organizers  - the infusion\nof youth and the energy they bring really makes the event better and\ninspires Hillary's hardest and most important workers to carry on;\n\xc2\xb7 Small Business Host Events $500/small business owners - this is\naffordable by a number of small business owners/many bring women employers;\n4.  Low Dollar fundraising needs support - each state/finance team should\nhave a staff person dedicated to supporting these events and help get the\nlower dollar surrogate events going for the $50 - $250 a head;\n\xc2\xb7    Create an incentive for Hill-Raisers/Blazers to recruit and help low\ndollar fundraisers that commit to raising $2,700 for these events (do\n$5,400, $10,800 levels as well);\n\xc2\xb7    Reinforce that incentive for those low dollar fundraisers that raise\n$2,700 by inviting them once they reach their goal to a high dollar event\nto meet Hillary/photo op :);\n\xc2\xb7    The emails asking for donations need to get on a cycle that works with\neveryday Americans, like  $5 Fridays.\n\xc2\xb7    The amount of emails and follow ups asking for more money makes it\nfeel like my contribution isn't enough, that's the impression the\nexperience leaves one feeling badly;\n5: Ethnic Outreach:  Would it be possible to get a brief audience on November\n2nd with some of the Chicago ethnic leaders: re: Maureen Pikarski who you\nmet in Chicago.  I see Hillary has a window in her busy schedule from 3-6\np.m.  Also, it seems we have had little traction on the Bosnian American\noutreach and that is a HIGHLY strategic in Iowa and Missouri and\nenthusiastic supporters of Hillary. Our Missouri HRC super volunteer has\nasked the Midwest Fundraising team to schedule a side meeting with Hillary\nand the leadership of the St. Louis Bosnian community during her next trip\nto Missouri.  The feedback I'm hearing is that folks have mixed feelings\nabout the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s response so far and I recommend hiring asap and engage\naggressively through the Ethnic Outreach department - more of a TASK FORCE\nwith liaisons to court and engage the diverse constituencies with the\nsensitivity and respect they deserve. It would be most unfortunate to see\nanother young D.C organizational hire that isn't up to the task for each of\nthe assigned 10 desks.\n\n6: Hillary's 2007 delegates - have they been contacted yet? I shared an\nupdated list with David Huyhn at the DNC Summer Meeting and I hope outreach\nis happening. I think it would be a wonderful gesture to do some special\noutreach there. *(update David Huyhn says that is underway! :) )*\n\nConsider the following issues:\n\n7: Messaging:  Hillary's four fights seem to get lost and aren't front and\ncenter (we need easy print outs for folks to hand out that are shrunk down\nso you can print and cut a page into 4 that has four fights on it).\nHillary lacks a slogan like Trump: Let's Make America Great Again or\nBernie: Not for Sale etc. etc.  perhaps Hillary: A fighter in your corner\n (you get the idea)  Bernie has cornered the market on income equality but\nHillary can really pounce on Civil Rights and Social Justice as part an\nparcel of good economic policy. *(As of today, a four fight print out was\nprovided for the debate watch night! THANK YOU!)*\n\n8:  Disability outreach and mobilization - again that should be a special\ntask force - especially targeting caucus states and swing states. Getting\nthem engaged in volunteer activities and identifying ways to get them to\nthe polls! Dr. Janice Lehrer Stein in San Francisco has spoken to you and\nRobbie I believe on this matter.\n\n9:  Many people would like to contribute to this campaign in other ways\nthat do not include money.  CREATE incentives!  Like 1,000 sign-ups gets\nsomeone an autographed book by Hillary! 5,000 sign ups by one person gets\nthem to a high dollar event, 10,000 sign ups gets the person a professional\nautographed and framed photo with Hillary and 50,000 sign ups gets you a\ndinner with Hillary (have this set up like Hillraisers and Hillblazers with\nrecruitment so that folks get credit for the efforts of their recruits)\n\n10: Create another incentive for merchandise:  Like Hillraiser Links -\nprovide HillMerchandiser Links so that folks get an incentive/credit for\nevery sale made via purchases on those links...this helps encourage folks\nto sell and promote the merchandise store!  Again - a certain number of\nsales gets someone free merchandise, an even greater amount of sales gets\nyou an invitation to a fundraiser event with Hillary or Bill or Chelsea,\netc.\n\n11:  St. Louis is the largest Bosnian American community in the U.S.\n--around 80,000.  Angie Acree, HRC Super Volunteer and the Clinton Campaign\nvolunteer rep in Missouri has asked the Midwest Fundraising Team to arrange\nfor a side meeting between Hillary and the Bosnian American leadership in\nMissouri during her next fundraising trip.  It is the belief of Ajla\nDelkic, the executive director of the Advisory Council for Bosnia and\nHerzegovina (based in D.C.) that it would take little attention by Hillary\nto light this community on fire.  Mr. Vajrovic is the leader and is locally\nconnected to the Democratic Party. But no one has ever met with them from\nthe Democratic Party at a senior level.  Barack Obama lost Missouri to\nMcCain by 3,903 votes in 2008. These votes are to be SOUGHT aggressively.\n\n12:  At the recent Ethnic Council Meeting with Amy Dacey, CEO of the DNC\nhere in Chicago, the talk among the ethnic leaders of Chicago area was the\nlack of outreach to their constituencies....People were highlighting the\nabsence of aggressive outreach since Bill Clinton's campaigns in 96 and\nObama's in 2007 - November 2nd - Hillary is in Chicago ALL day for\nfundraisers - would be nice if an Ethnic Round Table could be arranged\n(small one) with Maureen Pikarski who could help make that happen\n1-312-718-9351 and if it could be filmed by various news outlets that cater\nto these constituencies - would be huge in audience reached and for\nmobilizing the ethnic communities to help in IOWA and in IOWA!\n\n13:  Lastly swag:  I know and appreciate how much frugality is being\nexercised in the primary (in stark contrast to 2007) but if perhaps\nsomething could be worked out so that grassroots point people in each state\nare not encumbered with the expense of providing the basics like bumper\nstickers (that provides free advertising!) lapel stickers at a minimum.\nThis would be for commit to votes/commit to caucus but would really help at\nthe tables/booths so many volunteers do (which many cost money to do) and\nprovide incentives. It really is what is required in getting sign ups. The\nmost successful efforts over the summer were ones that had folks who could\nafford to buy supplies like this for handing out in exchange for sign ups.\n\n\nThank you for your time reading this.  Line item one is a very personal\nobservation that has been shared with me from a number of sources involved\nin the LGBTQ movement/leaders etc - particular midwest to west coast. The\nrest are number of observations and feedback I've heard from multiple folks\nalong the way.\n\nThank you for all you do to support Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s historic campaign for the\npresidency.  Those of us in the grassroots and a growing contingent of\nvolunteers continue to work hard for our Champion, she is worth it!\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn West\n'Volunteer and Supporter'\n"
