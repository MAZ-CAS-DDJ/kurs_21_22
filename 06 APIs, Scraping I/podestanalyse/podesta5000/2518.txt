john.podesta@gmail.comb'Looks good megan,\r\nSmall point.  On climate I like when she includes \xe2\x80\x98But I listen to them\xe2\x80\x99 after \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not a scientist either\xe2\x80\x99.  It makes the Reps look smaller, heads in the sand.\r\n\r\nFrom: Megan Rooney <mrooney@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:mrooney@hillaryclinton.com>>\r\nDate: Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 7:17 AM\r\nTo: Jennifer Palmieri <jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com>>\r\nCc: Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com<mailto:jbenenson@bsgco.com>>, Speech Drafts <speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com>>\r\nSubject: REVISED DRAFT: Talking points for tonight in Colorado\r\n\r\nGood morning all -- here are revised bullets for this evening.  I think they do everything we discussed.\r\n\r\nThree things:\r\n\r\n1. At the top, instead of writing out entire riffs that she knows backward and forward from the stump, we just put in the main tent-pole sentences, to leave the rest to her.  You\'ll see.\r\n\r\n2.  The "right to rise" immigration hit is different -- take a look.\r\n\r\n3.  Added a few sentences on the Voting Rights Act.\r\n\r\nHRC is departing earlier than planned this morning so I\'ll have to send her a revised version in the next 1.5 hours or so.  So please send me any edits asap.  (If you miss this window, the event isn\'t until tonight so we\'ll have time for important changes today.)\r\n\r\nThank you all for your invaluable guidance!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Mon, Aug 3, 2015 at 10:31 PM, Jennifer Palmieri <jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com>> wrote:\r\nSorry!

I\'m changing it so she\'s not endorsing that idea.  Joel let me know if I misunderstood you.\r\n\r\nOn Mon, Aug 3, 2015 at 10:29 PM, Jennifer Palmieri <jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com>> wrote:\r\nHm...,pretty sure we talked on the call with HRC today specifically\r\nabout using "right to rise" formulation to hit Jeb on immigration.\r\nThought you and I discussed separately, too.  Maybe not.  At any rate,\r\nit is the only way we make any news for the rest of the week.  If\r\nfolks have another formulation to hit Jeb on immigration that break\r\nthrough, that is great.  Otherwise I think we stick with right to\r\nrise.\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n\r\n> On Aug 3, 2015, at 9:35 PM, Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com<mailto:jbenenson@bsgco.com>> wrote:\r\n>\r\n> Megan,\r\n> I\'m not sure about co opting right to rise..
