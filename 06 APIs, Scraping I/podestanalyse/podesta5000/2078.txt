It's a right. Help us make sure our waters are protected. [ https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/t/9935/content.jsp?content_KEY=6304 ] \n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nLast week we told you that Congress is debating new changes that would strip the EPA of its authority to enforce the laws that protect our water, our air and our health. Many of you responded by making a donation to support our campaign. If you've already made a contribution, thank you...if not, we need your support now, more than ever! [ https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/t/9935/content.jsp?content_KEY=6304 ] \n\nThe budget bill being considered in Congress has several provisions that would limit the EPA's ability to protect our water. One would prevent EPA from taking action to restore protection for small streams and wetlands. That would leave the drinking water of 117 million Americans at risk of contamination. \n\nThere are also hundreds of proposed amendments that would make the bill even worse, limiting the EPA's ability to control toxic mercury emissions, regulate drilling for oil off our coasts or even just study the effects of climate change. \n\nPlease help us fight for clean water by sending a donation of $36, $60, $120, or more - today. [ https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/t/9935/content.jsp?content_KEY=6304 ] Your contribution will help Clean Water Action make sure that our Representatives and Senators know that we can't afford to play politics with our water and our health. \n\nCongress should be urging the EPA onward, advancing new protections for our water. Instead, it's debating how to weaken the laws and increase profits for polluters at the expense of our health and the clean water on which we all depend. \n\nWith your help Mary, we can stop these attacks and tell our legislators to strengthen, not weaken, protection of our drinking water. \n\nPlease join me in making a stand for clean water.
