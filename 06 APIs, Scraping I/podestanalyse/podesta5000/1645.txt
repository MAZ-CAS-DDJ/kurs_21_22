This Saturday JJ-Hillary is in and out-but on her way from the airport on Saturday, or to the airport on Sunday, it is very important if she could do a one hour stop in Aurora. We are especially weak there with Latinos and African Americans, and it is key for us to capture the delegates we need from the 7th Congressional District; and\n\n2. On February 21, we need to get WJC to Pueblo. We cannot the 3rd CD delegate race if we can't energize Pueblo! I know you are trying, but we really need this two things to happen.\n\nPlease call me (303)868-9910.\n\nKen Salazar\n\n\n\nSent from my iPad"
