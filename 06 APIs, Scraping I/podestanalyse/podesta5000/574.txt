john.podesta@gmail.comb'\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m in Israel where I have met with various high tech co\xe2\x80\x99s that have developed some incredible technologies that can be of great help to an eventual campaign.\r\nThere are two that have the greatest  potential.\r\nOne of them is summarized in one slide that just says what they do at 50k feet.The other one will come at you soon.\r\nI would strongly recommend that whoever will be in charge of all of our online efforts meets with them for an hour and explores the opportunity.\r\nI have no horse in this race other than to support our cause.\r\nPls LMK>\r\nTx John\r\n'
