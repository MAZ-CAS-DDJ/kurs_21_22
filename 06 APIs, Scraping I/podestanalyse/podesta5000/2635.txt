I plan to ignore unless someone thinks we should?\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n\n*From:* Andrew Perez <andrew.perez@ibtimes.com>\n*Date:* April 27, 2015 at 1:38:31 PM EDT\n*To:* Karen Finney <kfinney@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Subject:* *New request for comment*\n\nMs. Finney,\n\nWe\'re writing a follow-up piece on companies lobbying the State Department\nwhile Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and paying President Clinton\nspeaking fees.\n\nIn all, 13 companies and corporate trade associations made payments to\nPresident Clinton in close chronological proximity to when those\norganizations were lobbying Hillary Clinton\'s State Department. Nine out of\nthose thirteen groups paid Bill Clinton speaking fees in the very same\nreporting period that federal records show them lobbying Hillary Clinton\'s\nState Department.\n\nWas it appropriate for companies lobbying the State Department to pay\nPresident Clinton speaking fees around the same time? Please let us know if\nyou plan to answer or comment.\n\nWe\'re on deadline and will publish today. I can be reached at (954) 410-4522\n.\n\nThank you,\nAndrew\n\n-- \n*ANDREW PEREZ*\nInternational Business Times\nNational Political Reporter\nc: (954) 410-4522\nt: @andrewperezdc\n<http://t.signauxdeux.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0SmZ58dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7sM9dn7dK_MMdBzM2-04?t=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fandrewperezdc&si=4710579288145920&pi=0d1d24ac-a9e6-47fd-f277-0e8179740632>\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "HRCRapid" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n'
