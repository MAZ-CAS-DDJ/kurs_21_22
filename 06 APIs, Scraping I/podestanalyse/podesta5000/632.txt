And it should only take a couple minutes\n(and doesn\'t require buying or making a gift (or dumping ice water on your\nhead)).  I have set up a Google Form where you can input your comments, and\nthen I will compile all the responses into an attractive "book" that\ncaptures and conveys how much we all love, care about, and appreciate her.\n The form is accessible at this link\n<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fNsYnD_v-M0kkZWL_mEw2lwmkMSfHHgjw_VLP5iBWHo/viewform?usp=send_form>\n:\n\nIf you could please fill it out this weekend, that will give me time to put\nit all together and make it nice and pretty.\n\nThank you SO much.  I think Susan will really be touched by what everyone\nhas to share.  Again, please CLICK HERE\n<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fNsYnD_v-M0kkZWL_mEw2lwmkMSfHHgjw_VLP5iBWHo/viewform?usp=send_form>\nto share your words of tribute.\n\nBest,\nSteve\n\nP.S.  It probably goes without saying, but let me say anyway that this is a\nSURPRISE for Susan, so please don\'t say anything to her about it until the\n19th.  Gracias.\n\n-- \n___________________\nSteve Phillips\nhttp://www.s <http://www.pacplus.org>tevephillips.com\ntwitter.com/StevePtweets\n'
