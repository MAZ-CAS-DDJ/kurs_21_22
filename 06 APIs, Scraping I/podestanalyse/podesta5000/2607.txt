john.podesta@gmail.comb'Events taking a positive course.  Sending this one to both of you.  I would suggest\nHRC take a look at, and talk about, Sybil Ludington, the 16 year old girl who was\nthe female Paul Revere during the American Revolution.  She is going to make\nan appearance in the historical fiction novel/screenplay I am working on, and I\nresearched her, she was absolutely wonderful.  Short version, her dad was a leader\nof patriots and when the British were coming to Connecticut she volunteered to\nround up the Patriots to rally to their defense, persuaded her reluctant father to let\nher do it, rode 40 miles all night through the rain, rounded up the troops who\nsaved the day!  Her family fell on the floor when George F-ing Washington, who\nfound out about it, came to personally thank her!\n\nBeen saving this for a social occasion, which is now.\n\nIt is a fabulous story, all true, HRC will truly love it, and wonderful material for her\nto discuss sometime, the female Paul Revere!  A Christian couple made a nice\nlow budget film about her, here is the Wikipedia:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_Ludington\n\n\nSent from my iPad'
