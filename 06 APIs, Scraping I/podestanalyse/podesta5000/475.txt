The debate over where the Senate  of the \nUnited  States stands on this question is now  settled.  The Senate \xe2\x80\x93 like \nthe  American people, the House of Representatives and the President \xe2\x80\x93 \nsupports a  public option. \nWhat is not settled is whether the majority will be allowed to have an up  \nor down vote on a health care bill that includes a public option.   \nThe question is: will any of the Democratic Senators join with the  \nRepublicans to prevent an up or down vote on a bill containing a public option \xe2\x80\x93  \none that is supported by the overwhelming majority of the American  people? \nWill any of those Democratic Senators allow themselves to be used by the  \ninsurance industry to stifle the will of the majority of Americans who want \nto  end that industry\xe2\x80\x99s stranglehold over the American health care  system? \nSixty members of the Senate caucus with Democrats \xe2\x80\x93 58 Democrats and two  \nindependents (Joe Lieberman and Bernie Sanders).  These 60 members share in \nthe benefits  of being part of the majority party, including committee \nchairmanships. Together  they control enough votes to end a Republican filibuster \naimed at blocking  health insurance reform, and allow an up or down vote \nthat this critical bill  deserves. This should be a no-brainer. To their \ncredit, many Democrats who are  not strong supporters of the public option have in \nfact indicated that they  would not stand in the way of an up or down vote. \n Yet several Democratic Senators have not  yet committed to vote with the \nDemocratic Leadership and support a vote to  proceed. \nRemember that to pass a bill  in the Senate you only need 51 votes \xe2\x80\x93 or 50 \nvotes plus the tie-breaking vote of  the Vice President.   We do not need \nevery Democrat to pass a  bill.  But every one of them must  vote to end \ndebate on a bill to allow an up or down vote to take place, since  ending debate \nin the Senate requires 60 votes.  \nIf some Democrats disagree with the content of the bill \xe2\x80\x93 or oppose a  \npublic option \xe2\x80\x93 so be it. They should vote no on final passage.  But they should \nnever side with the  Republicans on a procedural vote to prevent an up or \ndown, majority vote on the  substance of the issue.  \nFrankly, if a  Democrat votes against the party on a procedural vote and \nempowers the  Republicans to block a vote on the party\xe2\x80\x99s top domestic \npriority, the caucus  should strip that Senator of all of the power that comes from \nbeing part of the  Majority Party \xe2\x80\x93 including committee chairmanships.  \nIt is one thing to oppose the substance of a bill.  It\xe2\x80\x99s another to oppose \nthe Party  Leadership on a procedural motion and block the will of the \nmajority.  That kind of breach of party discipline  makes it impossible for a \nmajority party to govern.  On procedural votes members of a  majority party \nhave to stick together or they might as well not be in the  majority \xe2\x80\x93 they \nhand the reins over to the minority. \nIn this case they would also be thwarting the will of the voters who \xe2\x80\x93  \nvery intentionally \xe2\x80\x93 ended Republican control of Congress and put Democrats in  \nthe majority so they could make change. \nBy voting with Republicans on a procedural vote, a Democrat would, in  \neffect, be handing the gavel back to Republican Senator Mitch McConnell.  They \nwould be allowing the minority  Republicans and their insurance industry \nallies to set the parameters for the  kind of change is even allowed to come to \na vote in Congress.  \nThat would be true on any issue.  But it is especially true of the Party\xe2\x80\x99s \nmarquee issue, health care  reform.  By joining with the  Republicans and \npreventing its leadership from calling an up or down vote on  health care \nreform, a Democratic Senator would be engaging in a traitorous  act.  Not only \nwould he or she be  preventing implementation of a critical party priority.  \nThat Senator would also be politically  endangering many of the swing seats \nheld by House and Senate Members who are up  for re-election next year.   \nThat\xe2\x80\x99s right \xe2\x80\x93 it is the swing district Democrats that would be  \nendangered by the failure to pass President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s health insurance  reform.  Look \nat what happened after  the 1993 failure of the Clinton health plan that was \nalso the  centerpiece of his Presidency. In 1994, Democrats lost 54 seats.  \nOf those, 36 were incumbents.  It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the members from strong  Democratic \ndistricts, who had fought hard for health care reform, who lost.  It was \nmainly members from swing  districts, rural districts and southern districts. \nThe Clinton health care bill never came to a vote  in the House, but only \n11 of the 36 incumbents who lost had co-sponsored the  bill.  Many of the 25 \nothers had  opposed the Clinton health care plan.  Didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter; they were \nthe biggest  political victims of the failure of health care reform.  \nHistory shows that when the  popularity and job performance rating of an \nincumbent President drops, the odds  of swing Democrats being elected to \nCongress drop as  well. \nAnd it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just that swing voters lost faith in Democrats.  Base \nDemocratic voters failed to turn  out.  Republican base voters \xe2\x80\x93  smelling \nDemocratic blood in the waters\xe2\x80\x93 turned out in record  numbers. \nThe fact is that just as a rising political tide lifts all boats, when  the \npolitical tide recedes those in the shallowest political water are most  \nlikely to be left aground.  \nFailure to take  action on health care would be the most likely way to end \nthe majority status  for Democrats.  Such a failure would  massively damage \nthe political standing of the President and the Democrat  brand.  That, in \nturn, would sink  swing district Democrats.  The  Republicans know this.  That\n\xe2\x80\x99s why  they are fighting so hard to prevent the passage of health \ninsurance  reform.  Any Democratic Senator who  helps them is endangering fellow \nDemocrats.  \nThat is particularly true since polls show that the policy question at  \nissue, the public option, is uniformly popular in swing, frontline and Blue Dog \n districts. The firm of Anzelone Liszt recently released the results of a \npoll it  conducted in 91 Blue Dog, Rural Caucus and Frontline districts.  The \npoll found that 54% of the voters in  these battleground districts support \nthe choice of a public  option. \nIn fact, throughout the country, giving consumers the choice of a public  \noption is one of the most popular elements of the overall health insurance  \nreform bill.  \nBut what is more important is that Democrats in swing districts need a  \npublic option to convince voters to favor a health insurance mandate.  Anzeloni \nand  Liszt make clear in their polling report that in swing districts: \xe2\x80\x9c\nIt\'s wrong to think about the public option  in isolation from other elements \nof reform. Forcing an individual mandate  without a public option is a clear \npolitical loser (34% Favor / 60% Oppose), and  only becomes more palatable \nwhen a public option is offered in competition with  the private sector (50% \nFavor / 46%  Oppose).\xe2\x80\x9d \nTurns out that a  public option provides a political inoculation against \nbacklash to a  mandate.  That\xe2\x80\x99s because people have  no stomach for being \nherded into the arms of private insurance industry like  sheep to the slaughter. \n They want  to know that if the government is going to require them to get \nhealth insurance,  that it also provides the choice of a not-for-profit \npublic plan \xe2\x80\x93 that they are  not left at the mercy of private insurance  CEO\xe2\x80\x99s. \nIt is fine for each Democrat in the Senate to vigorously advocate his or  \nher own position on health care.  But once the majority of the Senate has \nmade up its mind, no Democrat  should be allowed to side with the Republicans \nto block the majority will \xe2\x80\x93 to  block the Congress and the President from \ntaking action.  Not only would that be terrible for the  country-- it \nthreatens the majority status of the Democratic  Party. \nIf a Democratic Senator votes to prevent his party from having an up or  \ndown vote on its top domestic priority, he is endangering the political lives \nof  his swing district colleagues.  That  would be unforgivable. \nRobert Creamer is a long-time political  organizer and strategist, and \nauthor of the recent book: \xe2\x80\x9cStand Up Straight: How  Progressives Can Win,\xe2\x80\x9d \navailable on _amazon.com_ \n(http://www.amazon.com/Listen-Your-Mother-Straight-Progressives/dp/0979585295/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1206567141&sr=8-1\n) .\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
