FDA has the authority to\ncompel such a disclosure.\n\nHowever, state action will inevitably move us towards a national solution,\nalbeit not as swiftly. Many companies will choose to comply with Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s\nGMO labeling law by changing their packaging for all 50 states, not simply\nfor Vermont. 17 states are now considering legislating mandatory labeling\nand apparently there will now be a CA referendum again in 2016 with a\nstronger and better crafted proposal.  As more states enact GMO labeling\nlaws, the numbers of companies that choose to label for the national market\nwill grow. In addition, more companies will work with us to craft a\nnational solution \xe2\x80\x94 just like menu labeling for restaurants.\n\nSo, permitting states to continue to require GMO labeling is certainly an\noption and Secretary Clinton could stand for the principle that states have\nlong held the right to require disclosure on food packages \xe2\x80\x94 a right\nenshrined in the preemption provisions of the NLEA (which only apply to the\nnutrition facts panel and the ingredient line, not the rest of the food\npackage). States have used their power to compel everything from use-by and\nsell-by dates to grading for butter and maple syrup.\n\nAnd though as you say, it is probably obvious, nothing less than mandatory\nlabeling is going to ensure a level playing field for all manufacturers.\nWhile most complain about any new labeling requirements, every CEO I know\nprefers the certainty of a single national solution over a patchwork one.\nI lived through the food industry\'s endless protests against the NLEA\n(passed as you know during the Clinton Administration), but once it was in\nplace, everyone has been happy and gone back to business as usual.\n\nLet me know if you need more information.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n*Gary Hirshberg Chairman, Stonyfield Farm*\n\n*Chairman, Just Label It *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:        John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>\nTo:        Gary HIRSHBERG <GHIRSHBERG@stonyfield.com>\nDate:        07/01/2015 03:55 AM\nSubject:        Re: Recommendations on Mandatory Federal GMO Labeling\n------------------------------\n\n\n\nGary,\nI guess it\'s probably obvious, but can you say a bit more about why\nnational mandatory is preferable to no preemption? Discussing today with\ncolleagues and will brief her before she sees you so you can discuss.\nJohn\n\nOn Friday, June 19, 2015, Gary HIRSHBERG <*GHIRSHBERG@stonyfield.com*\n<GHIRSHBERG@stonyfield.com>> wrote:\nHi John, as you requested, I am forwarding a memo that summarizes the state\nof play with the national GMO labeling debate as well as policy\nrecommendations for Secretary Clinton.  I have also attached an Executive\nSummary of the recent Mellman polling data.  The full 60 page report is\navailable if you\'d like to receive it.\n\nI had a very nice chat with Robby at yesterday\'s lunch and am cc\'ing him as\nwell.\n\nPlease don\'t hesitate to reach out to me if I can provide further\ninformation or clarification. As I explained to you on the phone, there is\nvery clear and compelling USDA and USGS data demonstrating a strong\nlikelihood of serious health and environmental threats due to the\nskyrocketing increases in herbicides associated with GMO usage.  The most\nprolific of these compounds has now been found by the WHO to be "probably\ncarcinogenic", and the USGS reports that 60-100% of Iowa rainwater contains\nthem.   Leading agronomists and public health scientists are extremely\nconcerned that these trends are rapidly increasing. To me, this is the key\nreason why citizens need the right to know and therefore choose, but in the\ninterest of brevity, I have spared you a summary of those data.  As you\nwill read, we believe that the Right to Know is a compelling and rational\nposition even without the Secretary having to become conversant about the\nherbicide "treadmill", but I am happy to supply you with a brief on that\nproblem if you wish.\n\nI am looking forward to briefly discussing this matter with the Secretary\nwhen she visits our home on July 3rd. Until then, please let me know if and\nhow I can be useful.\n\nOn a separate and related note, I have heard both you and Robby speak about\nSecretary Clinton\'s strong interest in promoting sustainable and clean\nindustry and job growth.  Needless to say, this is where my last 30 years\nhave been focussed and I sit on many boards and invest in a great many\nsustainable food businesses. If I can be helpful in developing policy and\ntalking points in the clean food and energy space, I am at your and her\nservice.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n* Gary Hirshberg Chairman, Stonyfield Farm*\n* Chairman, Just Label It*\n'
