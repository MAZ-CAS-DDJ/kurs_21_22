john.podesta@gmail.comb'Fun day yesterday.  I hope it was productive for HRC.    My main observation is that her personal story of her parents that she ended both speeches with is really compelling.   The audiences were enraptured.  Really zoned in.   People think they know everything about her, and they dont.   The more they learn about the personal stuff, and things like the anecdotes I shared yesterday and others are doing as well, then there will be a greater appreciation for the fact she is fighting for them.   She is really good!\n\nOff to Nevada Monday for her.   Coincidentally, I committed previously to doing The Daily Show Tuesday, so this stuff might come up then.   \n\nThx for looking out for Kalen.  As you know, she is wonderful.\n\ntake care\ntom\nOn Dec 3, 2015, at 10:49 PM, John Podesta wrote:\n\n> Did you get what you needed from Xochitl?  She was pulling the background together. Thanks for doing this and have fun tomorrow.\n\n'
