In light of his decision, we must take\nthe opportunity to reflect on the challenges of this papacy. To many, the\nCatholic church hierarchy has been seen as an institution overly focused on\nissues of human sexuality, such as opposition to access to birth control\nand marriage equality, rather than first serving the poor as Christ\ncommanded.\n\n\x93The next pope has a unique opportunity to radically shift the agenda of\nthe church. Increasingly, the Catholic church is one that represents\ninterests far removed from Europe or North America. The cardinals can and\nshould consider opening their horizons toward a successor from the global\nsouth, such as Latin America or Africa, whose experience represents a\nvastly different worldview than many church leaders.\n\n\x93Catholics know the heavy burden of the papacy is wrought with challenges.\nThe next pope will have to face the greatest moral challenge of our day:\nthe imminent threat of global climate change and its effect on the poorest.\nHe must protect and expand equality and the role of women and those\naffected by oppression. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, he must\ndedicate himself to protecting the least among us, especially children, who\nhave been affected by the shameful scourge of abuse.\n\n\x93We pray the next pope has the wisdom to lead us in a bold direction toward\nhope and unity, and away from oppression and division.\x94\n\nSalt is available for comment or appearances today.\n\nFounded in 2004, Catholics United, and its educational arm, Catholics\nUnited Education Fund, are non-profit, non-partisan organizations dedicated\nto promoting the message of justice and the common good found at the heart\nof the Catholic Social Tradition.\n\nFor more information about Catholics United, \x93like\x94 us on our Facebook page\n(www.facebook.com/CatholicsUnited), follow us on Twitter (\nwww.twitter.com/CatholicsUnited) or on our blog at www.OurDailyThread.org.\n\n###\n\n\n\n-- \nJames Salt\nCatholics United Executive Director\nCatholics United Education Fund Executive Director\n202-246-2583\njsalt@catholics-united.org\n\n-- \n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.
