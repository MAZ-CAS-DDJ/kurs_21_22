As of tomorrow HRC will have earned nine building trades\nendorsements and they've been shared successes with Mike.\n\nVery exciting to share with you that on Thursday, December 3rd the North\nAmerica Building Trades Union will be voting as the Governing Board of\nPresidents to endorse HRC.  That endorsement will allow us to coordinate\ndirectly with local and state building and construction trades bodies.  It\nis also the first time (since likely Ronald Reagan) that the body has made\nthis type of endorsement.  Mike was able to confirm this today.\n\nGreat news.  Thank you Mike for all of your help, tremendous.  Shout out to\nthe awesome policy team too on this work together.  Team effort.\n\n-- \nNikki Budzinski\nLabor Outreach Director\nHillary for America\n646-854-1442 (direct)\n"
