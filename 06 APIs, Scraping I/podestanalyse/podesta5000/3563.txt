john.podesta@gmail.comb'<!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="content" -->Friend,\n\nI know you\'re busy, so I\'ll make this quick:\n\nKen Cuccinelli wasn\'t allowed to fundraise for his campaign\nduring the legislative session. But now that it\'s over, the\nKoch Brothers and their special interest pals are filling\nCuccinelli\'s war chest.\n\nIf we want to keep pace, we need to raise $50,000 before our\ndeadline at the end of this month.\n\nWill you make a $5 donation today?\n\nhttp://finance.terry2013.com/februarygoal\n\nThe most recent polling shows that this race is neck and\nneck. We can\'t let up even for a minute.\n\nThanks, \nTerry\n\nDONATE NOW: http://finance.terry2013.com/februarygoal\n\n_______________\n\nThis message was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.
