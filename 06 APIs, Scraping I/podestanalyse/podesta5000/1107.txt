And there is a sound bite on it\nin that section as well\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n\nOn Nov 19, 2015, at 1:42 PM, John Anzalone <john@algpolling.com> wrote:\n\nI am clearly not a ISIS policy guy so take my comments with a grain of salt\nbut what I thought was missing from a layman\xe2\x80\x99s perspective was a strong\ncall for Middle Eastern countries to join the fight with an immediate\ncommitment of money and ground troops (all I saw was Jordan mentioned).  We\nhave  \xe2\x80\x9cwork with our Arab partners\xe2\x80\x9d but I think this speech should lay out\na list of countries that should be supplying troops, planes, equipment,\ntraining, intelligence and money.  Call them out and call them out big.\nThat is where the American people are.  They are frustrated that this is a\nMiddle Eastern problem being fought by America and Europe.  We spent $500\nmillion training Syrian rebels and got nothing and we defended Iraq for a\ndecade and trained their army to see them all defect.  Re-asserting the\nneed for just training and the Suni\xe2\x80\x99s to rejoin the fight is not enough.\nShe needs to outline exactly who in the Middle East should be on the\nbattlefield with us.  That is missing.  She needs to call them out.\n\n\n\nThe speech mentions new \xe2\x80\x9cno fly zones\xe2\x80\x9d in Syria.  How does that square with\nRussia\xe2\x80\x99s current bombing campaign?  Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she call out the Russians for\nmaking the situation worse?  They would make her appear strong.  Take on\nPutin here.  There is language about \xe2\x80\x9cending Assad\xe2\x80\x99s rule\xe2\x80\x9d which seems to\ndefy political reality.  Why go there?  It is not going to happen in the\nalgebra of defeating ISIS so why don\xe2\x80\x99t we stick to the task at hand.\n\n\n\nOn Syrian refugees, is it enough to call  just for vigilant screening?\nShouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we call for a thorough review of how we screen to make sure the\nprocedures are actually up to snuff?  I think both the CIA/FBI heads have\ntestified and acknowledged that our screening may not deter terrorists.\nAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the american people feel like the screening process is\nadequate.\n\n\n\nAll in all I worry that if we don\xe2\x80\x99t really call out specifically by name\nthe Middle Eastern countries that need to join the fight in a significant\nway that there will not seem like much new here.  This seems ore like a\nreview of the diagnosis, a stroll down memory lane and a call for more\nbombing and intelligence gathering.\n\n\n\n*John Anzalone*\n\n*Partner *\n\nAnzalone Liszt Grove Research\n\n(o) 334.387.3121\n\nWebsite <http://algpolling.com/>*| *Twitter\n<http://twitter.com/anzaloneliszt>*|* LinkedIn\n<https://www.linkedin.com/pub/john-anzalone/5/aa2/563>*|* Facebook\n<http://facebook.com/anzaloneresearch>\n\n\n\n*From: *<speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com> on behalf of Dan Schwerin <\ndschwerin@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Date: *Thursday, November 19, 2015 at 2:53 AM\n*To: *Speech Drafts <speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com>, Speech Book <\nspeechbook@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Subject: *Remarks on ISIS\n\n\n\nI wanted to be sure everyone got this latest draft of our ISIS speech.
