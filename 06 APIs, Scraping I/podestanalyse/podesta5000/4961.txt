We have\nto get her something today.  Elizabeth is erroneously tying it to\nconservation, so should we set the record straight with her?   She wants to\nknow the nature of your work for them, and if you consider your\nconservation work to be a conflict of interest while at the WH.\n\nBasically she found your Politico monuments op-ed from Oct 2013 and thinks\nthat's a result of your consultancy agreement.\n\n\n-- \nEryn M.
