It\'s far more likely that it\'s just\nsunspot activity..."\n- Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Senate Candidate\n\nDear John,\n\nWhy are people like Sarah Palin, the Tea Party and their endorsed candidates rejecting the sound and settled science of climate change?\n\nDo they think the earth is flat too? Maybe it\'s time to change the name of the Tea Party to the Flat Earth Party. Their extremist views are both ridiculous and scary.\n\nCheck out LCV\'s new video and see their extremist views for yourself: \n\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=LsHnmKIqSixTYQpooEJz1A..\n\nIn any other election year, these "Flat Earthers" would be merely fringe candidates. But this year, most of the Republican candidates running for U.S. Senate are full-fledged global warming deniers. Worse, many of these climate skeptics are running neck-and-neck with our clean energy champions. \xa0There\'s a good chance that some - or even all of them - could win if we don\'t act now. For example, in Wisconsin, Senator Russ Feingold is running just one-point ahead in his race against Ron "Sunspots" Johnson and in Nevada, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is running even in his race with Tea Party activist and climate change denier Sharron Angle.\n\nI honestly fear for the future of our planet if either of these extremists wins in November. But Ron Johnson and Sharron Angle are both just the tip of a fast melting iceberg. Climate change deniers are locked in close Senate races with environmental leaders in states like California, Colorado, Missouri and New Hampshire. Over the next six weeks, we need every environmental voter to stand up and help us take on these extremists.\n\nSo please do three things for me right now: \n\n1)\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Take two minutes and watch our new video. You\'ll be both amused - and appalled - by it. http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=nvJ603XojtxZwjhlbKp0XQ..\n\n2)\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 After you watch the video, please take our pledge. http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=VoBBsvNcF31yGzDEU8TfEA..\nWe\'re asking you to vote only for those candidates who agree that climate\nchange is sound and settled science.\n\n3)\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 After you take the pledge, please tell a friend or two about the video. We   can only win in November if we can get thousands of people to watch the video and sign the pledge. http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=A7ifbzGHnjEUM1I87ERYcw..\n\nBottom line: If we want to continue fighting for climate policies next year, we need to defeat these climate deniers this year. We can\'t afford to let the "Flat\nEarthers" ascend to the U.S. Senate. Now is the time to stand opposed to these global warming deniers and stand up for a clean energy future.\n\nThank you for your help and thank you for spreading the word about LCV\'s video.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=LMbEuCDc_3gTCJMV4Whf8Q..\n\nSincerely,\n\nGene Karpinski\nPresident\nLeague of Conservation Voters\n\n\n\nUpdate Your Profile\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=8vadgxpSu5sS9YyHXbRzKA..\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=bLmEUFy3ZT5bJL1M6wQPCVNzeC3QOWYY&cid=0\n\n'
