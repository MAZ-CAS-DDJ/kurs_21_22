We need to get it in the hands of a lot more people.\'...In January, Adapt Pharma said it will offer a free carton of Narcan Nasal Spray to all U.S. high schools through state education departments, and work with the Clinton Health Matters Initiative to increase naloxone access nationwide."\n\n\nThe Clinton Foundation at South by Southwest 2016\nDrawing on his experience working on \'Inside Impact: East Africa<https://www.facebook.com/clintonglobalinitiative/videos/vb.377374190317/10153250212525318/>,\' a virtual reality film featuring President Clinton and Chelsea on their 2015 trip to East Africa, Bryan Mochizuki, CGI\'s Director of Marketing, participated on a panel at this year\'s South by Southwest Festival (SXSW) on the future of virtual reality technology in philanthropy.\nRead a live-blog of the panel here: http://www.thekindlechronicles.com/2016/03/15/virtual-reality-from-empathy-to-action-liveblog-at-sxsw/\n\nTerri McCullough, CEO of No Ceilings, also participated in SXSW on a panel about the barriers that #WomenInTech<https://twitter.com/hashtag/WomenInTech?src=hash> face.\nRead about the panel here: http://www.galvanize.com/tech-inclusion-austin/#.VusNN-IrKM9, and share on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/ClintonFdn/status/709117814519410688\n\n\nAlliance for a Healthier Generation encourages healthy snacking with fresh produce\nAlliance for a Healthier Generation\'s Nutrition Advisor authored a post on the USDA\'s blog<http://blogs.usda.gov/2016/03/10/fresh-produce-the-original-smart-snack/> this week about how fresh produce leads to smart snacking.

Media matters explains:\n\n"Breitbart News report misread results from a database to inaccurately claim that Clinton-affiliated organizations requested up to 87 H-1B visas from 2011-2014 in an attempt to criticize Clinton.... Many other international organizations -- including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the American Red Cross, Human Rights Watch...and the Heritage Foundation -- have also used the H-1B visa program...a search of "Clinton" on the website finds that the 87 number is completely false. Breitbart included organizations that are not affiliated with the Clintons, such as Clinton City Schools and the Mercy Medical Center - Clinton."\n\n\nIn Case You Missed It:\n\n*         Coverage of the work of the Clinton Foundation and how No Ceilings data informed the International Women\'s Day conversation included articles from a variety of national and international news outlets, including Forbes<http://fortune.com/2016/03/08/un-international-womens-day/>, Bustle<http://www.bustle.com/articles/146490-a-look-at-how-gender-equality-progressed-in-2015-and-the-roadblocks-that-still-lie-ahead>, LinkedIn Pulse<https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/college-students-can-bring-us-closer-gender-equality-ren%C3%A9e-joslyn>, and the Financial Times<http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2016/03/08/poverty-is-sexist-where-life-is-toughest-for-girls/?Authorised=false&_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.ft.com%2Fbeyond-brics%2F2016%2F03%2F08%2Fpoverty-is-sexist-where-life-is-toughest-for-girls%2F&_i_referer=&classification=conditional_registered&iab=barrier-app>, among others.\n\n*         The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, a CGI Member, included President Clinton in a list of the "20 Men Who Care About Clean Cooking"<http://cleancookstoves.org/about/news/03-07-2016-20-men-who-care-about-clean-cooking.html> in celebration of International Women\'s Day.\n\n*         The Huffington Post featured a Q&A with Colin O\'Brady<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aint-no-mountain-high-enough-a-conversation-with_us_56dde9fae4b0a94557aab697?ir=Sports&section=us_sports&utm_hp_ref=sports>, who is attempting to break the Explorer\'s Grand Slam world record.
