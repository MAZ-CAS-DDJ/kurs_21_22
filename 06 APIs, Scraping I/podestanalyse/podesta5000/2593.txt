That will give us more ability to go deeper on the analysis\nlater.\n2. I think with the uncertainty around the Dem nominee we should drop\nthe balance in the batteries--cut the Obama and HRC batteries. The\neffect of this will be to exaggerate McCain movement but it will also\nexpose who the hardcore McCain supporters are--people sticking with\nhim under the best of circumstances. So, the survey design would be\nsomething like this: opening Qs, McCain ballot and attributes, message\nand doubts batteries, closing ballot and attributes, demographic\nquestions.\n\nThis will save us time, money and it will exaggerate results--which is\nwhat we need since we didn't since big movements last time. We can\nalso probably cut down to 800 sample across 20-22 mins.\n\nUnless there are strong objections from anybody I'd like to move\nforward with this.\n\nOn Feb 7, 2008 9:48 PM, Andrew Baumann <ABaumann@gqrr.com> wrote:\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> All,\n>\n>\n>\n> Attached please find the draft questionnaire for the battleground survey.\n> There are some notes in imbedded in red.
