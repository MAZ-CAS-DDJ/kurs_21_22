HRC can talk about on stage\ntonight:\n\n*FOR IMMEDIATE\nRELEASE\nContact:*\n\n*March 6,\n2016\nKristin Moore*\n\n*\n(810) 237-2039*\n\n*\n\n kmoore@cityofflint.com <kmoore@cityofflint.com>         *\n\n\n\n*Flint Mayor Announces that Union Fund Commits to Bring  $25 Million Loan\nPackage to Remove Lead Pipes*\n\n\n\n*Infrastructure fund created as a commitment at the Clinton Global\nInitiative will use low-cost loans to renew Flint infrastructure and move\ntoward safe water*\n\n\n\n*FLINT, Mich.* \xe2\x80\x95 Flint Mayor Karen Weaver was pleased to announce on March\n6 that a union owned asset manager, Union Labor Life Insurance Company\n(ULLICO), has made a commitment to bring $25 million in low-cost loans to\nhelp remove lead pipes and move toward clean water for its citizens.  This\nfunding puts into action a commitment made by labor and union pensions at\nthe Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) to create a national fund to invest in\ninfrastructure in cities across America.  In a project put together by the\nAmerican Federation of Teachers (AFT) and ULLICO, this investment in Flint\nwill help Mayor Weaver move forward on her \xe2\x80\x9cFast Start\xe2\x80\x9d initiative to\nremove all lead-tainted pipes from Flint homes, in the wake of the city\xe2\x80\x99s\nwater crisis.  As a bridge source of capital until badly-needed State of\nMichigan and federal funding can be secured to upgrade Flint\xe2\x80\x99s water\ninfrastructure, this union investment will help Flint move into action now\non this critical public health challenge.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe people of Flint have been waiting for action to remove lead tainted\nlines,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mayor Karen Weaver.  \xe2\x80\x9cOn March 4, I was pleased that we pulled\nand replaced the first lead line.  This investment from union pension funds\nmeans that we can move forward to remove more lead lines and renew Flint\xe2\x80\x99s\ninfrastructure.  I am very grateful to ULLICO and AFT for putting this idea\ncrafted at the Clinton Global Initiative into action in our community.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen the City of Flint\xe2\x80\x99s water system was contaminated with lead after the\nState of Michigan switched water sources, Mayor Karen Weaver called for the\nremoval of all lead-tainted lines as fast as possible.\n\nAFT, which is leading a consortium of unions and pension funds involved\nwith CGI infrastructure efforts, has worked closely with the City of Flint\nand ULLICO to accelerate the Fast Start pipe replacement.  ULLICO is the\nonly labor-owned insurance and investment company, and has raised an\ninfrastructure fund with $332 million in commitments and $188 million in\ncalled capital.  This project arises out of a CGI commitment of the labor\nmovement-led by AFT, and involving many unions including the building\ntrades, AFSCME, SEIU and the AFL-CIO, and which has resulted in $14 billion\nof investment into US infrastructure by pension funds.  ULLICO is now\nworking on a financial package to provide the city with gap financing to\nscale up its $55 million Fast Start Plan to replace all of its lead-tainted\npipes.\n\nIn addition, the North America\xe2\x80\x99s Building Trades Unions are also working\nclosely with the City of Flint and local firms to help provide the\nnecessary workforce capacity, and to help train young adults in new skills\nand job opportunities, to expand the number of trained teams replacing the\ncity\xe2\x80\x99s contaminated pipes.\n\n\n\n*###*\n\n\n\nOn Sun, Mar 6, 2016 at 5:17 PM, Ann O\'Leary <aoleary@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Confirmed - Mayor Weaver and ULLICO will put out joint statement in next\n> hour announcing infrastructure loan and reference that the fund was started\n> a a CGI commitment.

Mayor Weaver\xe2\x80\x99s Fast Start Plan would replace\n> the city\'s 15,000 lead pipes in one year.
