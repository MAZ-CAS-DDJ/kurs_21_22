With several short-term options to reduce gas prices, including\nopening the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and reigning in speculators, it\nmakes no sense for Bush and McCain to embrace an option that won\xb9t work and\nwill threaten the physical and economic well-being of millions of Americans.\n\nUltimately, the solution to gas prices must be to give consumers real energy\nchoices by investing in efficiency and renewable energy sources, but Bush\nand McCain can\xb9t see the future through the oil covered windshield of the\nStraight Talk Express.\xb2\n\n###\n\n\n\n\n------ End of Forwarded Message\n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
