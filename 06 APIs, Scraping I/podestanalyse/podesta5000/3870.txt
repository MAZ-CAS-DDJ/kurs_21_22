The current President Bush\'s response in recent weeks to the\ncrippling gas prices hovering above $4 a gallon has been a \nposition-reversing\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/washington/18drill.html?_r=2&hp=&adxn\nnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1215792307-N9lLF39qiyHcQekfwnRSfg>  and\nwhole-hearted endorsement of Senator John McCain\'s proposal to lift the\nfederal ban on domestic offshore oil drilling, which the American\nPetroleum Institute has conceded\n<http://www.mcclatchydc.com/100/story/41379.html>  would not yield any\nadditional oil for seven to 10 years.  \n\n \n\n            "Oil and gas price records are being set and reset which\neach passing day.  Americans are making incredible sacrifices --\nchoosing between bills, gas, and food -- right now.  John McCain and\nGeorge Bush\'s best answer is offshore drilling that wouldn\'t yield a\ndrop of new oil for 10 years.  That\'s not a solution $4 a gallon gas\nprices - that\'s a distraction advocated by the same big oil companies\nmaking record profits that have given Senator McCain over half a million\ndollars\n<http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&cid=\nN00006424>  in contributions over the years," said Jeremy Funk, of\nAmericans United for Change.  \n\n \n\n"We join the House Democratic Leadership\'s calls for the President to\n\'Free Our Oil\' and tap into just a small amount of the 700 million\nbarrels of oil we have sitting around right now in the Strategic\nPetroleum Reserve, which would have an immediate and welcome impact on\ngas prices -- just as it did when President Bush\'s father did it in\n1991. It\'s a simple question: do we want real relief from crippling gas\nprices 10 years from now -- or 10 days from now?," added Funk.  \n\n \n\n-30-\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nJeremy J.
