john.podesta@gmail.comb'\nDear Colleagues,\n\nAs we approach the Thanksgiving holiday, I would like to thank you for all of your hard work and dedication to the Law Center throughout the year.\n\nAs a small token of appreciation, the Law Center will be closing at 1:00 pm on Wednesday, November 26th in anticipation of the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday.  So that all essential departments are appropriately staffed, please consult with your supervisors, who have been given discretion to approve leave to ensure that all departments are properly staffed in the case of an emergency.\n\nI hope you and your family have a truly wonderful holiday, and please be safe if you are traveling during the Thanksgiving break.\n\nWith all best wishes,\n\nBill\n'
