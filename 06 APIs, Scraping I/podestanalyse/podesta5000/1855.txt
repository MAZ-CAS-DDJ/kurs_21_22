john.podesta@gmail.comb"I've made a draft shell of a schedule for paper topic meetings, similar to last year's, but I need your guidance on a few things (or please, by all means just take it from here).\n\nBefore my questions, here are the folks who have sent their topic via email:\n\nTopic Received via email:\nKendra Clayton\nRyan Stephenson\nDave Wilkins\nKatie Wrede\n\nTopic Not Received via email:\nPhilip Beshara\nPeter Carey\nTimothy Drake\nGrant Dubler\nBrian Gilmore\nIrene Jefferson\nDerek Khanna\nPeter Klym\nAnsley Lacitis\nKieran McCarthy\nKelsey Mellette\nAdaku Onyeka\nSarah Shelton\nBrian Sullivan\nDavid Wilkins\nBryan Wood\nMatthew Worthington\nAaron Young\n\nUnlike last year, it sounds like we're doing paper topic meetings this coming Monday. Is that still accurate?  My follow up qs:\n-Are you planning on using the entirety of the class for this? If so, no need to start at 5:30 pm.\n-Have you identified which two students are able to come early if you do want to start earlier than 5:45?\n-Do you need my help disseminating the info to the students regarding signing up for times?\n\nThoughts?\n\nEryn M.
