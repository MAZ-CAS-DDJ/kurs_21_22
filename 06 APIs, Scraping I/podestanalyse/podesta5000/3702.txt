john.podesta@gmail.comb"John - \n\nLess than 96 hours after the attack in Paris, David Vitter is running ads accusing his opponent, U.S. Army veteran John Bel Edwards, and Barack Obama, of inviting ISIS into Louisiana.\n\nDown in the polls, David Vitter has shamefully decided to put his campaign before his country, and in doing-so helps our enemies by sending the message that the United States is united against Islam. \n\nIt's disgraceful behavior -- reminiscent of when Republicans attacked Vietnam Veteran and triple amputee Max Cleland for being soft of terror after 9/11. If you are disgusted with the Islamophobic rhetoric coming from Republican governors and presidential candidates, there's something you can do about it right now:\n\nContribute $21.83 (the average contribution from VoteVets supporters) to John Bel Edwards campaign against David Vitter in Louisiana. Early voting has already started, so there's better time to make a difference than right now.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/vv-edwards\n\nThe election is in two weeks, and together we can make sure David Vitter loses because of his position on this issue. \n\nAll my best,\n\nJon Soltz\nIraq War Veteran and Chairman\nVoteVets.org \n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/unsubscribe\nPaid for by VoteVets Action Fund\n\n"
