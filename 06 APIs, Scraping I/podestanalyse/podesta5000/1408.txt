john.podesta@gmail.comb'John, you may remember in China  we chatted about the possibility of setting up a meeting between you and James Cameron.\n\nHe is in town November November 18 and wants to talk to you (and Neera and a small high-powered group of CAP folks) about the work he and Maria Wilhelm are doing through his Avatar Alliance Foundation (AAF) and opportunities for partnering with CAP. He is  particularly focused on the food-climate link (especially the health and climate benefits of replacing meat-based diet with plant-based).\n\n\nWe will also be able to make the direct case to him for the China hub for ThinkProgress/ClimateProgress that I  mentioned to you in Beijing (a one stop curated site for  the best stories and analysis of what  China is doing in climate and energy). Judd and I have been working with Maria (and Energy Foundation) to fund. EF is in for $250k A year for two years if we can get Cameron to match that.\n\nMaria just called last night to tell me this is happening. I did tell her  there was no way of knowing if you are  even in town let alone available in the timeframe of, say, 12:30 to 3 (exact time TBD).\n\nShe said that was not a dealbreaker if Neera (and a small CAP group) could host Jim for a private lunch. Neera is available from 12:30 to 1:45, so I will work with her to set that up. (Neera gave me your email address.)\n\n\nAAF has already given CAP $200,000 and will likely become one of the largest foundations in the world over the next few years (from its share of the profits of Avatar 2, 3, and 4),  so it would be valuable if  we could form a long term partnership.\n\n\nIn particular, while Maria is very gung-ho about the China hub --  and actually helped us get the EF money -- it is Jim who makes all the final decisions. He needs reassuring that CAP is very sensitive to the special challenges and nuances of dealing with and writing about China. Obviously, no one can speak to those better than you. Also, I explained to Maria that the whole food-climate link is an interest of yours, so Jim  also wants to engage you on that.\n\nObviously, this  entirely depends on your availability. Jim is in town to give the keynote opening Wednesday morning at the huge US Green building Council annual meeting, where he will be interviewed by Mika Brezinski. I will be with Jim all morning as he goes to do some media around climate change.\n\nApologies for the sudden nature of this but this literally came together over a period of hours.\n\n\nJoe\n\n\nJoseph Romm\nFounding Editor, ClimateProgress.org\nSenior Fellow, Center for American Progress\nChief Science Advisor, Emmy-winning TV series, "Years of Living Dangerously"\nAuthor, "Climate Change: What Everyone Needs To Know\n'
