Democrats actually think when\nthey talk about abortion \xe2\x80\x94 they\'re right \xe2\x80\x94 they lose. Because Hillary\nClinton\'s positions on abortion are so radical and extreme that 9 percent\nof Americans agree with her. That is the exact statistic. Hillary Clinton\nembraces abortion on demand in all circumstances, up until the moment of\nbirth, partial-birth abortion with taxpayer funding, with no notification\nfor parents in any circumstances. Ninety-one percent of Americans say,\n\'That\'s nuts.\' So what do they do? They try to shift it. The war on women\nwasn\'t that. It was contraceptives. Now listen, I have been a conservative\nmy entire life. I have never met anybody \xe2\x80\x94 any conservative \xe2\x80\x94 who wants to\nban contraceptives. As I noted, Heidi and I, we have two little girls. I\'m\nvery glad we don\'t have 17. And it\'s a great example of what happened with\nRepublicans. When the war on women came up, Republicans would curl up in a\nball. They\'d say, \'Don\'t hurt me!\' Jiminy Cricket! This is a made-up,\nnonsense example. The last I checked, we don\'t have a rubber shortage in\nAmerica. Look, when I was in college, we had a machine in the bathroom.\nYou\'d put 50 cents in and voila! So yes, anyone who wants contraceptives\ncan access them, but it is an utterly made-up nonsense issue. I want you to\nthink for a second \xe2\x80\x94 imagine you\'re a Democratic politician. I\'m sorry.\nThat\'s a terrible thing to do. But imagine for a second, you\'re Hillary\nClinton. [laughs] This does kind of look like Leavenworth. [laughs] You\'re\nHillary Clinton, and you\'re trying to think, \'How do I run?\' Well, you\ncan\'t run on the economy because we have the lowest percentage of Americans\nworking in any year since 1977. You can\'t run on Obamacare because millions\nof people have lost their jobs and lost their health care, lost their\ndoctors, seen their premiums skyrocket. You certainly can\'t run on foreign\npolicy because every country you touched as secretary of state is a\ndisaster. So what do you do? You go, \'Aha! The condom police. I\'m going to\nmake up a completely made-up threat and try to scare a bunch of folks that\nare not paying a lot of attention into thinking someone\'s going to steal\ntheir birth control.\' What nonsense. How do we win? We speak the truth and\nwe do it with a smile, and it drives the Democrats crazy.\n\n-- \n*Patrick Svitek*\nReporter, The Texas Tribune <http:/www.texastribune.org>\nDesk: 512-716-8623\nCell: 260-615-7351\n@PatrickSvitek <http://www.twitter.com/PatrickSvitek>\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups\n"HRCRR" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an\nemail to hrcrr+unsubscribe@hillaryclinton.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrr@hillaryclinton.com.\n'
