Our friend Alvin Brown is\ndoing a fantastic job as Mayor of Jacksonville, leading as a New Democrat\nreformer in a city prone to elect Republicans. I hope you can come out\nnext Thursday and support his reelection. We need to make sure Alvin can\nkeep working to build the kind of economy we all want to see.\n\nBest,\nJP\n\nPlain Text Invitation (PDF Attached):\n\nPlease join\nJohn Podesta & Tony Podesta\nFor A Lunch Reception Honoring\nMayor Alvin Brown\nMayor of Jacksonville, FL\nThursday, September 19th, 2013\n12:00-pm-1:00pm\nPodesta Group\n1001 G Street NW, Suite 1000 West\nWashington, DC 20001\nMaximum Contribution\n$500 per individual and per business\nTo RSVP or for additional information please contact\nGreg Goddard at Greg@MayorAlvinBrown.com, or by phone at 904.370.3434\n(Political advertisement paid for and approved by Alvin Brown, Democrat,\nfor Mayor.)\n'
