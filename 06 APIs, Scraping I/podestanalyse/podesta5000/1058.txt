The only way to ensure Sean wins is by raising $15,000 today to keep our own ads up -- and it won't happen without you.\n\nPlease, chip in $250 for ads before tonight's 4 p.m. debate, or we'll have no path to victory.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20141010am-ld&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\nThis race is tightening by the day, and if Democrats don't step up, the Tea Party will step in.\n\nThanks,\n\nMaura\n\nP.S. The New York voter registration deadline is today, too, and our field team is out in force making sure every Democrat is registered. Chip in to help!\n\n\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20141010am-ld&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\n\n\n--\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com. \n\nTo unsubscribe from the Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress email list, please click here:\n\nhttp://action.seanmaloney.com/page/unsubscribe/?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\n\n\nPaid for by Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n\n\n\n"
