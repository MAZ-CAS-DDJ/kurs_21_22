(The same offer has been made to the McCain camp).  \r\nAfter socializing this with Jim and Denis, our recommendation is that Obama take the briefing at his residence the day after the election.  Worth noting, an alternate briefing site - the FBI field office - could be utilized as well and/or eventually the transition offices in Chicago.      \r\n\r\nConcerning length of time, one hour would be ideal (they will walk him thru more details and mechanics for the first briefing), but a lesser amount of time works as well.  Some combination of Podesta, Steinberg, and Lippert (possibly all) would staff Obama for the brief.  McDonough is cleared for the brief any time he is in Chicago.  Pete, we could get you cleared if you had any interest as well.  \r\n\r\nIn sum, should Obama win, we would recommend that we put this on the schedule for 5 November and reserve time for it everyday going forward, esp in light of the recent comments by Chairman Mullen about possible attacks/threats during transition.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMark\r\n \r\n"
