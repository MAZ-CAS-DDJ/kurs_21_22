john.podesta@gmail.comb'My roommate and I are looking for a 2-bedroom apartment available for a year lease beginning at the end of August or September 1. We\x92d like to live in or around the neighborhoods of Bloomingdale, Shaw, Le Droit Park, Columbia Heights, or Petworth. The apartment should be close to the metro, not a basement apartment, allow one dog, and rent for $2500 or less. Please let me know if you have any leads.\n\nBest,\n\nKrystal Quinlan\nE.
