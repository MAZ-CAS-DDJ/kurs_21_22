There's a additional $15,150 in commits that have not yet come in so we only need to identify an additional $18,700.\n\nI plan to send an email tomorrow to everyone who's RSVPed letting them know that we're full steam ahead and that we'll send an email on Saturday morning to let them know if we plan to postpone.  Does that work for you all?\n\nThanks!\nDavid\n\nDavid H.
