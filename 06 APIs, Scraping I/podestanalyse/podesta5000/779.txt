Let\'s set aside some time for next steps on these and what you need in terms of prep.\n\nI\'ll note that you\'ll receive a memo on the DINA early next week. I want John Schmitt - the new Research Director - to have a chance to weigh in this week.\n\nBest,\nHeather\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nHeather Boushey\nExecutive Director and Chief Economist\nWashington Center for Equitable Growth\n1333 H Street, NW, 2nd Floor\nWashington, DC 20005\n\nhboushey@equitablegrowth.org<mailto:hboushey@equitablegrowth.org>\nwww.Equitablegrowth.org\nDesk: (202) 545-3341\nTwitter: @hboushey\n'
