He wants you to\nmeet with him, and apparently Spielberg, in January.\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Thomas DELONGE <t.delonge@me.com>\nDate: Fri, Nov 13, 2015 at 8:30 PM\nSubject: Important\nTo: mfisher@hillaryclinton.com, Eryn Sepp <eryn.sepp@gmail.com>\n\n\nI created this teaser as a way to open conversations and excite Spielberg's\npeople. It worked. I just left my meeting at DreamWorks, and they are very,\nvery interested.\n\nOn another note, I have somebody important that is willing to fly out and\nmeet with Mr. Podesta. A member of my Committee.  I am awaiting a time in\nJanuary that might work for Mr. Podesta. My goal is for Spielberg to be\nthere, too. And if not him, somebody of his stature. Please show Mr.\nPodesta this private teaser. Let him know that I am spending all afternoon\ninterviewing a scientist that worked on a spacecraft at Area 51 tomorrow.\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/145495599\nPW: SM\n\nBest,\nTom DeLonge\n\n*TOM DELONGE | FOUNDER*\nTOM@TOTHESTARSINC.COM | (760) 518-7801 | *TO THE STARS MEDIA\n<http://www.tothestarsinc.com/>*\nSAN DIEGO | 1053 S Coast Hwy 101 Encinitas, CA 92024\n\n\n\n\n-- \nMilia Fisher\nSpecial Assistant to the Chair\nHillary for America\nmfisher@hillaryclinton.com\nc: 858.395.1741\n"
