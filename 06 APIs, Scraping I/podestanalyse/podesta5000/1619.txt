john.podesta@gmail.comb"Friends,\n\nForty-three years ago today, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its ruling in Roe. v Wade - a landmark national decision protecting a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to make a very personal medical decision.\xc2\xa0\n\nTime and time again, Congress demands to be part of the conversation. From voting to defund Planned Parenthood to undermining Roe v. Wade, today and every day we are reminded that our work continues in the fight to protect reproductive freedom.\n\nI am a mom of four and a decades-long supporter of reproductive rights. Stand with me to let Congress know that they do not speak for us in this deeply personal matter. >>> https://act.myngp.com/Forms/237413748120619008\n\nWe have heard tragic stories from our mothers and grandmothers about the days when access to women\xe2\x80\x99s reproductive health care, including safe, legal abortions, was not always available. This is a medical issue, not a political one.\xc2\xa0\n\nFour decades later, we honor and thank those who fought for the health and rights of women. Their efforts inspire us and give us the courage to stand up to the violence, harassment, intimidation by special interests, and ensure that Roe v. Wade remains the law of the land.\xc2\xa0\n\nI will always support a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to choose. Stand with me.  >>> https://act.myngp.com/Forms/237413748120619008\n\nSincerely,\n\nNancy\n\n\nwww.NancyRoteringForCongress.com\n\n\nMailing Address\nPO Box 18\nHighland Park, IL 60035\n\nOffice Address\n1910 First St. Suite 1S\nHighland Park, IL 60035\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n|    Paid for by Nancy Rotering for Congress, Inc.    |\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you believe you received this message in error or wish to no longer receive email from us, please https://act.myngp.com/el/-6035239576547227648/189851074126284800.\n\n\nNancy Rotering is the two-term Mayor of Highland Park, Illinois and is running to represent Illinois\xe2\x80\x99 10th Congressional District.
