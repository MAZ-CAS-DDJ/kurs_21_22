McCabe<http://www.humanevents.com/search.php?author_name=Neil%20W.+McCabe>\n*\n\n12/05/2011\n\nA former MF Global employee accused former president William J. Clinton of\ncollecting $50,000 per month through his Teneo advisory firm in the months\nbefore the brokerage careened towards its Halloween filing for Chapter 11\nbankruptcy.\nTeneo was hired by MF Global\x92s former CEO Jon S. Corzine to improve his\nimage and to enhance his connections with Clinton\x92s political family, said\nthe employee, who asked that his name be withheld because he feared\nretribution.\n\n\x93They were supposed to be helping Corzine improve his image as a CEO\x97I\nguess you can tell how that went,\x94 he said. Corzine resigned as CEO and\nchairman November 4.\n\nBefore Corzine joined MF Global in May 2010, the firm was a smart and\nwell-run commodities broker, a culture that was turned upside-down by his\nleadership style, he said.\n\n\x93The traders would be shaking their heads,\x94 he said. \x93They would come back\nto their desk and say, \x91Well, I thought we were going to do this\x97but\nCorzine would come by and do something else all by himself,\x92\x94 he said.\n\nThe Teneo contract with MF Global lasted at least five months, he said.\n\x93The board cancelled it after Corzine resigned.\x94\n\nThe source, who is no longer associated with MF Global, said Teneo is a\ndual-track company with one side devoted to merchant and investment banking\nand the other side set up to provide image and strategy consulting services.\n\n\nClinton is the chairman of the company\x92s advisory board. His duties and\ncompensation have not been released. The other member of the board is\nformer British prime minister Tony\nBlair<http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=47938>\n.\n\nTwo of the three founding partners are very close to the former president\nand his wife, Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton. They are Douglas J.\nBand, who is the former president\x92s counselor and has served on his\npersonal staff since 1995 and Declan Kelly, who earned the \x93Hillraiser\x94\nstatus in the secretary\x92s 2008 run for president for bundling more than\n$100,000 for the campaign.\n\nAnother prominent member of the Clinton political family is Tom\nShea<http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=47938>.\nShea is a senior vice president for Teneo Strategy and served as Corzine\x92s\nchief of staff, when Corzine was the governor of New Jersey.\n\nKelly sold his public relations firm Financial Dynamics in 2006 to FTI for\n$340 million, and stayed with that company until July 2009, when he joined\nthe State Department as the Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe source said, \x93Kelly was given a job they created out our whole cloth.\x94\nThe job did not exist previously.\n\n\x93He basically got to ride around developing a book of business, while he\nwaited for his non-compete clause to run out,\x94 he said.\n\nKelley and the former president traveled together networking and making\nintroductions at international conferences and events, he said.\n\nThe Secretary of State also traveled with Kelly, including the October 2010\nU.S. \x96 Northern Ireland Economics Conference, which Kelly organized and at\nwhich the secretary was the featured speaker.\n\nThe secretary announced that she accepted Kelly\x92s resignation May 11.\n\nTeneo landed its first major client June 1, when the Rockefeller Foundation\ngave Teneo a $3,447,150, six-month contract to help plan the foundation\x92s\n2013 centennial.\n\nThe foundation is another member of the Clinton\x92s extended family. It gave\nClinton its Lifetime Innovation Achievement Award July 27 and the\nfoundation is listed as a between $1 to $5 million contributor to the\nWilliam J. Clinton Foundation, along with several members of the\nRockefeller family who are listed as individual contributors.\n\n*[In the preparation of this story, several emails and phone calls were\nplaced to Teneo, MF Global and the State Department for comment. In each\ncase, there was no response.]*\n"
