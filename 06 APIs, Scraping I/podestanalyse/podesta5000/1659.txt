It's been nearly six years since the earthquake devastated these individuals' lives, but they have tremendous determination to ensure their country's future is prosperous.\n\nRight now, you can take a simple, powerful action that will change more lives around the world:\xa0Make a tax-deductible donation to help us empower more communities in 2016.\n\nhttps://action.clintonfoundation.org/pub/cc?_ri_=X0Gzc2X%3DYQpglLjHJlYQGNGlWKzgcY6ftFlfazeieTqDTkhYWX0TaHNKDLzdzaThn2EAHjUzdCDqgFUa5VXtpKX%3DSTSDAY&_ei_=EolaGGF4SNMvxFF7KucKuWPIJsAiJ56b3L30hWQEKd06uMTvxKVC.Jg%3D%3D\n\nOur family is matching every gift to the Foundation that comes in before\xa0midnight\xa0December 31, up to $200,000, and thousands of supporters have already contributed to share their commitment to this life-changing work.\n\nWe're counting on you to join them and make a difference:\xa0Click here to make your tax-deductible gift to the Clinton Foundation, and we'll double it, dollar for dollar, to maximize your impact.\n\nhttps://action.clintonfoundation.org/pub/cc?_ri_=X0Gzc2X%3DYQpglLjHJlYQGNGlWKzgcY6ftFlfazeieTqDTkhYWX0TaHNKDLzdzaThn2EAHjUzdCDqgFUa5VXtpKX%3DSTSDAY&_ei_=EolaGGF4SNMvxFF7KucKuWPIJsAiJ56b3L30hWQEKd06uMTvxKVC.Jg%3D%3D\n\nSo much work remains. Why doesn't every kid around the world have the chance to live a healthy life? How do we give girls the same opportunities as their brothers to follow their dreams?\n\nThis year I have had incredible conversations with people everywhere I go about these challenges. And whether I am talking to smallholder farmers in Africa or community members in Little Rock, it is clear that solutions to these questions are within our grasp -- and achievable if we keep working together toward our common vision of a healthier, more prosperous and equitable world.\n\nThat's why our family is matching every gift that comes in to the Foundation before the end of the year, up to $200,000. It will take us all working together to make lasting change.\n\nDonate to the Clinton Foundation today -- before\xa0midnight\xa0December 31\xa0-- and it will be matched, dollar for dollar, to make twice the impact in 2016.\n\nhttps://action.clintonfoundation.org/pub/cc?_ri_=X0Gzc2X%3DYQpglLjHJlYQGNGlWKzgcY6ftFlfazeieTqDTkhYWX0TaHNKDLzdzaThn2EAHjUzdCDqgFUa5VXtpKX%3DSTSDAY&_ei_=EolaGGF4SNMvxFF7KucKuWPIJsAiJ56b3L30hWQEKd06uMTvxKVC.Jg%3D%3D\n\nWishing you and yours a very happy, healthy new year.\n\nChelsea\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate -- \nhttps://action.clintonfoundation.org/pub/cc?_ri_=X0Gzc2X%3DYQpglLjHJlYQGNGlWKzgcY6ftFlfazeieTqDTkhYWX0TaHNKDLzdzaThn2EAHjUzdCDqgFUa5VXtpKX%3DSTSDAY&_ei_=EolaGGF4SNMvxFF7KucKuWPIJsAiJ56b3L30hWQEKd06uMTvxKVC.Jg%3D%3D\n\n\n--\n\nThe Clinton Foundation convenes businesses, governments, NGOs, and individuals to improve global health and wellness, increase opportunity for girls and women, reduce childhood obesity, create economic opportunity and growth, and help communities address the effects of climate change.\n\nPlease add news@action.clintonfoundation.org to your address book or safe sender list.\n\nView this email as a webpage: \nhttps://action.clintonfoundation.org/pub/cc?_ri_=X0Gzc2X%3DYQpglLjHJlYQGNGlWKzgcY6ftFlfazeieTqDTkhYWX0TaHNKDLzdzaThn2EAHjUzdCDqgFUa5VXtpKX%3DSTSBAY&_ei_=EolaGGF4SNMvxFF7KucKuWNX3t-6XCrKDJ7nxlgxf3eyBFnRR6zY4fcIHkW6iLEfamNssrNGhw.Jg%3D%3D\n\nUnsubscribe: https://action.clintonfoundation.org/pub/optout?_ri_=X0Gzc2X%3DYQpglLjHJlYQGNGlWKzgcY6ftFlfazeieTqDTkhYWX0TaHNKDLzdzaThn2EAHjUzdCDqgFUa5&_ei_=EolaGGF4SNMvxFF7KucKuWPIJsAiJ56b3L30hWQEKd06uMTvxKVC\n\nClinton Foundation | 1200 President Clinton Avenue | Little Rock, AR 72201\n"
