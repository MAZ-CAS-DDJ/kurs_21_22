Here is\nthe current QA:\n\n\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve made a couple edits in caps.  They work \xe2\x80\x93 or more?\n\n\n\n*Would you vote to reauthorize Section 215 of the Patriot Act (it sunsets\nin the summer of 2015)?*\n\n\n\n\xc2\xb7        When this was up for debate while I served in the Senate, I\nexpressed concerns about Section 215, noting that it \xe2\x80\x9cgives law enforcement\nin domestic intelligence investigations nearly limitless power to obtain\nall types of personal records.\xe2\x80\x9d I recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cgiven its broad scope,\nthis provision has tremendous potential for abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xc2\xb7        We have also learned that we need to MAKE CHANGES TO OUR APPROACH\nBASED ON THE privacy implications OF metadata surveillance.  PRESIDENT\nOBAMA HAS MADE IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS AND CONGRESS SHOULD ACT ON\nTHEM.\n\n\n\n\xc2\xb7        OF COURSE WE need to retain some capability to track terrorist\ncommunications into the US \xe2\x80\x93 with court orders and congressional oversight\nand stringent civil liberties protections.   BUT WE CAN DO THIS IN A WAY\nTHAT improveS accountability and protectS privacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*From:* John Podesta [mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com]\n*Sent:* Thursday, April 30, 2015 1:29 PM\n*To:* Jake Sullivan\n*Subject:* Silicon valley\n\n\n\nWe have to get the talking points on surveillance in a better place. You\nhave her positioned to the right of Obama on stuff like section 215. Let's\ntry to discuss.\n"
