john.podesta@gmail.comb"*DRIVE TO HNP: *\n\nAditi, who runs the Travel team, is still working out the details on ground\ntransit for the morning, but it sounds like a Manhattan departure around 10\nAM will be easiest to coordinate.\n\nAditi is working to arrange for the driver to pick you up from your\napartment or another convenient location close to it. She has your address.\n\nJust so you have the broader timing-- you're wheels up from HPN at 12:30\nPM, so their goal is to get everyone there by 12:00 PM.\n\nWill circle back shortly when I have the details on specific pickup\nlocation and driver name.\n\n(Sara- John & I discussed this earlier and he's good with this plan.)\n\n*PAPER:*\n\nI will work on pulling together Adrienne's top TPs on polling, emails,\ndebate, etc. to send to you.\n\nI think it is likely that I will be able to give hard copies (in a folder)\nto someone going to HPN tomorrow. IF NOT, do you want me to print and bring\nto you in the AM at your apartment?\n\n-- \nMilia Fisher\nSpecial Assistant to the Chair\nHillary for America\nmfisher@hillaryclinton.com\nc: 858.395.1741\n"
