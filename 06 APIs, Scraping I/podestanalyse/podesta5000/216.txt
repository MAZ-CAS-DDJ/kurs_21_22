john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi everyone -\n\nWe wanted to make sure you saw an article<https://www.devex.com/news/under-election-year-spotlight-clinton-foundation-prepares-for-a-new-era-86959> published today on Devex - a media platform for the global development community - about the work of the Clinton Foundation. The piece provides an overview of the work Clinton Foundation initiatives are doing on the ground all over the world and details our priorities for the coming years.\n\nShare the piece on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/ClintonFdn/status/648183654225735680.\n\nShare the piece on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/ClintonFoundation/posts/855970657857710.\n\n"Since Hillary Clinton left to pursue the presidency, the foundation has been thrust into the spotlight not for the impact of its programs, but for questions surrounding foreign donations, conflicts of interest, and internal politics. What has received less attention are the foundation\'s programs, and the professionals who lead them insist they are hard at work and won\'t be slowed down by an election in which the foundation itself has become an issue...The Clinton Foundation, a public charity, is a direct service provider, rather than a foundation in the traditional sense. The foundation has said 12 percent of its $223 million in expenditures from 2013 went to overhead costs for management and fundraising, with the rest of that money funding its programmatic work around the world. As an operating foundation, the vast majority of the funds it raises are spent on programs rather than grants. The exception to the rule is its work in Haiti, where the foundation uses targeted grants to build capacity in a country of special importance to the Clinton family."\n\nWalker Morris, CEO of the Clinton Development Initiative, talked about what people would find if they looked at the work of the Foundation:\n\n"Walker Morris, who manages foundation projects in Malawi, Rwanda, and Tanzania, told Devex that if people would only \'ignore the names for an hour and look purely at the work being done,\' they would come away understanding the effectiveness of the work the Clinton Foundation does to help people \'truly live that \'best life story\' that we talk about.\' He described that work as creating opportunity, removing obstacles where they exist, and leaving decisions up to people in their own communities. One example is the Anchor Farm Project, a commercial farm operated by the Clinton Development Initiative that provides smallholder farmers with improved seeds, training in advanced techniques, and direct access to buyers."\n\nDonna Shalala spoke about the background of many of those who lead the Clinton Foundations\' initiatives:\n\n"Shalala insists she tells her friends working on the campaign that she will see them after the election, and she expects the same focus on mission from other foundation staff. \'The people that run the programs are professionals in these areas," she said. "They\'ve been doing either domestic or global development work their whole careers and so keeping them focused is not as difficult as it appears on the outside.\'"\n\nMark Gunton talked about how Foundation staff stays focused on the impact of our work:\n\n"Gunton said he remains so focused on pioneering \'impact entrepreneurship\' that he is not phased even as donations from the billionaire his initiative is named after come under particularly heavy scrutiny. \'We keep our heads down and focus on impact,\' he said. \'The rest is just background noise.""\n\nThe reporter also discussed Chelsea Clinton\'s impact and vision for the Foundation:\n\n"[Chelsea\'s] eye for detail extends to the operations of the foundation. \'She has a shrewd eye for very efficient management and probably gave me the best briefing on the foundation that I received,\' Shalala said. Terri McCullough, director of No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, added, \'It is truly awesome, and not in the slang version of the word but in the true meaning of the word, to see how immersed she is in data and how focused she is on translating that data to impact.\'"\n\nThe article also discussed how the Foundation has been built to be more sustainable over the long term:\n\n"Staff are intent on building a foundation that won\'t live and die by the Clinton family\'s political victories and defeats. They\'ve taken conscious steps to set themselves up for long term success. \'Building the endowment was a critical step in that, and we prioritized that, so now we have an endowment and a staff that\'s truly committed to the work and our programs,\' [Senior Vice President of Programs Maura] Pally told Devex."\n'
