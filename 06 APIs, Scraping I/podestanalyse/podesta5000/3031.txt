I am not going\nto let that happen.\n- The differences between Obama and me is stark -- he wants to make\neverything harder for you\n- On education we must do more to empower women for 21st century jobs\n- I will veto every single bill with wasteful spending - you will know their\nnames and I will make them famous\n- I have never received an earmark or pork-barrel spending during my career;\nObama has received several million dollars with\n- I will never ask for a pork-barrel project my friends\n- Nothing is inevitable in America -- we\'ve always been captains of our fate\n- I will fight for your future -- not for politicians and bureaucrats\n- I make you one promise, I will always keep.  In war and in peace.  I\'ve\nbeen an imperfect servant, but I\'ve been a servant first, now and last.\nNothing has never mattered more to me than the honor of serving America.  I\nwill always put America first.  I will keep that promise.\n\n*Question and Answer:\n*1 Q) Will you agree to drill in ANWR to get oil?\nMCCAIN: I believe we should drill off our coasts.  I believe ANWR is a\npristine area.  I believe we should drill off our coasts and Obama is\nagainst that.  We are sending 700 billion dollars of our money overseas to\ncountries that don\'t like us that much.  And sometimes that ends up in the\nhands of terrorists.  We\'ve got to decrease our dependence on foreign oil.\nWe\'ve got to have clean coal, wind, solar and nuclear.  Senator Obama\nopposes nuclear power.  France is using nuclear for 80% of their energy\nneeds!\n\n2 Q) You intend to build 45 new nuclear power plants.  How will you move\nthis country toward accepting the need for new nukes?\nMCCAIN: Americans are smart.  They know what we have to do and they know\nthat nuclear power is safe.  Americans understand and Americans are sick and\ntired of us doing nothing in Congress.  Their approval rating is at 9%.\nAmericans have figured it out -- they\'re demanding we move forward.  Nuclear\nenergy is key to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.  This election is a\nmandate for change -- it\'s either the right kind of change of the wrong kind\nof change and nuclear energy is the right kind of change.\n\n3 Q) Our soveirgnty.  American is truly the last great hope for the world.\nHow do we deal with a group like the U.N who takes away our power?\nMCCAIN: I understand your frustration.  I\'m sure you heard about Iran\ntesting missiles.  And Russia at the U.N. is preventing us from doing what\nwe need to do.  We have to unite with nations like France, etc.  We will\nremain the world\'s super power.   We are seeing the rise of India and China\n-- we have to work with them.  I\'d also like to talk about Afghanistan.  We\nhave to urge our friends and allies to get more involved there because the\nTaliban is getting stronger.  It\'s important for us to lead, but not do it\nalone.\n\n4 Q) My father was a solider in WW11 -- he was injured there.  Given your\nstrong stand on the environment, what is your opinion on the revelation that\nVP Cheney forced scientists to doctor the facts on global warming?\n MCCAIN: Thank you for your father\'s service.  Our veterans health care has\nto be better.  We have to take care of the greatest generation.  As I hope\nyou know, I\'ve had strong disagreements with this administration on climate\nchange.  I\'ve traveled the world -- often at your expense and I\'ve seen the\neffects of climate change.  But suppose I\'m wrong, but we still move to\ndevelop all these alternative energy sources and we hand off to our children\na cleaner planet.  But suppose, I\'m right and we do nothing - then we hand\noff a worse world to our children.  But I also believe there\'s lots of\neconomic opportunity in the development of green technology.  I am not\nfamiliar with the allegation you said.  But as the chair of the commerce\ncommittee, I didn\'t see anything that was inappropriate, but I did think\nthey were not forthcoming enough.  I believe that young Americans are\ncommitted to cleaning up our nation.  And we Republicans are the party of\nTheodore Roosevelt.\n\n5 Q) What do you think of the release of 1 in 5 prisoners held at Guantanamo\nsays about the ability of the Bush Administration to fight terrorism?  This\nis a chance for you to separate yourself from George Bush.\nMCCAIN: I don\'t believe in torture.  I disagree with the Supreme Court\'s\ndecision.  It\'s not in my view that these non-citizens should have the full\nrights of American citizens.  Let me point out to you, some have already\njoined and again attacked the United States.  So lets be careful on how we\naddress this.  I don\'t think we have to read them their Miranda rights,\nokay.\n\n6 Q) Thank you.  A year and a half ago I became a widow.  I asked if I would\nlose my benefits if I got remarried.  They said no.  Then I got remarried,\nand then I asked again and they said yes.  Is there some way that widows\nthat have worked so hard can keep their benefits?  I\'m a teacher.\n MCCAIN: All I can say is that I will do everything to fix that problem.  I\nwill look into it.\nFOLLOW-UP: We talk about family values.  I teach my kids -- and then I just\ngo live with someone and not get married.\nMCCAIN: I understand.  Thank you.  It\'s a compelling story and I will look\ninto it.\n\nMCCAIN: The entire social security system is going to go bankrupt.  It\'s not\ngoing to be there for young Americans.  We gotta reform it, fix it.\nDemocrats and Republicans have to work together.\n\n7 Q) Most Democrats are moving to the center to get elected and will say and\ndo anything to get elected and this is certainly your opponent.  Will you\nhammer away at this?  They have moved so far to the left!  Will you hammer\naway at their socialist, Marxist ways?\n MCCAIN: Yes!  I give the American people great credit for their\nintelligence and knowledge.  I am sorry that Barack Obama has not taken up\nthe request to have these town hall meetings together.  We should stand in\nfront of you and listen to the American people.  The American people deserve\nmore than the soundbyte, the gotcha moment.  They deserve to see us with the\nvoter.  These things are great and wonderful.  It\'s the most fun thing and\ninformative thing I\'ve ever done.  I promise you this makes me a better\ncandidate and also a better president.\n\n8 Q) My husband is a WWII veteran and I promised him I would shake your\nhand.  Wisconsin is the leader of health care -- we do not have a crisis.\nWhat we have is a health care, care crisis.  Medicare is failing.  It puts a\nburden on all of us.  Do you have a plan to help us out there a bit?\n MCCAIN: You remind me of my mother.  Thank you and thank your husband.  You\nput your finger on the problem -- it\'s not the quality of care that\'s the\nproblem, it\'s the skyrocketing cost.  We\'ve got to put incentives into place\nthat keep health care costs down.  I want to give every family in American a\n$5000 tax credit.  I want to start giving people with chronic diseases\noutpatient care.  We need walk-in clinics and community centers.  We need to\nlook at the issue of the uninsurables.  We need to have government approved\nplans for these people.  We need to establish risk-pools.  Wellness and\nfitness, wellness and fitness.  This is very important.  The rise of obesity\namong young people is staggering.  We should know what the school lunch is\nand what the phys-ed is in schools.  Get fit and get in shape.  We can have\nhealth insurance provide incentives for people to get healthy and fit as\nwell.\n\n9 Q) Many JROTC programs are not getting Phys Ed credits, funding, etc.\nWe\'re getting the boot in high schools.  What are you opinions of JROTC\nprograms?\nMCCAIN: I think that program is an outstanding one.  I do not know that\nabout California -- and I will bring this up with the Governor.  I think its\na great program.\n\n10 Q) Thank you for your work with Feingold on campaign finance reform.  I\nwas going to ask you about the Iraq war and its costs but instead, I\'ll have\nto ask you about what everyone is thinking: Is Brett Farve coming out of\nretirement?\n MCCAIN: That\'s a great example of wellness and fitness.  And I\'d just like\nto add what a great state this is.  Let me recognize the mayor here.  Let me\ntell you about my story running for the Senate - and I was elected.  Tells\nstory.\n\n11 Q) How would you address the growing problem of all the illegal entries\ninto our country.\nMCCAIN: It\'s a big problem and it\'s a federal responsibility.  My friends\nour borders are broken.  I tried twice to get comprehensive immigration\nreform.  We have to secure our borders first.  Then, we need tamper-proof\nbiometric document that temporary workers can use.  We also have to address\nthis in a human way as well.  It\'s a federal responsibility and we must act\nand quickly.\n\n12 Q) I\'m from Minnesota.  Please take Pawlenty as your VP.\nMCCAIN: Gov. Pawlenty is a wonderful person.  He\'s the next generation of\nleadership.\n\n13 Q) Nuclear power.  What do we do with the waste of 45 nuclear power\nplants?\nMCCAIN: We have to store and reprocess.  France reprocesses.  I\'d like to\nset up a reprocessing facility in Russia -- they\'ve offered, but I don\'t\nknow if they are serious. There\'s some issues we have to figure out with\nYucca Mtn, but we should pursue that.\n\n14 Q) I\'m an undecided voter.  I\'m tired of all these crises!  I think we\nall have to work together.  I\'m tired of the war when there\'s so many things\nwe have to fix here.  What can you tell me as I am an undecided voter?\n MCCAIN: Thank you for coming here.  What it really comes down to is what\nAmericans want us to do.  And my records shows me doing that.  Now someone\nmentioned Feingold -- I\'ve worked with him.  I\'ve worked with Lieberman and\nKennedy.  Americans want us to sit down together and figure out these\nproblems.  I have a proven record of reaching across the aisle.  Sometimes I\nhave not succeeded -- like immigration -- but at least we sat down\ntogether.  Americans are so frustrated.  Most Americans think we are on the\nwrong track.  The last time Social Security was in danger -- Democrat Tip\nO\'Neil and Republican Ronald American sat down together and fixed it.  My\nrecord shows me having done this as well.\n\n*Conclusion*\nA long time ago I had the opportunity to leave the prison camp before others\nwho had been their longer.  I declined.  I put my country first.  I\'ve done\nwhat I thought was right and I\'ve put my country first, even when it made\nothers made.  I will always put my country first.\n\n\n-- \nCammie L.
