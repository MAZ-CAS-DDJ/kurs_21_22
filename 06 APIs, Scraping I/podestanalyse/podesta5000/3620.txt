Today\xe2\x80\x99s article is a summary of that interview plus additional excerpts taken from their web page\xc2\xa0www.progressiowa.org/. Progress Iowa was established in 2012 as a 501(c) 4, non-partisan social welfare organization.\n\nWe chose to interview Progress Iowa to remind Iowa progressives of the critical work they perform. Progressives don\xe2\x80\x99t have a rich uncle like the Koch Brothers funding their efforts. The Kochs\xe2\x80\x99 extreme agenda and their far right allies must be challenged, and groups like Progress Iowa can and will build coalitions to challenge them.\n\nContinue\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWhy does the public vote against their own self-interest?\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOpinion: Ode to Obama \xe2\x80\x93 Fighting Terrorism\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOpinion: Iowa Democrats have a bright future, but only with a \xe2\x80\x9d2-cycle solution\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nDespite widespread concerns, Branstad refuses to budge on Medicaid deadline\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nIowa Daily Democrat (\xe2\x80\x9cIDD\xe2\x80\x9d) is published by the Clarion News Service, LLC.
