The new group was created to, well, correct the record,\nparticularly the right-wing attacks on Hillary Clinton as she mulls a 2016\npresidential run.\n\n\n\nThe 20 or so staff members at Correct the Record, glued to computers in a\nloft-like space on Massachusetts Avenue, next to Brock\xe2\x80\x99s own office, were\nengaged that afternoon in pushing back on a narrative emerging that sales\nof Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s latest memoir, Hard Choices, were tanking.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t already seen three articles on this, before the bestseller\nlist was even out, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be doing this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Burns Strider, a genial\nbear of a Mississippian. He was surrounded by Elrod, an Arkansan and former\noperative with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and two\nother aides who barely looked up from their MacBooks. On the walls around\nthem were photos of Clinton at various periods of her career\xe2\x80\x94looking regal\nat the State Department, shaggy with Bill in their Yale Law School days.\n\n\n\nThe idea for CTR came to Brock during the Benghazi hearings on Capitol\nHill. With Clinton not there to defend herself, having left her post as\nsecretary of state, the right wing was having a field day, Brock says.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no, or limited, capacity for her to deal with the range of\nattacks, coming mainly from Capitol Hill but echoed elsewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d Brock told\nThe Daily Beast. Plus, there were already a half-dozen or so right-wing\nsuper PACs that had Clinton in their sights, none more serious than America\nRising, an opposition research outfit founded to counter some of Brock\xe2\x80\x99s\nefforts.\n\n\n\nThat group is run by Tim Miller, a 30-something former aide to Jon Huntsman\nwho, Strider huffed, \xe2\x80\x9cmust have, like, a Ph.D. in snark.\xe2\x80\x9d (Indeed, on the\nPAC\xe2\x80\x99s website at the moment are GIFs of George Constanza, The Office, and\nMr. Potato Head lifting a dumbbell, each meant to highlight some\ndunderheaded comment from a Democrat.)\n\n\n\nStrider and his team see Miller and America Rising as their dark shadow, if\na somewhat unserious one, throwing whatever they can against the wall to\nsee what sticks.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey throw out stuff, like, 10 times a day. The RNC has a damn squirrel\nfollowing her around! I mean\xe2\x80\x94they have a squirrel!\xe2\x80\x9d Strider said in\ndisbelief, referring to the Republican National Committee intern tasked\nwith stalking Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s appearances in a squirrel mascot outfit, wearing a\nT-shirt that reads, \xe2\x80\x9cAnother Clinton in the White House is NUTS.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAccording to Elrod, Correct the Record is trying its best to avoid the kind\nof flack-on-flack combat that is a hallmark of political campaigns,\nespecially in the era of Twitter and all-night news-athons, preferring to\nstick to the facts and work by subterfuge.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are strategic about how we get our facts out there,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pointing\nout that her group tends to push out its own research to friendly\nreporters. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of what we do doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have our fingerprints on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSo far, there have been only a few exceptions to that rule. When Miller and\nAmerica Rising put out a hit on President Clinton for boasting about how he\nhad given away several $550 watches to friends, Correct the Record did\nrespond, noting that the watches came from the Shinola company, a Detroit\nsuccess story. \xe2\x80\x9cSo not only were they anti-Clinton, but they were\nanti-American small business and anti-generosity!\xe2\x80\x9d cackled Strider.\n\n\n\nAnd when America Rising put out a surprise e-book on Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s time at the\nState Department, researchers at Correct the Record had, according to Isaac\nWright, a Democratic consultant brought on by Brock, \xe2\x80\x9cwithin two hours on a\nSundaynight debunked everything they had in that book. That book went\nnowhere. It quite deservedly landed in the trash.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA bigger question facing the new outfit, however, is how to manage press\noperations from a non-campaign campaign when Clinton is the best-known\nfigure in American political life\xe2\x80\x94according to a recent NBC News/Wall\nStreet Journal poll, only 1 percent of respondents did not have an opinion\nabout her\xe2\x80\x94and when news outlets have proliferated since she was last\napproaching a race.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no exact science. The first thing you look at is, is it getting\nany traction? And we start getting reports on Twitter or Facebook, or other\nreporters picking it up, and see where is it going,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strider. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may\nstill hold off, or you may go balls to the wall for whatever reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIf something is going to stay in conservative precincts, Correct the Record\nprefers to keep it there rather than respond and fan the flames further.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can almost tell what things she says will get mischaracterized,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nElrod. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can tell what is going to end up in The Daily Caller, what is\ngoing to get picked up by the Free Beacon, and which are going to move more\ninto the mainstream. We try to always have a prepared response, but we wait\nto see what moves.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBrock and his staff expressed frustration that mainstream outlets, The New\nYork Times chief among them, have dedicated reporters to covering Clinton\nlong before she has announced a potential candidacy.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome venues say that the job is to write on her once a day, or write on\nher five times a week or something, which puts a number value on the\narticle, instead of a value of content,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strider. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that\ndeserves a little discussion from the other side. You know it is getting\nrough when you turn on Morning Joe and they are criticizing themselves for\ncovering Hillary so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPart of the point of Correct the Record is to make sure that Democrats\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t get caught flat-footed the way they did in 2004. Then, long before\nthe days of super PACs, wealthy Republicans funded ads that questioned John\nKerry\xe2\x80\x99s war record. At the time, the attacks seemed absurd to Democrats;\nthe Massachusetts senator was a decorated Vietnam veteran, and George W.\nBush\xe2\x80\x99s service record was spotty at best.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think Democrats to this day tend to have Swift Boaters right over our\nshoulder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strider. \xe2\x80\x9cWe tend to worry. We saw what happened to Senator\nKerry, and while it was happening, everyone thought, This can\xe2\x80\x99t work. This\nguy\xe2\x80\x99s got medals. Well, they had a free ride for a good long while before\nthere was an honest-to-God response. I think on some level Democrats think\nof that and say, \xe2\x80\x98Never again.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIf Kerry got it bad in 2004, Obama in 2008, with his funny name and exotic\nupbringing, surely had it far worse. That year, the campaign devoted a\nsignificant part of its outreach to a \xe2\x80\x9cFight the Smears\xe2\x80\x9d effort to beat\nback rumors that their candidate was Muslim or born in another country. And\neven though a British tabloid occasionally picks up a story about Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\ndivorce or has some anonymous first-person account of his cocaine habit, no\nAmerican political figure has undergone quite the onslaught that Clinton\nhas in her nearly three decades on the national scene.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is fair to say that it has always been the case that the media\ninterest in the Clintons seems wide and deep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brock. \xe2\x80\x9cThe right\nthinks, and there is a history going back 20 years, that the Clintons have\nbeen very good for business. They are magnets for money on the Republican\nand conservative side, and a lot of this anti-Clinton stuff can be seen as\na business.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRecently, staffers at Correct the Record have been surprised to discover\nthat the stories they need to push back on are not about Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s book\ntour, or her time as secretary of state, or even her stint in the U.S.\nSenate, but her time as first lady, or even more surprisingly, her time as\nfirst lady of Arkansas, if not before.\n\n\n\nWhen the Free Beacon discovered diaries of the late Clinton friend Diane\nBlair that revealed Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts during the Monica Lewinsky scandal,\nthe CTR staff thought it was old news but still flew someone down to Little\nRock the next day. By that evening, their staffer was poring through the\nfiles at the University of Arkansas. When an uproar arose more recently\nover Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s role as a public defender in a Little Rock rape case, the\ngroup helped arrange interviews with Mahlon Gibson, the prosecutor in the\ncase whom Elrod and Brock knew from their Arkansas days. Gibson told CNN\nand others that Clinton was appointed to the case and expressed\nreservations about it at the time.\n\n\n\nSuch retread stories from the past, they say, do not worry them.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen [Kentucky Sen.] Rand [Paul] cranks up his old hits from the \xe2\x80\x9970s, it\nis such a waste of time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Burns. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly those events helped shape\nthe character of the people we all are today, but you know, the people who\nremember it aren\xe2\x80\x99t interested in reliving it. I remember the last night of\ndisco. People burned that damn stadium down\xe2\x80\xa6Campaigns are about the future.\nIt is all they have, so they are working it.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes when somebody brings up one of [the scandals of the past], you\nsee all the old hands come out of the woodwork. I mean, good lord. What is\nthat woman\xe2\x80\x99s name\xe2\x80\x94Maureen Dowd? Peggy Noonan. It\xe2\x80\x99s like they want to get\none more shot at their glory years in their 40s, and they are all going at\nit again, all giddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut if a well-turned phrase by Dowd or Noonan can no longer set tongues\nwagging like it did in the \xe2\x80\x9990s the ability of rapid responders to punch\nback is equally limited. In the last 24 hours, 365 news articles were\ndevoted to Hillary Clinton, according to Google. There have been dozens of\ntweets just in the last few minutes, including, \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps Hillary Clinton\nshould have thought about who her husband was before naming her book \xe2\x80\x98Hard\nChoices\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99 Just sayin\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cName 1 thing Hillary Clinton has ever\naccomplished? As 1st lady? As Senator? As Secretary of State? You CAN\xe2\x80\x99T!\nShe has accomplished nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d Never mind whatever podcast, Vine, Tumblr,\ntalk radio host or triple digit cable network is spouting off about at the\nmoment.\n\n\n\nHow can any one response team keep up? And, for that matter, why should\nthey?\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the old days, rapid response meant you convince NBC or whomever that\nthe story was bogus and don\xe2\x80\x99t run it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul Begala, a Brock ally (and\nformer Daily Beast columnist) running his own super PAC. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this citizen\njournalism age, you can\xe2\x80\x99t do that anymore. Somebody is going to run it\nanyway. All you can do is push back with the facts. I can come up with the\nhyperbole, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about that, but give me the facts and the data and\nthe quote in context.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAs Begala, who was chief strategist for the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign,\nsees it, the impetus behind the conservative attacks on Hillary Clinton now\nis not so much to change perceptions about her, since she is so well-known,\nbut to drive down enthusiasm. If there is an idea afoot that Clinton is\nsoft on rapists, for example, then maybe key parts of her coalition, like\nyoung women, will stay home.\n\n\n\nSome Democratic communicators told The Daily Beast that they thought\nCorrect the Record\xe2\x80\x99s time would be better spent on offense. With the\ngroup\xe2\x80\x99s resources, it could track what the top GOP 2016 contenders were\ndoing, much as its b\xc3\xaate noire, America Rising, is doing to Clinton, and\npull out embarrassing comments made when Paul, Ted Cruz, and others think\nno one is really listening.\n\n\n\nAnd the very idea that the Clintons already have a group pushing back on\nnegative stories about them plays into one of the persistent themes of\nClinton-world\xe2\x80\x94that they are too sensitive to slights and press criticism,\nand so need an outside entity to defend them even during an ostensible\nnon-campaign period. It was Hillary Clinton, after all, who invented the\nmodern day campaign war room back in 1992, Begala said.\n\n\n\nBrock, naturally, disputes this point.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the extent that there is a sensitivity, it is almost a wholly warranted\nsensitivity,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI would say someone could write a book about the\nunfair treatment of the Clintons, but I already did.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut the main question facing Correct the Record is what becomes of it once\nClinton embarks on a full-scale campaign. In the era of super PACs, almost\neverything a campaign does can be outsourced\xe2\x80\x94get out the vote drives,\nadvertising, and the like.

Last year talk show host Charlie Rose was paid $141,700 to\nspeak at the dinner, which earned a $68,335 profit.\n\n\n\nThe UNLV Foundation launched the annual fundraiser in 1989 but didn\xe2\x80\x99t start\ncharging to attend the event until 2010, when David Gergen, a former\nadviser to Bill Clinton and three previous presidents, spoke for $55,000.\nThe dinner lost $93,289 after expenses, however.\n\n\n\nThe most expensive dinner was in 2005, when the nonprofit foundation spent\n$319,435 for 482 attendees to kick off a $500 million fundraising campaign.\nOver the years, the foundation has raised more than $1 billion for the\nuniversity.\n\n\n\nAllen said foundation leaders in recent years realized the value of selling\npricey tables for 10 with special access to speakers.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe foundation changed the business model for the donor recognition event\nin 2010 to a paid dinner, which has helped the foundation cover its event\ncosts and in recent years raise money to support the work of the\nfoundation,\xe2\x80\x9d Allen said in an email. \xe2\x80\x9cPreviously, the annual dinner was\ncomplimentary to attendees and budgeted and paid for by the foundation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAsked whether the foundation expected the fall event with Clinton to be\nprofitable, Allen said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, we anticipate the donor recognition dinner\nwill cover event costs and generate a net profit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s six-figure fee stirred controversy with critics\ncomplaining that it\xe2\x80\x99s too large, especially because she\xe2\x80\x99s speaking to an\neducational group. Timing is also an issue. The $225,000 fee got extra\nattention because of gaffes the former secretary of state made while on\ntour to promote her new book, \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate said she was \xe2\x80\x9cnot\ntruly well off.\xe2\x80\x9d She also said the Clintons were \xe2\x80\x9cdead broke\xe2\x80\x9d when they\nleft the White House in 2001. The couple has earn more than $100 million,\nmuch of it from speaking fees, in the past eight years, according to\nPolitico.\n\n\n\nDavid Damore, a political science professor at UNLV, said Hillary Clinton\nis under a microscope.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s so high-profile that anything she does is going to draw the\npartisans out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the optics weren\xe2\x80\x99t great.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s supporters note that her speaking fees from universities go to\nthe Bill, Hillary &Chelsea Clinton Foundation, a charitable organization\nthat deals with a range of issues, from global warming to economic growth.\n\n\n\nControversial or not, Clinton is looking like a good investment.\n\n\n\nSo far, all $20,000 tables ($18,000 tax deductible) have sold out,\naccording to the foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website. All confirmed 16 \xe2\x80\x9cworld\xe2\x80\x9d tables were\nreserved. Those tickets include a photo session with Clinton and\nautographed copies of her book as well as \xe2\x80\x9cpremium wines, champagne and\nspecial menu for guests.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThree $10,000 tables have also been sold, as has one $3,000 table. There\nwere no takers for a $5,000 table as ofWednesday afternoon, Allen said. The\ntotal tables sold so far adds up to $353,000.\n\n\n\nIndividual tickets at $200 a pop aren\xe2\x80\x99t available for sale until August,\naccording to the foundation. Allen said it\xe2\x80\x99s too soon to say how many\npeople will attend the dinner or how much it will cost because \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s still\nin the planning stages.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Clinton dinner has created a division among UNLV\xe2\x80\x99s student leaders, too.\n\n\n\nLast week, Student Body President Elias Bejjelloun and Daniel Waqar, public\nrelations director for the student government, co-signed a letter to the\nClinton Foundation, suggesting she donate all or part of her fee to the\nuniversity as a charitable gesture. The students were careful to praise\nClinton and say they looked forward to her speaking at UNLV.\n\n\n\nThis week, UNLV Sen. Alex Murdock objected and on Tuesday mailed his own\nletter to the Clinton Foundation, apologizing for what he called an\n\xe2\x80\x9cinappropriate and embarrassing request\xe2\x80\x9d by Bejjelloun.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe request made by the CSUN Student Body President was not only in poor\ntaste, it was also misinformed and not indicative of the intelligence of\nUNLV Students,\xe2\x80\x9d Murdock wrote.\n\n\n\nMurdock also trashed Bejjelloun, saying his ascent to the presidency this\nyear violated bylaws and the student government constitution. The two men\nhave clashed since Murdock challenged Bejjelloun\xe2\x80\x99s election, which was\nupheld.\n\n\n\nMurdock said Wednesday he thought Bejjelloun should have consulted with all\nUNLV student senators before writing the Clinton Foundation. He also noted\nthat the event will make money, so the high fee is worth it.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to spend money to make money,\xe2\x80\x9d Murdock said.\n\n\n\nBejjelloun stood by his actions, saying Wednesday that he wanted to send\nout a timely request after Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s fee was revealed. He also said he\nconsulted with other senators who were on campus. Murdock, a Navy reservist\nwho served in Iraq, said he was involved in special military training at\nthe time and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t asked.\n\n\n\nBejjelloun was unsympathetic.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Murdock wanted to be consulted he should come into the office and do\nhis job. He\xe2\x80\x99s never here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Gainesville Sun opinion: Douglas Smith, former assistant secretary for the\nprivate sector at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security: \xe2\x80\x9cInternational\ntourism benefits Florida\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.gainesville.com/article/20140707/OPINION/140709767?p=1&tc=pg>*\n\n\n\nBy Douglas Smith\n\nJuly 7, 2014, 3:52 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nThe Washington Economics Group recently released its quarterly report,\nwhich shows that tourism and recreation spending in Florida increased 6.4\npercent from the same quarter last year. On the report, WEG principal and\nfounder Tony Villamil said that the growth is \xe2\x80\x9ca sign of a sustainable\neconomic recovery led by tourism and investment spending.\xe2\x80\x9d In Florida, and\nother areas throughout the country, tourism has been a large driver on the\nroad to economic recovery.\n\n\n\nThe money spent by foreign tourists fuels economic growth and supports\nhundreds of thousands of American jobs. According to former Secretary of\nState Hillary Clinton, \xe2\x80\x9cFor every 65 international visitors, one American\njob is created.\xe2\x80\x9d In Florida, international tourism is vital to the state\xe2\x80\x99s\neconomy. The most recent data from the Department of Commerce ranks Florida\nas the second highest destination for international visitors to the United\nStates.\n\n\n\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton used the tools available to her as\nAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s top diplomat to positively impact the economy here at home,\nunderstanding that our economic security was integral to our national\nsecurity, and vice versa. In her book, \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices,\xe2\x80\x9d she writes about\n\xe2\x80\x9chow a collapsing economy in Athens, Greece, affects businesses in Athens,\nGeorgia [and] how a revolution in Cairo, Egypt, impacts life in Cairo,\nIllinois.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nI worked alongside Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team to promote international\ntourism when I served on the President\'s Travel and Tourism Advisory Board.\nWe implemented a variety of policies that helped increase the number of\ninternational tourists to the U.S. from 55 million in 2009 to 70 million in\n2013 \xe2\x80\x93 which gave the American economy a boost when it needed it the most,\nwhile never compromising our national security.\n\n\n\nSecretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s work on two important initiatives made a profound\nimpact on Florida\xe2\x80\x99s economy by increasing the number of Brazilian visitors\nto the state. Florida is the top U.S. destination for Brazilian tourists,\nwho spend more than $5,000 per visit, higher than the average overseas\ntourist and nearly twice as much as visitors from France and the UK.\n\n\n\nFirst, she reduced inefficiencies and optimized the process for Brazilians\nto obtain U.S. visas, by creating new visa adjudicator positions and\nexpanding processing facilities. This resulted in a 58% increase in visa\nprocessing capacity in just one year. According to Secretary Clinton, \xe2\x80\x9cin\nSao Paulo in Brazil, it once took 140 days to get a visa, that time is now\nunder 48 hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSecond, Clinton worked with the Brazilian government and American Airlines\nto increase the number of flights to the U.S., adding 10 additional flights\na week between Miami and Brazil, including the first nonstop routes from\nMiami to Recife and Salvador.\n\n\n\nHer work paid off. In 2012, it was reported that \xe2\x80\x9cmore flights\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ceasing\nof the visa logjam\xe2\x80\x9d are listed as two of the four reasons Florida has\nbecome \xe2\x80\x9ca magnet for Brazilians.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact, the number of visitors from\nBrazil to South Florida has reached record levels over the past few years,\nmaking Brazil Miami-Dade\xe2\x80\x99s top international market. Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nefforts on these two initiatives increased the number of visitors to\nFlorida, fueled money into Florida\xe2\x80\x99s economy, and created tens of thousands\nof jobs for Floridians in the middle of an economic downturn.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker said, \xe2\x80\x9ctravel and\ntourism to and within the United States has been a significant contributor\nto our economic recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d The increase in foreign travelers under\nSecretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s watch spurred economic growth and created jobs at a\ntime when America needed it most, particularly in Florida.\n\n\n\n*Douglas Smith is executive vice president of the public relations firm\nMWW.

Bernard, however,\ncontinued to imply Clinton may have voluntarily accepted the role after\nspeaking with the prosecutor.\n\n\n\nThe fact that the court appointed Clinton to represent the defendant is not\nin doubt. The judge -- not the prosecutor -- directed Clinton to take on\nthe case, as Glenn Thrush established in a 2008 Newsday report:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn May 21, 1975, Tom Taylor rose in court to demand that Washington County\nJudge Maupin Cummings allow him to fire his male court-appointed lawyer in\nfavor of a female attorney. Taylor, who earned a meager wage at a paper bag\nfactory and lived with relatives, had already spent 10 days in the county\njail and was grasping for a way to avoid a 30 years-to-life term in the\nstate penitentiary for rape.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTaylor, 41, figured a jury would be less hostile to a rape defendant\nrepresented by a woman, according to one of his friends. Cummings agreed to\nthe request, scanned the list of available female attorneys (there were\nonly a half dozen in the county at the time) and assigned Rodham, who had\nvirtually no experience in criminal litigation.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Hillary told me she didn\'t want to take that case, she made that very\nclear,\xe2\x80\x99 recalls prosecutor Gibson, who phoned her with the judge\'s order.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I didn\'t feel comfortable taking on such a client, but Mahlon gently\nreminded me that I couldn\'t very well refuse the judge\'s request,\xe2\x80\x99 the\neventual first lady writes in \xe2\x80\x98Living History.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton had no choice but to accept the court\'s order, despite voicing\nreservations, a fact the case\'s prosecutor reiterated to CNN:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMahlon Gibson told CNN on Wednesday the then 27-year-old Hillary Rodham\n(now Clinton) was \xe2\x80\x98appointed\xe2\x80\x99 by the judge in the case, even though she\nvoiced reservations.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[...]\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGibson said that it is \xe2\x80\x98ridiculous\xe2\x80\x99 for people to question how Clinton\nbecame Taylor\'s representation.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98She got appointed to represent this guy,\xe2\x80\x99 he told CNN when asked about\nthe controversy.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to Gibson, Maupin Cummings, the judge in the case, kept a list\nof attorneys who would represent poor clients. Clinton was on that list and\nhelped run a legal aid clinic at the time.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTaylor was assigned a public defender in the case but Gibson said he\nquickly \xe2\x80\x98started screaming for a woman attorney\xe2\x80\x99 to represent him.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGibson said Clinton called him shortly after the judge assigned her to the\ncase and said, \xe2\x80\x98I don\'t want to represent this guy. I just can\'t stand\nthis. I don\'t want to get involved. Can you get me off?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I told her, \'Well contact the judge and see what he says about it,\' but I\nalso said don\'t jump on him and make him mad,\xe2\x80\x99 Gibson said. \xe2\x80\x98She contacted\nthe judge and the judge didn\'t remove her and she stayed on the case.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Daily Caller opinion: Lanny Davis: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Hard Choices\xe2\x80\x99\nShow Who She Really Is\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/09/hillary-clintons-hard-choices-show-who-she-really-is/>*\n\n\n\nBy Lanny Davis\n\nJuly 9, 2014, 10:02 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nThe reviews are in on Hard Choices, Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s history of her\nfour-year tenure as U.S. secretary of State. They are almost all positive.\nHer book sales are strong \xe2\x80\x94 number one on The New York Times bestseller\nlist for three weeks in a row.\n\n\n\nWhat is missing from most of the reviews is what the book reveals about\nClinton the person. I can speak to that, knowing her since I was a senior\nand she was a freshman at Yale Law School when we first met in the fall of\n1969.\n\n\n\nFirst, to state the most obvious: Hard Choices is about Hillary working\nhard.\n\n\n\nWe have all read the data of her travels and meetings as secretary of\nState: 401 days on the road, one million miles traveled, 112 countries\nvisited. The book depicts the results of that hard work, her enduring\nachievements as secretary of State, including her indefatigable personal\nshuttle diplomacy between Israel and Egypt, which led to a cease-fire\nbetween Israel and the Hamas-led Palestinians in Gaza, saving countless\nlives; her determined negotiations with Russia, which led to a reduction in\nU.S.-Russian nuclear missiles with better verification; and her successful\neffort to obtain global cooperation imposing economic sanctions on Iran,\nwidely credited with bringing Iran to the negotiating table regarding its\nnuclear weapons program.\n\n\n\nThen there is Hillary the strong and decisive leader, who made difficult\njudgments based on the available facts, taking the risk that, with the\nwisdom of hindsight, she might turn out to be wrong. The most dramatic\nexample, described in page-turning detail in her book, was her support of\nPresident Obama\xe2\x80\x99s courageous decision to send in the Navy SEALs to kill\nOsama bin Laden, a decision opposed by Vice President Biden.\n\n\n\nFinally, the book conveys the positive global effects of her authenticity\nand likeability. In my view, one of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s most enduring achievements as\nsecretary of State \xe2\x80\x94 maybe the most important \xe2\x80\x94 was the dramatic increase\nin positive perceptions of American leadership around the world during her\ntenure. In the last two years of the Bush administration, according to\nGallup World Poll data, America trailed Britain, France, Germany, Japan and\nChina in approval of its leadership. That\xe2\x80\x99s right, behind even China. In\n2011, after two years of Clinton as secretary of State, America was tied\nfor first place with Germany.\n\n\n\nFinally, several sentences in the last two chapters of her book convey core\ninsights into the real Hillary Clinton that her long-time friends have\nunderstood over the years.\n\n\n\nWhen Obama asked her to stay into the second term, she wrote that she \xe2\x80\x9cfelt\nthe tug of my \xe2\x80\x98service gene,\xe2\x80\x99 that voice telling me there is no higher\ncalling or more noble purpose than serving your country.\xe2\x80\x9d But then made she\nmade the decision to return to private life \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cspending more time with my\nfamily, reconnecting with friends, doing the everyday things I missed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe also wrote poignantly about her thoughts at her mom\xe2\x80\x99s funeral: \xe2\x80\x9cI\nlooked at Chelsea and thought about how proud Mom was of her. Mom measured\nher own life by how much she was able to help us and serve others. I knew\nif she was still with us, she would be urging us to do the same. Never rest\non your laurels. Never quit. Never stop working to make the world a better\nplace. That\xe2\x80\x99s our unfinished business.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe first time I met Hillary Rodham in September 1969, we were standing in\nline to register for classes at Yale Law School. I asked her if she needed\nany advice on how to study and brief cases in her first semester at a\nfairly challenging law school. She said, politely, \xe2\x80\x9cno thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d and then\nasked: \xe2\x80\x9cCan you tell me where I can find the nearest legal services clinic?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNo, Hillary Clinton hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed through all the years: the importance of\nfamily and friends, the \xe2\x80\x9cservice gene\xe2\x80\x9d as active today as I witnessed some\n45 years ago, motivating her to \xe2\x80\x9cnever quit \xe2\x80\x94 never stop working to make\nthe world a better place.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Time: \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s What John Kerry Can Learn From Hillary About Israel\xe2\x80\x99s New\nCrisis\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://time.com/2969852/hillary-clinton-john-kerry-barack-obama-israel-hamas/>*\n\n\n\nBy Michael Crowley\n\nJuly 9, 2014\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] Clinton writes that Obama was \xe2\x80\x9cunderstandably wary\xe2\x80\x9d about\nintervening the last time violence flared\n\n\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu on Wednesday, amid rising fears that the confrontation between\nIsrael and Hamas could escalate to new levels of bloodshed. But Kerry might\nalso want to talk to his Foggy Bottom predecessor about how the last round\nof violence in the intractable conflict was defused.\n\n\n\nWhen Israel and Hamas last fought in Gaza in November 2012, President\nBarack Obama dispatched then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to broker a\ncease-fire. As Israel called up 75,000 reservists for a possible ground\ninvasion, Obama was \xe2\x80\x9cunderstandably wary\xe2\x80\x9d of the U.S. taking a direct\nmediation role, Clinton writes in her new book, Hard Choices.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we tried to broker a cease-fire and failed, as seemed quite likely, it\nwould sap America\xe2\x80\x99s prestige and credibility in the region,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton says.\nAmerican involvement might also risk undercutting Israel, whose \xe2\x80\x9cright to\ndefend itself\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton underscores. Obama officials also worried a U.S.\nrole might \xe2\x80\x9celevate\xe2\x80\x9d the conflict\xe2\x80\x99s profile, leading both sides to harden\ntheir negotiating positions.\n\n\n\nEven so, Clinton and Obama concluded that it was \xe2\x80\x9cimperative to resolve the\ncrisis before it became a ground war.\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton knew that Netanyahu didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nwant to invade Gaza \xe2\x80\x94 but that he faced domestic pressure to do so and had\nno clear \xe2\x80\x9cexit ramp\xe2\x80\x9d that would allow him to de-escalate without seeming to\nback down, Clinton writes.\n\n\n\nJust over 18 months later, many of the same dynamics apply as Obama weighs\nwhether Kerry can \xe2\x80\x94 or should \xe2\x80\x94 broker a deal like the one Clinton struck.\n\n\n\nFor now, Obama officials have two public messages. One is that Israel is\nentitled to hit back at Hamas when the hard-line Palestinian group launches\nrockets at its territory. \xe2\x80\x9cNo country can accept rocket fire aimed at\ncivilians, and we certainly support Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to defend itself against\nthese attacks,\xe2\x80\x9d State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki saidTuesday. The\nother is that the two sides should rein in the violence \xe2\x80\x94 which now takes\nthe form of Hamas rocket attacks and Israeli air strikes. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re continuing\nto convey the need to de-escalate to both sides,\xe2\x80\x9d Psaki said.\n\n\n\nThat may not happen on its own, warns Dennis Ross, a former Obama White\nHouse aide who has handled Middle East issues for multiple Presidents.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven if neither side wants it to spin out of control, the potential for\nthat is quite high,\xe2\x80\x9d Ross says.\n\n\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s why Obama has to decide whether to step in, especially given growing\nsigns of an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza. Israel\xe2\x80\x99s 2009 incursion into\nthe Hamas-governed coastal territory left 1,400 dead, and badly damaged\nIsrael\xe2\x80\x99s international image. A second invasion was averted in November\n2012 only by the Clinton-brokered cease-fire, a deal struck just 48 hours\nbefore Israeli troops planned to swarm into Hamas\xe2\x80\x99 stronghold.\n\n\n\nJust before Thanksgiving that year, Clinton flew to the region and met with\nIsraeli and Palestinian leaders. She also saw Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s then President\nMohamed Morsi, whose Muslim Brotherhood government was friendly with Hamas.\nThe result was a mutual cease-fire, overseen by Egypt, with the promise of\nfuture negotiations about Hamas\xe2\x80\x99 rocket arsenal and Israel\xe2\x80\x99s Gaza blockade.\nThose talks never went far. But the cease-fire held.

The onetime New York senator whom many Wall Street bankers\nsupported and former secretary of state who gave speeches to Goldman Sachs\nand others for a reported $200,000 per? Or the leader of an increasingly\nprogressive Democratic Party, who, in an interview with the German magazine\nDer Spiegel this week, affirmed the thesis of economist Thomas Piketty? \xe2\x80\x9cI\nthink he makes a very strong case that we have unbalanced our economy too\nmuch towards favoring capital and away from labor,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nFriend or foe of Wall Street? On the one hand, it was Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s husband who\nentrusted the nation\xe2\x80\x99s economic policymaking to former Goldman Sachs\nexecutive Robert Rubin, who, along with subsequent Treasury secretaries\nLawrence Summers and Timothy Geithner, promoted an agenda of free trade,\nderegulation and privileging the interests of big banks over all others. On\nthe other, as a senator, Clinton called for tougher regulations on\nderivatives and said that \xe2\x80\x9cWall Street has played a significant role\xe2\x80\x9d in\nthe subprime mortgage disaster \xe2\x80\x94 and she did so in 2007, one year before\nthe great collapse.\n\n\n\nWhat makes Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s predicament particularly significant is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not\nhers alone. For decades, the default position of generations of Democrats\nhas been to back economic policies that helped ordinary Americans \xe2\x80\x94 higher\nminimum wages, the right to unionize, spending on infrastructure \xe2\x80\x94 without\nreining in banks, corporations and the wealthy beyond the basic constraints\nlaid down by the New Deal. They could do this for one fundamental reason:\nEconomic growth in the United States was largely equitable; prosperity was\nbroadly shared.\n\n\n\nWhen President John F. Kennedy famously declared that \xe2\x80\x9ca rising tide lifts\nall boats,\xe2\x80\x9d he was not merely describing how the economy worked in the\npre-globalization and highly unionized United States of the post-World War\nII decades. He was also, however inadvertently, explaining how the relative\nabsence of class conflict enabled Democrats to be both pro-union and a\nfriend of financial elites, who were not yet accruing all the proceeds of\ngrowth for themselves.\n\n\n\nBut that was then.\n\n\n\nToday, as Clinton told Der Spiegel, capital has eclipsed labor. Fully 95\npercent of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s income growth since the recovery began in 2009,\nUniversity of California economist Emmanuel Saez has shown, has gone to the\nwealthiest 1 percent of Americans. The share of the country\xe2\x80\x99s gross\ndomestic product going to profits is at a record high; the share going to\nwages a record low.\n\n\n\nUnder these conditions, what\xe2\x80\x99s a Democrat \xe2\x80\x94 what\xe2\x80\x99s Hillary Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 to do?\nHow does she propose to re-create a United States where the gains in\nproductivity go not only to the largest shareholders but also to the\nworkers who make those gains?\n\n\n\nShe could, for starters, propose cutting taxes on employers who raise wages\nin line with the nation\xe2\x80\x99s annual productivity increase, and raising the\nlevy on employers who don\xe2\x80\x99t. She could propose hiking taxes on capital\ngains and dividends at least to the level of taxes on work-derived income.\nShe could propose cutting taxes on corporations that divide their boards\nequally between representatives of shareholders and employees, as the\nGermans do, and raising the tax rates of corporations that don\xe2\x80\x99t, that are\nrun almost solely for the benefit of their large shareholders and their top\nexecutives \xe2\x80\x94 as most U.S. corporations are.\n\n\n\nImmodest proposals, to be sure, but in an economy in which nearly all the\nincome growth accrues to a sliver of investors, Democrats no longer have\nthe luxury of indulging both that sliver and everybody else. As Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nproto-candidacy continues to take shape, one modest way that she could\nbegin to address the scourge of inequality would be to follow the example\nof Franklin Roosevelt.\n\n\n\nIn selecting his Treasury secretary, Roosevelt opted not to choose Sen.\nCarter Glass, in part because Glass wanted a J.P. Morgan executive as his\ndeputy. As Adam Cohen documents in \xe2\x80\x9cNothing to Fear,\xe2\x80\x9d his history of\nRoosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s first 100 days as president, Roosevelt told his aide Raymond\nMoley, \xe2\x80\x9cWe simply cannot go along with Twenty-Three.\xe2\x80\x9d (The Morgan bank was\nheadquartered at 23 Wall St.)\n\n\n\nExpanded from 23 to the rest of the street, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good guidance for\nour next president, whomever it may be. Wall Street veterans aren\xe2\x80\x99t likely\nto see Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s ascendancy over the rest of the economy as a problem.\nThe cure for Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s, and the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99, identity crisis begins with a\nclear declaration that the nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy will no longer be entrusted to\nthe leaders of the very institutions that have brought it low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Slate blog: Weigel: \xe2\x80\x9cHow Hillary Clinton Went from Working Class Hero to\nElite Loser, in Two Bill Kristol Columns\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/07/09/how_hillary_clinton_went_from_working_class_hero_to_elite_loser_in_two_bill.html>*\n\n\n\nBy David Weigel\n\nJuly 9, 2014, 2:07 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nOne of the great joys of political reporting circa 2014 is how quickly you\ncan crowd-source a question. After skimming a column about how Hillary\nClinton\'s book tour might have happened too early (this, after how many\nmonths of coverage of when Clinton would climb back on the horse?), I\nflashed back to all the punditry from 2011 and 2012 about Clinton\'s\npolitical might. Hadn\'t pundits argued for Joe Biden to leave the ticket\nand the popular, adroit Hillary Clinton to replace him? Had any pundits\nargued both for a Hillary-veep switch and argued that Hillary 2016 was\nfalling apart?\n\n\n\nWithin five minutes of my ask, Reuters reporter Gabriel Debenedetti\nproduced two Bill Kristol columns that did exactly this. On May 28, 2012,\nKristol trolled the Obama campaign by suggesting an obvious\nface-saving/election-winning switcheroo. Joe Biden had to go. (My emphasis.)\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho should replace Biden? Everyone knows the answer. Hillary Clinton\nreceived nearly 18 million votes in the race for the 2008 Democratic\nnomination. Her rating in a Washington Post survey a couple of weeks ago\nwas 65 percent favorable, 27 percent unfavorable. Biden hurts Obama. She\nwould help him. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, she\xe2\x80\x99d help with precisely the undecided voters\nObama needs in November. Many of them are white, working- and middle-class\nAmericans who supported her in the 2008 primaries. They overcame their\ndisappointment at Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s defeat to vote for Obama that November. But\nmany became disillusioned and voted Republican in 2010, producing that\nyear\xe2\x80\x99s GOP landslide. Barack Obama needs to win back as many of them as\npossible in 2012. They voted for Hillary Clinton once. Surely they\xe2\x80\x99d be\nmore likely to return to Obama if given the opportunity to vote for her\nagain as part of the ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nJust two years and one month later, Kristol reacted to Hillary Clinton\'s\nbook tour -- specifically, her inartful answer to Diane Sawyer\'s question\nabout how rich she\'d become post-Foggy Bottom. In "Our Dead Broke Leaders,"\nhe suggested that the Republican party could easily out-campaign this\nroyalist.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRepublicans, for a change, aren\xe2\x80\x99t saddled with the prospect of an\nout-of-touch insider as their presidential nominee. (Is it conceivable that\nno populist Democrat will see Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s glaring weaknesses and take\nher on?) The populist mantle, the reformist mantle, the Main Street and\nMiddle America mantles, are there for the Republican taking.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nTo be fair, perhaps the white, working, and middle-class Americans who\nsupported Hillary before do not technically live in middle America, or on\nMain Street. They might live on State Street, or Locust Street, or Electric\nAvenue. Thanks anyway to Debenedetti for coming up with the columns. It\'s\nnice when someone covers politics with consistency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Associated Press: APNewsBreak: \xe2\x80\x9cDifferent Attackers In Benghazi?\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://bigstory.ap.org/article/apnewsbreak-different-attackers-benghazi>*\n\n\n\nBy Donna Cassata and Bradley Klapper\n\nJuly 9, 2014, 7:53 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nNewly revealed testimony from top military commanders involved in the U.S.\nresponse to the Benghazi attacks suggests that the perpetrators of a\nsecond, dawn attack on a CIA complex probably were different from those who\npenetrated the U.S. diplomatic mission the evening before and set it\nablaze, killing Ambassador Chris Stevens and another American.\n\n\n\nThe second attack, which killed two security contractors, showed clear\nmilitary training, retired Gen. Carter Ham told Congress in closed-door\ntestimony released late Wednesday. The assault probably was the work of a\nnew team of militants, seizing on reports of violence at the diplomatic\nmission the night before and hitting the Americans while they were most\nvulnerable.\n\n\n\nThe testimony, which The Associated Press was able to read ahead of its\nrelease, could clarify for the first time the events of Sept. 11, 2012,\nthat have stirred bitter recriminations in the U.S., including\nRepublican-led congressional investigations and campaign-season\ndenunciations of the Obama administration, which made inaccurate statements\nabout the Libyan attacks. The testimony underscores a key detail that\nsometimes has been lost in the debate: that the attacks were two distinct\nevents over two days on two different buildings, perhaps by unrelated\ngroups.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. government still has not fully characterized the first attack in\nwhich, according to Ham and eight other military officers, men who seemed\nfamiliar with the lightly protected diplomatic compound breached it and set\nit on fire, killing Stevens and communications specialist Sean Smith. A\ndisorganized mob of looters then overran the facility.\n\n\n\nIn testimony to two House panels earlier this year, the officers said that\ncommanders didn\'t have the information they needed to understand the nature\nof the attack, that they were unaware of the extent of the U.S. presence in\nBenghazi at the time and they were convinced erroneously for a time that\nthey were facing a hostage crisis without the ability to move military\nassets into place that would be of any use.\n\n\n\nThe testimony reveals how little information the military had on which to\nbase an urgent response.\n\n\n\nTwo House panels \xe2\x80\x94 Armed Services and Oversight and Government Reform \xe2\x80\x94\nconducted interviews with the nine officers on separate days from January\nto April.\n\n\n\nFour Americans died in Benghazi, including Stevens. To this day, despite\nthe investigations, it\'s not clear if the violence resulted from a\nwell-planned, multiphase military-type assault or from a loosely connected,\nescalating chain of events.\n\n\n\nIn their testimony, military officials expressed some uncertainty about the\nfirst attack, describing protests and looting in an assault that lasted\nabout 45 minutes.\n\n\n\nThe military attache to the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli told Congress the first\nattack showed some advance planning. The Libyan police officer guarding the\ndiplomatic compound fled as it began.\n\n\n\nThe defense attache, whose name wasn\'t released, suggested the attackers\n"had something on the shelf" \xe2\x80\x94 an outline of a plan based on previously\nobtained information about the compound and its security measures, so they\nwere ready to strike when the opportunity arose.\n\n\n\n"They came in, and they had a sense of purpose, and I think it sometimes\ngets confused because you had looters and everyone else coming in," he\nsaid. "It was less than kind of full, thought-out, methodical."\n\n\n\nHam testified that the second attack, which killed security officers Tyrone\nWoods and Glen Doherty at the annex a mile from the diplomatic compound\nwhere the assault began the night before, showed clear military training.\nIt was probably the work of a new team of militants, taking advantage after\nreports of violence at the first site and American vulnerability.\n\n\n\n"Given the precision of the attack, it was a well-trained mortar crew, and\nin my estimation they probably had a well-trained observer," said Ham, who\nheaded the U.S. command in Africa. The second attack showed "a degree of\nsophistication and military training that is relatively unusual and\ncertainly, I think, indicates that this was not a pickup team. This was not\na couple of guys who just found a mortar someplace."\n\n\n\nHam said the nearly eight-hour time lapse between the two attacks also\nseemed significant. "If the team (that launched the second attack) was\nalready there, then why didn\'t they shoot sooner?" he asked.\n\n\n\n"I think it\'s reasonable that a team came from outside of Benghazi," he\nsaid of the second attack in testimony on April 9. Violent extremists saw\nan opportunity "and said, \'Let\'s get somebody there.\'" He also acknowledged\nthat the absence of American security personnel on the ground soon enough\nafter the first attack "allowed sufficient time for the second attack to be\norganized and conducted," he said.\n\n\n\nStevens had gone to Benghazi from the embassy in Tripoli to open a cultural\ncenter, State Department officials said.\n\n\n\nThe attacks came as President Barack Obama was in a close re-election\nbattle, campaigning in part on the contention that al-Qaida no longer posed\na significant threat to the United States and that, blending the economy\nand the fight against terrorism, General Motors was alive but "Osama bin\nLaden is dead." A terror attack on American assets could have damaged that\nargument.\n\n\n\nFive days after the attack, after feverish email exchanges about her\n"talking points" among national security staff members and their spokesmen,\nU.N. Ambassador Susan Rice linked the Benghazi attacks to protests in\nTunisia and Cairo over an anti-Islam video. Weeks later, U.S. officials\nretracted that account but never fully articulated a new one.\n\n\n\nRepublicans seized on the inaccuracies, contending that the Obama\nadministration was covering up a terror attack for political gain.\n\n\n\nSeveral congressional and independent investigations have faulted the State\nDepartment for inadequate security, but they have not provided a full\nreading of who was involved in the violence, what the motives were and how\nthey could pull off such a seemingly complicated, multipronged assault.\n\n\n\nPeople on both sides of the debate tend to link the two incidents as one\nattack.\n\n\n\nThe congressional testimony that distinguishes the attacks came from\nmilitary officials in Tripoli or, like Ham, coordinating the response in\nWashington. Most have never given a public account. But they agreed that\nconfusion reigned from the outset.\n\n\n\n"We\'re under attack," was the first report the military received from\nBenghazi. That message came from Stevens\' entourage to Tripoli in the late\nafternoon of Sept. 11. Word was relayed to the defense attache, who\nreported up the chain of command.\n\n\n\nThat report gave no indication about the size or intensity of the attack.\n\n\n\nThe defense attache testified that the assault on the diplomatic mission\nwas followed by a mob that complicated and confused the situation.\n\n\n\nHe said of the original attackers, "I don\'t think they were on the\nobjective, so to speak, longer than 45 minutes. They kind of got on, did\ntheir business, and left." For hours after that, he said, there were\nlooters and "people throwing stuff and you see the graffiti and things like\nthat."\n\n\n\nOnce the first attack ended around 10 p.m., the military moved to evacuate\nAmericans from Benghazi, while preparing for what it erroneously believed\nmight have been an emerging hostage situation involving Stevens.\n\n\n\nIn fact, Stevens died of smoke inhalation after the diplomatic post was set\non fire in the first attack.\n\n\n\nSeven-and-a-half hours later, at dawn, mortars crashed on a CIA compound\nthat had been unknown to top military commanders.\n\n\n\nThe military worked up a response on numerous fronts.\n\n\n\nAt one point, fewer than 10 U.S. military personnel in Libya were grappling\nwith the mortar and rocket-propelled grenade attack on Americans who had\ntaken cover at the CIA facility and, some 600 miles away, the evacuation of\nabout three dozen people from the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli by a convoy of\narmored vehicles.\n\n\n\nAn unarmed Predator drone conducting an operation nearby in eastern Libya\nhad been repositioned over Benghazi, yet offered limited assistance during\nthe nighttime and with no intelligence to guide it. A standby force\ntraining in Croatia was ordered to Sicily, while another farther afield was\nmobilized. Neither was nearly ready in time to intervene during the first\n45-minute attack and couldn\'t predict the quick mortar attack the next\nmorning. An anti-terrorism support team in Spain was deployed, though it,\ntoo, was hours away.\n\n\n\nAmerican reinforcements of a six-man security team, including two military\npersonnel, were held up at the Benghazi airport for hours by Libyan\nauthorities. Drone images and intelligence hadn\'t provided indications of a\nnew attack, but word eventually came from two special forces troops who had\nmade it to the annex and reported casualties from the dawn attack up the\nchain of command.\n\n\n\nIn Tripoli, military and embassy officials were evacuating the embassy\nthere and destroying computer hardware and sensitive information.\n\n\n\nThe administration last month apprehended its first suspect, Ahmed Abu\nKhattala, and brought him to the United States to stand trial on terrorism\ncharges.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department maintains in court documents that Abu Khattala was\ninvolved in both attacks, and it describes the first breach on the\ndiplomatic post as equally sophisticated. The government said a group of\nabout 20 men, armed with AK-47- rifles, handguns and rocket-propelled\ngrenade launchers, stormed the diplomatic facility in the first attack.\n\n\n\nAbu Khattala supervised the looting after Americans fled, the government\nsays, and then returned to the camp of the Islamist militant group Ansar\nal-Sharia, where the Justice Department says a large force began assembling\nfor the second attack.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department provided no supporting documentation for those\nconclusions. They also reflect the divisions among current and former\ngovernment officials about the two attacks.\n\n\n\nIn her book "Hard Choices," former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham\nClinton wrote that there were scores of attackers with different motives.\n"It is inaccurate to state that every single one of them was influenced by\nthis hateful video. It is equally inaccurate to state that none of them\nwere. Both assertions defy not only the evidence but logic as well."\n\n\n\nAbu Khattala\'s lawyer says the government has failed to show that he was\nconnected to either attack.\n\n\n\nHam, who happened to be in Washington that week, briefed Defense Secretary\nLeon Panetta and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey. They informed\nthe president.\n\n\n\nMany of the military officials said they didn\'t even know about the\ndiplomatic mission in Benghazi, let alone the CIA\'s clandestine\ninstallation nearby. Few knew of Stevens visiting the city that day. Given\nall of the confusion, Ham said there was one thing he clearly would have\ndone differently: "Advise the ambassador to not go to Benghazi."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*New York Post: Page Six: \xe2\x80\x9cSales figures for Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s book continue to\nplunge\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://pagesix.com/2014/07/09/sales-figures-for-hillarys-book-continue-to-plunge/>*\n\n\n\nBy Ian Mohr\n\nJuly 9, 2014, 10:36 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nSales of Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices\xe2\x80\x9d continued to plunge as new\nfigures were released Wednesday.\n\n\n\nAccording to Nielsen BookScan, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s book sold just 16,000 copies in\nits most recent week, down from 28,000 a week prior.

Andrew Cuomo has ventured beyond\nthe borders of New York state only a handful of times.\n\n\n\nIn coming months, that may change.\n\n\n\nAccording to people familiar with the plans, Mr. Cuomo\'s administration is\nweighing a travel schedule that would send the governor to locations\nincluding Israel and Puerto Rico, an itinerary that would mark the first\ntime he has left the country since he took office in 2011.\n\n\n\n"There are always discussions about trade and economic-development\nmissions," said Matt Wing, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo. "Nothing is planned."\n\n\n\nThe governor\'s international travel, the people familiar with the matter\nsaid, would be conducted for the ostensible purpose of attracting business\nto an economic-development program, Global NY. Mr. Cuomo launched that\ninitiative earlier this year to encourage export deals in foreign markets\nfor startup companies in the state\'s new tax-free zones. It also opens the\ntax-free zones to foreign companies interested in establishing a branch of\ntheir business in New York.\n\n\n\nTo that end, administration officials planning the trips in recent weeks\ninclude Special Counsel Linda Lacewell, Cuomo liaison for Jewish affairs\nDavid Lobl and officials from Empire State Development Corp., the state\nagency that runs the Global NY program.\n\n\n\nFor Mr. Cuomo, who is said to have national political aspirations, such\ntrips could boost his standing among other Democrats jockeying for the 2016\npresidential nomination. While Mr. Cuomo is likely to sit the race out if\nformer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton runs, he would be considered a\ntop contender if she decides against running.\n\n\n\nCurrent events could complicate or derail any potential ventures. In\nIsrael, tensions have flared in the wake of the kidnapping and killing last\nmonth of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, and the subsequent\nkilling of a Palestinian teenager.\n\n\n\nIn the weeks since, Israeli security forces have mounted a crackdown on\nHamas members, and Palestinian militants have stepped up rocket attacks\nagainst Israel.\n\n\n\nThus far, Mr. Cuomo has made a point of sticking close to his home state.\nSince his gubernatorial inauguration, he has traveled once to Puerto Rico,\nfor a political conference; twice to Washington, D.C.; twice to Los Angeles\nfor fundraisers; and once to Charlotte, N.C., for the 2012 Democratic\nNational Convention.\n\n\n\nMr. Cuomo has toyed with international trips in prior years, according to\npeople familiar with the matter. In late 2011, the administration\nconsidered sending the governor to destinations including China and Israel,\nand a similar plan resurfaced roughly two years ago.\n\n\n\nIt isn\'t clear why those trips never materialized, but Mr. Cuomo has touted\nhis infrequent travel outside the state as a measure of his commitment to\nthe cause of New York.\n\n\n\nInternational travel is common for ambitious governors, particularly to\nIsrael.\n\n\n\nIn the spring of 2012, Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie embarked\non a "Jersey to Jerusalem Trade Mission," where he visited the Western Wall\nand met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Rick Perry has visited the country several times,\nmost recently in the fall of 2013. In 1998, George W. Bush, then the\ngovernor of Texas, visited Israel with a group of other governors, two\nyears before he ran for president.\n\n\n\nMr. Cuomo, however, hasn\'t visited Israel since 2002, when he made two\ntrips there during his bid for the Democratic nomination for governor of\nNew York.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with the Jewish Week newspaper in September 2002, Mr. Cuomo\nspoke about his connection to the country.\n\n\n\n"I have a long relationship with Israel. I am a born-and-bred New Yorker. I\nwas raised in a community in Queens with Jewish people," he said in the\ninterview, which was published in 2010.\n\n\n\n"So I feel a connection, I feel a bond. It is something I would like to do\npersonally," he said of traveling to Israel, "and something I feel\nprofessionally the governor could do and should do."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Washington Free Beacon: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat They\xe2\x80\x99re Saying About the Hillary Tapes\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://freebeacon.com/politics/what-theyre-saying-about-the-hillary-tapes/>*\n\n\n\nBy David Rutz\n\nJuly 9, 2014, 3:05 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nMainstream media members have listened to the tapes uncovered by the\nWashington Free Beacon of Hillary Clinton laughingly discussing a child\nrapist she defended in the 1970s, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve come away rather troubled\nabout how they bode for her 2016 presidential prospects.\n\n\n\nBoth Morning Joe\xe2\x80\x98s Joe Scarborough and Huffington Post reporter Sam Stein\ncalled her comments \xe2\x80\x9cdisturbing,\xe2\x80\x9d with Scarborough\xe2\x80\x99s liberal co-host Mika\nBrzezinski adding there was a \xe2\x80\x9cbigger problem\xe2\x80\x9d there for Clinton.\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post\xe2\x80\x98s Karen Tumulty questioned the \xe2\x80\x9cswagger\xe2\x80\x9d and\n\xe2\x80\x9cdismissiveness\xe2\x80\x9d of Clinton regarding the emotionally sensitive issue on\nAndrea Mitchell Reports. On Hardball Tuesday, host Chris Matthews opened\nthe segment about the case coming back to \xe2\x80\x9chaunt\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton and wondered why\nshe would be laughing about it. Left-wing Salon\xe2\x80\x98s Joan Walsh even said she\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9csugarcoat\xe2\x80\x9d the tape that she admitted was not \xe2\x80\x9cfun\xe2\x80\x9d to listen to,\nand fellow MSNBC guest Michelle Bernard said they could be \xe2\x80\x9cvery\nproblematic\xe2\x80\x9d for Clinton.\n\n\n\nCNN\xe2\x80\x99s Brianna Keilar also stated Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s attitude was \xe2\x80\x9cbad politics\xe2\x80\x9d and\ncould serve to alienate young voters.\n\n\n\nOthers have seized on her recent remarks on the case to Mumsnet, where she\nclaimed to have been appointed by a local judge to the case and requested\nto be taken off it. However, in the Roy Reed interview uncovered by\nreporter Alana Goodman, Clinton said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe prosecutor called me a few years\nago, he said he had a guy who had been accused of rape, and the guy wanted\na woman lawyer. Would I do it as a favor for him?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon\xe2\x80\x98s Andrew Stiles noted the \xe2\x80\x9centire American media\nestablishment\xe2\x80\x9d could not be bothered with asking Clinton about the tapes\nfor more than three weeks after they were first published, leaving it to\nMumsnet, a British parenting website.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat she said last week does not appear to be truthful, does it?\xe2\x80\x9d\nScarborough asked on Morning Joe Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t serve her well,\xe2\x80\x9d reporter Mark Halperin replied.\n\n\n\nMSNBC\xe2\x80\x99s PoliticsNation host Al Sharpton said the tapes would put a dent\ninto Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s image as an advocate for women.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt clearly is not the kind of situation that she wants to have to defend,\nwhen you hear in your own voice taking lightly something that speaks to one\nof your core issues, and that is the value of women,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n*Sec.
