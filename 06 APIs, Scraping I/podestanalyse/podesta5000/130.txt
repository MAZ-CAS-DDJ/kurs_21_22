I've been\nenjoying watching the successes of the campaign and have been impressed\nwith HRC's performance, as always of course, as well as that of the\ncampaign team, and... I can't help but want to support the effort (as I\nmentioned in my early days of motherhood).\n\nThough I'd be excited and willing to quit my job and work on the campaign\nas soon as possible, I still have the limitations of being a new mom and\nhaving a young baby, which are not conducive to traditional campaign hours/\nlifestyle.  Do you think there may be roles where I could still add value\ngiven this, or any other way I can help the campaign (so frustrating\nfederal employees are not allowed to fundraise)?  If so, I'd love to have a\nconversation with you or whomever may be most appropriate.  If not, I fully\nunderstand, and please know that I'm rooting along with you all every step\nof the way!\n\nVery best,\n\nAshley\n"
