She throttled off the funny a little too early I think, they were hungry for more, but in the end it didn\'t matter.  Good on humor, good on a light nudge for accountability, and good on substance.\r\n\r\nShe had no plans to sit but wanted to see the Toner kids present.  She sat again after remarks and connected with most of the beat folks as Huma noted below along with Jonathan Martin, Betsy Fischer, Laura Meckler, and a few others.  The Carolyn Ryan conversation was awkward but appreciated by Carolyn.  She asked her a few questions about health care and the courts.  Was fine.\r\n\r\nThe best part is that HRC was squarely in the mindset of very glad she did it, and glad she stayed and mingled.  It was a good setting for it.\r\n\r\nA little griping about her not taking questions (Biden spoke last year and also did not take Qs), including Dan Balz jokingly offering to yield his time for her to take some questions during his remarks.  But I think it was fine, especially because it was truly what the family wanted.\r\n\r\nAll in a all and very good evening.\r\n\r\nNick\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Mar 23, 2015, at 9:29 PM, Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com<mailto:huma@hrcoffice.com>> wrote:\r\nWill let Nick and Dan give more color but it appears as though her speech was well-received by both guests and reporters in the room. They appreciated that she was funny and several people said they were impressed she addressed the elephant in the room and was self-deprecating. Andrea mitchell, laura meckler, jon allen, anne gearan, phil rucker, karen tumulty in unison agreed that she did the right thing and appreciated that she "acknowledged" that she has a problematic relationship with the press. Nick, hrc and I all had uncomfortable exchanges with Carolyn Ryan. Carl Hulse said some NYT staff was betting that she would cancel her appearance tonight.\r\nAlso, we noted at least one young tracker. And she was audio taped the entire mix and mingle by amy chozick who may as well have been sitting in her lap....\r\n'
