john.podesta@gmail.comb'Georgetown University Law Center is very pleased to host an exhibit of more than 50 photographs taken by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), L\x9264. The exhibit coincides with the 50th anniversary of his law school graduation and 40th anniversary of his Senate service.\n\n\nThe exhibit is now on display until October 19 on the second floor of the Hotung Building, located on the Georgetown Law campus at 550 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C.\n\n\n \x93Whether he\x92s looking over President Obama\x92s shoulder as the president signs the 2014 Farm Bill, capturing images of the Dalai Lama at Middlebury College, or leaning out from a rocky ledge to watch children fly kites in the skies of Turkey, the perspective is Leahy\x92s own,\x94 said Georgetown University Law Center Dean William M. Treanor. \x93With these photos, law students in the nation\x92s capital and citizens in Vermont will benefit from his unique perspective, witnessing historical events not only through the lens of a camera but filtered through his thoughtful, perspective and compassionate mind.\x94\n\n\nMore information is available here:\n\nhttp://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/press-releases/leahy-exhibit-at-georgetown-law.cfm\n\n\n\n'
