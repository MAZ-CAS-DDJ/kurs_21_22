However, in order to facilitate communications between you and the race you are strongly urged to download our expanded Credit Union Cherry Blossom App available for both iOS and Android devices. It can be downloaded from the iTunes App Store or Google Play by searching for \'CUCB\' or \'Credit Union Cherry Blossom.\' If you forget to print out and bring this confirmation email with you to packet pick-up at the National Building Museum, you can retrieve it from the App and avoid the number look-up lines.\n> \n> Now, on to your key registration information as it appears in our records.\n> \n> Bib: 6749 \n> Race: Ten Mile Run\n> \n> Gender: Male \n> Age: 67 \n> Shirt Type: Standard Cotton \n> Shirt Size: Unisex Medium (Cotton shirts are unisex) \n> Standard Finisher\'s Medal: No \n> Enhanced Finisher\'s Medal: No\n> \n> John Podesta \n> 3743 Brandywine St \n> Washington, DC 20016 \n> USA\n> \n> --- Please have the information above with you when picking up your number ---\n> \n> If any of the information above is incorrect, please send an email with a correction to info@cherryblossom.org. IMPORTANT: Please put in the "Subject" line of your email message what information you are correcting (i.e. AGE CORRECTION or ADDRESS CORRECTION, etc.). This will greatly facilitate our processing.\n> \n> Health and Fitness Expo and Packet Pick-up: Packet Pick-up will take place over two days at the National Building Museum (please note that there is no race day pick-up; no exceptions): Here is the information you will need to pick up your packet before the race.\n> \n> Packet pick-up will take place on the second floor of the Health and Fitness Expo on Friday, April 1 between 3:00 P.M. and 7:45 P.M. (Note new Friday hours) and Saturday, April 2 between 9:00 A.M. and 4:45 P.M. (sharp!) at the spectacular National Building Museum, 401 F St., NW, Washington, DC www.nbm.org/about-us. The National Building Museum is located directly opposite the Judiciary Square Metro stop on the Red Line. Metro use is strongly encouraged; parking is difficult to find and expensive! There is free bike valet parking on the west lawn (4th St. side) of the National Building Museum. There will be wine, beer and Cabot Cheese available at a special reception presented by the 201 bar in the expo hall at 5:00 P.M.. on Friday and lasting as long as the beer and wine hold up.\n> \n> There is no Sunday pick-up at the race site on the Washington Monument Grounds. No exceptions. Details about having someone else pick-up your number on Friday or Saturday appear below.\n> \n> We have two suggestions to minimize crowding at the National Building Museum. First, avoid trying to pick up your packet the moment packet pick-up opens on either Friday or Saturday. Last year, we had lines at the opening times which dissipated an hour later and never reformed. Second, we are asking you to pick up your packets based on the following schedule based on the first letter of your last name. We realize that your personal schedule may not allow this or you may be picking up with a group. However, if a decent percentage of entrants adhere to this schedule, it will ease the flow for everyone.\n> \n> Friday, April 1\t   \tSaturday, April 2\n> N-Z: 3:00 P.M. - 4:00 P.M.\t   \tN-Z: 9:00 A.M. - 11:00 A.M.\n> A-F: 4:00 P.M. - 5:00 P.M.\t   \tA-F: 11:00 A.M. - 1:00 P.M.\n> G-M: 5:00 P.M. - 6:00 P.M.\t   \tG-M: 1:00 P.M. - 3:00 P.M.\n> Open: 6:00 P.M. - 7:45 P.M. (sharp)\t   \tOpen: 3:00 P.M. - 4:45 P.M. (sharp)\n> You should bring this email with you to facilitate packet pick-up or download the free official Credit Union Cherry Blossom app for the iPhone, iPad or Android which will enable you to look you bib number up on your phone. If you do neither of these, you will need to go to the "Information Desk" in front of the fountain where volunteers will assist you in looking up your number. We will not have "Number Look-up" sheets posted on the wall.\n> \n> You may pick up another runner\'s packet as long as you have a note (an email is fine) from that runner or his or her copy of this confirmation email, plus an ID for yourself. You may need to sign a waiver stating that the number only will be used by the proper registrant and supply us with your email address. Violations of this policy will result in the registrant being banned from future races at the discretion of the organizing committee.\n> \n> Key Race Information Leading up to the Race and on Race Day Important information will appear on the event website and on the App.\n> \n> This will include the following:\n> Staging area and course map.

If we have leftovers (and we usually do), they will be available for purchase after the race on the website.\n> \n> Gear Check: Due to heightened security only items placed into the clear plastic bags given out at the Health and Fitness Expo on Friday and Saturday will be accepted at Gear Check on Sunday. No backpacks, gym bags or luggage can be left at the Gear Check tent.\n> \n> Clinics and a Line Up of Social Activities at the Health and Fitness Expo: There will be music, and beer (for those of sufficient age - one free beer for runners; $5 for others), and other non-alcoholic beverages (the popular Cherry Blossom Mocktail will return), courtesy of the 201 Bar, along with snacks from Cabot cheese on Friday evening between 5:00 P.M. and 7:30 P.M. (or as long as supplies last), so come and unwind after work on Friday. In addition, we have an exciting array of speakers lined up for our clinics on both Friday and Saturday. Here is the schedule:\n> \n> Friday\n> 3:00 P.M. - 5:00 P.M.\tMeet Meb Keflezighi: The four-time U.S. Olympian, 2004 Olympic silver medalist, and Boston and New York City Marathon winner will give a short clinic followed by plenty of time for autographs and photographs in the National Building Museum Auditorium.

Joan remains one of the top age group runners in the U.S. and will be chasing the U.S. women\'s age 55-59 10 mile record on Sunday.\n> 3:00 P.M. - 4:00 P.M.\tJoan Benoit Samuelson will also be signing autographs at the Credit Union booth from 3:00 - 4:00 P.M.\n> Run for Children in Need of World Class Medical Care: It is not too late for confirmed race entrants to become Individual Online Fundraisers (or to continue your on-going fundraising efforts). New fundraisers can go to the Children\'s Miracle Network Fundraising site www.helpmakemiracles.org/?fuseaction=donorDrive.event&eventID=2185 and register as an "Individual Fundraiser." You will be able to set up your own fundraising webpage which you can forward to family members and friends to invite them to support both you and Children\'s Miracle Network in either the 10 mile run or the 5K Run-Walk.\n> \n> Consider the following: Every day is filled with decisions. Few are between life and death. As a fundraiser in support of Children\'s Miracle Network Hospitals and the Credit Union Cherry Blossom Ten Mile Run you have an opportunity to say "yes" to life for thousands of sick and injured children.\n> \n> Asking your friends and family to support you in the run can be a struggle. But as you ask, remember all the children who struggle with challenges far beyond anything we can imagine. There are children who are told "no" every day -- "No, your blood counts are still too low." "No, you\'re too sick to go outside and play today."\n> \n> On behalf of the kids:\n> \n> Log into your fundraising page now\n> And please "Ask"\n> For more information or questions, please email us at lsmith@cmnhospitals.org.\n> \n> Thanks for saying "yes" to the kids!\n> \n> Since becoming the title sponsor of the race in 2002, credit unions, business partners, and runners, have donated over $7.5 million to Children\'s Miracle Network Hospitals.\n> \n> Follow Our Fundraising initiative on Social Media\n> \n> "Friend" our Fundraising Facebook Page at facebook.com/CreditUnionCherryBlossom\n> and Sign Up for Our Twitter Feeds: \n> twitter.com/CUCB\n> Watch Your Email Inbox for Our Virtual Goodie Bag! We will be emailing everyone our "Virtual Goodie Bag" around March 25. This environmentally-friendly electronic "goodie bag" replaces the usual clutter which lies in the bottom of the old fashioned goodie bag with dozens of clickable electronic coupons, information and offers for our sponsors and other vendors. However, we will still be distributing clear plastic bags at packet pick-up which must be used for bag check on race day.\n> \n> Sustainability News: We received Gold Certification in 2015 as an environmentally-friendly event from the Council for Responsible Sport. We will keep up our efforts this year. A key area of focus will be waste diversion, which means we want to prevent as much of the 8 to 10 tons of waste generated as possible from being sent to a landfill. Our goal in 2016 is to recycle, compost and donate at least 75% of the waste generated. With your help, we can do it! Almost everything you receive on race morning, including heat sheets, can be recycled or composted. We\'ll make it easy to do so. Even clothing discarded at the start line will be collected and donated. You will hear more about sustainability, and how you can help, over the coming months and at the expo. For more information about our efforts, visit: www.cherryblossom.org/aboutus/environment.php\n> \n> Use Metro to Travel to the Race Site: Metro will open at 5:00 A.M. on race day. The staging area is 1/4 mile from the Smithsonian Metro stop.\n> \n> Getting to the Race by Bicycle: As part of our sustainability initiative and thanks to Two Wheel Valet we have upgraded our free Bike Valet parking this year. Simply ride your bike to the race site and leave it with us. We will guard your bike to ensure it is safe while you run. No backpacks may be left with your bike. Bikes must be removed by 12 noon on race day. Details at www.cherryblossom.org/generalinfo/gettingtorace.php#bike.\n> \n> Important Information about Time Limits in the 10 Mile: In order to balance the interests of tourists in town for cherry blossom season and the participants in the race, we need to close the 10-mile course promptly at 10:30 A.M.. Runners who are not maintaining a 14-minute per mile pace or faster will have to leave the course at the 5-mile mark (located about 1/4 mile from the start-finish line). Runners who fall behind the 14-minute per mile pace during the second half of the race will need to board our sweep bus and be driven to the finish line.  www.cherryblossom.org/theraces/attherace.php#limits\n> \n> Don\'t Want the Pressure? Switch to the 5K Run-Walk (Don\'t worry, your 10 mile number will work in the 5K Run-Walk): If you don\'t think you will be maintaining a 14-minute per mile pace, you can run or walk the 5K Run-Walk instead. We would prefer to have you go to the website, www.cherryblossom.org/theraces/switch_form.php and complete a "5K Run-Walk Switch" form so we will know what race you are in. However, if you decide to switch on race day, you can simply line up at the 5K Run-Walk start. Please be aware that you will be running the 5K Run-Walk with your 10-mile bib number and that is OK. We will not reissue you a 5K bib number. Your "BibTag" will be "read" by the MyLaps Bib system and you will be scored in whichever race you actually run.\n> \n> Volunteers Still Needed for Sunday Duties: Ask a family member or friend to volunteer on Sunday at the race site. He or she will earn a guaranteed entry into the 2017 race which is transferable (to you or anyone else). So the best way to ensure you are exempt from the lottery next fall is to have a non-running friend volunteer, cheer you on and help you avoid the lottery for 2017. www.cherryblossom.org/generalinfo/volunteer.php\n> \n> Go gently on your training these last two weeks. I know if you are a participant in our Virtual Training program that Coach Kirt West is rounding you into shape to meet your race goal. Although your training is nearly over, you can still prepare for your hydration needs by using Gatorade Endurance Formula between now and race day. It is what will be served at the aid stations on the course.\n> \n> We send our best wishes for personal best times for everyone. It looks like the blossoms will be out!\n> \n> Sincerely, \n> The Credit Union Cherry Blossom Organizing Committee\n> \n> P.S. Remember, to speed up the packet pick-up process, bring this confirmation email with you to the National Building Museum (or have the App on your phone) on Friday or Saturday and remember that there is no packet pick-up on the Washington Monument Grounds on Sunday.\n> \n> Thanks To Our Sponsors:\n>      \n>  \n>   \n>   \n>   \n'
