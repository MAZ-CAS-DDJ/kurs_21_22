This will get only worse and not bode well for her as time goes on.\r\n\r\nShe desperately needs the people on her side. And, although it\'s early, the imprinting process has begun... And, I don\'t like how it feels.\r\n\r\nHer inner circle and the powers to be, need to reject the status quo, and understand how brands (and she is a brand) in the world we now live in are built. It requires a vision for the future that is steeped in truth and authenticity and builds an enduring emotional connection with the voters.\r\n\r\nThe rules of engagement for running for President have dramatically changed, accept it.\r\nSubstance absolutely matters, but so does the form it takes. The campaign feels "yesterday." It\'s too packaged and prescribed. The American people are longing for truth and someone to believe in.\r\n\r\nReboot the look of it all and the overriding message before its to late. The answer is not in the polls, it\'s in her heart and her conscience. When she begins to truly trust herself and find her inner voice, and has the courage and conviction to share it with the world, things will change and change rapidly.\r\n\r\nEncourage her to be herself. And, to embrace her core purpose and reason for being. That\'s the lens it all needs to go through.\r\nIt\'s not politics as usual. Especially as it relates to technology and social media, but that\'s a whole another story.\r\n\r\nI\'m not a politician and certainly not a pollster. Just one person with one vote, who cares deeply about the country and the dire need for authentic leadership.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nHoward\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'
