john.podesta@gmail.comb"John,\n\nYesterday, we let you know about an ad from national Tea Party Republicans vilifying me and misrepresenting my record.\xa0 Today, I responded with an ad of my own.\n\nOur commercial puts a face to the thousands of families who are sick of Congresswoman Hayworth putting Tea Party values ahead of their own. She has resorted to deceit and distortion to hide her Tea Party votes to end Medicare and defund Planned Parenthood. My commercial exposes her and shows that I will fight for the middle class.\n\nBut I need your help right away to make sure voters keep seeing it. To buy another week of airtime, we need to raise $25,000 in grassroots donations by Tuesday. If we don't, the Tea Party attacks will go totally unanswered. That could swing this election in their favor. We need to fight back today.\n\nDonate $35 - or whatever you can - now to help me keep my ad on the air.\n\nhttps://services.myngp.com/ngponlineservices/contribution.aspx?X=v0BJouSVA84rq1cJ0IOB1SS7araOO8Xg4162LJPGlg8%3d\n\nWhen voters hear the truth about me and my opponent, we win.\xa0 That's why my campaign needs to place our next ad buy on Tuesday, and we need $25,000 to do it. Time is running out. If we're going to stop the Tea Party once and for all, now is the time to act.\n\nCan you donate today to help us meet that goal and ensure victory in November?\n\nhttps://services.myngp.com/ngponlineservices/contribution.aspx?X=v0BJouSVA84rq1cJ0IOB1SS7araOO8Xg4162LJPGlg8%3d\n\nThank you for your support.\xa0 Together, we can defeat the Tea Party in the Hudson Valley.\n\nSean \n\nPaid for by Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n\nSean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n18 West Main St\nBeacon, NY 12508\n\nTo unsubscribe from this mailing list, click here - http://images.myngp.com/unsubscribe.aspx?crypt=Casv%2frrJxGAq9DTl%2f1OHiP%2bAWwwyVVvAuFm1lEpc1bg%3d\n\nPowered by NGP VAN, Inc.\n\n"
