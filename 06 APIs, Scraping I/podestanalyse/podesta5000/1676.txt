Connecticut anniversary, NARAL Pro-Choice\nAmerica says McCain\'s anti-choice record includes opposition to birth\ncontrol\n\n \n\nWashington, DC - On June 7, anti-choice activists around the country\nwill protest the historic Supreme Court ruling that held that the right\nto privacy includes the right to birth control - showing just how far\nout of the mainstream their agenda really is.  While the majority of\nAmericans support the use of birth control to prevent unintended\npregnancy, John McCain has actually voted to block women\'s access to\nbirth control.  Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America,\nsaid that voters should question the myth of the moderate maverick that\nthe McCain campaign is selling.\n\n"Forty-two years ago, the United State Supreme Court ruled in Griswold\nv. Connecticut that the right to privacy includes the right to birth\ncontrol, yet American women are still facing attacks on their freedom\nand privacy from every level, including the White House," Keenan said.\n"Many Americans may be unaware that it\'s not just a fringe group of\nactivists who oppose birth control. Seemingly \'mainstream\' anti-choice\npoliticians like John McCain are consistently bowing to the pressure of\ntheir far-right base and moving an agenda that is out-of-touch with the\nAmerican public."\n\nJohn McCain has, in fact, voted at least 22 times against women\'s access\nto family-planning services, including birth control.  \n\n"During his twenty-five years in office, Sen. McCain has consistently\nvoted to block low-income women\'s access to birth control, to deny our\nteens accurate information about birth control and condoms, to stop\nmeasures that would require insurance companies to cover birth control,\nand to prevent funds to an organization that provides family-planning\nservices - not abortion - for the world\'s poorest women. Voters need to\nknow that John McCain is not only against abortion, he is against birth\ncontrol."\n\nOn June 7, 1965, by a vote of 7-2, in Griswold v. Connecticut, the\nSupreme Court struck down a Connecticut law that prohibited the use of\ncontraceptives, holding the statute violated the constitutional right to\nmarital privacy. This decision is cited as fundamental to privacy\nrights, but today, the right to use birth control is under increasing\nattack from extreme anti-choice activists and pressure groups. This\nweekend, the American Life League, an anti-choice, anti-birth control\ngroup, is launching "Protest the Pill Day \'08: The Pill Kills Babies."\n\nTo learn more about John McCain\'s full anti-choice record, including a\nsection on his votes against access to family-planning services, please\nvisit: \nhttp://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/files/mccain_fact_sheet.pdf.\n\n \n\nContact: Kathryn Prael, 202-973-3032\n\n \n\n###\n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
