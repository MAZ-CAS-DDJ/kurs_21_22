We will circle up on all the outreach to folks and keep you in the loop.  If you're good, we can reach out to Congresswoman Jackson Lee's COS to see if they have a Texas Southern event.\n\nOn Tue, Apr 7, 2015 at 11:54 AM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>> wrote:\nFormer Army Secretary Louis Caldera, who was a former California State Sen and head of the White House Military Office in early Obama years (did the plane ride across Statue of Liberty with AF1), is anxious to help out.  Willing to do Veterans work as well as work with the Latino community.  He's free and has a lot of time, living in Maryland, but his political base is in California.\n\nSheila Jackson Lee is stalking me.  In addition to wanting to be invovled in eveyrthing, she specifically asked me about whether Hillary would accept the Barbara Jordan Medallion for Service at Texas Southern University.\n\nAmb. Luis Lauredo, former Amb. to OAS under President Clinton, lives in Argentina but he is willing to spend a lot of time back in the states. He is happy to help particularly in Florida.  I think he's mostly a Dennis contact, but wants to do Spanish Language Media--he's been a Spanish/English surrogate for HRC in '08 and Obama in '12.\n\nCongressman Jim McGovern, in Mass, is willing to do anything to help, including organizing his constituents to go to New Hampshire.\nRuth Goldway, who is an old friend of the Clintons, is a member of the Postal Regulatory Commission. Desperately wants in, and offered to organize support amongst postal unions and postal companies.  She's a federal appointee, but she's holding over in a term is that is expired and will be leaving this summer.  Her bio is attached.\n\nHelga Flores Trejo is a senior executive at the Inter-American Development Bank in charge of Brazil.  Used to run Heinrich Boell Foundation in Washington, which is the foundation of the German Green Party.  Has considerable electoral experience but mostly in Europe.  Helga grew up in Mexico and has worked in the US for the past 10 or 15 years. She has excellent executive and communication skills in both English and Spanish--wants to work on the campaign.  I have no idea whether you can use her someplace, but her resume is attached.\n\n"
