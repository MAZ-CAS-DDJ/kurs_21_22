Marco Rubio <http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/marco-rubio.htm>\'s\nforeign-policy platform has a theme: undoing some of President Obama\'s\nbiggest decisions.\n\nThat would include reopening the military prison at Guantanamo\n<http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/iraq/guantanamo.htm> Bay, Cuba\n<http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/cuba.htm>, if Obama succeeds in closing\nit as the president promised at the outset of his first term in the White\nHouse <http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/white-house.htm>.\n\n"Absolutely," the Florida\n<http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/florida.htm> Republican\nsaid when asked whether he would reopen the prison in an exclusive\ninterview with ABC\'s George Stephanopoulos, his first as a presidential\ncandidate.\n\nMarco Rubio Running For President in 2016: \'I Can Lead This Country\'\n(EXCLUSIVE)\n<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/marco-rubio-running-president-2016-lead-country-exclusive/story?id=30271315>\n\nMeet Marco Rubio: Everything You Need to Know (And Probably Didn\xe2\x80\x99t Know)\nAbout the Prospective 2016 Presidential Candidate\n<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/meet-marco-rubio-didnt-2016-presidential-candidate/story?id=30236906>\n\nWhere They Stand: Marco Rubio on Key Issues of 2016 Campaign\n<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/stand-marco-rubio-key-issues-2016-campaign-30281057>\n\n"Here\'s why," Rubio continued. "We no longer, on an ongoing basis, detain\nterrorists <http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/terrorism.htm>, and so\nwe\'re not getting interrogation. They\'re killed by a drone, or they\'re\ntargeted in some other way, but there\'s tremendous value in capturing\npeople that are enemy combatants and, from them, being able to gather\nactionable intelligence that can not only prevent attacks against the\nhomeland and abroad, but allow us to disrupt their cells that they\'ve\ncreated in different parts of the world."\n\nRubio, who publicly announced his 2016 run for president in the exclusive\nABC interview, had previously supported keeping the prison open. Home to\nmilitary detainees from the U.S. "GlobalWar on Terror\n<http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/iraq/war-on-terror.htm>" from the George\nW. Bush <http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/george-bush.htm> presidency,\nObama has sought to transfer detainees out of the prison but has struggled\nto close it despite his pledge to do so.\n\nRubio also vowed to reverse course on Obama\'s recent diplomatic endeavors\nwith Iran <http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/iran.htm>, with which the\nUnited States is working to finalize a nuclear pact, and Cuba, with which\nObama has opened diplomatic relations.\n\n"I think from a national-security perspective, this deal with Iran is an\nextremely dangerous one," Rubio said when asked what he would do on his\nfirst day as president. "I think the next president of the United States is\ngoing to have to deal with that on day number one."\n\nOf the diplomatic opening with Cuba, Rubio said, "I would reverse every\nsingle one of the decisions that [Obama] made."\n\n-- \n*Ian Sams* | Rapid Response Associate\nHillary for America\n(423) 915-6592 | @IanSams <https://twitter.com/iansams>\nGchat: icsams\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "HRCRapid" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.\nTo view this discussion on the web visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/hrcrapid/CABd81J%2BFLX5C%2B7WsWm8tTOuveCG3-OLVjFuBy_Q4gtkdCoEBaQ%40mail.gmail.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n'
