Thanks!\n\nOn Tue, Sep 15, 2015 at 6:02 AM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n> good talk. He appreciated the call. He's a big supporter, but has a\n> serious Bernie faction, so said he has some work to do. He'll participate\n> in tele town hall. Thinks she needs to be clear that she will be a break\n> from Obama, or more importantly, Duncan policy.\n> Ann, he has a big meeting after the early October endorsement\n> schedule--800 teacher activists. Thinks it might be good if you go even\n> with the endorsement to keep them calm and, happy and energized with a good\n> policy discussion. If someone can get me his email, I'll put you two in\n> touch.\n>\n\n\n\n-- \nAnn O'Leary\nSenior Policy Advisor\nHillary for America\nCell: 510-717-5518\n"
