If we don\'t convince Boehner to bring up this bill, 70,000 more Americans are going to lose their unemployment insurance this week... and more next week... and the week after that. \n\nUnemployment insurance is a critical investment in our economy, in the Hudson Valley and across the country. I need you to stand with me and demand Congress get it going again. \n\nClick here to add your name: http://signforgood.com/extendui/?code=SPM-2\n\nThanks,\n\n- Sean \n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Sean Patrick Maloney\nDate: Wed, Apr 23, 2014\nSubject: Demand Congress Restore Unemployment Insurance Now!\n\nFriends, this is serious. \n\nSeventy Thousand. That is how many Americans lose their unemployment benefits every week. And this has been going on since emergency unemployment insurance expired in December!\n\nI think this is an outrage. My opponent, on the other hand, voted to cut off people\'s unemployment insurance. In fact, she voted to rip away unemployment insurance even earlier. The Albany Times Union actually called her out by name for being "so smug" while voting to deny hard-hit families this essential lifeline!\n\nThe total has already topped 2 million, including over 178,000 New Yorkers. We can\'t let it get any higher. Click here to demand Congress extend unemployment insurance now.\n\nhttp://signforgood.com/extendui/?code=SPM-2\n\nAfter months of deadlock, the Senate finally passed a bipartisan bill that will restore essential benefits to American families - but Boehner won\'t even bring it to the House floor! \n\nWe can\'t sit by while our friends and neighbors suffer. It\'s time to let Boehner and the House Republicans know that Americans are watching and that we need action now. \n\nClick here to call for the immediate restoration of unemployment benefits, and help show Boehner that we mean business!\n\nhttp://signforgood.com/extendui/?code=SPM-2\n\nJohn. I know I can count on you.
