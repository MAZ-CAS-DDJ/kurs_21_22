john.podesta@gmail.comb'Is anyone giving the name of the reporters? We need that. Does Nides have specific information?\r\nI briefed McKenna and he talked to PIR and Craig as they all got the email from the Wash Post yesterday. BTW - all thought reaction would be "so what".\r\nAll were suspicious of where this is coming from.\r\nI\'ll work on getting the language.\r\n\r\nFrom: Cheryl Mills [mailto:cheryl.mills@gmail.com]\r\nSent: Sunday, February 09, 2014 08:29 AM\r\nTo: Tina Flournoy; Bruce Lindsey <BruceRLindsey@aol.com>; John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>\r\nSubject: Had several calls\r\n\r\nlatest from Tom N saying reporters calling around\r\n\r\nI feel like this is being stirred consciously now\r\n\r\nif he knows reporters are calling around, cnn knows reporters are calling around.\r\n\r\nwe should try to do language today\r\n'
