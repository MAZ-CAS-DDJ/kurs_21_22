Netanyahu declared he has not given up on peace with the Palestinians, while Obama stressed that Israel\'s security is one of his top foreign policy priorities. Speaking to reporters ahead of their private meeting, Obama said he would seek Netanyahu\'s thoughts on ways to lower tensions between Israelis and Palestinians and get the parties "back on a path towards peace." "I want to be very clear that we condemn in the strongest terms Palestinian violence against innocent Israeli citizens. And I want to repeat, once again, it is my strong belief that Israel has not just the right, but the obligation to protect itself," Obama said. "I want to make it clear we haven\'t given up on our hope for peace," Netanyahu told Obama, stressing he supports a two-state solution, with a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the Jewish state.\n\n\n** Times of Israel\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n** White House Says PM\xe2\x80\x99s Comments \xe2\x80\x98Encouraging\xe2\x80\x99 (http://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-november-9-2015/)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhite House Spokesman Josh Earnest said Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s comments were \xe2\x80\x9cencouraging, but what matters is the follow through.\xe2\x80\x9d He said Israel and the Palestinians must take a series of confidence-building measures, including a \xe2\x80\x9creduction, if not an end\xe2\x80\x9d to the violence and the incitement and \xe2\x80\x9ca willingness on both sides to engage constructively.\xe2\x80\x9d In addition, Earnest said that settlement construction is \xe2\x80\x9ccounterproductive.\xe2\x80\x9d The White House spokesman added it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that a peace deal \xe2\x80\x94 or peace talks at all \xe2\x80\x94 will be renewed in the last 4 months of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s term.\nSee also: \xe2\x80\x9cTop Obama Adviser: Israel to Face Growing Pressure Over Settlements, Peace Process Impasse\xe2\x80\x9d (http://www.haaretz.com/peace/.premium-1.684915)  (Ha\xe2\x80\x99aretz) (http://www.haaretz.com/peace/.premium-1.684915)\n\n\n** Ha\'aretz\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n** At Least Four Killed by Gunman at Jordan Training Center (http://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/1.685001)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA Jordanian officer shot dead two U.S. government security contractors, a South African trainer and a Jordanian translator at a U.S.-funded police training facility near Amman on Monday before being killed in a shootout, authorities said.

The hacker group - dubbed "Rocket Kitten" by security experts who have been hunting the outfit since early 2014 - has mounted cyberattacks on high-profile political and military figures globally since that time, according to researchers from several cyber security firms who have monitored its activities. The action could hamper Tehran\'s efforts to gather sensitive intelligence from rivals including Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United States which were among the nations targeted. "We have discovered the inner workings of a cyber espionage campaign," Shahar Tal, research group manager for US-Israeli security firm Check Point Software, told Reuters.\n\n\n** Jerusalem Post\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n** Zoabi: What is Happening in Israel is Worse than Germany (http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Zoabi-doubles-down-to-Post-What-is-happening-in-Israel-is-even-more-dangerous-than-Germany-432500)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCoalition MKs blasted Joint List Mk Haneen Zoabi (Balad) on Monday after she compared Israelis to Nazis at a Kristallnacht commemoration event in Amsterdam on Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cKristallnacht didn\xe2\x80\x99t suddenly fall from the sky, come out of nowhere,  it was the result of a development over time. We can see a similar development happening in Israel over the last several years,\xe2\x80\x9d Zoabi said Sunday afternoon. Zoabi\xe2\x80\x99s appearance was organized by Platform Stop Racism and Exclusion, a far-left group that is shunned by local Jews for its members\xe2\x80\x99 perceived animosity toward Israel and sympathy for Hamas. About 200 people attended the event. In response to the speech, Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely responded saying her appearance at an event commemorating Kristallnacht was a \xe2\x80\x9cmockery.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHaneen Zoabi uses the tragedy of the Jewish people in order to spread her lies and slander, while she herself encourages terrorism and the murder of Jews."\n\n\n** Channel 2 News\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n** Ya\xe2\x80\x99alon: High Probability that a Bomb Caused the Plane Crash (http://www.jerusalemonline.com/news/middle-east/israel-and-the-middle-east/yaalon-high-probability-that-a-bomb-caused-the-plane-crash-17023)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe investigation of the Metro-Jet plane crash in the Sinai Peninsula continues to occupy the Defense and Intelligence agencies around the world. In a briefing to reporters on Monday, Defense Minister Moshe (Bogi) Ya\xe2\x80\x99alon estimated that an explosive device caused the crash. \xe2\x80\x9cWe understand that there is very high probability that it was an attack,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ya\xe2\x80\x99alon. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not part of the investigation, but it seems we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about an explosive device which exploded inside the airplane.\xe2\x80\x9d At the same time Ya\xe2\x80\x99alon refused to comment on the CNN report according to which Israeli Intelligence is the source of the information that ISIS planted the bomb in the plane. Israel is concerned about the success of the ISIS branch in Sinai to carry out an attack of this magnitude, indicating high operational skills. This is a prestigious attack which may be followed by a transfer of a large sum of money and weapons from the ISIS leadership in Iraq. In recent days, since the plane crash, the\nEgyptian army has launched a significant assault on ISIS terrorists in northern Sinai.\n\n\n** Yedioth Ahronoth \xe2\x80\x93 November 9, 2015\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n** Obama and Netanyahu Will Talk, but Won\'t Say Anything\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe prime minister has embarked on a trip to Washington in order to meet with the American president, however the meeting will amount to nothing due to their non-existent relationship.\n\nBy Nahum Barnea\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu departed for Washington on Sunday afternoon, and is set to meet with President Barack Obama at the White House on Monday. It will most likely be a business-like meeting: Obama will likely pay off the debt of promises he made to Democratic senators in exchange for their votes to approve the Iran deal; this debt includes advanced military equipment for Israel, and maybe even some funds. But nothing more \xe2\x80\x93 no defense pacts, no guarantees.\n\nNetanyahu held up his end of the deal: He promised the White House that his speech against the Iran deal at the UN General Assembly meeting would be his last on the matter; and he has kept his word. The threats to urge Republicans in Congress to enact new sanctions have all but disappeared, as if they were never uttered.\n\nNetanyahu is convinced that Obama is a disaster for America, and an enemy of Israel; Obama is convinced that Netanyahu is a pathological liar, and a disaster for Israel. Nothing they will say in public will change that reality.\n\nIn a meeting between leaders, after the cameras have been shooed out of the room, a sense of intimacy normally takes hold. Most politicians have similar domestic problems: They can vent about them to each other. They can maintain eye contact. President Bush once said that he learned the nature of a leader by looking into their eyes. He looked into Putin\'s eyes and believed him. There is no chance that Obama will experience this sense of intimacy in his meeting with Netanyahu. Regardless, they have things to discuss.\n\nFor example, the issue of Jordan. The Americans know of the tear between Netanyahu and King Abdullah, and they are concerned with its possible outcome. The king has refused Netanyahu\'s calls and has leveled some serious criticism against him. The reason for this has been the recent tensions over the Temple Mount. The Temple Mount is Jordan\'s last true outpost in the territories. The Muslim world tasked the King of Jordan with safeguarding the holy sites. The government of Jordan pays the salaries of the Islamic waqf\'s workers, and influences their actions.\n\nAt the height of the clashes on the Temple Mount, Netanyahu agreed that Jordan would be responsible for security cameras that will be placed at every corner of the Temple Mount. The government of Jordan\'s announcement of the deal was supposed to make Amman appear as an active party in all happenings in the West Bank, while beating back domestic criticism over its peace with Israel.\n\nRight wing officials in Israel protested Netanyahu\'s compromise. Why would Israel agree to weaken its hold on the Temple Mount? It would be a surrender to the forces of terror. Why Jordan? Netanyahu reneged.\n\nThe king was then seen as a liar and collaborator. The anger was great. Under pressure, Netanyahu backtracked on rejecting the deal. Now he is ready to approve the deal, while leaving the details up for negotiation, hoping that the issue will be all but forgotten by the time the negotiations convene. He would be all too happy to have Obama or Kerry mend his ties with Abdullah.\n\nThe two could discuss the Palestinian issue. Obama will say that he whole-heartedly supports Israel\'s right to defend itself, but asks himself what will happen the day after. Does Israel have anything to offer? Netanyahu will talk about terrorism, incitement, and Abbas\' inciting speeches. In light of that, he will say that he is ready to renew peace talks without preconditions, anywhere, even tomorrow. Obama will smile: He has already heard this speech time and again. He is convinced that Netanyahu\'s version of negotiations only serves the purpose of playing for time.\n\nObama will then say that Kerry had convinced Abbas to hold off on any diplomatic steps until Netanyahu\'s visit to Washington. What can Kerry say to him now?\n\nNetanyahu will repeat his tired speech. Negotiations, at any time, even tomorrow. "I even froze settlement construction," he will add. "Sadly, that\xe2\x80\x99s just not enough anymore," Obama will say.\n\n"Will the US veto the resolution that New Zealand plans to put to a vote at the Security Council?" Netanyahu will ask. Any resolution that talks about 1967 borders will complicate the situation. It\'s doubtful that Obama will commit to anything. He would prefer to let Netanyahu sweat a bit.\n\n"What do you think about the state of the Palestinian Authority?" Obama will ask. If they still had any trust between them, Netanyahu would tell Obama that officials within the Israeli defense establishment have grown frustrated with the Authority, and place their trust on Hamas. Hamas is popular today, both in the West Bank and Gaza. The Palestinian Authority is seen as a weakened and corrupt actor, which does not care for the good of the Palestinian people. The future belongs to Hamas. All the better that Hamas is less effective against Israel within the international organizations. Netanyahu will almost surely be content with raising objections to Abbas\' speech.\n\nThey could talk about Syria and Hezbollah, or ISIS. They will talk, but they won\'t really say anything. "It was a good meeting," the White House spokesman will say to the media. "The two discussed all the issues on the agenda." "Excellent meeting," Netanyahu will say.\n\n\n\n\n** Ynet News\xe2\x80\x93 November 9, 2015\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n** Amos Oz, BDS\'s Man of the Year (http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4722997,00.html)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt\'s okay to criticize the government in a way which can be accepted by most Israelis, but when this \'criticism\' is mainly used by the campaign for Israel\'s destruction - you become part of it.\n\nBy Ben Dror Yemini\n\nAmos Oz will win the BDS campaign\'s man of the year award. It\'s strange, because the Israeli author is against the BDS movement. But he recently announced that he would boycott state-sponsored events around the world.\n\nThere is nothing original about this move. Oz is joining a new trend of a small and noisy minority among US Jews: We love Israel, we are Zionist, but we are basically joining the boycott against Israel. It\'s true that the leaders of the boycott campaign are against peace, it\'s true that they are against two states, it\'s true that they object to the actual existence of the State of Israel, it\xe2\x80\x99s true that they mainly identify with Hamas - but does that really matter? Intellectuals, as much as others, must join trends. Now Oz is one of them, and it\'s sad.\n\nIt\'s sad because the Zionist Oz - an Israel lover, not an Israel hater - symbolizes the tragedy of the Israeli Zionist left.\n\nDuring Operation Protective Edge, Oz made sensible comments which angered the radical left. Oz delivered two important lectures this year and combined them into one article, in which he laments what we are going through. He does not share the left\'s illusions on the Palestinians. He does not disregard the right\'s fears over what will happen here if there is an agreement. And he reaches the conclusion that there is no escape from pursuing an agreement and a separation. For our sake, he argues, for our sake. It\xe2\x80\x99s a national interest. I support almost every sentence in the article. Occasionally, maybe not as often as I should, I write it myself.\n\nAnd this is where the tragedy lies: Because the voice is Jacob\'s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. You can\xe2\x80\x99t make rebuking comments of a loving person, which can be accepted by most Israelis, including a large part of right-wing voters, and at the same time join Israel haters\' operation pattern.\n\nAnd that\'s the exact story of a large part of the Israeli left: It\'s okay to criticize the government. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay to warn of wrongs. It\'s okay to equip hundreds of Palestinians with cameras, so that once in a few months someone will be able to catch a soldier beating or cursing a Palestinian. But when this "criticism" is mainly used by the campaign for Israel\'s destruction - you become part of it.\n\nWorse: The Palestinians have repeatedly turned down serious offers for an agreement, but instead of condemning them you have excused and justified them. You are not bringing the reconciliation closer. You are turning Israel into a monster. And if Israel is a monster, then BDS is the right answer.\n\nNow it\'s Oz. He loves Israel but is basically supporting BDS. What will intellectuals invited to cultural events at an Israeli embassy say? Like Oz, they love Israel, but are critical towards it. If one of the most important writers in Israel boycotts the embassy, why should they act any differently? They too will explain their move in the important newspapers. And the explanation, as we know, will be based on the publications of the propaganda of lies, which are turning Israel into a fascist and criminal state.\n\nIt\'s true that NATO, UN, British and US soldiers have hurt civilians in conflict areas, in a relative and absolute manner, much more than IDF soldiers have hurt the Palestinians (I present these figures from every possible stage). It\'s true that the Palestinians have repeatedly turned down any offer based on two states for two people. It\'s true that they are not stopping the incitement campaign for a moment. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter, as long as Breaking the Silence activists run from one campus to another to recruit more people.\n\nI feel sorry for Amos Oz. I feel sorry for the camp which used to be a peace camp. It has failed to bring peace closer, but has succeeded in bolstering the Palestinian rejectionist camp and the campaign for Israel\'s destruction.\n\n============================================================\nS.
