john.podesta@gmail.comb'Quick thought here in response and not specific to the speech, but a point with a nod to the general:\n\nLet\'s make sure we don\'t go too far with anti-corporate rhetoric despite the anger we heard in Yesterday\'s groups in Detroit.  We absolutely need to go after the bad corporate actors who are hurting the country (by scamming out of paying taxes) and families (by jacking up drug costs a million percent).  But let\'s not forget the good corporate citizens that are doing right by their employees and contributing to the fabric of communities, providing good jobs and the careers that so many seek right now.  Need to make sure we don\'t tar entire corporate America as we forcefully take on those who are hurting us.  \n\nBut with that caveat, I agree with the line Jim calls out below as extremely effective. \n\nSent from mobile device\n\n> On Feb 27, 2016, at 1:17 PM, Margolis, Jim <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com> wrote:\n> \n> Dan, others...\n> The corporate stuff is what is testing the strongest for us and what did the best in focus groups yesterday.

The inversion/perversion line is good poetry, but i think it\'s hard for a lot of people to understand.  Whether you keep it, or cut it, i\'d like you to add the line we used in the Johnson spot because we may use it elsewhere:\n> \n> "If you walk out on America, you\'ll pay a price".\n> \n> That line could find it\'s way into other ads..\n> \n> Thanks.\n> ________________________________________\n> From: speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com [speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com] on behalf of Nick Merrill [nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com]\n> Sent: Saturday, February 27, 2016 12:30 PM\n> To: Dan Schwerin\n> Cc: Speech Drafts; Clay Middleton; Stephanie Formas; Varun Anand\n> Subject: Re: DRAFT: South Carolina Primary Day Remarks\n> \n> Sitting with John, Jennifer, and Maya.

It builds on what worked in Nevada, but reverses the order to give more prominence to the "we\'re all in this together and all have to do our part" section. You\'ll see prominent placement for the Mothers of the Movement, Flint, and our favorite corporate villains.  It\'s also infused with a bit more "love & kindness," to elevate the tone of a week defined by Republican mud wrestling.\n>> Please send me any comments or concerns.\n>> Thanks\n>> Dan\n>> <2016-02-27 SC Primary Remarks - 12am.docx>\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> This email is intended only for the named addressee.
