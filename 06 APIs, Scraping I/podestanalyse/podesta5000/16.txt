I need tthem to ask people on the board why fred can\'t have this drug. This drug has been tested with freds tumor in a testube and is efficaous. The drug is in the hospital that fred is in AND this drug is being used in clinical trials on myloma (but fred doesn\'t qualify). It\'s bullshit. If I am unable to get drug I will take out full pg add in boston globe to ceo and board members. Fred is running out of time. He\'s so sick and needs this drug. Thanks so much\n\n2) The Background\n\n>From a Friend Describing the problem\nFred Baron of Dallas, good friend, is in Mayo now with Multiple Myeloma(sp?). There is a drug-Tysabri- made by Biogene that is given for multiple sclerosis, but is now in clinical trials for use on Multiple Myeloma. Fred\'s drs at mayo think this drug is his only chance, but Bogene won\'t approve for fred because he is too sick and if it fails him, it could skew the outcome of the trials(this told to me by his wife). According to his wife, sen. Kerry called andy von eschenbach on friday, andy called biogene, and got this reply from the company. Fred needs a compassionate use release from the company, whose ceo is James Mullin ph: 617-679-2000. I would like to call him on monday to argue that they could release this drug for mayo drs to administer to fred, and have the FDA "carve" it out of being factored in the clinical trials. So, early monday I need Von eshenbach ph #, and arrange a call later with mr. Mullin. See what info you can get me on him, and who represents them in dc. Thanks.\n\n>From his Dr. Lust, Fred\'s Doctor\nWe are requesting approval from Biogen/Idec to obtain compassionate use of Tysabri (natalizumab) for a patient we have that has end-stage myeloma and has exhausted all other treatment options.  We have discussed the potential risks including the development of PML and the patient wishes to proceed with treatment.  The Mayo Clinic has been approved to dispense this medication and our neurologists have been using it for the approved indication, multiple sclerosis.  We also have an IRB approved clinical trial with this agent for myeloma through Biogen Idec entitled "A Phase I/2, Two Arm Dose Finding Study of Natalizumab for the Treatment of Subjects with Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma.  Our patient does not meet the eligibility criteria for this trial and the treating physicians would like to treat him with Tysabri off study. If there are any additional questions please contact me at 507-250-3606 (cell phone).\n\n>From Harkin\n\nOn Sunday\n\nI got through to Mullen.  He had already had extensive conversations with Senator Kerry and Lance Armstrong and had heard from President Clinton, too.  The answer he gave in every case was "no.  I believe that I understood it correctly that Kerry had organized a conference call with Mullen and FDA Commissioner Von Eschenbach.  I hear that Von Eschenbach said it was fine with him for the drug to be used in Fred\'s case.  However, Biogen believes that Von E does not have that authority given the strict FDA conditions on the use of the drug.  (FDA had withdrawn the drug from the market because of its harmful effects.  It\'s the only drug that has ever been reapproved - but its reapproval was with very strict limitations.).  I\'m having people look into FDA\'s authorities in this area.  Mike, it would be great if Bill Schultz could, too.  Also, I\'m told that Mayo is what\'s called an FDA "touch approved program" - which means that it\'s one of the institutions in the country authorized to administer Tysabri.  Might be worth asking Schultz if there are authorities there that could allow Mayo to go ahead even without Biogen or FDA OK.  We\'re exploring that, too.\n\nOn Munday after the call with the FDA\n\nI just had a disappointing call with Dr. Von Eschenbach. FDA had a phone conference with the medical and science officers from Biogen. FDA told them there would be no prejudice to the clinical trial if this drug were used for Fred. They were appreciative but gave no indication they would change their position, which is that a corporate decision has been made they would not go outside the clinical trial. I am really upset about this, personally, since FDA has been great to help. I have not had the time today to reach out to some on the board of Biogen, but hope to do so yet today. I felt last night, after talking with Andy von Eshenbach, that with clearance from FDA, the company would be ok.\n\n\n\n3) The Board of Biogen\n\nMr. Bruce R. Ross (Chairman)\nBruce R.

I suggest you connect with him and hear his point of view of the conversation.\n\n>From what Dr. Trudel has told me:\n- Dr. Lust still has confidence in the US as an option\n- In Canada, this procedure would be viewed as experimental\n- There would be some need to engage with the hospital executives to secure permission and the appropriate process for paying for the drug (which is different in the socialized medical system), but my sense is that this would ultimately be manageable\n- There is the potential that permission from the manufacturer would be required given the use-case of the drug is different than it\'s intention, but she does not know for sure if this would be required.\n\nDr. Lust has her contact information.  She is waiting in the wings, if put into action she will instruct the pharmacy to do the appropriate investigation and put the wheels in motion to make it happen.\n\nShe also told me that Princess Margaret is the likely the only institution in the country capable of doing this type of advanced work in the Myeloma field.\n\nI will add:Hospitals in Canada are chronically underfunded, and a donation may grease the wheels.  I would consider this and be up front with a proposal in conversations you have with senior members of the hospital executives.\n\n\n7) Other Things that have happened:\n\nNate Landow who is a major Democratic Funder is  on the Board of the Mayo Clinic,  and is reaching out to his contacts at Mayo to see if they can make this happen around the company.
