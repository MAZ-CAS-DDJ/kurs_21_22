john.podesta@gmail.comb'Mr. Podesta:\n\nIt is certain this email contains nothing you have not already \nconsidered in depth. Nevertheless, it needs to be conveyed.\n\nAny reasonable person would think it too early to predict whether \nSecretary Clinton will be the next President of the United States. \nOur elections now start too early and cost too much, but that is now \nthe norm. Based upon input from multiple sources, it is increasingly \napparent to me her candidacy is in doubt. Which is not to judge \nwhether the onslaught arraigned against her is fair. Not my call.\n\nTruth is I do not care one way or the other. What matters for the \nadvocacy movement in which I am involved is whether or not the \nAmerican people are finally told the truth about the extraterrestrial \npresence. That truth must come from the President, and the President \nis Barack Obama.\n\nWhatever the future holds for Mrs. Clinton, at this time she very \nmuch needs a major change of subject - an issue so significant it \ntranscends all others. That issue, of course, is well known to you.\n\nThe media is very close to breaking the Clinton/ET connection wide \nopen. With that in mind, the equation would seem simple.\n\nWait for the media to arrive and be dragged into the truth process on \nthe ET issue, thus reinforcing on a massive scale the meme that \nplagues her, OR, preempt the media and proactively speak to the issue \nand perhaps transform the meme overnight.\n\nI have perhaps one quote that may one day may find its way into Bartlett\'s.\n"If you choose to speak truth to power, it is not enough to select\n  those truths which are convenient or safe or self-serving. You must speak\n  the whole truth and nothing but the truth and place your fate in \nthe hands of history."\nIf I can be of help in solving the equation in such a way as to \nproduce the most positive outcome for your candidate, I am happy to \ndiscuss that at your convenience.\n\nRegards,\nSteve Bassett\n\n\n\n'
