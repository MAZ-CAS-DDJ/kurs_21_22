I teach once a semester for Madeleine, and this was the morning, so I had to exit early.\n\nIt was great that you were there for Katie, but I'm not surprised.  Having been the beneficiary of your support when I ran for Congress, I know that you're always there for former colleagues and old friends.\n\nThe Republicans seem to be moving along their remarkable path, setting up a clash between one of the least qualified presidential candidates in history with one of the most qualified.  Given the state of the country, it promises to be quite a battle.   One that we have to win.\n\nAll my best,\nIra\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIra Shapiro\nIra Shapiro Global Strategies, LLC\n1200 New Hampshire Avenue, NW  Suite 800\nWashington, DC  20036\nOffice:   202-419-3412\nMobile: 202-577-5789\nwww.shapiroglobal.com<http://www.shapiroglobal.com/>\n\n"
