As we acknowledge the horror of what happened, we must also remember that what makes America great is our noblest ideals of diversity, tolerance, and acceptance.\xc2\xa0\n\nBut in order to live up to our ideals and show extremists they will never win, we need to do our part. We fight violence with civil action by making our voices heard at the ballot box.\n\nThe Millennial Generation is the most diverse and inclusive generation in American history, but we consistently fail to show how we create change and make progress when we don't show up to vote. Each time we stay home, we relinquish our power to influence critical decisions about who we are as a Nation.\xc2\xa0\n\nYou can change that today.\n\nVisit www.ourtime.org/vote to register to vote and make sure the choices this country makes about our future correctly represent our values.\n\nLet's show the perpetrators they can't restrict our freedoms or intimidate us from having our voices heard.\xc2\xa0\n\nSincerely,\n\nAndrew Lee\nExecutive Director, OurTime.org\n\nPS - Visit www.ourtime.org/vote to register to vote now. We can't allow others to make decisions for us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you believe you received this message in error or wish to no longer receive email from us, please https://act.myngp.com/el/7474510362881427456/7098934752954419200."
