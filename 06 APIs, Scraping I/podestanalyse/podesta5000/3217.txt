Choice, Palin\nInterviewed, Maverick or Gimmick?\n\nSummary of Shift:\nWith the announcement of McCain\'s vice presidential nominee, a slew of\nspeculation has arisen as to Sarah Paulin\'s ability to chair the position of\ncommander in chief if McCain passes.  The strongest arguments against her\nremain her inexperience (2 years as governor and small-town mayor), her\nlimited relationship with McCain, as well as the current investigation due\nto her firing a commissioner under questionable intentions.   Barack Obama\'s\nspeech at the DNC has continued to be highlighted.\nIn other news, the Gulf Coast prepares for the worst as Gustav is predicted\nto become a category 4 hurricane.

CNBC: Sarah Palin Interview Discusses Energy and ANWR Drilling\n\nHighlights, No YouTubes:\n1.     MSNBC: Mike Murphy gave the Bush presidency a "C" grade\n2.     MSNBC - DAN SCHNUR: "I think, like everybody else in the universe, I\nam extremely surprised. Earlier this summer when McCain was running 10, 12,\n15  points behind Obama a pick like this, a gamble like this would have made\nmore sense. Conventional wisdom suggested that in a race that\'s essentially\ntied, he would have done something safer. But I think what it show\'s you\nAndrea is how much John McCain values his reputation as a Maverick. He\'s\nvery steadily come back in the polls over the last couple of weeks, but it\'s\nbeen by running a very conventional campaign. I think given the choice of\nbeing a maverick and being president, John McCain would rather be president.\nA pick like this, potentially at least, gives him the opportunity to do\nboth."\n3.     MSNBC - RACHEL MADDOW: On the temperament issue, I think that we\'ll\nkeep hearing it because I think that McCain keeps demonstrating it. I mean,\nwhen he said "we are all Goergian\'s now", that may have sounded like big\ntough rhetoric, but he\'s essentially saying, let\'s treat Georgia like it was\na member of NATO. Which means, let\'s treat Georgia as if it were Nebraska\nthat just got invaded by the Russians. Let\'s go bomb Moscow. To have that\nsort of reaction, that sort of hair trigger reaction, on a very sensitive\non-going policy dispute, where our own government is taking a very different\nattack, yeah, no matter who says that, I think temperament ought to be an\nissue. He keeps bringing it up himself.\n4.     MSNBC - PHIL MUSTER: "Well, look, I think the bottom line on\nexperience here is she\'s had more experience as a chief executive as the\nGovernor of Alaska than Barack Obama has in the United States Senate. So\npeople grow into new jobs as they develop and take them. But her record as a\nchief executive in Alaska has been great. She\'s reached out across the\nboard, just like John McCain has worked in a bi-partisan fashion in\nWashington, she\'s worked in a bi-partisan fashion in Alaska. She hasn\'t been\nafraid to challenge those within her own party who are wrong. Take for\nexample, the fact that she\'s been outspoken in supporting a primary\nchallenge to Don Young who sponsored the bridge to no where in our party.\nShe calls them like she sees them, and I think America might fall in love\nwith this woman who really brings a real common touch."\n5.     MSNBC - MICHAEL MOORE: [\x85] I don\'t know if you showed the cake there,\nthat they had three years ago today with McCain and Bush. When Marie\nAntoinette, when she said let them eat cake, I think she was speaking\nfiguratively, they literally were, while New Orleans was drowning, eating\ncake.\n6.     MSNBC - KEITH OLBERMAN: But our winner [Worst Person in the World]\nSenator John McCain. In the last twenty days, suicide bombers have killed at\nleast 78 people in Iraq. Wounded countless others. Yet the Senator told Time\nMagazine, in an extraordinary and frightening interview, that as to Iraq,\n"It\'s a peaceful and stable country now." The reporters asked the natural\nfollow-up, "It is? But you wouldn\'t say you\'ve achieved victory now?" He\nanswered, "Yes, I would say that the surge is succeeding and we are\nwinning." So an average of four people a day dead in suicide bombings means\nthat a country is peaceful and stable. But a peaceful and stable country\ndoes not mean victory has been achieved and we can get our men and women out\nof there. One way or another, you are witnessing a man suffering from at\nleast from one actual delusion. To say nothing of an utter disrespect of the\nmeaning of the loss of life. It is not funny, it is shameful. John McCain,\ntoday\'s worst person in the world.\n\nClips:\n\nHighlight #1\n*Pfotenhauer Doesn\'t Know the Extent or Length of McCain\'s and Paulin\'s\nRelationship* (FNC  08/29/08 10:08am)\n\nBILL HEMMER: [\x85] Tell me about the relationship between McCain and Palin.  How\nmuch time have they spent together?  How well do they know one another?\n\nPFOTENHAUER:  *You\'re running flat into the wall of my ignorance here, Bill.\nI just, I truly, um, no indication whatsoever of the extent of a\nrelationship that exists with the governor of Alaska.*  And you know there\nare several other folks [\x85] and they have been at the forefront of the scene\nthe last several months.\n\nHEMMER:  You know, Nancy, if I could just stop you there, maybe that answer\nitself is *a bit revealing of the fact that they don\'t have much of a\nrelationship*.  Is that a fair reading?\n\nPFOTENHAUER:  No, no, no.  It\'s revealing of my ignorance.  Not of their\nrelationship.\n\n\nHighlight #2\n*Jack Cafferty on Sarah Paulin\'s Inexperience with International and\nDomestic Issues *(CNN 08/29/08 6:39pm)\nGLORIA BORGER:  [\x85] I\'ve been talking to some democrats who are now\nexpecting that Senator McCain will soon name his Secretary of State,\nSecretary of Defense to try and relay questions about this sort of military\nindustrial complex in his administration, should anything happen to him.\n\n[\x85]\n\nSTEVEN HAYES: [\x85] It\'s legitimate to wonder whether she would have this\nexperience; but look at what she\'s done in Alaska.  You can\'t just ignore\nher record in Alaska.  She up-ended the establishment.  The republican party\nestablishment in Alaska taking on people in her own party, she\'s governed\neffectively, she\'s cut taxes, she\'s done all of these things that won her an\n80% approval rating.  It is absolutely not crazy to pick her.  [\x85]\n\nJACK CAFFERTY:  The state of Alaska has the population of Austin, Texas.  What\ndoes she know about inner-city poverty? The war on drugs? What does she know\nabout the Middle East? You want to put her up against Putin, Achmajenidad?  She\nwas the mayor of a town of 7,000 people in Alaska.  [\x85] Most of the\nrepublicans I heard from, including a lot of women, how dare John McCain\npresume because he names an inexperienced woman from Alaska, that he can\nstart collecting the 18 million votes that were cast for Hillary\nClinton?  They\'re\non opposite sides of all the issues, people are outraged.  This is a joke.\n\n\nHighlight #3\n*Bounds Deflects Question About Palin\'s Foreign Experience* (FNC 08/29/08\n1:35pm)\n\nTUCKER BOUNDS:  [\x85] It\'s an exciting pick for us.  Both of these candidates\nshare a passion for change in government, they have records of reform, and\nwe can think of no better person to be joining us here at the campaign other\nthan governer Palin of Alaska.  So many of the issues, she has expertise on.\nWe are important to American voters that are facing skyrocketing gas prices.\nShe\'s an expert on energy issues.  She understands that we need to\ntransition to alternative fuels, renewable energies.  But she also\nunderstands the importance of drilling; making sure we have those short\nshock measures to fight energy prices that are skyrocketing, pinching\nfamilies.\n\nTRACE GALLAGHER:  [\x85] the democrats are already on the attack here.  You\nknow they\'re going to go after her foreign credentials, and how do you\nretaliate against that?\n\nBOUNDS:  [\x85] for them to completely ignore that Governor Palin is a governor\nand executive and reformer in the state of Alaska, and to belittle her, to\ntry and say that small-town Americans , a mayor wasn\'t befitting of a vice\npresidential nominee.  [\x85] America\'s built on small towns. Small town\nAmericans may have taken offense.  I know I certainly did.\n\nGALLAGHER: [\x85] How do you respond to the democrats when they attack her\nforeign relations credentials?\n\nBOUNDS:  Well, Senator McCain is running for president of the United States,\nand I don\'t think anyone would disagree that in this campaign, there is no\none with more experience, more understanding of the international stage,\nforeign affairs than John McCain.  That\'s why Americans are gonna support\nhim in the fall; is because he understands that we need to take the right\napproach overseas [\x85]\n\nHighlight #4\n*Senator Lindsey Graham on McCain\'s Choice of Sarah Palin* (MSNBC 08/29/08\n4:33pm)\nPETER ALEXANDER: First question, perhaps in the case of an unforeseen\ntragedy, John McCain comes into office at the age of 72, would be the oldest\npresident to walk into the White House. If for any reason Sarah Palin were\nto assume the presidency, are you comfortable with her leading this country?\n\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Given her life story, yes, absolutely. When you look at\nwhat she\'s accomplished in her life, from a personal point of view and a\nprofessional point of view, I don\'t think there\'s anything that she can\'t\ndo. She is tough. She\'s reformed minded. She\'s taken a beating for her\nprinciples. She\'s put her political future at risk more than one time\nchallenging her own party. She\'s a quite extraordinary lady and I would be\nproud for her to be my president.\n\nALEXANDER: If you\'re comfortable with her life story, I think a lot of\ndemocrats will hear you say that Senator and say, why then aren\'t the\nrepublicans comfortable with Barack Obama\'s life store? If he lacks\nexperience but he does have a terrific life story, wouldn\'t that be\nsufficient for him as a candidate?\n\nGRAHAM: I\'m not talking just about her life story; I\'m talking about her\njudgment. She has taking on corruption, she has made people mad at her they\nyou would want mad at you if you wanted to reform the government. She has\nreally done things in Alaska that are similar to what john McCain would like\nto do in Washington. At the end of the day, I had a chance to see senator\nObama up close in the immigration debate. We had a comprehensive bipartisan\ndeal where republicans got some things and gave some things to democrats. I\nsaw what he did. We had a temporary worker program as part of the\ncomprehensive bipartisan agreement that republicans wanted, unions hated.\nAnd at the end of the day he introduced an amendment to do away with that\npart of the deal, which was basically killing the deal. So I\'m not very\nimpressed with senator Obama, quite frankly, when it comes to doing hard\nthings and telling democrats something they don\'t want to hear. I\'m very\nimpressed with governor Palin taking on her own people at times. That\'s what\nJohn\'s looking for. Somebody that will come to Washington with him, that\nwill turn the place up side down. And Obama and Biden are not going to do\nthat.\n\nALEXANDER: Senator, have you ever met Governor Palin?\n\nGRAHAM: No. Talked to her on the phone. Anybody that hunts moose at 3:00 in\nthe morning is high on my list.\n\nALEXANDER: Alright, then give us a better sense, perhaps, is this pick more\nof an appeal, do you believe, to the republican base? She\'s a strong social\nconservative. Or do you think it plays to independents and disgruntled\nHillary Clinton supporters? Who will this sway?\n\nGRAHAM: Good question. What I think it\'s going to do is reinforce what\nsenator McCain would like to do in Washington. You know, when you look at\nhis legislative career he\'s always pushed the status quo, much to his\ndetriment sometimes. And you\'ve got a governor, a young governor in Governor\nPalin, who\'s done exactly the same thing in Alaska. So I think that\'s the\nnarrative that will resonate in both groups. People are frustrated, the\nCongress is at 12 percent. People are dying for something new and different,\nand controlling spending, reforming the way business is done. From the women\nperspective, I think a lot of young women in this country are going to be\ninspired by Governor Palin. And Republicans will be inspired by her. She\'s a\nsolid conservative, but more than anything else, she\'s taken the status quo\nand corruption head on. And that\'s exactly what we need to do in Washington.\nSo I think it\'s a two-for. I think it helps us with our base, and I think it\nwill help us with independent voters who are looking for somebody, not to\ntalk about change, but who has actually done something to make things\nchange.\n\nHighlight #5\n*Andrea Mitchell and Chuck Todd Discuss Palin\'s Risk* (MSNBC 08/29/08\n5:05pm)\nANDREA MITCHELL: [\x85] Now it is a high risk, high payoff kind of nomination,\nbecause she\'s got no real national experience. [\x85] She could help with\nHillary Clinton voters in the suburbs of some of the big cities, in\nbattleground states, I mean this could be a game changer. That said, the\nfact that John McCain only met her once, when we get this tick doc just now\nthat, from the McCain, they didn\'t even know each other. This was not a\ncarefully vetted, personal decision. This was a very calculated, strategic\ndecision to try to change the whole game.\n\nCHRIS MATTHEWS: [\x85] Is this niche marketing here? In other words, you\'re\ntaking a person who doesn\'t really conform to the profile, the voters you\'re\ntrying to win over, the women voter, the working women, the very committed\nwoman. This candidate for vice president, now apparently has no real\ninterest in the Iraq war. She said she hasn\'t given it much thought, which\ncertainly separates her from a lot of democratic women who are vastly\nagainst the war. She would outlaw abortion in every circumstance, including\ncases where a woman had been raped or there was incest involved. Certainly a\nradical view at odds to, it seems to me, in my experiences with those\nsuburban women that Andrea just mentioned.\n\nCHUCK TODD: Well, look, I see this pick as a decision by the McCain campaign\nto basically say, well, look we can not win on experience alone. Every time\nthere\'s an election, a change election, and it\'s change versus experience,\nchange wins and I think they came to that conclusion. Look, I had been told\na couple of weeks ago that you can tell what McCain thinks about his chances\nby the type of running mate he names. [\x85] They\'ve abandoned experience and\nthat\'s ok, because McCain had not been able to recapture his maverick,\nchange image. This is giving him an opportunity to re-launch. Look, he may\nnot win over a lot of new supporters over the next couple of days. But it\'s\nmaking them take a second look and that\'s what he needed. He needed a second\nlook, he needed a fresh look. Look the campaign staff is fired up, they\'re\nenthusiastic. [\x85] For McCain it\'s about playing with the news cycle and\nsurprising, do these nice surgical strikes when it comes to the media. Look,\nit may be a disaster at the end of the day. But McCain thought they had a\nceiling going on in the trajectory that they were headed.\n\nHighlight #6\n*Hardball discusses if Palin\'s Selection is Just a Gimmick* (MSNBC 08/29/08\n5:15pm)\nCHRIS MATTHEWS: We have a Vice President who\'s committed almost viscerally\nto the war in Iraq. Here\'s a candidate to replace him in a Republican Party\nwho said this, [\x85] "I\'ve been so focused on state government, I haven\'t\nreally focused much on the war in Iraq." I mean here she is running to\nreplace a guy with 60 staff people involved with foreign policy and Intel\ncollection in a very hawkish setting. How can she be a credible successor?\n[\x85]\n\nANDREA MITCHELL:  [\x85] Foreign policy is not why she was chosen. You could\nargue, politically, tactically, you don\'t want to replace Dick Cheney with\nanother Dick Cheney. That\'s not what the Republicans want right now. You\'ve\ngot John McCain, John McCain\'s your foreign policy guru. Look, there are a\ncouple of pluses and minuses here. She\'s got five children, [\x85] she will\nappeal to the soccer moms and the hockey moms, as she describes herself.\nShe\'s got a lot of color. People are going to talk, people who don\'t know\nAlaska who don\'t know that part of the world, [\x85] she eats moose burgers.\nThis is exciting to a lot of people. Everyone up there eats moose burgers.\nThat\'s the meal, that\'s the food, that\'s the meat that you get, that you\nshoot. That you bring home. [\x85] She is also a bit of a libertarian. She\'s\nnot completely consistent on those social conservative issues. I got a Log\nCabin email from the Log Cabin Republicans saying her first veto was to\nprotect gay rights for partners. So we need to dig a little deeper into\nthis.  [\x85] But the biggest thing is she has no personal relationship with\nthe man that she\'s running with.\n\nCHUCK TODD: The biggest downside, Chris, is that this could look like a\ngimmick. Cause John McCain only met her twice. Doesn\'t know her. This goes\nagainst everything we think we know about John McCain. He likes to surround\nhimself with people that he\'s comfortable with, that are loyal to him, and\nall of a sudden this is a political calculation, and it\'s gimmicky. And the\ngimmick could wear out. [\x85]\n\nCHRIS MATTHEWS: Let\'s talk about age. John McCain has just turned 72. John\nMcCain will be 77 in his first term as President. A lot of concern he\nwouldn\'t really be running for two terms, which is unique. He\'d really be\nrunning for one. And there for his running mate would really be running like\nhis successor to be. And you have to wonder whether this is credible. Is\nJohn McCain replaceable, effectively by the Governor of Alaska, could\nsomething happen in the first term? Is this something that he can honestly\nsay to the American people, that this person after a year in office in Juno,\nwith no foreign policy interest? Not just experience, no interest\napparently. Can this person be commander in chief if something happens?\n\nMITCHELL: That is going to be the biggest question. [\x85]\n\nHighlight #7\n*Countdown Investigates If Palin Will Be Able to Draw Clinton Voters* (MSNBC\n08/29/08 8:31pm)\nKEITH OLBERMAN: The Republicans have chosen the least experienced vice\npresidential candidate, probably in American history. A rabid conservative,\nseemingly a vague alternative to Hillary Clinton, except that last March the\nGovernor claimed that Senator Clinton was "whining" about the primaries.\n\nKEITH OLBERMAN: This wasn\'t really a bid for Hillary supporters was it? I\nmean A: If you\'re trying to poach Clinton women, you would announce this\nbefore the democratic heal-a-thon, not the day after it ends. And B: at your\nown magazine\'s women in leadership event, [\x85] she felt kind of bad she\ncouldn\'t support a woman, but she didn\'t like Clinton\'s "whining". So the\nHillary alternative just called Hillary and the PUMA\'s whiners?\n\nHOWARD FINEMAN: Well Keith, there are a lot of pro-drilling and anti-polar\nbear and anti-abortion women among those 18 million Hillary supporters, I\'m\nsure.  I\'m being factious, I don\'t think there\'s that many left. And I don\'t\nthink this really is about that. I think in big picture terms, it was about\nJohn McCain seeking to change things up to try to re-establish his Maverick\ncredentials. Because, despite her lack of experience, Sarah Palin is sort of\na brave political person, having taken on her own political party the way\nJohn McCain used to do. He wanted to underscore the desire for change, and\nthe fact that he gets it. And he wanted to, frankly, shake things up and not\nmake it so boring. [\x85]\n\n[\x85]\n\nOLBERMAN: The experience argument. This had been viewed widely, as maybe\nSenator McCain\'s best weapon against Obama. He just turned this in. Why give\nthis up for her?\n\nFINEMAN: Well for the reasons I said. Because he hadn\'t established himself\nwith the grassroots of the Republican Party. Because he wanted to be an\nagent of change. Because he wanted to restore his maverick credentials. I\nmean, that\'s what the McCain people were telling me all day today, the\nMaverick just picked a maverick. But yes, he\'s done it at great cost,\nbecause the whole Republican Convention, I was told, [\x85] the slogan was\ngoing to be, he\'s not ready to lead, meaning Barack Obama. Well Sarah Palin\nmakes Barack Obama look like John Adams. I mean it\'s no contest. [\x85]\n\nHighlight #8\n*Rachel Maddow Highlights Palin\'s Bridge to Nowhere Flip-Flop* (MSNBC\n08/29/08 8:40pm)\nKEITH OLBERMAN: She said no thanks to the Bridge to Nowhere. But in 2006 one\nof her spokesman, I guess in Alaska her spokesman, told the Associated Press\nthat she had supported the Bridge. So she just jumps into this national\nspotlight complete with the Bridge to Nowhere attached to her? Is she the\nbridge to nowhere?\n\nRACHEL MADDOW: Yeah, this is very awkward, because she is out there, in her,\nyou know, I\'m the new running mate speech, her debut on the national stage\nbringing up that bridge to nowhere issue. I went and looked it up in the\nAnchorage Daily News from 2006, she was asked point-blank about funding for\nthat bridge, and she said yes, I would like to Alaska\'s infrastructure\nprojects built sooner rather than later. The window is now while our\ncongressional delegation is in a strong position to assist. So as recently\nas two years ago, she was not only in favor of the Bridge to Nowhere, which\nshe\'s now saying that she wasn\'t, but she was also in favor of it on the\nbasis of the fact that Alaska\'s congressional delegation was in a position\nthat they could do it through earmarks. This is an embarrassing position to\nhave taken. Not only because of the flip-flop, but they\'re trying to market\nher as a fiscal conservative who stood up to Alaska\'s, sort of famously\ncorrupt Republican politicians.\n\nHighlight #9\n*Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz Blasts Palin as Anti-Women\nIssues*(MSNBC 08/29/08 6:16pm)\nDAVID GREGORY: This statement from Hillary Clinton, could this not be\ninterpreted as a message to her own supporters that perhaps this new\nRepublican ticket ought to warrant a new look?\n\nREP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: No, I don\'t think that\'s the message that\nHillary Clinton was speaking at all. On the contrary, she made it clear that\nJohn McCain and Sarah Palin are wrong on all the issues that matter to\nwomen. This is a pick that demonstrates colossally bad judgment on the part\nof John McCain. You know, we\'re talking about someone who has less than\n18months experience as Governor of a state that has fewer people than my own\nCongressional district. Someone who was the mayor of a town of 8,000 people.\nSomeone who would have to have their hand on the pillar of our foreign\npolicy, and combat the war on terror, with that colossal lack of experience\nis frightening. And it demonstrates that John McCain, just like Barack Obama\nsaid last night in his acceptance speech, just doesn\'t get it.\n\n[\x85]\n\nSCHULTZ: John McCain has failed both tests, experience and judgment. He\'s\nchosen someone who totally lacks the experience that we need in a potential\nPresident of the United States, and he\'s demonstrated an unbelievable lack\nof judgment in choosing her. What he\'s done here is he\'s tried to appeal to\nthe women of this country, by choosing someone who simply has the same parts\nthat we do. And what matters to women is not having someone that\'s the same\ngender as we are, but we need to make sure that we have someone in office\nthat cares the same issues that we do. Sarah Palin is wrong on a women\'s\nright to choose, wrong on equal pay for equal work, wrong on expanding\naccess to children\'s healthcare. It\'s insulting, I have to tell you.\n\n[\x85]\n\nSCHULTZ: [\x85] I\'m sure she manages her household with five children very\nwell, but she is not ready to manage this country.\n\nHighlight #10\n*Rep. Eric Cantor Supports Sarah Palin\'s Experience* (MSNBC 08/29/08 6:18pm)\nDAVID GREGORY: Is there the potential [\x85] that John McCain would actually\nexperience a backlash from the very women he\'s trying to court here, Hillary\nClinton supporters and other women around the country? Does this look like\npandering?\n\nREP. ERIC CANTOR: [\x85] Sarah Palin represents what so many women in this\ncountry are about, trying to balance work and raising a family, and all the\ndouble income families out there in America, we all feel the strains. And\nthe women often bare the brunt of that. So what we have in Sarah Palin is in\nindividual that has a wealth of experience, not only raising five children,\nbecoming a mayor, and then a governor, but also one of experience. I mean, I\nfind it really unbelievable that the Barack Obama folks are starting to\ncriticize Sarah Palin over lack of experience. She has as much experience as\nBarack Obama, and even more. She was chief executive of a state, Barack\nObama has had no executive experience whatsoever.\n\nGREGORY: He\'s 72 years old, he\'s actively talked [..] about him just\npursuing one term as president. [\x85] Now he\'s got someone who\'s 44 years old,\nonly been Governor since 2006, will Americans look to her and think, yeah\nshe can do the job if anything happens to him.\n\nCANTOR: I think Americans will pull the level when they go into the ballot\nbooth in November, they\'ll put it based on Barack Obama versus John McCain.\n\nHighlight #11\n*Race to the White House Asks If Sarah Palin is the New Dan Quayle* (MSNBC\n08/29/08 6:46pm)\nRACHEL MADDOW: This feels a little Dan Quayle like to me. I mean, I guess it\nwould be Daniel Quayle. Have they ever been seen together before? Are there\nany pictures of them together? Is there any evidence that they\'ve ever\nspoken? In an interview today, Sarah Palin did not know what John McCain\'s\nplan is on Iraq. I mean, the reason that Dan Quayle was a bad choice is that\nit was a transparent electoral choice. I think this guy will make me look\nyounger, I think this guy will make me look more like the future. And there\nwas not even lip service paid, either with Dan Quayle or with Sarah Palin.\nTo the idea that these two politicians want to govern together, that they\neven know each other, or that the McCain campaign really thinks she can be\nthe best president, out of everybody else in the country, other than John\nMcCain. It just doesn\'t feel right, it doesn\'t smell right, it seems a\nlittle insulting.\n\nDAVID GREGORY: Is this stage craft first?\n\nJOHN HARWOOD: Yes. [\x85] He has a much narrower margin for error than other\nrecent Republican nominees. He\'s got to have everything go right. And if\npeople look at her and say, hey this was a real reach that was made for\npolitical reasons to try to appeal to those Hillary supporters, that\'s going\nto hurt him. [\x85]\n\nHighlight #12\n*Sarah Palin Interview Discusses Energy and ANWR Drilling* (CNBC 08/29/08)\nSARAH PALIN: Economically speaking though, it\'s about 20 percent of the U.S.\ndomestic supply of energy is produced up on the north slope up in Prudo. So\nit\'s very, very significant economically, physically, it\'s a tiny little\nfoot.\n\nMARIA BARTIROMO: So you\'re saying it\'s a tiny little footprint, actually the\noperations in Prudo Bay, but people think of it as so expansive and so\nmassive that it\'s going to have a material effect if in fact we were going\nto see drilling there, on the wildlife and on the community.\nPALIN: Well, ANWR, that point, it\'s about 2,000 acres that is being asked to\nbe looked at and then to be explored and then to be produced. 2,000 acres\nout of 20,000,000 acres. That footprint, it\'s about the size of LAX, or one\nof the larger airports across the nation. That should allow some perspective\nthere also. No one, I think, but Alaskans, care more about our wildlife,\nabout our clean water, our clean air, the pristine environment that we are\nblessed to live in and get to breath in every single day. No one but\nAlaskans will care more to make sure that we are preserving that pristine\nenvironment that is ANWR, the coastal plane, Prudo Bay, Alaska as a whole.\nAnd when you ask Alaskan\'s, are you ready to allow drilling to take place to\na greater degree up on the north slopes, specifically here we\'re talking\nabout ANWR, do you want to see that happen? And with Alaskan\'s love and care\nfor our environment and our lands and our wildlife, Alaskan\'s are saying,\nyes, because we believe that it can be done safely. It can be done\nprudently. And it had better be done ethically, also. Yes, we\'d want to see\nthat drilling. So hopefully the rest of American can understand that also.\nYou go door to door and you ask Alaskans if we are ready, willing, and able\nto produce more and contribute more to the U.S., and they\'re going to tell\nyou, yes.\n\nBARTIROMO: President Bush tried this a number of times under his watch. Why\nis it that we have been unable to actually get this done?\n\nPALIN: I think there\'s a lot of misperceptions and misconceptions about what\nANWR is all about and what, up in the north slope, what the environment\nactually is up there. You see pictures, you see visuals from the nay-sayers,\nthe critics of the idea of opening up ANWR and the pictures that they\'re\nshowing are mountains, and polar bears, lots of different wildlife. They\'ll\nshow moose in a stream with mountains in the background, that\'s not ANWR.\nAnd as your people go up there also and actually get to see for themselves,\nand we\'ve had a lot of Congressman and Congresswomen come up here this\nsummer even to see for themselves, what actually is ANWR. What would be\ntouched here in terms of lands and wildlife. Then they see that those\nvisuals that have been shown to America for all these years  are inaccurate.\nThose are not the pictures of ANWR, there aren\'t mountains up there for\ninstance. So I think that there\'s a lot of misperception out there for what\nthe plane actually looks like. And the visuals are very important to\nAmericans, I do think though that Americans are recognizing more and more,\nit\'s evidence in the pressure that they\'re putting on Congress at this\npoint, the constituents putting on Congress, more and more Americans are\nrecognizing it is time to ramp up America\'s supply of energy. Especially,\nwe\'re a nation at war, a lot of the issues that are so adversely effecting\nAmerica are based on energy supplies as we\'re relying on foreign sources of\nenergy to feed our hungry market. More and more Americans are recognizing,\nour sister state, up in the Alaska, has these supplies. We have trillions of\ncubic feet of clean, natural gas. We have billions of barrels of oil still\nsitting underground, in a sense, being warehoused. It\'s time to unlock these\nreserves and allow competitors to come in and compete for the right to tap\nthose resources and start flowing that energy into the domestic markets that\nso hungry, so that we can become less reliant on foreign sources of energy.\nAs more Americans recognize that, more Americans,  I believe, are choosing\nto educate themselves on what ANWR is really all about.\n\nBARTIROMO: For Sure. And this year there was a price. And once there was a\nprice actually reached, it was, people got it.\n\nPALIN: I believe so too.\n\nBARTIROMO: Let me get your thoughts, on really the consequences. What then\nare the major consequences of drilling in ANWR? I was reading a piece\nearlier that said, look, it will impact the breeding of caribou, the\nbreeding of polar bears. Give me your sense, what are the consequences?\n\nPALIN: Well, let\'s look at lessons learned over the last 30 years from the\nTrans-Atlantic Oil Pipeline was finally allowed to be built. And there were\nthe threats then and the fears that the caribou herds would diminish and die\noff. No, the caribou herds are actually thriving, they\'re flourishing. There\nhas not been the adverse impact on the caribou herds. So we anticipate the\nsame thing as we tap more energy supplies up on the North Slope in ANWR, and\nas we build a Natural Gas Pipeline also that\'s underway at this point. When\nyou consider the naysayers, kind of the fear mongerers, 30 years ago before\nthe Trans America Pipeline was built, and remember, that pipeline has\nsupplied 50 billion barrels of oil into our domestic supplies here in\nAmerica. By the way, Joe Biden was one who voted against that Trans Atlantic\nPipeline 30 years ago. He was fearful of allowing ramped up domestic\nsupplies of energy, even then. So of course, I fear, if he\'s of the same\nmind today we\'re in a world of hurt there. But no, the environment will\ncontinue to be protected. Our wildlife will continue to thrive and prosper\nup there. And we\'re going to make sure that we have the stringent and safe\noversight that is necessary and will allow the population of this wildlife\nand the pristineness of the area to continue.\n\nBARTIROMO: Ok, let\'s talk about jobs and sort of the impact of drilling and\nof operations there. How significant?\n\nPALIN: Here in Alaska, oil production is so significant. 85 to 90 percent of\nour entire state budget is based on that barrel of oil and the price that it\ndrives. And our state revenue, is again, so reliant on the price of a barrel\nof oil. For such a great part also Alaskan jobs are contingent on very\naggressive production of oil and natural gas up here in Alaska.\n\nBARTIROMO: On probably of all the 48 states, it\'s a ripple effect\n\nPALIN: Absolutely, and also the ripple effect, is our belief too that as\nmore domestic supplies of energy from Alaska flow into the hungry markets,\nnaturally, we believe the price of energy will diminish also. It will\ndecrease and that will be good for the economy as a whole. But very, very\nimportant to the US economy, specifically here in Alaska. My goodness, it is\nwhat drives our economy.\n\nBARTIROMO: So how important are the oil and gas industries, businesses to\nAlaskans?\n\nPALIN: Very, very important. Conical Phillips, Exxon, BP, you know we bump\nheads quite a bit when it comes to the sovereignty of our state. Alaska is\nset up unlike any other state in the nation, where our statehood compact\nact, and our state constitution lays out for us who owns the resources. And\nunlike other states, it\'s Alaskans who live here who own the resources\nunderground. So as they\'re tapped, as they\'re produced Alaskans share in the\nwealth that\'s derived from the production of these resources. So the oil\nindustries there are our partners here, they have the leases, the rights to\ndevelop the resources. But Alaskans own the resources. So that obviously\ncreates some tension with who owns what and who can control what. But our\nposition of strength in my administration, we know is our state\nconsititution that again lays out for us who actually owns the resources.\nThat\'s the Alaskan residents and I will do all I can to protect the Alaskan\nresidents as we develop, but at the same time we recognize that the big oil\nindustry that is here they do have the rights and have had the rights for\nmany years now to develop these resources for us and with us.\n\nBARTIROMO: How will you do that? How will you protect Alaskans homes, there\nenvironment?\n\nPALIN: We need to drill, drill, drill though. Otherwise I can not believe\nthat a domestic  solution is any part of a national energy policy. If\nthey\'re not going to let Alaskans drill on our own lands, and on Federal\nlands within our own state. And a domestic solution isn\'t part of a national\nenergy plan, then our nation  is in a world of hurt. We\'re going to continue\nto be reliant on foreign, dangerous regimes, to feed our hungry markets. I\nfind it ironic, and I find it non-sensical that here, we send Secretary\nBodman we even send our own President overseas to negotiate with the Saudi\'s\nto ask the Saudi\'s ramp up oil production. For us in America, where again,\nabsolute nonsense because Alaska has those resources already. And we should\nbe tapping these American supplies before we go over to the Saudi\'s  and ask\nthem to do so. So very significant where what is going on and I think our\nnation is at a cross roads also. We better be making decisions to allow this\nAmerican supply of energy to be tapped, or we are going to become more and\nmore beholden to these foreign regimes. And again, our nation is going to be\nin a word of hurt. When you talk about national security, when you talk\nabout ever reaching potential towards energy independence. If we can not\nimplement  a domestic solution for this national energy policy,  and we have\nlacked a national energy policy also.  We have not had a plan.  Alaska\nshould be a leader in this plan because we have the conventional, the\nnon-renewable supplies, the petroleum.  We have them up here.  [\x85]\n We also have the renewables also. We have the largest tides on the\ncontinent.   We have the geothermal.  We have the winds.  We have all these\nalternative renewable resources that also can be tapped into as we work\ncollectively and comprehensively on an energy plan.\n\nBARTIROMO: So as a nation we need to be doing everything?\n\nPALIN: We need to be doing everything, and people need to be realistic,\nalso.  This is what scares me about Biden and Obama also is it seems to be\nalmost a na\xefve notion of their that we can just automatically jump right\ninto a renewable supply of energy to feed hungry markets across our nation,\nwhen these renewables are not yet proven to be economic or reliable.  We\'re\ngoing to be in a transition period for quite some time where we\'re going to\nhave to continue to be reliant on conventional sources of energy as we\'re\nworking on the renewables.  And we certainly have to head in that direction\nalso, but it\'s got to be doin\' everything, everything that we can to allow\nthe domestic supplies; renewable and unrenewable, to be tapped; solutions\nplugged in both those ends, and not just skip the oil and gas developments\nthat- and the coal development also that we have to have as part of a\ncomprehensive plan.  It\'s na\xefve to think we can go right to renewables, and\nthink that\'s ever going to work for our nation, today.
