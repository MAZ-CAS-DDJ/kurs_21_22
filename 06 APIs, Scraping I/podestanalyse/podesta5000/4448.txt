john.podesta@gmail.comb'Ok thanks!\n\n\n\n*From:* John Podesta [mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com]\n*Sent:* Wednesday, November 11, 2015 1:12 PM\n*To:* Dennis Cheng <dcheng@hillaryclinton.com>; Michael Smith <\nmsmith@hillaryclinton.com>; Charles Baker <cbaker@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Subject:* Cary Fowler\n\n\n\nHad a good meeting with him. Compared notes on the 1968 McCarthy campaign.\nHe and  Amy will host a high $ fundraiser at their place if we want. Pushed\nhim on HVF as our top ask, but also made the case for Priorities. They are\ndoing a lot for the Senate and planned parenthood. They have also made a\npledge to Brock, but I think Media Matters, not CTR.\n'
