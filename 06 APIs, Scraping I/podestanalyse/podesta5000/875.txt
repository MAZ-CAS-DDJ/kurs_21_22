john.podesta@gmail.comb' \n\nJohn, heard this second hand but more than once. Seems Erdogan faction is\nmaking substantial investments in U.S. to counter opposition (CHP, Kurds,\nGulenists etc.) outreach to policymakers and USG. Am told that the Erdogan\ncrew also tries to make inroads via donations to Democratic candidates,\nincluding yours. Two names that you should be aware of are Mehmet Celebi and\nAli Cinar. Happy to elaborate on the phone, provided you are not shopping at\nthe liquor store.\n\nM.\n\n \n\n'
