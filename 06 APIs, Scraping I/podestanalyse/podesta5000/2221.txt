Below are the notes from our call.*\n\n**Warren, OH - McCain Employee Town Hall Meeting\n*(Disclaimer: The following are notes, not direct quotes. If you\'d like a\nquotable transcript or video of any part below, please email us.)\n*\nBackground Details: *\n- Event at GM plant - team Lordstown\n- Small venue - 18 audience members on stage, 75 chairs and 10 standing\n- Room is so small there is not enough for print reporters and traveling\npress. They are scrambling to see where they are gonna fit them.\n- Stage has a large American flag, otherwise room is decorated with company\nbanners and flags\n- Press - local and embeds, including WRMJ (NBC), Fox, CBS, couple news\nreporters.\n- Less staff then usual\n- He is having a tour of the plant, followed by the town hall and then a\nmedia availability\n- Opening remarks by XX, thanks union leadership, introduces John McCain\n\n*Speech Highlights:*\n- Thank yous.\n- I\'m here because I want to see what can be done to restore and retain\njobs, but also move forward in addressing energy requirements and the great\nopportunity that lies in green technology.\n- America is hurting now -- manufacturing jobs have left, we\'re struggling\nto compete.  But let\'s talk about the future of the auto industry.\n- It\'s gonna be long, hard and tough\n- I have faith in the innovative ability of American and quality of our\nworkers -- we have the best workers\n- In the state of Ohio, more people have lost their homes than anywhere\nelse.\n- This issue is a nexis of national issues we face:\n   - 1) national security issue -- dependent on nations that are bad for our\noil supply\n   - 2) environmental issue -- there\'s enough compelling information now\nthat shows human activity is hurting the planet\n- We can become energy independent and one of the ways we can do that is\nthrough the automotive industry -- hybrids\n- But we also need nuclear energy, clean coal technology -- I\'m willing to\ninvest $2B a year in clean coal energy\n- And I believe we can rebuild the automotive industry\n- We can compete in the world; I am optimistic, but we have to take action\n- A word about nuclear power -- the French 80% of their electricity comes\nfrom nuclear, the reprocess the waste\n- We need to reprocess the waste but we need to store the waste as well --\nincluding Yucca mountain\n- None of these are the ultimate answer -- but you put them all together and\nit can work -- and we give the American worker more job opportunities and\nget them back in their homes\n- We need better job training programs\n- The same old jobs are not going to be there -- new jobs will be there,\nthey\'ll be here in Lordstown\n- I proposed a $300 million dollar prize for a battery -- it\'s been called a\ngimmick\n- I wanted to give Americans a gas-tax holiday too -- wouldn\'t it be nice to\ngive folks a break?  I think so\n- He have to have a whole broad array of initiatives to solve this\n- And who\'s getting hurt the most?  low-income, fix-income people with old\ncars\n- Thanks for having me -- these meetings are a great part of the political\nprocess\n- I\'d like to take a moment to recognize and thank the veterans\n- We\'re in two wars -- one in Iraq and Afghanistan\n- After 4 years of mishandling -- we now have a good strategy and are\nsucceeding\n- I\'d much rather lose a political campaign than a war\n- I look forward to this debate\n- No one has contributed more than our solidiers\n- It\'s gonna be a long, hard struggle but I believe we will win\n- I\'m here to tell you that -- no matter if you vote for me -- that I will\nreach across the aisle and I will always put my country first\n\n*Question and Answer:\n*Q 1) Yesterday Sen. Obama said the auto industry may need some bridges to\nreach this new technology.  What do you think about that and what would you\ndo?\nMCCAIN: I will make the research and development tax credit permanent.\nAnd I gotta give you some technology, once we develop that technology, I\nbelieve we should hand it over to private industry.\nThe Internet was created this way -- started by the federal government, then\nhanded over to the private industry where it could be further developed.  I\nam convinced we are not that far away from a pure electric car - it\'s the\nbattery and we\'re almost there.  It\'s a national priority.  When we look at\nour dependency on foreign oil, the government has to be an active\nparticipant.\n\nQ 2) Oil prices rising -- the American people are confused on what is\ncausing this.  What would you say to the American people?\nMCCAIN: I believe the root cause is finite resource that a cartel controls\nand that many countries need and desire.  That is first and foremost the\nmajor part of the problem.\nThere\'s got to be more transparency in this whole global market.  And\nthere\'s investigations going on.  If more are needed, then we should do\nthem.  But really, the root cause is basically there\'s not really an\nexpandable finite resource and we are seeing a growing demand.\nIf we develop/when we develop cars we can drive 100-200 miles, we are going\nto need more electricity.  We need nuclear plants.  We should have 45 new\nones by the year 2030.  My answer to you is the fundamental problem is there\nand we have to determine the role speculators have played.\n\nQ 3) You are strictly against opening up any trade deficits.  If our deficit\nis in the trillions, is there anyway we can make it more fair?  Our\nmanufacturing jobs are going.  My plant closed.\nMCCAIN: I don\'t believe every trade agreement is fair.  We have had various\ndisputes on the implentation of free trade agreements.  I would say that\nif/when we conclude additional free trade agreements perhaps we can do a\nbetter job of preventing unfair practices.  But I do believe there are some\nrealities of life, that when we erect barriers to other countries, they do\nthe same to us.  I also think that when we look at countries in our own\nhemisphere, that if they had a better economy they would be better to deal\nwith.  We should conclude the free trade agreement with Columbia.  I\nunderstand the pain.  I will make sure our trade practices are fair.  When I\nsay we\'re for free trade, because I believe it\'s in the best interest of the\nU.S.  I know we\'ve lost manufacturing jobs -- I don\'t have to tell you to\nlook at Detroit or the stock market -- but I don\'t think we are going to get\nthe labor intensive jobs back in America.  But I do think we\'re more\ninnovative than any countries and other kinds of jobs will come.\nThat\'s no comfort to your colleagues I\'m sure.  But I will make sure\neveryone has a second chance.\nI understand it, I will act as quickly as possible and I will provide relief\nas quickly as I can.\n\nThank you for being here today.  I will be back.\n*\n*\n-- \nCammie L.
