This cycle you stood by me and together, we won a tough re-election campaign so I can continue to deliver for my community, California and our country.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe 2016 election cycle began after Election Day and it is absolutely essential that we replenish our resources after taking part in one of the most expensive US House races in the country. There is still too much important work to be done in Washington\xc2\xa0and Silicon Valley and we cannot let a lack of funds make us vulnerable to political attacks - that is a distraction we cannot afford.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nHow much we raise by Midnight this Wednesday will determine our early budget and show the world our commitment to building on a well earned victory in November.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nMake a contribution today to help us meet our goal for Wednesday's critical end of the year deadline.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nIn November, we had an incredible turnout for a midterm election, in spite of the negative attacks from a super PAC funded by wealthy, right wing interests. We were victorious and it is because of supporters like you. I want to make sure we start the New Year off on the right foot.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nContribute today to make sure we have the resources\xc2\xa0to reach our goal.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nI cannot thank you enough for your incredible outpouring of support - we really appreciate all that you can do.\xc2\xa0 I hope you are enjoying the holidays with your family and have a prosperous New Year!\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nSincerely,\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nMike Honda\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nLearn More about the Campaign Online:\n\nFacebook |\xc2\xa0Twitter | Webpage\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nHonda for Congress\n2050 Gateway Pl\nSuite 100, PMB 218\nSan Jose CA 95110 United States\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n|    Paid For By Mike Honda for Congress    |\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nIf you believe you received this message in error or no longer to wish to receive email from us, please https://act.myngp.com/el/-6835675365293160704/-193506990330214656."
