Thanks much for your leadership on that!\n\nI'd really like to chat very briefly with you re the possible student privacy legislation that the WH is considering. \n\nWe've been on a couple of follow up calls, and we have some significant feedback and advice that I'd like to share with you personally.\n\nI know how busy you are, and I'm cc'ing Eryn and Dwight in hopes we can chat this week.\n\nBest to all the Podestas and talk soon,\n\nJim"
