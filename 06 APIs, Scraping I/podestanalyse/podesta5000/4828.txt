What a great guy!  It was fun catching up on politics with him.\r\n\r\nI wanted to follow up on the below.  Thank you for bringing it up with Neera.  We would highly value a meeting with her to discuss in more detail.  Is that something you could help make happen?\r\n\r\nWe have some recent building purchase experience that we believe she would find helpful as she evaluates how a buy vs. lease affects the strategic mission of CAP.\r\n\r\nWe want to make sure we stay engaged with CAP and help frame its presence in the market as real estate strategic planning is an evolving process, especially if building ownership continues to be a logical option.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know the best way to go about scheduling a meeting with Neera.  Thank you again for all of your help as it is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nChris\r\n\r\nChristopher Lucey\r\nManaging Director\r\nNewmark Grubb Knight Frank\r\nT 202.312.5471\r\nM 202.731.6566\r\nclucey@ngkf.com<mailto:clucey@ngkf.com>\r\n\r\n\xc3\xbe\r\n\r\n Save a Tree - Think Before You Print.

Did Katie go to the event?\r\nOn Jul 2, 2015 2:36 PM, "Lucey, Chris" <CLucey@ngkf.com<mailto:CLucey@ngkf.com>> wrote:\r\nJohn and Mary:\r\n\r\nI hope you and the whole clan are doing well.\r\n\r\nI thought of you last night as Katie and I were at the home of Lee Satterfield and Patrick Steel for a fundraiser for Hillary.\r\n\r\nI wanted to reach out to you regarding CAP.  My business partner, Doug Damron, was part of the team that represented CAP in its most recent office lease transaction in 2010.  He worked closely with Sarah Wartell and Kaliope Poulianos.  Also I understand that there were serious conversations about buying a building as well as leasing at that time.\r\n\r\nThe current lease expiration is 3/31/2021 (into Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s 2nd Presidential term!) and while that is several years away it may make sense for us to get re-engaged to do a strategic real estate plan for CAP \xe2\x80\x93 especially if building ownership is something that is to be considered.  Given the administrative changes at CAP with Sarah Wartell and Kaliope Poulianos no longer with the organization, we no longer have the appropriate contacts to keep CAP informed on the real estate market.\r\n\r\nAny help in reaching out to the powers that be would be greatly appreciated. We want to continue to count CAP as a client and be a resource for them at all times.\r\n\r\nI wish you a happy and safe 4th of July!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nChris\r\n\r\nChristopher Lucey\r\nManaging Director\r\n[http://www.ngkf.com/redline.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNewmark Grubb Knight Frank\r\n1899 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Suite 300\r\nWashington, D.C. 20006\r\n\r\nT 202.312.5471<tel:202.312.5471>\r\nM 202.731.6566<tel:202.731.6566>\r\nclucey@ngkf.com<mailto:clucey@ngkf.com>\r\n\r\n[Newmark Grubb Knight Frank]<http://www.ngkf.com/>\r\n\r\n\r\n[Facebook]<http://www.facebook.com/Newmarkkf>  [Twitter] <https://twitter.com/ngkf>   [LinkedIn] <http://www.linkedin.com/company/newmark-grubb-knight-frank>\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc3\xbe Save a Tree - Think Before You Print.
