This year, we are planning to make the \xe2\x80\x9cCompliance 1010\xe2\x80\x9d event a truly global platform and are inviting eminent speakers, lawyers and compliance professionals having expertise and experience in different areas of laws and we assure that this year\xe2\x80\x99s event would be more interesting, enriching and encouraging for all participant organizations.\n\nWe have come a relatively long way in a short period of time. It is important to understand the different reasons why compliance has evolved into what it is today, and why it is necessary to adapt to the changing circumstances in industries, listen to compliance professionals, and concern ourselves with getting to the \xe2\x80\x9cnext level.\xe2\x80\x9d Compliance is now looked at from a different perspective from a \xe2\x80\x98must do\xe2\x80\x99 approach replaced by \xe2\x80\x98want to do\xe2\x80\x99 attitude.  The change in nomenclature from simply \xe2\x80\x9cCompliance Officer\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cChief Compliance Officer\xe2\x80\x9d is a result of the increased role compliance has in many corporations today and the way corporations are proactively choosing to be compliant. Naming new versions of something has a purpose: it helps those who are behind to know they are behind.\n\nThe theme for this year\xe2\x80\x99s Awards is \xe2\x80\x98Compliance by Choice\xe2\x80\x99. Considering the evolution of the role of the Compliance function, which is now being viewed as an integral part of the business, imperatives will drive the need to view Compliance as a tool for competitive advantage and integration with the community in which businesses operate in. Hence \xe2\x80\x98Compliance by Choice\xe2\x80\x99. There is a cultural shift where now compliance officers hold a more high profile position in the compliance function which is proactively involved in control frameworks, decision making, training, product design etc.\n\nLegasis with Lex Witness as Legal Magazine Partner is pleased to invite submissions for the 2015 Compliance Awards to honor those compliance professionals who have played an active role in bringing out this change.\nThrough a panel of independent jury we would be analysing your contributions that impacted the organisational behaviour on compliances.\n\nYour submissions will help us measure and reward value delivered to the organization by bringing out culture of compliance rather than the more conventional metrics such as size, budget and a \xe2\x80\x98tick the box\xe2\x80\x99 approach. This unique analysis will be the basis for recognising and rewarding Compliance Champions across India Inc.\n\nFor online submissions visit http://compliance1010.com/news_events/event_registration.aspx\n\nSaturday, October 10, 2015\nFour Seasons Hotel, Mumbai,\n1900 hrs to 2100 hrs followed by Cocktails & Dinner\n\nFor any queries or questions please contact Legasis on:\n\nNazneen Nakra\nLegasis Services Pvt.
