As was communicated in early December, there are some important changes for those individuals who claimed "EXEMPT" tax status in 2014. Please pay close attention to the information below as it could have a significant impact on your paycheck, particularly if you claimed "EXEMPT" on your Federal, Maryland or Virginia taxes in 2014.\r\n\r\nFederal Taxes\r\n\r\nIf you claimed "EXEMPT" from Federal taxes in 2014, you must enter withholding information for 2015 in GMS by Friday, February 13th. If you do not make any changes in GMS by this date, Georgetown University is required by law to withhold taxes at the highest rate (single status and zero withholding allowances) until new information is entered.\r\n\r\nState Taxes\r\n\r\nIf you claimed "EXEMPT" status on your State taxes (MD and VA only) and wish to continue that status in 2015, you will also need to submit a 2015 state tax form to Payroll by Friday, February 13th. State withholding forms are found on the Human Resources website by going to the Employment Services section and clicking on Forms<http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/ctt?kn=1&ms=MjIwMzk1NjUS1&r=NzgyMDgzMjk1MTMS1&b=0&j=NDgzMTUzNzE1S0&mt=1&rt=0>.\r\n\r\nIf you do not wish to continue the \xe2\x80\x9cEXEMPT\xe2\x80\x9d status and do NOT submit a state tax form with your changes, the following tax status and withholding updates will automatically occur:\r\n\r\n  *   For Virginia residents - You will be defaulted to single status with zero exemptions.\r\n\r\n  *   For Maryland residents - Your status will revert to your last MW507 form completed that did not claim an exemption from withholding.  If a MW507 form was not filed, you will default to one exemption until new information is submitted.\r\n\r\nThis does not apply to residents of the District of Columbia; your 2014 withholding elections will carry over into 2015 if no changes are made.\r\n\r\nIf you currently have Federal or State taxes being withheld and do not want to change your withholdings for 2015, simply do nothing and they will remain in force for next year.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to review your information. As always, if you have questions, please contact Payroll Services at payrollservices@georgetown.edu<mailto:payrollservices@georgetown.edu>.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nClaudette Richardson\r\nDirector of Payroll Services\r\n[http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/open/log/22039565/NzgyMDgzMjk1MTMS1/0/NDgzMTUzNzE1S0/1/0]\r\n'
