It is somewhat esoteric but not that complicated  \n\nIt centers on theme that money managers should put interests of clients first.  That is not true now. Obama administration estimates 17 bil in unnecessary fees yearly. \n\nWhat does this mean in practical terms. ?  I know a woman who invested 100k in 2000. 15 tears later she had 125 k.  If she had simply invested in Vanguard Wellington index fund, she would have 400 k. \n\nNaturally, Wall St and Republicans are opposed. \n \nSent from my iPad'
