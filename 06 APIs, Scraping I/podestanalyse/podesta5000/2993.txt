We\nhave about 60% of the support of AFL-CIO unions and we needed 66%.  1.\nSanders will never receive the AFL-CIO endorsement.  Its impossible  2.  We\nshould let the affiliates that have endorse speak to how they feel about\nthe AFL-CIO silence on this (which I don\'t think will be positive for the\nAFL-CIO).\n\n\n\nLet me double check my math...but its very damn near close to 60%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Feb 17, 2016 at 5:56 PM, Jesse Ferguson <\njferguson@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\nSanders campaign is touting this as a victory for them.

From the\nvery start of the presidential contest, we have been clear that we have an\nendorsement process in place, and that we will continue to follow that\nprocess in accordance with our Constitution.\n\nMost importantly, we will further elevate the Raising Wages agenda and hold\nall politicians accountable to it.\n\nWe also continue to encourage affiliated unions to pursue their own\ndeliberations with their members and come to their own endorsement\ndecisions, if any, through open and rigorous debate.  Many unions have\nendorsed a candidate, and many have not.\n\nOur country is engaged in a vigorous national debate about our next\npresident, and we look forward to a robust discussion of the issues at our\nCouncil meeting.\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer: *If you do not wish to receive further news/releases from\nAFL-CIO, please click the following link: [Remove Me]\n<https://influencers.meltwater.com/unsubscribe/mPress?c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iv=AD4A975A7AB69DE83821B6A546497653>.\nRequests will take a maximum of 2 business days to process.\n\nContact information: AFL-CIO Communications Department ., AFL-CIO, 815 16st\nNW, Washington, DC 20006\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\nNikki Budzinski\n\nLabor Outreach Director\n\nHillary for America\n\n646-854-1442 (direct)\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nJesse F.
