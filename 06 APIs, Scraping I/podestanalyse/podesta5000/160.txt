In reality, they are seeking exactly what we are celebrating this week -  a safe place to live and work, and the opportunity to live a life free from war and oppression.\n\nWith your support (http://asylumaccess.org/donate) , we can still change the reality for millions of refugees around the world.\nhttp://asylumaccess.org/donateOur volunteer-based model leverages every dollar donated into 40.00 USD worth of legal services, helping refugees access legal status, and their rights to work, housing, and education.\nPlease, donate today and help us make refugee rights a reality.\n\nWith gratitude,\nEmily Arnold Fernandez\nExecutive Director\nhttp://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Feepurl.com%2FbG8xG1 Share (http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Feepurl.com%2FbG8xG1)\nhttp://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Wishing+you+a+happy+holiday+weekend.: http%3A%2F%2Feepurl.com%2FbG8xG1 Tweet (http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Wishing+you+a+happy+holiday+weekend.: http%3A%2F%2Feepurl.com%2FbG8xG1)\nhttp://us2.forward-to-friend.com/forward?u=9366053d26e0045c1bbf10365&id=01d988eff6&e=22be14b57e Forward (http://us2.forward-to-friend.com/forward?u=9366053d26e0045c1bbf10365&id=01d988eff6&e=22be14b57e)\n\n============================================================\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2015 Asylum Access.
