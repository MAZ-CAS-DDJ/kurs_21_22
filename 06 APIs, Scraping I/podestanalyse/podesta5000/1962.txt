john.podesta@gmail.comb'Robby & John\n\nI understand more debates are being added. I also sent the below to Charlie. Please have a look at the attached document.\n\nAs you know, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with the DNC on a science and environmental forum and have good will and credibility.\n\nIn considering debates, we\xe2\x80\x99re pitching the attached CNN science & environmental debate moderated by Wolf Blitzer.\n\nThis debate will make history and contrast democrats with republicans in substantive ways that especially appeal to young people and suburban women swing voters, and that are different from all other debates.\n\nAll best\n\nShawn Otto\n\n\n'
