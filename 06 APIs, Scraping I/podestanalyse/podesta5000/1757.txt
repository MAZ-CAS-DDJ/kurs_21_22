Help LCV Action Fund raise $16,235 in the next 12 hours for Tammy Baldwin's campaign: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=rB7O4On5Hn61xXkTeMYt0w .\n\nI know Wisconsin and I know Tammy Baldwin. I can tell you that she will fight to protect our environment in the U.S. Senate. But with just\xa060 days left until November 6, she needs our help right now.\n\nThe most recent polls show a tightening race. Tammy is within striking distance of overtaking Tommy Thompson in the race for Wisconsin's U.S. Senate seat, and now millions in corporate special-interest cash courtesy of Karl Rove and the Koch brothers is pouring into the state -- including half a million dollars from one group just two weeks ago.\n\nThat's just the beginning. They'll keep coming all the way until Election Day. But if we act now, while it's still early enough to make a difference, we can put these false attacks on Tammy's record to rest.\n\nWill you join me to help Tammy? Will you chip in with a donation today of $24 via LCV Action Fund's GiveGreen. Let's help Tammy keep fighting and win in November: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=vcOwJtyju3LdQKWDM8LWuQ .\n\nHere's the thing: we can't match Karl Rove and the Koch brothers dollar-for-dollar. But here's what we can do -- we can help Tammy put together one of the best ground games in the history of Wisconsin. With an election this close, it's going to be decided by turnout, and right now, Tammy is mobilizing grassroots supporters in every one of Wisconsin's 72 counties.\n\nTammy will be a fighter for progressive values in the U.S. Senate. That is what she has done in Congress, where she has an outstanding LCV lifetime score of 97 percent. She's demonstrated time and again that she's a true environmental leader and a real fighter.\n\nSo far, LCV supporters have raised $83,765 for Tammy Baldwin, but I know we can do better. Will you chip in right now to help reach $100,000 for Tammy by MIDNIGHT tonight?\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=wfne_hfazNltdIRYXNlyRw\n\nIf LCV supporters join together and support environmental leaders like Tammy Baldwin, we can deal the Koch brothers a major setback in 2012. I hope you'll help Tammy Baldwin through GiveGreen right now.\n\nThank you for supporting Tammy Baldwin and LCV Action Fund.\n\nBest --\n\nRuss Feingold\n\nPaid for by the League of Conservation Voters Action Fund, www.lcvactionfund.org, and not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.\n\n\nUpdate Your Profile\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=gA98eNS8FgR1BJb1WGf0lw\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=IYDrjEIS5WSolmLUjrDm0qs-ZejFq4w8&cid=0\n\n1920 L Street, NW Suite 800\nWashington, DC 20036\n202-785-8683\n\n"
