"The squeeze on families because of child and other care costs is tremendous," says Ben Zipperer, research economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. "For policymakers, the solution is clear: Embrace policies that provide universal access to affordable, high-quality child care."\nEconomic News | Back to Top\n\nHillary Clinton Aim Is to Thwart Quick Buck on Wall Street\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/28/business/dealbook/clinton-aim-is-to-thwart-quick-buck-on-wall-st.html?ref=business\nNew York Times - Andrew Ross Sorkin\nIf Mrs. Clinton becomes president, her remarks may turn out to be more than campaign talking points - and could radically change the way investors and chief executives behave.\n\nAnother Fight for Fair Pay in New York\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/28/opinion/another-fight-for-fair-pay-in-new-york.html?ref=opinion\nNew York Times - Editorial Board\nThe issue is payroll cards - prepaid debit cards issued to employees and refilled each payday with the employees\' wages in lieu of paper checks or direct deposits into a worker\'s bank account.\n\nUnder Jeb Bush, housing prices fueled Florida\'s boom.

A new report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers argues that the way licensing is applied in practice often leads to higher prices, reduced opportunity, and more macroeconomic fragility.\n\nThe Myth of New Orleans\'s Affordability\nhttp://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/07/cities-housing-rental-affordability-new-orleans/399695/\nThe Atlantic - Gillian B.

Social policies have also acknowledged that efforts differ, and that people respond to incentives. Prevailing measures of inequality (in outcomes or opportunities) do not, however, measure incomes consistently with personal choices of effort. The direction of bias is unclear given the heterogeneity in efforts and preferences. Data on the labor supplies of single American adults suggest that adjusting for effort imposing common preferences attenuates inequality, although the effect is small. Allowing for preference heterogeneity consistently with behavior suggests higher inequality.\n\n'
