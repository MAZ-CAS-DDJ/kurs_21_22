With the deadline to buy airtime on television today, it is crucial that we maximize our buy to enhance our reach. Jack is out there every day, traveling Iowa end to end, to carry his vision of a fresh start for this great state to the voters. But we need your help.\n\n\nWe need your help to make sure we can buy as much time as possible. $10, $20, or $50 goes a long way.\nhttps://act.myngp.com/Forms/-4364261426736068864\n\n\nThis deadline is the last chance we will have to reserve space on TV before the election. Jack wants every voter to know about his plans for reducing the income tax for Iowa's working families, and his vision for creating access to universal preschool for Iowa's 4 year olds. These ideas are resonating with voters, and the polls have all shown the same thing: the gap has closed significantly, despite Terry Branstad's millions of negative advertising.\n\n\nCan you contribute $10, $20, or $30 before TODAY's deadline to make sure Iowans are given the opportunity to make the clear choice for governor?\nhttps://act.myngp.com/Forms/-4364261426736068864\n\n\nWe can't do this without you.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nGrant Woodard\n\nCampaign Manager\n\nTeam Hatch/Vernon\n\n\nChip in!\nhttps://act.myngp.com/Forms/-4364261426736068864\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 Neighbors for Hatch, Inc.
