john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear Law Center Community:\n\nWe have all been shocked and saddened by the devastation in Nepal.  As Fr. O\x92Brien, University Vice President for Mission and Ministry, said in his email, there will be a main campus interfaith prayer service on Tuesday, April 28th at 4 p.m. In the Dahlgren Quadrangle.\n\nHere at the Law Center we will also have a brief and simple interfaith prayer service on Thursday, April 30th at 12:40 p.m. in the St. Thomas More Chapel (first floor McDonough).  All are welcome to attend.  The normal 12:15 mass will begin at 12:00 in order to accommodate the service.\n\nPlease also consider making a donation to the relief efforts.  Georgetown\x92s Center for Social Justice (CSJ) has set up a fund to support humanitarian aid and disaster relief to the area. Donations can be made here<http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/ctt?kn=1&ms=MjI1NDYwMDAS1&r=NzE1OTM1MTE1MzUS1&b=0&j=NTQyNzg5NjAzS0&mt=1&rt=0>. All donations will be directed to a Jesuit-related organization on the ground in Nepal and a relief agency providing direct short or long-term assistance. Organizations are being vetted now and will be posted on the website.\n\nBoth in our daily masses and in the prayer proper to each of our traditions we in Campus Ministry will continue to ask God\x92s help for all those afflicted by this unimaginable calamity.  Every tragedy is also an invitation to greater solidarity and a deepened realization of our shared humanity.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\nFr. Paul Rourke, S.J.\nDirector\nLaw Center Campus Ministry\n\n\n'
