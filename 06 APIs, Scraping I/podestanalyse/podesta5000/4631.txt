It doesn't appear as though we have a problem on the server itself; it may be an issue with the device. I'd recommend removing and replacing the battery, as this looks much like the BlackBerry device losing its network connection and then failing to try and reestablish it. If that doesn't work, I'll engage with RIM support.\n\n\n--\nWill Thomas\nDirector, Information Technology\nCenter for American Progress\n202 682 1611\n== sent from BlackBerry ==\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Juliana Gendelman\nTo: Will Thomas; Rhon Hayes; Steve Heibein\nCc: 'john.podesta@gmail.com'\nSent: Sat Jan 17 15:17:55 2009\nSubject: John's Blackberry\nJohn has not been receiving emailed on his CAP blackberry since Tuesday.
