john.podesta@gmail.comb"t r u t h o u t | Is your inbox flooded with unwanted, misleading fundraising emails? We suspect so, judging by the popularity of a recent William Rivers Pitt op-ed about the onslaught of doomsday emails from political campaigns.\n\nSo what makes this email any different? The answer: Truthout doesn't take corporate money or even money from political parties - we really do rely almost entirely on contributions from readers like you. And we came up short in our last fundraising drive, which makes it even more essential that we raise the $43,000 or more still needed in this campaign.\n\nWill you come through for us with a $5 donation right now?\n\nIt's crucial that we reach this goal if we are to continue to expose the corrupt corporate-driven narratives that dominate much of the US political landscape. Please, if you can - make a tax-deductible donation towards truly impactful independent news today! Truthout's future depends on you.\n\nClick here to donate: https://members.truth-out.org/donate\n(Truthout is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.
