Only \nproblem was, that since the \xe2\x80\x9ccredit  default\xe2\x80\x9d business was completely \nunregulated, AIG had no capital requirements to  guarantee that they could pay off.   \nTo prevent what they thought might be a world-wide systemic meltdown, the  \nGovernment was ultimately forced to invest $180 billion of taxpayer money, \nand  now owns 80% of the company.  \nBut earlier this year AIG actually paid $168 million in bonuses to  \nexecutives and traders in the company\xe2\x80\x99s Financial Products Division that had run  \nthe \xe2\x80\x9ccredit default swap\xe2\x80\x9d program, causing universal outrage.  \nDoes it make any sense at all to give even more financial rewards to the  \nvery people who have helped put millions of Americans out of work and caused \nthe  worst economic downturn since the Great Depression?  Of course not, but \nthat is exactly what  AIG management is poised to do.   \nOne of the problems the company\xe2\x80\x99s management says it confronts is that  \nthey are \xe2\x80\x9ccontractually bound\xe2\x80\x9d to make these payments.  Apparently contractual \nobligations mean  more when it comes to stock speculators than it does when \nit comes to labor  agreements where companies constantly demand changes if \xe2\x80\x9c\neconomic circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d  warrant.  At the very least, they  should make the \npeople who helped bring us the recession sue the company in open  court and \ntell a jury why they deserve millions of dollars in bonus money for  the \nbrilliant job they  did. \nKenneth Feinberg, the U.S. Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s point man on compensation for  bailed \nout firms, has advised the company to scale back its payments to avoid  \nanother public firestorm.  He is  dead on.   \nBut AIG is only the tip of the iceberg.  According to the Washington Post, \nJ.P. Morgan Chase has  set aside $2.78 billion in compensation for its \ninvestment bankers for the third  quarter \xe2\x80\x93 a 28% increase over the same period \nlast year. \nJ.P. Morgan Chase is able to pay those kinds of bonuses because the  \nfinancial bailout by the taxpayers has put it \xe2\x80\x93 and the other big Wall Street  \nBanks -- in a position where they will generate very strong profits in the \nthird  quarter.  J.P. Morgan Chase itself  will generate profits of $3.59 \nbillion \xe2\x80\x93 the strongest results in two  years.   \nCommunity and Regional banks, on the other hand, are in deep trouble. The  \ndifference is that the Wall Street banks are making money on investment \nbanking  activities \xe2\x80\x93 on underwriting equity plays and speculative trades \xe2\x80\x93 \nexactly the  activities that sent the financial sector into a tailspin.  The \nCommunity and Regional banks, on the  other hand, are restricted to \ntraditional banking activities \xe2\x80\x93 receiving  deposits and making loans.  But the  \nrecession has caused demand for loans to drop and delinquencies on loans to  \nincrease.  \nSo the Community and Regional  banks that didn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to do with \ncausing the recession are paying the  price -- along with the rest of \nAmerica.  But the big Wall Street banks that  actually caused this catastrophe are \nrolling in money and handing it out in huge  chunks to the brilliant young \nspeculators that drove the process.    \nThat ain\xe2\x80\x99t right.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not  right morally and it certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t right \neconomically.  If the economic incentives continue to  encourage reckless \nspeculation and penalize sound banking, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get  reckless \nspeculation. \nThe Obama Administration has made regulatory reform proposals that are  the \nfirst step down the road to changing these economic incentives \xe2\x80\x93 and \nreining  in the massive power of the financial sector as a whole. This package \nincludes  regulation of so called "derivatives" -- essentially bets on the \ndirection of  underlying investment instruments -- including the "credit default \nswaps" that  sunk AIG.  Their passage is not just  a matter of \xe2\x80\x9cgood policy\xe2\x80\x9d\n \xe2\x80\x93 it is a matter of national economic  security.. \nIf our economic system continues to be dominated by an outsized financial  \nsector \xe2\x80\x93 if world-class reckless risk-taking continues to receive massive  \neconomic rewards \xe2\x80\x93 then we are headed to another financial collapse in two  \nyears, or five years or fifteen years.   \nJust as surely as America had to change the policies  that had made it \nvulnerable to terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, we have  to change the \npolicies that made us vulnerable to the attack of the Wall Street  speculators \nthat culminated in the collapse of Lehman Brothers on September 15,  2008.  \nRobert Creamer is  a long-time political organizer and strategist, and \nauthor of the recent book:  \xe2\x80\x9cStand Up Straight: How Progressives Can Win,\xe2\x80\x9d \navailable on _amazon.com_ \n(http://www.amazon.com/Listen-Your-Mother-Straight-Progressives/dp/0979585295/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1206567141&sr=8-1\n) . \n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
