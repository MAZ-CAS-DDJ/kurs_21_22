Below and attached are some articles that do mention CCI, including some comments by the Mexico City Mayor. Perhaps more importantly, although the landfill closure has been announced, Mexico City is receiving increasing criticism for not effectively handling the waste that continues to be generated. In some ways, it's good for us to NOT be in the current wave of stories. We will work on ways to enhance communications around this when the story (and reality on the ground) improves. CCI staff have offered to help the city better handle this process, but CCI staff say the City is unfortunately not currently taking any tangible/urgent steps to correct the situation or improve the collection/diversion of garbage being generated at present. According to CCI staff, Mayor Bloomberg was going to call the Mayor of Mexico City to congratulate him on the closure of the landfill but then punted on making that call as it became clearer that the city isn't implementing this effectively. We'd be happy to provide more information if it would be helpful, and we'd welcome his feedback. Thanks, Ami\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Julius Tintelnot\r\nTo: Amitabh Desai\r\nSent: Thu Jan 26 18:59:40 2012\r\nSubject: Bordo Poniente\r\n\r\n\r\nAmi:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached is the statement made by Mayor Ebrard regarding the closure of the Bordo Poniente landfill. This was sent to us by CCI and is translated from Spanish into English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following press release was issued directly by C40-CCI: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bordo-poniente-landfill-closing-helps-green-mexico-city-136063528.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow are related articles that mention CCI or WJC. There were far more Spanish ones, which are not included here. The statement by the Mayor is the strongest endorsement of WJC. Most of these simply mention the partnership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs Mexico City's 'Plan Verde' a Model for Latin America?
