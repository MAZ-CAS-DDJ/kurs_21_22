john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear Mr. Podesta:\n\nI was not alarmed by the violence in Ohio last night\nas much as I was by the reactions and particularly\nby the arguments of Trump\'s supporters. Some of\nthe CNN people made me think that Turner doen\'t\nreason any more or that he has always been simply\nfascist.\n\nI believe that you are facing an extremely dangerous\npossibility because Trump\'s fascism is based on an\nauthoritarianism audience that cannot reason and is\na high percentage of the population. I wonder if it\nhas not become inevitable to begin denouncing his\nfascist strategies and tendencies.\n\nHe does not explain any of his promises, he corrects\nhimself if something does not turn out to be convenient\nand he evades any possible criticism by talking about\nhis basic positions like bringing back production from\nChina as if the owners of the companies producing\nthere could simply be told to go back to the States\nwhere they will make more profits. Who is going to\nmake the owners of Jockey make the shorts in the\nStates and who is going to give orders to Dupont\nor Nabisco? Establishing new competing companies\nin the States would take at least ten years or more.\n\nOn the other hand, consciously or out of utterly\ndevious passion, Sanders is also resorting to\nfascist strategies but in simple, understandable\nlanguage, and the ceaseless repetition of the\nsame words is an old Goebbels tactic, whether\nhe knows or not, but it is beginning to appear\ndestructive for Mrs. Clinton. I feel that she\ncould repeatedly play around with the praises\nof Cuban health services and education but\nalways stressing that they are an achievment\nof a dictatorship, that the American people\ndo not want to sacrifice freedom and justice\nover night for universal free health services.\n\nOn the other hand, she or somebody else in\nher retinue could play with the fact that Sanders\nis making the people believe that his revolution\nis going to be God\'s gift because otherwise he\nwould have to organize an armed revolution.\nWho has the power to put and end to Wall\nStreet? Does he want an America without\nmillionaires. None of the promises he repeats\nonce and again can be kept without a power\nthat a President of the United States does not\nhave. Is he going to decide that Congress is\ngoing to approve by asking the people to make\ntelephone calls to the representatives and to\nthe senators?\n\nFor your own knowledge in case that you did\nnot feel much interest for the subject, I am\nattaching a few things about a "Trumpish"\nfascism that used the same strategies and\nmeans.\n\nI hope these messages do not become\ndisagreable to you, but I do worry about the\nuse of military force, and because I have\nfamily in the United States who have nothing\nto do with politics and I do not want them to\nbe "Trumped".\n\nSincerely,\n\nD.
