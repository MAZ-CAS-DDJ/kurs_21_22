Raid funding for lead abatement. Defund Planned Parenthood. Travel around doing anything to back Trump and his base of right-wing supporters.\n\nAnd while Christie jets around the country to support Trump, New Jersey commuters are stuck on trains that run late and roads that are crumbling and clogged with gridlock.\n\nThe state's transportation trust fund is broke. Our property taxes remain the highest in the nation. Our unemployment rate is the highest in the region. Our foreclosure rate is second to none.\n\nEither Governor Christie comes home and performs the job for which we continue to pay him or he needs to get out of the way -- sign the petition:\n\nhttp://www.DoYourJobOrQuit.com\n\nThank you,\n\nPhil\n\nPhilip D.
