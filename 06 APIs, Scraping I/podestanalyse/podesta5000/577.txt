Pat is CGI America's Working Group Manager for Clean Fuel and Transportation.  He was thrilled to learn of your interest in contributing to the sessions and would welcome the opportunity to speak with you further to identify how best to incorporate you into the America meeting agenda.\n\nI'll leave it to Pat to provide you with more information on his plans and connect with you on a possible role.\n\nIn addition, I'll provide you with an update draft of the CGI Annual Meeting program memo in the coming days as we complete a further revision.\n\nThanks again for all of your help and all the best,\n\nEd\n\n\nEd Hughes\nDeputy Director and Director of Program\nCLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE\n+1.212.397.2255\nwww.clintonglobalinitiative.org<http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org>\n"
