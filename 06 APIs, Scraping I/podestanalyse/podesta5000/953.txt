Was her statement\n> inaccurate?*\n>\n>\n>\n> No information in Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s emails was marked classified at the time she\n> sent or received them.  Clinton only used her account for unclassified\n> email.\n>\n>\n>\n> When information is reviewed for public release, it is common for\n> information *previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified*\n> <http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/05/22/408774111/state-department-to-release-more-clinton-emails-today>\n> if the State Department or another agency believes its public release could\n> cause potential harm to national security, law enforcement or diplomatic\n> relations.\n>\n>\n>\n> After reviewing a sampling of the 55,000 pages of emails, the Inspectors\n> General have proffered that four emails, which did not contain any\n> classified markings and/or dissemination controls, should have been\n> classified at the time they were sent.  The State Department has said it\n> disagrees with this assessment.\n>\n>\n>\n> Clinton hopes the State Department and other relevant agencies will sort\n> out as quickly as possible which of the 55,000 pages of emails are\n> appropriate to release to the public.\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> *Is Department of Justice conducting a criminal inquiry into Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\n> email use? *\n>\n>\n>\n> No. As the Department of Justice and Inspectors General made clear, the\n> IG\xe2\x80\x99s made a security referral.  This was not criminal in nature as\n> misreported by some in the press.  The Department of Justice is now\n> seeking assurances about the storage of materials related to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\n> email account.\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> *Is it true that her email server and a thumb drive were recently turned\n> over the government.   Why?*\n>\n>\n>\n> Again, when information is reviewed for public release, it is common for\n> information *previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified*\n> <http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/05/22/408774111/state-department-to-release-more-clinton-emails-today>\n> if the State Department or another agency believes its public release could\n> cause potential harm to national security, law enforcement or diplomatic\n> relations.\n>\n>\n>\n> It is her hope that State and the other agencies involved in the review\n> process will sort out as quickly as possible which emails are appropriate\n> to release to the public, and that the release will be as timely and as\n> transparent as possible.\n>\n>\n>\n> In the meantime, her team has worked with the State Department to\n> ensure her emails are stored in a safe and secure manner.\n>\n>\n>\n> As a result, she directed her team to give her email server to the\n> Department of Justice, as well as a thumb drive containing copies\n> of her emails already provided to the State Department.  We have pledged to\n> cooperate with the government\'s security inquiry\xe2\x80\x94if it decides it needs to\n> see more, we will arrange for that to happen.\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> *Would this issue not have arisen if she used a state.gov\n> <http://state.gov> email address?*\n>\n>\n>\n> Even if Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s emails had been on a government email address and\n> government device, these questions would be raised prior to public release.\n>\n>\n>\n> While State Department\xe2\x80\x99s review of her 55,000 emails brought the issue to\n> the Inspectors Generals\' attentions, the emails that were classified prior\n> to public release were on the unclassified .gov email system. They were not\n> on the separate, closed system used by State Department for handling\n> classified communications.\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> ------------------------------\n>\n> This message and any attachments are intended only for the addressee and\n> may contain information that is privileged and confidential.
