Despite being the victim of\nthis heinous crime, the Girl of Qatif was sentenced to 200 lashes and\nsix months in prison. This sentence was unjustifiable, and I am glad to\nsee that it has been overturned. We cannot truly end the epidemic of\nviolence against women unless we can end the silence and stigma that so\noften accompanies these crimes, and ensure that those who have\nexperienced violent sexual assault are not blamed or jailed for what\nthey have endured.  I am pleased to note that the Saudi government has\nannounced reforms to its legal system, and I encourage them to continue\nthat process so that all Saudis - both men and women - have equal\nprotection under the law."\n\n \n\nSenator Clinton, a longtime champion of women\'s rights around the world,\npreviously expressed outrage at this sentence, and joined with several\nof her colleagues last week in introducing a resolution urging the Saudi\ngovernment to overturn the sentence of the Girl of Qatif.\n\n \n\n \n\n###\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n'
