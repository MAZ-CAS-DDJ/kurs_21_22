john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hands full may be a misnomer.  I had my hand operated on on Wednesday and\nI\'m walking around  my right hand in a big bandage. I\'ll check into this.\n\nGood luck this week with your adoring fans and your crazy critics. Seems\nreally good so far.\n\nMary sends love.\n\nJP\n\n<hrod17@clintonemail.com> wrote:\n>\n> Dear John,\n>\n> I know your hands are full, but I don\'t want the President\'s wildlife\nconservation initiative to wither away.

Once these recommendations have\nbeen publicly adopted our plan is to work with the Task Force on specific\ntactics for implementation.\n>\n> David and I are going to try and get meetings with Kerry, Jewel and\nHolder to ensure that the implementation of the new strategy proceeds\nexpeditiously. Also continuing to work on getting a meeting with Ben and\nJohn Podesta. We had a call with Task Force reps from Interior and State on\nThursday which was incredibly disappointing. The initiative appears to have\nbeen pushed pretty far down in both Departments and we are concerned that\nwithout WH prodding not much will happen to move things forward. Will let\nyou know if we need help in getting the meetings.\n>\n> Finally, I\'ve been able to move things around on my calendar so I plan to\nattend the WCS event at the Zoo on Thursday and hope to see you there.\n>\n> J\n>\n> --\n> Judith A.
