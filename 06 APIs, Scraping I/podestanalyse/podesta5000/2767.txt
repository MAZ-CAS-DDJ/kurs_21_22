She will embark on an unofficial listening tour to gather ideas\nfrom the business community, union leaders and others. And she will seek\nadvice from such far-flung advisers as an ad man in Austin, Tex., behind\nthe iconic \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Mess With Texas\xe2\x80\x9d campaign and a leading strategist at a\nBoston-based public affairs consulting firm with ties to the Kennedys.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic debacle in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s midterm elections has put new urgency\non Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to create a blueprint for a 2016 presidential\ncandidacy, including exploring White Plains as a possible national\nheadquarters and digesting exit polls to determine what the midterm results\ncould mean for the presidential electoral map.\n\n\n\nA number of advisers saw only upside for Mrs. Clinton in the party\xe2\x80\x99s\nmidterm defeats. Before then, opinions had been mixed about when she should\nform an exploratory committee, the first step toward declaring a\npresidential candidacy, with some urging her to delay it until late spring.\n\n\n\nBut over the past few days, a consensus formed among those close to Mrs.\nClinton that it is time to accelerate her schedule: She faces pressure to\nresurrect the Democratic Party, and she is already being scrutinized as the\nparty\xe2\x80\x99s presumptive nominee, so advisers see little reason to delay.\n\n\n\nNo action will be taken before the Dec. 6 runoff in Louisiana between\nSenator Mary L. Landrieu, a Democrat and a Clinton friend, and her\nRepublican challenger, Rep. Bill Cassidy, putting the likely date for the\nestablishing an exploratory committee in early next year, said several\nClinton advisers who insisted on anonymity in discussing private\nconversations.\n\n\n\nDonors, meanwhile, have already started to discuss a Clinton candidacy, at\ntimes barely veiling a giddy excitement.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Ready for Hillary, a \xe2\x80\x9csuper PAC\xe2\x80\x9d that supports her\ncandidacy, sent a fund-raising email. \xe2\x80\x9cNow more than ever we need to show\nHillary that we\xe2\x80\x99re ready for her to get in this race,\xe2\x80\x9d the plea for\ndonations read. \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica needs Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s leadership.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn many ways, Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s election results clear a path for Mrs. Clinton. The\nlopsided outcome and conservative tilt makes it less likely she would face\nan insurgent challenger from the left.\n\n\n\nAnd a Republican-led Senate creates a handy foil for her to run against:\nRather than the delicate task of trying to draw a stark contrast with an\nunpopular president in whose administration she served, her loyalists say,\nMrs. Clinton can instead present herself as a pragmatic alternative to what\nthey predict will be an obstructionist Republican Congress.\n\n\n\n"Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and their allies in the House" will be "pushing\nRepublican leadership hard," said Geoff Garin, a pollster who succeeded\nMark Penn as chief strategist for Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 campaign. "When that\nhappens it will give Hillary Clinton or whoever the Democratic nominee is a\nbetter platform to run."\n\n\n\nBut before any campaigning begins, Mrs. Clinton will first embark on a\nlistening tour that echoes what she did first as a candidate for the Senate\nin New York and then as a freshman senator, gathering ideas and advice from\na cross-section of influential people about their concerns.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll slow down a bit, get off the radar, get ready for this, and ready\nincludes being a good freshman senator, with a legal pad and lots of\nconversations,\xe2\x80\x9d said one person with direct knowledge of her plans who\nspoke on condition of anonymity because the plans have not been made public.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the people around Mrs. Clinton will speed up their efforts to\nvet potential campaign aides, casually connect with donors and begin to\nhelp Mrs. Clinton craft a clearer message, especially on the economy.\nAlthough Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s midterm campaigning schedule took her to Iowa,\nPennsylvania, Colorado, North Carolina and other important 2016 states, she\ndid not spend much time getting to know the specific concerns of voters,\nsomething she would need to do ahead of a presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nExit polls from Tuesday are being pored over for signs about what voters\xe2\x80\x99\nopinions could mean for Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s message and approach. Midterm voters\nexpressed frustration with government, but also economic unease.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the questions for 2016 is: Which of those will 2016 be about? Will\nit be about the size and cost of government, or will it be about who the\neconomy works for?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Garin asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s an election about who the\neconomy works for, then the Democratic nominee will be in a much better\nposition to win,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\n\nTo help Mrs. Clinton do just that, several advisers are already being eyed\nfor senior positions in a potential 2016 campaign. People close to Mrs.\nClinton often point to a potential campaign manager in Robby Mook, a\n34-year-old operative who managed the campaign for the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 longtime\nmoney man, Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia. In addition to her small\npersonal staff, Mrs. Clinton also receives advice from Minyon Moore, a\nsavvy former White House adviser who works at the Dewey Square Group, a\nBoston-based consultancy with an office in Washington. A spokeswoman for\nDewey Square said the firm has no formal relationship with Mrs. Clinton.\n\n\n\nMs. Moore is close to other potential campaign aides like Guy Cecil,\nexecutive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and who\npreviously worked at Dewey Square.\n\n\n\nOther advisers are more far-flung. Roy Spence, the Austin advertising\nexecutive who helped develop the state\xe2\x80\x99s ubiquitous \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Mess with Texas\xe2\x80\x9d\nanti-littering campaign and who has known the Clintons for decades, is\noffering advice about image and messaging.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton turned to Sean Wilentz, a Princeton professor and presidential\nhistorian, for advice on shaping her stump speech ahead of Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s\nelection. During the 2008 Democratic primary, Professor Wilentz, a longtime\nClinton defender, accused Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s campaign of \xe2\x80\x9cthe most outrageous\ndeployment of racial politics since the Willie Horton ad campaign in 1988.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n(A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton declined to comment, and Mr. Spence and\nProfessor Wilentz did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\n\n\nDuring the midterm campaign, Mrs. Clinton raised more than $10 million for\nDemocrats, and she and former President Bill Clinton attended at least 75\nevents on behalf of more than 30 candidates, building and rebuilding the\nrelationships she and her husband are known for.\n\n\n\nThe Clintons worked hard on behalf of Alison Lundergan Grimes, a candidate\nfor Senate in Kentucky, and Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, and were\nsomewhat startled by their double-digit losses. But it was former Gov.\nCharlie Crist\xe2\x80\x99s loss to Gov. Rick Scott of Florida that carried the biggest\nimplications for a 2016 presidential campaign, as the Clintons had hoped\nfor Democratic leadership in a critical battleground state.\n\n\n\nOther Democratic defeats had a silver lining. The Maryland governor\xe2\x80\x99s race\nin which a Republican, Larry Hogan, defeated the Democrat, Anthony G.\nBrown, 51.6 percent to 46.9 percent, for example, diminished the likelihood\nthat former Gov. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, another Democrat, could emerge as a\nserious primary challenge to Mrs. Clinton.\n\n\n\nAs the outline for a campaign is drawn, Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s supporters describe\nwhat they envision as a \xe2\x80\x9cNew Clinton Map\xe2\x80\x9d that they believe could create a\nwinning coalition for 2016, drawing on the white working-class women who\nhave long supported Mrs. Clinton and the young voters and African-Americans\nwho helped elect Mr. Obama.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Politico: \xe2\x80\x9cClinton may put campaign HQ in Westchester\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/hillary-clinton-2016-campaign-headquarters-112652.html?hp=l1>*\n\n\n\nBy Maggie Haberman\n\nNovember 6, 2014, 3:51 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton has yet to say for certain whether she\xe2\x80\x99ll run for\npresident, or for that matter who her campaign manager or what her message\nwould be.\n\n\n\nBut this much she has settled one: if a second presidential campaign\nhappens, it will not be run out of Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\nHer aides are all preparing for a campaign based in New York \xe2\x80\x93 and talks\nabout where to set up shop have increasingly focused on Westchester County,\naccording to several people familiar with the discussions.\n\n\n\nWestchester is Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s home county \xe2\x80\x93 she lives in Chappaqua, an affluent\nhamlet north of New York City. Having the campaign there would not just\nkeep it close to Clinton \xe2\x80\x93 but it would place it far away from New York\nCity and the hordes of political reporters and elites who live there.\n\n\n\nIt will be a far cry from Ballston, the Virginia suburb where Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\ncampaign was based in 2008, in a onetime Immigration and Naturalization\nServices building. While a few of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s advisers at the time wanted her\nto put her campaign in upstate New York, most of her senior advisers wanted\nit based near Washington so they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to move.\n\n\n\nThis time, the only question is how far away from Manhattan it will be.\n\n\n\nClinton advisers say no decision has been made about where she will put a\ncampaign, and they continue to insist there is a chance \xe2\x80\x93 no matter how\nsmall \xe2\x80\x93 that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run.\n\n\n\nStill, one group of Clinton insiders has advocated for White Plains, a city\nin the south-central part of Westchester County replete with office parks.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s more socioeconomically diverse than some other parts of a county best\nknown as a haven for wealthy suburbanites who commute to Manhattan.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s close to the city,\xe2\x80\x9d one Clinton insider explained, adding that it\xe2\x80\x99s\neasily accessible by rail service.\n\n\n\nOther sources have said that officials like Westchester because many places\nthere are more than an hour\xe2\x80\x99s car ride away from the city.\n\n\n\nBrooklyn has also been under discussion for the campaign headquarters,\naccording to people close to Clinton. And Queens and Long Island have also\nbeen in the mix.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re certainly ready for Hillary Clinton if Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s ready for\nus,\xe2\x80\x9dsaid Brooklyn Congressman Hakeen Jeffries, a Barack Obama supporter in\n2008, who called the borough \xe2\x80\x9cone of the coolest\xe2\x80\xa6 most diverse places on\nthe planet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut others say that separation from New York City \xe2\x80\x94 and proximity to the\nClinton household \xe2\x80\x94 weigh in favor of Westchester.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat tendency is to have it close the family house and convenient to\nthem\xe2\x80\xa6.and [Westchester is] better than the West Side of Manhattan,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nJames Carville, a longtime Clinton ally. In 1992, Carville said, the family\nchose Little Rock, Ark. for Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s where they lived.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not about the place, it\xe2\x80\x99s about an attitude,\xe2\x80\x9d Carville, who has\nprovocatively suggested locating the campaign in Buffalo.\n\n\n\nThat attitude, according to a number of operatives and veterans of past\ncampaigns, is that people are opting to make the campaign their lives. So a\nless centrally-located headquarters may allow for a more complete focus on\nthe job.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama\xe2\x80\x99s campaign aides have often said that being in Chicago in\n2008 was crucial to their success. It kept them out of the Beltway feedback\nloop, kept their staffers focused on the task at hand and stanched the\nviral spread of gossip from operatives to political reporters.\n\n\n\nThe same was true for George W. Bush, who chose Austin as a base for his\n2000 campaign.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that lobbyists, hangers on, and special pleaders couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nfind there way to the campaign, but at least they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just walk across\nthe street,\xe2\x80\x9d said former Bush adviser Mark McKinnon.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt had a fundamental impact on our entire attitude, our DNA, and the core\napproach and messaging of the campaign. We were not by, of, or sponsored by\nWashington. We were from outside the beltway and, therefore, better\nunderstood voters and what they wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBeing sponsored by New York is not necessarily a selling point for the rest\nof the nation. Neither is Westchester, a wealthy and fairly homogenous\narea. But Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s advisers believe it\xe2\x80\x99s preferable to Washington.\n\n\n\nFor months, Washington-based operatives have been preparing to move to New\nYork; they just weren\xe2\x80\x99t sure exactly where. Even when it isn\xe2\x80\x99t explicit,\nNew York as the new center of Democratic political gravity seems to be\nunderstood.\n\n\n\nFor instance, allies of Robby Mook \xe2\x80\x94 a potential Clinton campaign manager\nwhose legion of former staffers talk on a \xe2\x80\x9cMook Mafia\xe2\x80\x9d listserv and go on\nvacation together yearly \xe2\x80\x94 recently posted that their annual retreat will\nlikely be held in New York next year.\n\n\n\nBeing in Westchester \xe2\x80\x9cwould pose some logistical challenges, but look,\neverything\xe2\x80\x99s done these days electronically,\xe2\x80\x9d said Judith Hope, a longtime\nfriend of the Clintons and a former New York State Democratic Party chair.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might be a good thing to do,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it would be a\nsuburban-based campaign, which wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily be a bad thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*New York Times blog: The Upshot: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat 2014 Elections Can Tell Us About\nthe 2016 Ones: Not So Much\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/upshot/what-2014-elections-can-tell-us-about-the-2016-ones-not-so-much.html?_r=0&abt=0002&abg=1>*\n\n\n\nBy Brendan Nyhan\n\nNovember 6, 2014\n\n\n\nAmerica has again embraced our long history of electoral overreaction.\nWhile it\xe2\x80\x99s true that Republicans won a major victory at the polls, the\nresults tell us far less about future elections than some commentary has\nsuggested.\n\n\n\nIn particular, the widespread Democratic losses weren\xe2\x80\x99t a \xe2\x80\x9crepudiation\xe2\x80\x9d of\nHillary Rodham Clinton (who played a minor role). But despite claims that\nthey actually offer her a useful opportunity to contrast herself with a\nRepublican Congress, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t face a \xe2\x80\x9cgreat situation\xe2\x80\x9d for her\nprospective 2016 presidential candidacy either.\n\n\n\nHistorically, midterm results, which are typically unfavorable to the\npresident\xe2\x80\x99s party, tell us relatively little about the coming presidential\nelection, as the accompanying chart illustrates. The record shows that the\npresident\xe2\x80\x99s party can rebound from major losses to win at the polls in two\nyears. Bill Clinton, for instance, bounced back from the 1994 Republican\nlandslide to easily win re-election in 1996. Similarly, President Obama,\nwhose party suffered major losses in 2010, went on to defeat Mitt Romney in\n2012, and George Bush won the 1988 election after Republicans suffered\nmajor losses in 1986, President Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s sixth year in office.\n\n\n\nCandidates from the president\xe2\x80\x99s party can also perform poorly immediately\nafter a favorable midterm election. Most notably, Democrats performed\nunusually well for the party of the incumbent president in 1998, gaining\nseats in the House and avoiding losses in the Senate in what was seen as a\nrepudiation of the Republican impeachment of Bill Clinton. However, Al Gore\nsignificantly underperformed what most forecasting models expected just two\nyears later, winning the popular vote only narrowly (and losing the White\nHouse) despite campaigning against the G.O.P. Congress. Similarly, George\nBush was soundly defeated by Mr. Clinton just two years after his party\nlost only one Senate seat.\n\n\n\nThe reality is that the fundamental factors that dictate presidential\nelections will again matter in 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 principally, the state of the economy\nin the months before the vote. Mrs. Clinton faces an additional headwind\nbecause Democrats have held the presidency for two terms, which seems to\nreduce incumbent party performance.\n\n\n\n>From that perspective, party control of Congress is a relatively minor\nissue for future presidential elections. If the economy is strong, Mrs.\nClinton won\xe2\x80\x99t need to distance herself from Mr. Obama \xe2\x80\x93 she\xe2\x80\x99ll be rushing\nto take credit for the prosperity Democrats have brought to America. If\nAmericans are still feeling pessimistic about wages and jobs, however, she\nis likely to lose no matter who or what she tries to run against.\n\n\n\nA more significant consequence of the recent election results may be the\neffect it has on the pool of candidates in future campaigns. Wave elections\ndecimate lower-level officeholders on the losing side, depleting a party\xe2\x80\x99s\nranks and depriving it of possible aspirants for higher office in future\nraces (though some may be able to mount comebacks). Senator George Allen of\nVirginia, for example, was once thought to be a promising Republican\npresidential candidate, but lost in 2006 and is now forgotten. By contrast,\nwave elections can help fuel \xe2\x80\x93 or preserve \xe2\x80\x93 political careers for the\nwinning party. In 1994, George W. Bush easily defeated the incumbent\nDemocrat, Ann Richards, for the Texas governorship, starting a career in\nelected office that took him to the White House just six years later.\n\n\n\nIn this sense, it\xe2\x80\x99s far more likely that Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin or\none of the other G.O.P. candidates who narrowly won on Tuesday will be the\nultimate beneficiaries of Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s result, not Mrs. Clinton.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Bloomberg: \xe2\x80\x9cIs Clinton the Biggest Winner or the Biggest Loser of the\nMidterms?\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-11-06/is-clinton-the-biggest-winner-or-the-biggest-loser-of-the-midterms>*\n\n\n\nBy Emily Greenhouse\n\nNovember 6, 2014, 6:11 p.m. EST\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] The answers to that question were surprisingly diverse.\n\n\n\nThe Republicans won big on Tuesday\xe2\x80\x94or, depending on which part of the\nbifocals you\xe2\x80\x99re peering out of, the Democrats lost bad. President Obama is\nterribly unpopular, and Americans, on the whole, do not feel their country\nis going in the right direction\xe2\x80\x94not close. But Obama is done facing\nnational election, and he knows it; he was practically chipper with relief\nat yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s press conference. So the question creeping onto everyone\xe2\x80\x99s\nmind is: How ought the sages of ClintonLand read the midterm leaves?\n\n\n\n*She\'s a loser*\n\n\n\nIn the very first hour of the first day after midterms\xe2\x80\x94and therefore to\nsome the very first day of the 2016 campaign\xe2\x80\x94Sen. Rand Paul unleashed this\nclot of virality, complete with a new hashtag:\n\n\n\n[IMAGES OF SEN. PAUL\xe2\x80\x99S #HILLARYSLOSERS]\n\n\n\nIn his rundown of the Midterm winners and losers, Mark Halperin, the\nmanaging editor of Bloomberg Politics, put her squarely in the \xe2\x80\x9cLoser\xe2\x80\x9d\ncolumn. Whatever her plan was before, Halperin said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all thrown up in\nthe air because no one expected the result they got. . . The party is now\nin disarray. Hillary Clinton and her team are so cautious\xe2\x80\x93they overthink,\noveranalyze everything\xe2\x80\x93this gives them a lot of new complexity to deal\nwith.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*She needs a vision*\n\n\n\nIn The Washington Post, Jennifer Rubin reduced \xe2\x80\x9cClinton\xe2\x80\x99s main selling\npoint [to] her gender identity," then wondered if Clinton would be \xe2\x80\x9cas\ndelusional and defiant about the state of the Democratic Party as Obama\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d She added:\n\n\n\nAs the GOP becomes harder to typecast, it becomes harder to think of\nClinton as the future of a major political party and a movement that likes\nto think of itself as progressive. What exactly is she progressing toward\nand how is she going to get there?\n\n\n\nYuval Levin took a more overtly aggressive tack, in the National Review,\nwriting that \xe2\x80\x9cpeople are bored of her and feel like she has been talking at\nthem forever.\xe2\x80\x9d Levin saw Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s results as evidence of the Democrats\'\n"overwhelming intellectual exhaustion\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94nothing fresh to offer or say. He\nwrote of Clinton, \xe2\x80\x9cShe is a dull, grating, inauthentic, over-eager, insipid\nelitist with ideological blinders yet no particular vision and is likely to\nbe reduced to running on a dubious promise of experience and competence\nwhile faking idealism and hope.\xe2\x80\x9d Ouch.\n\n\n\nAt The Atlantic, Peter Beinart used milder terms, but similarly considered\nthe Democratic voter\xe2\x80\x99s hunger for inspiration. \xe2\x80\x9cHer gender alone won\xe2\x80\x99t be\nenough,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cShe lost to Obama in 2008 in part because she could not\novercome her penchant for ultra-cautious, hyper-sanitized,\nconsultant-speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Actually, she is now golden*\n\n\n\nSo Clinton may have to work on energizing and rebranding, but what\ncandidate doesn\xe2\x80\x99t? She sure has the energy\xe2\x80\x94she did 45 campaign events for\n26 candidates in 18 states (and Washington, D.C.) in less than two months.\nIt may be her fame and the bath of inevitability around her, but many feel\nthat Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s day has come. A good number of journalists found silver\nlinings for Clinton in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s news.\n\n\n\nWriting for Politico, Maggie Haberman noted that "Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s major problem\nwas always going to be running as the candidate of the two-term party in\npower ... But a newly minted Republican Senate helps her to solve the\nproblem of how to run against Washington.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThis logic was found in many pockets online. Rick Ungar, in Forbes,\nenergetically announced that the Republican sweep will \xe2\x80\x9cmake it easier to\nlet Hillary be Hillary.\xe2\x80\x9d He concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cInside the Clinton camp, the\nresults of the 2014 midterms no doubt feel like a large steam valve has\nbeen turned, allowing all that left-wing pressure to release and\ndissipate.\xe2\x80\x9d Make no mistake, he said, it is she who emerged on top.\n\n\n\nAndrew Romano at Yahoo News followed the same line of thinking, with\ngreater verve and a little more wonk talk. The "easy answer" for 2014\nmidterm election winner is the Republican Party\xe2\x80\x94but the "long-term winner"\nis Hillary Clinton. He wrote:\n\n\n\nUnder the surface, almost everything about last night\xe2\x80\x99s midterm results \xe2\x80\x94\nand the map, the math and the legislative morass that lies ahead in the\nrun-up to 2016 \xe2\x80\x94 suggests that the former first lady and secretary of state\ncould have a better next two years than the party currently guzzling\nchampagne.\n\n\n\nHe detailed how many seats were likely to open up to the Democrats in 2016,\nand pointed out that, for Mitch McConnell, who \xe2\x80\x9csays he wants to compromise\nwith Democrats, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to control his\nparty\xe2\x80\x99s vehement Just Say No caucus for long.\xe2\x80\x9d Fox News took after\nNewsBusters in running a headline, \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton won the 2014 midterms?\nThat\'s what Yahoo says,\xe2\x80\x9d in which Tim Graham, author of "Collusion: How the\nMedia Stole the 2012 Election and How to Stop Them From Doing It In 2016,\xe2\x80\x9d\nlightly mocked Romano. But mostly he just pasted in paragraphs of Romano\xe2\x80\x99s\ncolumn, without bothering to add any words by way of disagreement.\n\n\n\n*One thing is for sure*\n\n\n\nCompetition is necessary for evolution, and the Democratic party, the week\nproves, certainly needs to evolve. Clintons always survive, but it\xe2\x80\x99s yet to\nbe seen if Hillary Clinton will be the fittest. Inevitability smells stale,\nespecially after Tuesday\'s shake-up. Her political brand needs spontaneity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Slate: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Does It Mean for Hillary?\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/republican_midterms_and_hillary_clinton_what_does_the_gop_s_success_mean.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Jamelle Bouie\n\nNovember 6, 2014, 1:33 p.m. EST\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] The Republicans ran the table on Election Day. What does it\nmean for the Democrat in waiting?\n\n\n\nThe night was hardly over before Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul had his take on\nTuesday\xe2\x80\x99s election results. \xe2\x80\x9cI think this election was basically a\nrepudiation of the president, but also Hillary Clinton,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nDemocrat [in Kentucky] ran and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t admit that she voted for President\nObama. She was very specific\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98I am a Clinton Democrat.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAs political explanations go, this is unusually self-serving. Yes, the\nClintons campaigned for Alison Lundergan Grimes, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence\nKentuckians were voting against Clinton as much as they were voting against\nObama. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s take is purely a product of his aspirations; he\xe2\x80\x99s running for\nthe Republican presidential nomination, and he wants you to think that he\xe2\x80\x99s\nthe only one who can take on Hillary Clinton and win. Still, his comment\nraises a question: What does Tuesday mean for the unofficial\xe2\x80\x94but very\nreal\xe2\x80\x94Clinton campaign?\n\n\n\nWriting for Yahoo News, Andrew Romano says that the Republican win is a\nboon for the presumptive Democratic nominee. Because it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chard to imagine\xe2\x80\x9d\nsoon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \xe2\x80\x9cwill be able to control\nhis party\xe2\x80\x99s vehement Just Say No caucus.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact, there\xe2\x80\x99s a great chance\nWashington will stay broken, allowing Clinton to \xe2\x80\x9crun as the antidote to\nD.C.\xe2\x80\x99s dysfunction,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Romano.\n\n\n\nOn the other side, the National Review says this is nonsense. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get\nsomething clear: Watching your party get stomped like a narc at a biker\nrally in a midterm election is not something that helps a party\xe2\x80\x99s\npresidential frontrunner,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Jim Geraghty for the conservative\nmagazine. \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica is not happy with Washington, and particularly furious\nwith Obama and Democratic governance as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBoth takes get part of the picture right. The new Senate Republican\nmajority is filled with Tea Party politicians\xe2\x80\x94like Joni Ernst of Iowa and\nTom Cotton of Arkansas\xe2\x80\x94who have no interest in compromising or even working\nwith the president, much less the Democratic minority. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, the\nmost extreme lawmakers\xe2\x80\x94like Sen. Ted Cruz and the hard-right caucus of the\nHouse\xe2\x80\x94likely feel vindicated. After two years of obstruction\xe2\x80\x94including a\ngovernment shutdown and a debt ceiling standoff\xe2\x80\x94they won a huge midterm\nvictory. Why change course? What\xe2\x80\x99s the incentive?\n\n\n\nIn which case, the antics of an irresponsible Republican Congress will\nburden the eventual Republican presidential nominee, which only helps a\nClinton candidacy. At the same time, the Democratic Party is in utter\ndisrepair. Some progressives have comforted themselves by noting the\npopularity of Democratic ideas: Otherwise conservative states have raised\nthe minimum wage, legalized marijuana, and protected abortion rights from\ndraconian \xe2\x80\x9cpersonhood\xe2\x80\x9d laws. But this only highlights the problem with the\nDemocratic brand, which is so unpopular it weighs down candidates who push\notherwise popular proposals.\n\n\n\nThe question for Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign is this: Will voters see her as\na singular figure\xe2\x80\x94Hillary\xe2\x80\x94standing against an unpopular Republican Party,\nor will they see her as just another Democrat against just another\nRepublican? If it\xe2\x80\x99s the former, then Tuesday doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean much for her\nprospective candidacy; voters will see her as Clinton first and a Democrat\nsecond, and may even see her ideas as Clinton ideas and not Democratic\nones, which could help if she tries to expand the national issue space to\ninclude things like universal child care.\n\n\n\nIf it\xe2\x80\x99s the latter, however, then Team Clinton has a new challenge: to turn\nthe Democratic brand into something worth supporting in 2016. But even that\ncomes with the important caveat that presidential candidates have done just\nfine following a bad midterm year and have failed after a good one. George\nH.W. Bush won the election after the Republican failure of 1986\xe2\x80\x94the closest\nanalogue to Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s situation\xe2\x80\x94and Al Gore lost it after the\nDemocratic success of 1998.\n\n\n\nI should say that there\xe2\x80\x99s a third option in all of this: that Tuesday\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t matter at all, and in a way that has nothing to do with Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\npersona. Put simply, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance that 2014\xe2\x80\x94like 2010\xe2\x80\x94was driven\nby the demographics of American politics, in which Republican voters\ndominate midterm elections, and Democratic voters dominate presidential\nyears. In which case, Clinton doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about 2016 since she\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be speaking to the people who elected a Republican Congress; she\xe2\x80\x99ll\nbe speaking to the people who twice elected Barack Obama. And that is a\ngood position to be in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Bloomberg: \xe2\x80\x9cPost Midterms, the 2016 Presidential Contenders Recalibrate\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-11-06/heres-what-the-2016-contenders-have-been-up-to-since-the-election>*\n\n\n\nBy Arit John\n\nNovember 6, 2014, 2:47 p.m. EST\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] Some candidates are already gearing up for 2016, while others\nare nowhere to be found.\n\n\n\nThe 2014 midterm elections may be in the books, but for the crop of\ncontenders who hope to be elected president in 2016, the next chapter is\nalready being written. For some that means jumping into campaign mode, for\nothers it means laying low and nursing political wounds, and for Texas\nGovernor Rick Perry it means spending the morning in court.\n\n\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s how the politicians expected to run for their party\xe2\x80\x99s nomination\nhave spent their time since Tuesday.\n\n\n\n*Rand Paul*\n\n\n\nRepublican Kentucky Senator Rand Paul\xe2\x80\x99s main goal since the GOP\'s D-Day has\nbeen to tie Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 losses not just to Obama, but to favored 2016\nnominee Hillary Clinton. \xe2\x80\x9cToday, voters sent a message to President Obama\nand Hillary Clinton, rejecting their policies and many of their\ncandidates,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in a Facebook post late Tuesday called\n#HillarysLosers. Paul has also said that he would push for tax reform in\nJanuary.\n\n\n\n*Paul Ryan*\n\n\n\nRepublican Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan is the favorite to become the\nWays and Means Committee chairman. Given the nature of the job\xe2\x80\x94proposing\nsometimes unpopular reforms to entitlement programs\xe2\x80\x94it would probably not\nbe helpful to a presidential bid. Like Paul, Ryan also went after Hillary\nClinton. During an appearance on the "Hugh Hewitt Show" Thursday, Ryan said\nthat the substantial Democratic loses showed that she could lose in 2016.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt just tells you that she\xe2\x80\x99s not inevitable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think she\xe2\x80\x99s very\nbeatable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Rick Perry*\n\n\n\nNot all Republicans are having a great post-election week. After being\nallowed to miss the first two pretrial hearings, Republican Texas Governor\nRick Perry will made his first court appearance on Thursday morning. The\ngovernor was indicted in August by an Austin grand jury on abuse of power\ncharges, which his team has called a politically-motivated attack from\nDemocrats. His lawyers will attempt to get the case dismissed on\ntechnicalities.\n\n\n\n*Bernie Sanders*\n\n\n\nIndependent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has made it clear that he thinks\nAmericans made a mistake on Tuesday. \xe2\x80\x9cI fear that the American people who\nwant change \xe2\x80\xa6 I think perhaps they have just voted for some folks whose\nagenda is very different than what they want and need,\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders said\nWednesday during an appearance on CNN. Sanders, also retweeted a link to a\nstatement he released last month, making it clear that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to\ncaucus with Republicans. In the statement, he said he intended to caucus\nwith the party that supports stances like rebuilding infrastructure,\nraising the wage, pay equity for women and a single-payer health-care\nsystem. \xe2\x80\x9cI could be wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut my guess is that will not be\nthe Republican Party.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton*\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made any major appearances, or even minor ones, but\nis still the talk of the town. What do the midterms mean for Hillary? One\nthing we know for sure is that, according to the exit polls, more people\nthought Clinton would be a bad president than a good president. Paul,\nChristie and other GOP hopefuls fared worse, but it\xe2\x80\x99s another sign that\nrunning for president isn\xe2\x80\x99t good for your popularity.\n\n\n\n*Scott Walker*\n\n\n\nWinning re-election means Republican Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker gets\nto stay on the 2016 presidential long list. Earlier this year he declined\nto commit to serving his full term if elected, but on Tuesday night he told\nthe Associated Press that his decision on running \xe2\x80\x9cwill have to wait\n[until] long after\xe2\x80\x9d he passes the next state budget, which might be next\nspring.\n\n\n\n*Mitt Romney*\n\n\n\n*Gov.

But on\nWednesday he and a few likeminded senators sent a letter to Senate Majority\nLeader Harry Reid, threatening to use \xe2\x80\x9call procedural means necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to\nprevent Obama from following through with his promise to \xe2\x80\x9clawlessly grant\namnesty.\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz, who will likely be the bane of Mitch McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s existence,\nhas also repeatedly refused to say whether he supports him for Majority\nLeader.\n\n\n\n*Jeb Bush*\n\n\n\nJeb Bush released a statement Tuesday night congratulating \xe2\x80\x9cMajority Leader\nMitch McConnell\xe2\x80\x9d on a great night. \xe2\x80\x9cRepublicans in Congress now have the\nopportunity\xe2\x80\x93and the responsibility\xe2\x80\x93to demonstrate to American voters that\nour party can effectively govern,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote.\n\n\n\n*Marco Rubio*\n\n\n\nFlorida Republican Senator Marco Rubio released his own statement, saying\nhe looks \xe2\x80\x9cforward to working in a Senate Republican majority to advance the\nreform agenda I\xe2\x80\x99ve presented this year.\xe2\x80\x9d In January the senator released a\nplan to help families lift themselves out of poverty, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include\nraising the minimum wage.\n\n\n\n*Chris Christie*\n\n\n\nAfter visiting 19 states in 5 days to help rally the troops for Republican\ngovernors, New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie probably took a\nwell-deserved nap. On Wednesday, he has a fancy two-course lunch at the\nfour Seasons Grill Room with a few billionaires.\n\n\n\n*Bobby Jindal*\n\n\n\nLouisiana\xe2\x80\x99s Republican Governor Bobby Jindal gave a late endorsement on\nWednesday to Republican Representative Bill Cassidy, who\xe2\x80\x99s heading into a\nrunoff election to try to unseat Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu. "I don\'t\nthink Mary, anymore, represents Louisiana\'s values in Washington D.C.,"\nJindal said of Landrieu.\n\n\n\n*Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley*\n\n\n\nAfter watching his second in command lose, Maryland Democratic Governor\nMartin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley has spent his post-election days being taunted by Governor\nChristie. The outgoing governor\xe2\x80\x99s lieutenant, Anthony Brown, suffered a\nsurprise defeat for governor against Republican Larry Hogan and many saw\nthe race as a referendum on O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, including Christie. \xe2\x80\x9cEven for\nMaryland, it got to be too much,\xe2\x80\x9d Christie said Wednesday of O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s\npolicies. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s quite an accomplishment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Joe Biden*\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Vice President Joe Biden and his wife hosted a reception\ncommemorating Breast Cancer Awareness month, but otherwise he has kept a\nlow profile. Given that he predicted on Monday that Democrats would keep\nthe Senate and that Greg Orman would likely caucus with his party, that\xe2\x80\x99s\nprobably for the best.\n\n\n\n*Elizabeth Warren*\n\n\n\nThe general consensus is that unlike Biden, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley and Clinton, Senator\nElizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and populist hero, backed\nwinners. Her record on the trail (of the 11 candidates she campaigned for,\nsix won and five lost) is decent given the circumstances, and while she\xe2\x80\x99s\nstill a \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d on running in 2016, her supporters saw the results as more\nproof that Democrats need to get with the Warren program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*New York Times opinion: Timothy Egan, NYT correspondent: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Big Sleep\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/opinion/timothy-egan-the-big-sleep.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Timothy Egan\n\nNovember 6, 2014\n\n\n\nMaybe it\xe2\x80\x99s best to close your eyes and fall into a Rip Van Winkle slumber\nfor the next two years. The party that has refused to govern for half a\ndecade and ran a substance-free campaign will now play at governing and not\ntake up anything of substance.\n\n\n\nOf course there will be votes, investigations and intrigue. Having worked\ntirelessly to make the Senate inert, Mitch McConnell now says he wants it\nto be relevant again. The man most likely to head the Environment and\nPublic Works Committee, Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, would flunk a\nhigh school science class. He claims climate change is a huge hoax. The new\nsenator from Iowa, Joni Ernst, vowed to bring at least one thing to the\ncapital. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a beautiful little Smith & Wesson 9 millimeter and it goes\nwith me virtually everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d she cooed.\n\n\n\nDid you vote for that? No, you voted against President Obama. Why? David\nLetterman had the best line of the campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cTake a look at this: Gas\nunder $3 a gallon \xe2\x80\x94 gas under $3 a gallon! Unemployment under 6 percent \xe2\x80\x94\nwho ever thought? Stock market breaking records every day. No wonder the\nguy is so unpopular.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDemocrats would not embrace that record, or even try to explain it as a\ndecent start for a country shaken by two decades of income stagnation. And\nso they were trounced. Where substance was allowed on Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s ballot \xe2\x80\x94\nminimum wage increases in four red states, gun background checks in a blue\nstate \xe2\x80\x94 big majorities did what the new Congress never will.\n\n\n\nBut enough with the postmortems. On to 2016!\n\n\n\nHill and Jeb. Can we get to it now, and treat the next two years as a fog\nof fractious do-nothingism that has already passed? Hillary Clinton and Jeb\nBush are poised to complete some unfinished business. Bush would be running\nfor the second term of his dad, the now beloved George H.W., and to make\neveryone forget the two terms of his brother. And Clinton would be running\nfor a third term of her husband, the most popular president of the last 20\nyears and the last Democrat who knew how to win over white people in red\nstates.\n\n\n\nCall it monarchy in a country that got its start by throwing off a king, or\na dynasty in a nation that still likes to think of itself as a model of\negalitarianism. But a moderate Bush and a problem-solving Clinton are\nreally the only choices. Everyone else is flawed in special ways.\n\n\n\nTake Senator Rand Paul, who always manages to look like a guy who just woke\nup from a long nap and missed a button on his shirt. Sure, he has some of\nhis kooky father\xe2\x80\x99s baggage, the 18th-century view of 21st-century issues.\nBut of late, Paul\xe2\x80\x99s been trying a little outreach beyond the Republican\nbase of old white Southerners. He thinks our prisons shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be stuffed\nwith drug offenders, predominantly black. He says Republicans should not be\npassing laws making it harder for the poor, minorities and students to\nvote. And he says his party\xe2\x80\x99s brand \xe2\x80\x9csucks\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 his word \xe2\x80\x94 in many, many\nparts of the country.\n\n\n\nAll of this will get him nowhere, and be replayed in attacks ads, when the\nRepublican presidential primary moves to its whitest of bastions in the\nSouth.\n\n\n\nWe saw a lot of Gov. Chris Christie in the last week of October. If you\nliked seven days of a red-faced guy shouting \xe2\x80\x9cshut up\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cget in line\xe2\x80\x9d\nand medical diagnosis from afar \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cShe was obviously ill,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of a\nhealthy nurse \xe2\x80\x94 you\xe2\x80\x99ll love a Christie presidency. The New Jersey governor\ndemonstrated, again, the character traits we don\xe2\x80\x99t want in a president:\npoor judgment, a temper, pettiness. He\xe2\x80\x99s all bombast without even the belly\nanymore.\n\n\n\nScott Walker, the Wisconsin governor re-elected Tuesday after taking on and\ntaking down organized labor, will be a flavor of the month. That\xe2\x80\x99s part of\nthe problem: Scott is personality-free. But more important, an anti-labor\ncandidate will not fare well in old-school blue-collar states like Michigan\nand Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\nTed Cruz will be around \xe2\x80\x94 a microphone, that is. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be shadowed by his\nfemale doppelg\xc3\xa4nger, the new Iowa senator, Ernst. His problems are myriad.\nHe loves brinkmanship and shutdowns, but more than that, he really loves\nhimself. Nearly everyone who comes in contact with him in the Senate, no\nmatter the party, can\xe2\x80\x99t stand him.\n\n\n\nThat leaves Jeb Bush, a seemingly sensible nonpartisan. He\xe2\x80\x99s for\nimmigration reform, the kind his base despises. If he can get over that\nhurdle, he\xe2\x80\x99s the nominee. And then he\xe2\x80\x99ll face one final problem: his name.\nHe is, of course, the younger brother of a man who will long remain on the\nlist of worst presidents. Take it from his mother, the reliably\nblunt-speaking Barbara Bush, last of the flinty New Englanders. The\ncountry, she said, has had \xe2\x80\x9cenough Bushes\xe2\x80\x9d in the White House.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton, it\xe2\x80\x99s yours to lose. You\xe2\x80\x99ve already started co-opting the\nprogressive flank, making nice with Senator Elizabeth Warren. And yet, Wall\nStreet likes you! The best thing Hillary has going for her right now is\nwhat happened in this week\xe2\x80\x99s midterms. Republicans will overreach, because\nthey always do, prompting much nostalgia for the days when Stuff Got Done.\n\n\n\nTwo years is a long time to wait if, say, you are a fan of the New York\nJets and believe that professional football teams should get more than one\nwin every now and then. But it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in politics. It\xe2\x80\x99s here now. Take a\nlong snooze, and then wake up to 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*MSNBC: \xe2\x80\x9cThe curse of the Obama coalition\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-curse-the-obama-coalition>*\n\n\n\nBy Alex Seitz-Wald and Trymaine Lee\n\nNovember 6, 2014, 4:40 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nBarack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s coalition has become a curse for Democrats, in addition to a\nblessing.\n\n\n\nIn 2008, running to become the first black president, Obama made history by\ninspiring Americans who don\xe2\x80\x99t typically vote to get to the polls. The\nproblem is that it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to reliably capture that kind of lighting in\na bottle on the first Tuesday of November every two years.\n\n\n\nThere may be more people in Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ccoalition of the ascendant\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 young\npeople, minorities, single women and others \xe2\x80\x93 than in the GOP grouping,\nwhich skews white and male and old. But the Democratic coalition is much\nmore fragile, as Tuesday night\xe2\x80\x99s victory proved.\n\n\n\nThere are lots of important numbers that help explain Democrat\xe2\x80\x99s drubbing,\nbut here\xe2\x80\x99s the underlying landscape of Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s vote, as well as virtually\nevery other election: There are more conservatives in America. Far more.\nAnd they vote in every election, not just in presidential years.\n\n\n\nExit polls from Tuesday night show 37% of voters identify themselves as\nconservative, compared to just 23% who say they\xe2\x80\x99re liberals. About 40%, say\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re moderate.\n\n\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with survey data going back decades, and the numbers have\nheld more or less steady over time. In 1996, 20% of Americans said they\nwere liberal and 40% conservative, according to Pew.\n\n\n\nIdeological partisans tend to be the most dedicated voters and the ground\ntroops of the party, so Democrats start every election with a deficit here.\nLately, Democrats have only overcome that drag with the intensity of a\npresidential campaign and the inspirational force of a charismatic leader.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s basically two Americas \xe2\x80\x93 there\xe2\x80\x99s midterm America and there\xe2\x80\x99s\npresidential-year America,\xe2\x80\x9d White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer told\nThe Washington Post. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re almost apples and oranges. The question was,\ncould Obama voters become Democratic voters?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe answer to that question looks like a resounding \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPart of what attracts Democrats to Hillary Clinton 2016 is the\ngroundbreaking possibility of electing the first woman president. But is a\nreliance on history-making presidential contenders really a sustainable\napproach?\n\n\n\nIn North Carolina, which hosted this year\xe2\x80\x99s most expensive Senate race,\nprogressives have been trying to create a more durable coalition under the\nMoral Monday Movement banner.\n\n\n\nRev. William Barber, the president of the North Carolina NAACP and leader\nof the Moral Monday Movement, is trying to move past the \xe2\x80\x9cmessiah\xe2\x80\x9d politics\nof the Obama era.\n\n\n\nBarber said the task moving forward would be building a wider coalition\nthat isn\xe2\x80\x99t simply charged by one charismatic politician, in this case,\nObama. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re going to change America you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to break through\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d Barber said after a speech and rally the night before the election\nin Greensboro.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you get whites, blacks and women and young people and Latinos to begin\nto come together and begin to change their language and not be trapped by\nDemocrat versus Republican, liberal versus conservative, but really begin\nto talk about coming together around five issues,\xe2\x80\x9d Barber said. He listed\namong those issues: Poverty and labor rights, educational opportunity,\nhealthcare for all, fairness in the criminal justice system and protecting\nvoting, LGBT, women\xe2\x80\x99s rights and immigration reform.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose five areas can garner and pull together a different kind of movement\nand we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that right here in North Carolina that does not back away\nfrom the race critique but allows people to come together across many, many\ndifferent lines,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nStill, the effort was ultimately unsuccessful in reelecting Sen. Kay Hagan.\nEven with the most sophisticated and expensive turnout operation ever\ndeployed in a congressional midterm election, Democrats got crushed when\nthe Obama coalition didn\xe2\x80\x99t show up.\n\n\n\nThe electorate skewed along racial and generational lines, very much\nsimilar to what happened four and eight years earlier. The drop-off among\nyoung voters, who fueled Obama\xe2\x80\x99s insurgency in 2008, was particularly\npronounced. Nationally, 18-29-year-olds made up only 13% of the electorate\nthis year, while a quarter of voters were seniors, who lean Republican.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a steep drop from 2012, when 21% of the electorate was young.\n\n\n\nAcross the country, voters were much older and whiter than they were in\n2012, according to William Frey, a demographer with The Brookings\nInstitution who analyzed exit polls and data from Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s election.\n\n\n\nStill, Frey said demographic and cyclical factors point to the sweeping\nRepublican victory as more of an \xe2\x80\x9caberration\xe2\x80\x9d than a trend indicator.\n\n\n\nFrey also said there are a few key points to distill from the election\ndata. He said the data suggests less of a referendum on the president than\na pattern consistent with a cultural and generation gap, where older whites\nare resistant to policies associated with a younger, progressive and more\ndiverse America.\n\n\n\nIn a way, Frey said, North Carolina even in this Democratic loss, is a sign\nthat the Democratic coalition of hardcore whites, young and diverse voters\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere \xe2\x80\x93 even if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work this time.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey just didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn out. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t as interested,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nDemocrats will have a much better shot during the presidential election in\n2016, but Republicans will try to head them off at the pass. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat GOP\nreally won yesterday was a huge opportunity to recast our brand before\n2016, when the terrain will swing back toward the Ds,\xe2\x80\x9d longtime GOP\nstrategist Mike Murphy tweeted.\n\n\n\nWhat Democrats gained among minorities and young people with Obama, they\xe2\x80\x99ve\nlost among whites and older voters, who still make up the larger single\nsegments of the voting population. And worse \xe2\x80\x93 those demographics are more\nlikely to vote regularly. For instance, Democratic Senate Candidate Bruce\nBraley was been leading among women by several percentage points in the\nfinal polls, but Ernst easily doubled that margin in her lead among men.\nAnd in a state that\xe2\x80\x99s 95% white, no amount of minority turnout could make\nup for Braley\xe2\x80\x99s 11 point deficit among whites.\n\n\n\nOne silver lining here for Democrats is that Hillary Clinton tends to do\nwell among working class whites, and thus could make up for some of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\nmajor losses among those groups in 2016. But she\xe2\x80\x99ll also have to contend\nwith the possibility that blacks won\xe2\x80\x99t turn out in the record numbers they\ndid in 2008 and 2012 to vote for an African-American president.\n\n\n\nClinton does have the potential to electrify a diverse coalition if she\ndecides to run. But once again, Democrats may be lurching from one messiah\nto another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Mediaite: \xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x99Reilly to GOP: Stop Fighting or Hillary Will Cruise to\nVictory in 2016\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.mediaite.com/tv/oreilly-to-gop-stop-fighting-or-hillary-will-cruise-to-victory-in-2016/>*\n\n\n\nBy Josh Feldman\n\nNovember 6, 2014, 8:18 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nBill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly kicked off tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Factor with some advice for Republicans\non how to fix the country, and predicted President Obama would be\nremembered as a \xe2\x80\x9cvillain\xe2\x80\x9d if he vetoes any of it.

Why? Let us count the\nways.\n\n\n\nShe will have to run against an energetic and motivated Republican Party.\nIf the GOP had failed to capture the Senate, the loss would have been more\nthan demoralizing. It would have led to serious discussion of a third\nparty. Donors would have reconsidered whether their spending was worth the\nreputational cost. Candidate recruitment efforts would have stalled.\nRepublican voters would have asked why they bother to show up. The\nRepublican circular firing squad, always a problem, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use\nconventional weapons. They\xe2\x80\x99d use ICBMs.\n\n\n\nClinton would have loved to capitalize on this scenario. It would have\nenabled her to prolong strategic decisions such as how and when and to what\ndegree she breaks from Obama. She would have claimed partial credit for\nsaving the Senate. She would have promised to build on Democratic success.\nYou would have been able to see her aura of inevitability for miles.\n\n\n\nBut she has been denied. Instead she must calculate how to salvage the\nwreckage of 2014. She must convince Democrats that their savior is a\ngrandmother who lives in a mansion on Massachusetts Avenue. It is her party\nthat is shell shocked, not the GOP. Trust me: You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in that\nposition.\n\n\n\nThe results also showed that the electorate looks forward rather than\nbackward. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 argument will be based in part on recollection.\nHer message: If you liked the 1990s, the last period of broad-based growth\nand full employment, put my husband and me back in the White House.\n\n\n\nBut voters are not retrospective. They judge based on the conditions of the\nmoment. In 2010, Democrats tarred Rob Portman as a former Bush official. In\n2014, they tried something similar with congressional candidate Elise\nStefanik. Both Portman and Stefanik won.\n\n\n\nThis year, several candidates ran explicitly as \xe2\x80\x9cClinton Democrats.\xe2\x80\x9d They\ntried to associate themselves with fond and gauzy memories of a better\ntime. They lost. Arkansas\xe2\x80\x94the birthplace of Bill Clinton, the test tube of\nClintonism\xe2\x80\x94became a GOP stronghold. Tom Cotton defeated Mark Pryor by 17\npoints. The Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 star power, such as it is, was overwhelmed by the\nRepublican wave of discontent and anger at liberal incompetence.\n\n\n\nThe Clintons aren\xe2\x80\x99t gods. They are human beings\xe2\x80\x94extremely, terribly,\nirredeemably flawed human beings.\n\n\n\nTheir specialty: Mitigating Democratic losses among whites without college\ndegrees. In 2014, the Clintons couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop the bleeding. Republicans won\nthe white working class by 30 points. And it will be difficult for Hillary\nClinton to reduce this deficit over the next two years.\n\n\n\nThat is because of her problematic position as heir apparent to an\nunpopular incumbent. Her recent talk of businesses and corporations not\ncreating jobs illustrates the dilemma: She has to identify herself with her\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s legacy in Elizabeth Warren\xe2\x80\x99s left-wing Democratic Party, while\ndissociating herself with the repudiated policies of the president she\nserved as secretary of State. Has Clinton ever demonstrated the political\nskill necessary to pull off such a trick?\n\n\n\nA failed president weighs heavily on his party. He not only drags it down\nin midterm elections such as 2006, 2010, and 2014. He kills its chances in\npresidential years. Think Hubert Humphrey. Think John McCain.\n\n\n\nThe McCain-Clinton comparison is worth considering. Both would be among the\noldest presidents in American history. Both are slightly at odds with their\nparty: McCain on campaign finance and immigration, Clinton on corporatism\nand foreign policy. Both lost the nomination to the presidents they sought\nto replace. Both campaigned for rare third consecutive presidential terms\nfor their parties in the cycle after those parties lost Congress.\n\n\n\nThe environment was so hostile to Republicans by the time Election Day 2008\narrived, and the Democrats had so successfully defined themselves in\ncomplete opposition to the incumbent, that McCain didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a chance. But\nwho in 2006 had predicted that a financial crisis would be the most\nimportant issue of 2008? Who in 2012 had the slightest idea that the\nIslamic State and Ebola and illegal migration would be factors in 2014? Who\nin 2014 knows with even the faintest degree of certainty what will loom\nover the electorate on Election Day 2016?\n\n\n\nRussia, Iran, Syria, Iraq, North Korea, and al Qaeda are not moving to\nanother planet. The Federal Reserve is not about to acquire the power of\nprophecy. The business cycle is exactly that\xe2\x80\x94a cycle.\n\n\n\nI do know this: Whatever voters are upset about two years from now, they\nare unlikely to hold it against John Boehner and Mitch McConnell. They are\nmore likely to direct their ire at the president and his party: Hillary\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s party.\n\n\n\nDo the Democrats begin presidential campaigns with the advantage?\nAbsolutely. The distribution of the population, the composition of the\npresidential electorate, and the clustering of liberal voters in major\nmetropolitan areas give the party of government a head start in the race to\n270 electoral votes. Republicans can win. But, like in 2000 and 2004, it\nwill be close.\n\n\n\nWhat the 2014 results suggest, however, is that the \xe2\x80\x9ccoalition of the\nascendant\xe2\x80\x9d that elected and reelected Barack Obama may be more tied to him\npersonally than to a generic Democrat. The panicked racial appeals to\nmotivate black turnout failed not only because conditions are poor, but\nalso because Obama was not on the ballot. The significance of electing the\nfirst black president, and then of legitimating his first term, did not\napply. Nor will it in 2016, in which voters are likely to once again face a\nchoice between two white people.\n\n\n\nA lot will depend on those two candidates. If there was a sure lesson in\n2014, it was that candidate performance matters. Colorado, Iowa, and\nArkansas are the clearest examples of states where the Democratic Senate\ncandidate became an embarrassment, and his Republican opponent made no\nunforced errors. The importance of candidates was also the lesson of\nVirginia, where Ed Gillespie used substance, clever advertising, and a\nwinning personality to come within striking distance of Mark Warner. It was\nthe lesson of New Hampshire, where Scott Brown\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as a\ncarpetbagger may have prevented a tenth GOP pickup. And it was the lesson\nof Maryland, a deep blue state where the Democratic gubernatorial\ncandidate, Anthony Brown, stumped so poorly coming off two terms of Martin\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley that partisan and demographic advantages could not save him.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton is famous, ambitious, methodical, and clever. As I write,\nshe faces no significant challengers for the Democratic nomination. She is\nthe frontrunner to win the 2016 election. But she is not flawless. Her\npolitical skills are limited. She says things she later walks back. She\nrepresents the past. There are so many skeletons in her family\xe2\x80\x99s closets\nthat the skeletons have closets. Her favorable numbers have already\nreturned to Earth, and she will spend the next two years under attack by\nboth Democrats and Republicans.\n\n\n\nFaced with a younger, positive, appealing Republican candidate who avoids\ngaffes and runs not on amnesty and entitlement reform, but on a platform\naimed at middle-class families and working-class whites, there is no\ntelling how Hillary Clinton would look, how she would perform, what choices\nshe would make. And if she slips and falls, who\xe2\x80\x99s going to rescue her?\nDavid Brock?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sec. Clinton\'s upcoming appearances as reported online.
