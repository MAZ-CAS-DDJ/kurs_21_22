Barack's supporters here in D.C. have an opportunity to help a Democratic presidential candidate win there for the first time in more than 40 years.\n\nAnd now that there are just seven weeks left until November 4th, it's going to be a sprint to Election Day.\n\nThat's why we're counting on supporters like you to take your commitment to the next level by spending a few weeks in Virginia to help put us over the top.\n\nWe're holding day-long Camp Obama trainings in the Washington, D.C. area to offer an in-depth look at the strategies and techniques that have driven this campaign. If you attend a Camp Obama, you'll walk out fully prepared to lead our Get Out The Vote efforts in Virginia as a Deputy Field Organizer.  \n\nApply to attend a Camp Obama session, and make a big impact in Virginia:\n\nhttp://dc.barackobama.com/VACampObama \n\nIn just the last three months, supporters like you have led an unprecedented voter registration drive that has helped more than 110,000 Virginians register to vote.\n\nIt's a remarkable accomplishment. But now we need to make sure that those voices are heard.\n\nNo experience is required. Our Camp Obama sessions on the weekend of September 27th-28th -- led by experienced Obama campaign staffers and other professional organizers -- will provide you with all the knowledge and resources you need. \n\nApply to attend Camp Obama and become a Deputy Field Organizer for the final five weeks before Election Day:\n\nhttp://dc.barackobama.com/VACampObama \n\nWe can't do this without you.\n\nThanks,\n\nJohn\n\nJohn Bowman\nWashington, D.C. State Director\nObama for America\n\nP.S. -- If you are unable to attend Camp Obama, there are still lots of ways to get involved in Virginia.
