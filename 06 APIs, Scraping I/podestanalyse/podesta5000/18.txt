John McCain (R-AZ) to fire the\n> lobbyists who run and fund his campaign.\n> \n>> Now, we\'re singing it, too. Check out our new Web ad\n>> <http://ga3.org/ct/xpX_qJn1BE4o/> .\n> It\'s a clever song to the tune of an old classic, and maybe it\'s just catchy\n> enough to get stuck in John McCain\'s head until he gets the idea: the\n> lobbyists have got to go.\n> \n> We\'ve already had some success in holding the McCain campaign accountable.\n> News reports on McCain\'s lobbyist ties are everywhere. More than 11,000 people\n> have signed our petition <http://ga3.org/ct/xpX_qJn1BE4o/>  asking McCain to\n> fire from his campaign three lobbyists with ties to brutal dictators and\n> repressive regimes. One of them, Tom Loeffler, resigned as McCain\'s national\n> finance co-chair over the weekend.\n> \n> But 115 others, including two we\'ve suggested should go \x97 Charlie Black and\n> Peter Madigan \x97 remain with the campaign. There\'s no sign that McCain or\n> campaign manager Rick Davis, himself a former lobbyist, are about to truly\n> clean house.\n> \n>> We need to keep the pressure on McCain. Watch the video\n>> <http://ga3.org/ct/xpX_qJn1BE4o/> , and then spread the word \x97 and the song \x97\n>> to your friends and family.\n> If we can get enough people singing our tune, it might get John McCain to\n> change his and do something that\'s long overdue: fire the lobbyists.\n> \n> Sincerely,\n> \n> David Donnelly\n> Director\n> Campaign Money Watch\n>   \n> \n>  \n>  \n> \n>    \n>   Visit the web address below to tell your friends about this.\n>   Tell-a-friend! \n> <http://ga3.org/join-forward.html?domain=pcactionfund&r=R7X_qJnq6MUt>\n>   \n> \n>  \n>   If you received this message from a friend, you can sign up for Public\n> Campaign Action Fund and Public Campaign\n> <http://ga3.org/pcactionfund/join.html?r=R7X_qJnq6MUtE> .\n> \n>  \n>   This message was sent to david.a.donnelly@gmail.com.
