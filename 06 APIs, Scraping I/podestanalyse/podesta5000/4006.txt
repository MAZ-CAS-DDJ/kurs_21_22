Meanwhile, American families are suffering as gas\nprices--and oil company profits--surge to new records.\n\n\n"Having Big Oil\'s best friends in the White House has crippled our economy\nand hardworking Americans are suffering," said Cathy Duvall, Sierra Club\nNational Political Director.  "Barack Obama went to Detroit and told the\nautomakers what they needed to hear--that they must make cars that get\nbetter gas mileage; John McCain went straight to Houston and told the oil\nindustry what it wanted to hear--that he strongly supported their desire to\nbegin the wholesale, unfettered \'exploitation\' of our coasts. It\'s clear\nthat America simply cannot afford another president from the \'Grand Oil\nParty.\'"\n\n\nBig Oil Raking in Record Profits at the Expense of American Drivers\n\n\nAn analysis of the record--breaking 2007 profits of just the five biggest\noil companies--ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Shell, and ConocoPhillips--shows\nthat they made an astonishing $123,300,000,000 last year alone.  With\napproximately 202 million American drivers on the road, that means Big Oil\nis raking in about $610 in profits for each and every driver.  As oil and\ngas prices continue to surge, the amount every driver is paying to pad Big\nOil\'s bottom line will only keep increasing.\n\n\n"Big Oil has American consumers over a barrel," said Duvall.  "We literally\ncannot afford to continue the failed policies of the Bush administration,\nbut it seems unlikely that a campaign full of oil industry lobbyists and\nawash in millions made at the expense of American consumers is going to\nstand up to Big Oil and deliver the kind of change we need.  By contrast,\nBarack Obama has stood up to special interests and has a plan to help\nAmericans get through today\'s crisis, while putting us on the path to\nenergy independence in order to rid us of Big Oil\'s chokehold once and for\nall."\n\n\nNew Campaign Finance Reports Show Big Oil Has Funneled over $5 million to\nMcCain and the Republican Party\n\n\nCampaign finance reports filed June 30, 2008 and analyzed by the\nnon--partisan Center for Responsive Politics show that John McCain has\nreceived $1,001,668 from the oil and gas industry, while the Republican\nParty has separately raked in an astonishing $4,002,662.  These new reports\nshow that McCain hauled in nearly $210,000 from the industry in the month\nof June alone--a month in which he flip--flopped on offshore drilling and\nheld numerous fundraisers in Big Oil\'s backyard.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional analysis of past campaign records by Campaign Money Watch\nunderscores McCain and Big Oil\'s mutual embrace.  From 1989--2006, McCain\nreceived a total of $305,277 from oil and gas interests----despite running\nfor president in 2000 and occupying the high--profile position of Senate\nCommerce Committee Chairman.  Big Oil has already poured nearly three times\nthat much into his campaign in just the past few months alone.\n\n\n"It looks like the Big Oil fat cats in Texas gave John McCain more than\njust a couple standing ovations after he flip--flopped on offshore drilling\nand gave them exactly what they wanted," noted Duvall.  "And is it just a\ncoincidence that the Republican Party hauled in over $4 million from Big\nOil and then turned around and bought $3.4 million worth of false and\nmisleading attack ads riddled with blatant lies about Barack Obama\'s energy\nplan?"\n\n\nLobbying disclosure forms also indicate that at least 22 lobbyists who\nlobby on behalf of some of the biggest oil companies in the world are\ninvolved in John McCain\'s campaign.\n\n\nJohn McCain v. Barack Obama on Gas Prices and Breaking Big Oil\'s Chokehold\non America\n\n\nObama\'s Plan for Real Short--Term Relief v. John McCain\'s Gas Tax Gimmick\n   Obama wants a second round of stimulus checks for consumers and an\n   additional $1000 tax cut for working and middle--class families to offer\n   Americans short--term relief from crippling energy prices and the\n   skyrocketing cost of food and other goods.  Obama would pay for this tax\n   credit by repealing billions in taxpayer--funded giveaways to Big Oil\n   and by imposing a windfall profits tax on oil companies that fail to\n   invest their excess profits in clean energy. (Source: Bloomberg,\n   05/01/2008)\n   John McCain has proposed a gimmick: a so--called gas tax holiday that\n   would do absolutely nothing to lower prices at the pump, but would pad\n   Big Oil\'s bottom line with an extra 18 cents a gallon and potentially\n   bankrupt the highway trust fund at a time when our infrastructure is\n   already crumbling.  His misguided plan has been denounced by over 200\n   leading economists--including 4 Nobel Prize winners. (Source: Bloomberg\n   News, 05/05/2008)\n\n\nObama\'s Plan for 50 MPG Cars v. John McCain\'s $300 Million Giveaway Gimmick\n   Obama knows that the long--term solution to high gas prices is making\n   sure we have cars that get better gas mileage.  He fought hard to pass\n   the first increase in fuel economy in more than 30 years.  Now he wants\n   to go further and give American automakers the tools they need to double\n   fuel economy to 50 miles per gallon. (Source:\n   www.barackobama.com/issues/energy)\n   John McCain didn\'t even bother to show up for any votes on last year\'s\n   landmark fuel economy/energy bill.  And he has had a spotty record on\n   the issue in the past.  Instead of providing the real leadership we need\n   right now and putting forth a real plan, McCain proposed a $300 million\n   gimmicky giveaway to grab headlines.

McCain\'s Empty Rhetoric\n   Obama knows that Wall Street speculators are gaming the system and\n   running up the price of oil at the expense of hardworking American\n   consumers.  He supports the Consumer--First Energy Act of 2008 (S.3044),\n   which would crack down on speculators and put in place other measures to\n   protect consumers, make sure oil companies are paying their fair share\n   on their record profits, and encourage the development of renewable\n   energy. (Source: Associated Press, 06/10/2008)\n   John McCain says he wants to take on speculators, but has refused to\n   support the Consumer--First Act.  One of the biggest loopholes exploited\n   by speculators--the so--called "Enron Loophole"--was put into law by one\n   of McCain\'s closest campaign advisers, former Senator Phil Gramm, who\n   also blocked efforts to close the loophole in 2002.

McCain\'s Texas--Sized\nTax Cut for Big Oil\n   Obama wants to end the billions in subsidies and giveaways that the oil\n   industry receives each year--at taxpayer expense.  He also wants to make\n   sure Big Oil is paying its fair share on its tens of billions in record\n   profits.  He would impose a windfall profits tax on oil companies that\n   fail to invest their excess profits in the clean energy technologies we\n   need to end our addiction to oil and fight global warming. (Source:\n   Reuters, 06/09/2008)\n   John McCain has mocked Obama over his proposal for a windfall profits\n   tax--even though McCain himself said he was open to the idea just two\n   months ago. Meanwhile, he has proposed a tax plan that would offer a\n   $3.8 BILLION tax cut to the five largest American oil companies alone.\n   This plan would cost a stunning $1.7 trillion overall and put any hope\n   of balancing the budget well out of reach.

Rhetoric\n   John McCain flip--flopped on offshore drilling and gave the oil industry\n   exactly what it\'s wanted for 30 years. (Source: Politico, 06/18/2008)\n   McCain claims that the Bush--McCain drilling plan would offer Americans\n   "psychological" relief. (Source: ABC News, 06/24/2008)\n   Even the Bush Administration admits that drilling offshore won\'t do\n   anything to lower gas prices today, tomorrow, or even a decade from now.\n   (Source: Energy Information Administration)\n   Oil companies currently hold leases on 41,000,000 acres offshore, but a\n   mere 8,123,000 of those acres are actually in production.

(Source: Bloomberg, 05/01/2008)       \n           John McCain has proposed a gimmick: a so--called gas tax       \n           holiday that would do absolutely nothing to lower prices       \n           at the pump, but would pad Big Oil\'s bottom line with an       \n           extra 18 cents a gallon and potentially bankrupt the           \n           highway trust fund at a time when our infrastructure is        \n           already crumbling.  His misguided plan has been denounced      \n           by over 200 leading economists--including 4 Nobel Prize        \n           winners.
