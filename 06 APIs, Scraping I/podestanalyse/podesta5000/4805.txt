john.podesta@gmail.comb"John--\n\nThank you so much for making General Douglass's first ad a success. John really wanted to get the message out there that he is in this to Help Virginia Families and not for a political career of catering to power brokers or party leaders. Listen to him tell it in his own words by watching the ad below.\n\nWe have a big ad budget deadline Monday and we are just $3,445 away from hitting our goal.  Can you click here and help us keep the ad on the air?\n\nYou are receiving this message from the John Douglass for Congress because you signed up to receive email from Democratic candidates. If you do not wish to receive email, click here to unsubscribe. We're up against millions of dollars in spending by Corporate Congressman Hurt and other secretly funded outside groups. There is no time to lose at this critical moment. Rush a donation now, so we can beat back the barrage of negative attack ads and overcome the odds for the people of Virginia.\n\nThank you again for your continued support.\n\nChase Winder\nCommunications Director\nPaid for by John Douglass for Congress\nhttp://jdouglass.bluestatedigital.com/unsubscribe\n\n"
