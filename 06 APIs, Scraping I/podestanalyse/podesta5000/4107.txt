Some materials for the event say they\'re all "hosting" it, which I assumes mean they will be there. We\'ve also heard that all three committed to attend the event at the time it was announced.\n\nAlso can you offer any more background on the meeting, including whether it has sponsors beyond OCP Corporation?\n\nAnd is there any further guidance on CF/CGI activities if Sec. Clinton runs for president? We assume this event is going ahead either way, although under the full State Department restrictions these types of overseas events weren\'t allowed.\n\nI don\'t have an exact time frame for the story at this point but at moment seems like next day or so.\n\nIf you wanna call I\'m most reachable on cell today 703 980 5029\n\nTks\n\n--Josh\n\nJosh Gerstein\nReporter\nPOLITICO\n703-647-7684 (w)\n703-980-5029 (c)\n\n'
