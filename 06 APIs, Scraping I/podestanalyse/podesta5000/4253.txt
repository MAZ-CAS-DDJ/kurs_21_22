Jen\n\n\n\n*HILLARY CLINTON\xe2\x80\x99S STANDARDS FOR THE TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP*\n\n*Statement of Hillary Clinton Campaign, April 17 2015  *\n\n*Hillary Clinton believes that any new trade measure has to pass two tests:\nFirst it should put us in a position to protect American workers, raise\nwages and create more good jobs at home. Second, it must also strengthen\nour national security. We should be willing to walk away from any outcome\nthat falls short of these tests.  The goal is greater prosperity and\nsecurity for American families, not trade for trade\xe2\x80\x99s sake.*\n\n*She will be watching closely to see what is being done to crack down on\ncurrency manipulation, improve labor rights, protect the environment and\nhealth, promote transparency, and open new opportunities for our small\nbusinesses to export overseas.  As she warned in her book, Hard Choices, we\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be giving special rights to corporations at the expense of\nworkers and consumers.*\n\n*Hillary Clinton: TPP Needs To Protect American Workers, Raise Wages And\nCreate Jobs, And Be In Our National Security Interests. *\xe2\x80\x9cI think I have a\npretty good idea of what we could do to meet the tasks that I believe any\ntrade agreement\xe2\x80\x94especially TPP must meet. It needs to number 1, protect\nAmerican workers. Number 2, it needs to raise wages and create good jobs at\nhome. Number 3, it needs to be in our national security interests. I've\nbeen saying that for months.\xe2\x80\x9d [Iowa Remarks, 6/14/15]\n"
