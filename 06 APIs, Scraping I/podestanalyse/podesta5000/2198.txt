He does not have anything on his event calendar for Democrats\nthat is equivalent to the big GOP cattle-call held down the street \xe2\x80\x94 and,\nfor now, he is OK with that.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis year has been quiet, more like a typical presidential year rather\nthan the one we saw in 2007 when Barack Obama first came to the state,\xe2\x80\x9d\nHenderson said, recalling the regular visits by then-candidate Obama or one\nof his surrogates or staff members, who all spent a great deal of time\nteam-building. \xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\'t mean there aren\'t people on the ground now for\ncandidates, it just hasn\'t percolated up yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Iowa Democratic Party is in a moment of self-reflection, explained Iowa\nState political scientist Steffen Schmidt.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe establishment is in a blue funk after the catastrophic performance in\nthe 2014 elections,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, referring to state Democrats losing a U.S.\nSenate seat that many considered a sure thing, as well as a U.S. House seat\nand the governorship. \xe2\x80\x9cAll of this has contributed to a sense of both\nmalaise and panic.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDespite the absence of campaign offices and event announcements for a\ncluster of potential candidates that, eight years ago, had nine very\ndifferent Democrats stumping the Hawkeye State to win voters\' hearts,\nplenty of excitement is building for next year\'s caucuses, Henderson and\nothers insist.\n\n\n\nPolk County has a big impact in elections, and 25-year-old Blake Hanson is\nliterally at the epicenter of that excitement and impact.\n\n\n\nThe Des Moines law student, who grew up in the town of Sergeant Bluff, is\nthe state treasurer of the Ready for Hillary campaign. He helped to\norganize the first RFH event in Iowa last January, coordinated RFH\'s\npolitical contributions to Iowa Democrats in the midterm elections, and\nadvises the RFH Iowa group that is organizing in all 99 of the state\'s\ncounties.\n\n\n\nThat type of person-to-person grassroots organizing is the key to success\nin a caucus.\n\n\n\nHanson said he supports Hillary Clinton because of her experience\nadvocating and fighting for ordinary middle-class Americans: \xe2\x80\x9cMy father has\nworked in a factory for nearly 40 years, and my mom is a schoolteacher.\nThese are the hardworking people that make America work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nLinda Nelson, chairwoman of the Pottawattamie County Democrats and former\nstate teachers union president, said she, too, is comfortable with the pace\nof the race. A former Obama supporter, she said former U.S. Sen. Jim Webb\nof Virginia and Martin O\'Malley, who just stepped down as Maryland\'s\ngovernor, visited the county during the midterm elections; the Run Warren\nRun folks \xe2\x80\x94 supporters of U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \xe2\x80\x94\nwill meet with her shortly.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when Hillary announces, everything will change around here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nThat announcement conceivably might not come until summer \xe2\x80\x94 which means\nClinton\'s strategy appears to be to make this into a short campaign.\n\n\n\nAnd, in many ways, that makes sense: The slower and longer her non-campaign\ncampaign can go on, without her out there, is probably a good thing.\n\n\n\nThere is a scrutiny and a sense of voter fatigue that happen to all\npresidential candidates; holding back until the very end to announce can\nlimit those, along with the number of stumbles that inevitably occur (and\nwhich today\'s social media promptly make appear to be as significant as the\ncollapse of the free world).\n\n\n\nFor someone with the name Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 or Bush \xe2\x80\x94 to stay in the news but out\nof the fray may be the best advantage, if fundraising and campaign-building\nare done without officially being done.\n\n\n\nThis does not mean Clinton does not do a full-throated campaign.\n\n\n\nShe does, but she just does it on a shorter calendar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Des Moines Register: \xe2\x80\x9cFiorina goes after Clinton over Benghazi\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/01/24/carly-fiorina-iowa-freedom-summit/22292113/>*\n\n\n\nBy Josh Hafner\n\nJanuary 24, 2015, 11:11 p.m. CST\n\n\n\nFormer Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina pitted herself against likely\nDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at Saturday\'sIowa Freedom\nSummit, sparking some of the event\'s most boisterous applause.\n\n\n\nWith a calm tone and polished delivery, Fiorina introduced herself to\nIowans as a business-savvy outsider, the kind capable of creating real\nchange in government.\n\n\n\n"Like Hillary Clinton, I too have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles\naround the globe," Fiorina said. "But unlike her, I\'ve actually\naccomplished something."\n\n\n\nThat line prompted applause, hoots and hollers.\n\n\n\nFiorina also touted her international business experience to help position\nherself as one familiar with America\'s allies and enemies.\n\n\n\n"And unlike Hillary Clinton, I know what difference it makes that our\nAmerican ambassador and three other brave Americans were killed in a\ndeliberate terrorist attack," she said, alluding to the 2012 attack at the\nU.S. embassy in Benghazi, Libya. The line brought a standing ovation from\nattendees, halting her mid-speech.\n\n\n\nStill unknown to many Iowans, Fiorina touted pro-life credentials by\nslamming liberals in her former home state of California.\n\n\n\n"Liberals believe that flies are worth protecting, but the life of an\nunborn child is not," Fiorina said.\n\n\n\nHINTS ON A PRESIDENTIAL BID: Fiorina described America\'s founding fathers\nenvisioning a country governed not by professional politicians but leaders\nemerging from agriculture or, like herself, business.\n\n\n\n"To accomplish fundamental reform, it will take an understanding of the\ntechnology that is driving this century," the former tech company CEO said.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE REACTION: The crowd\'s applause indicated praise for Fiorina\'s\nbusiness background and glee for her head-on remarks regarding Clinton.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Time: \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Why Carly Fiorina Thinks She Can Best Criticize Hillary\nClinton\xe2\x80\x9d <http://time.com/3681536/carly-fiorina-hillary-clinton/>*\n\n\n\nBy Zeke J. Miller\n\nJanuary 24, 2015, 4:12 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nFormer Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina is gearing up to announce a White\nHouse bid this year, positioning herself as the Republican party\xe2\x80\x99s chief\ncritic of likely Democratic nominee former Secretary of State Hillary\nClinton.\n\n\n\nFiorina begins as a relative unknown, and trails far in the polls. In a\nspeech to the Iowa Freedom Summit, a conservative cattle call hosted by\nRep. Steve King, Fiorina offered a preview of her anti-Clinton message,\nwhich she believes she, as the only other woman in the race, is best\nequipped to offer.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike Hillary Clinton, I too have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles\naround the globe,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut unlike her, I have actually accomplished\nsomething. Mrs. Clinton, flying is an activity not an accomplishment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe full Clinton excerpt is below:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must understand our role in the world \xe2\x80\x93 which is to lead \xe2\x80\x93 and the\nnature of our allies and especially, our adversaries. Like Hillary Clinton,\nI too have travelled hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe. But\nunlike her, I have actually accomplished something. Mrs. Clinton, flying is\nnot an accomplishment, it\xe2\x80\x99s an activity. I have met Vladimir Putin and know\nthat it will take more to halt his ambitions than a gimmicky red \xe2\x80\x98Reset\xe2\x80\x99\nbutton. Having done business in over 80 countries and having served as the\nChairman of the External Advisory Board at the CIA for several eyars, I\nknow that China and Russia are state-sponsors of cyberwarfare and have a\nstrategy to steal our intellectual property. I know Bibi Netanyahu and know\nthat when he warns us that Iran is a danger to this nation as well as to\nhis own, that we must listen. And unlike Hillary Clinton I know what\ndifference it makes that our American Ambassador and three other brave\nAmericans were killed in a deliberate terrorist attack on the anniversary\nof 9-11 in Libya. And apparently unlike Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, I\nknow that the response of our nation must be more forceful that the arrest\nof a single individual a year later.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA Republican strategist told TIME last year that Fiorina could be a potent\nweapon for the GOP in the coming cycle. \xe2\x80\x9cThe most effective way to\ncriticize a woman is to have another woman do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Bloomberg: \xe2\x80\x9cSarah Palin Says \'Yes We Can\' Beat Hillary\xe2\x80\x9d\n<https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-01-24/sarahpalin-says-yes-we-can-beat-hillary>*\n\n\n\nBy Terrence Dopp\n\nJanuary 24, 2015, 6:37 p.m. EST\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] Despite expressing interest earlier, she won\'t say whether she\nwill run for president.\n\n\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa\xe2\x80\x94Sarah Palin, standing before a packed room of Republicans\nin Iowa, cast herself Saturday as the judge of who\'s a real conservative\nand who can beat Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\n\n\n"Things must change for our government," Palin said. "Look at it\xe2\x80\x94it isn\'t\ntoo big to fail; it\'s too big to succeed. So we can afford no retreads or\nnothing will change."\n\n\n\n"We\'re not in a mood to give politicians a pass just because they happen to\nhave a certain party initial next to their name," she said.\n\n\n\nPalin, the unsuccessful 2008 vice presidential candidate and former\nRepublican governor of Alaska, told about 1,200 people attending the Iowa\nFreedom Summit that the nominating process should serve as a competition,\nnot a coronation. She never mentioned by name either Mitt Romney or Jeb\nBush, two popular moderate Republicans who are skipping the summit, though\nshe did go after Clinton, considered the Democratic frontrunner.\n\n\n\nDespite suggesting interest in the race on Friday, Palin never said whether\nshe was in the race, and did not name a candidate who she thinks can win.\n\n\n\nHer prognostication on whether the GOP can defeat Clinton in a general\nelection? With a vibrant, fresh candidate her party stands a good shot, she\nsaid. "To borrow a phrase, yes we can," she said.\n\n\n\nPalin started a 30-minute speech addressing her latest rounds of\ncontroversy: defending both the film American Sniper and its protagonist,\nChris Kyle. She also addressed the controversy that erupted recently over a\npicture of her youngest son, Trig, standing on top of the family\'s pet\nLabrador, saying that the pet had been trained in Iowa.\n\n\n\nShe recalled an event she recently attended in Las Vegas thrown by Kyle\'s\nwidow. One veteran in the crowd held up a sign with an expletive for\ndocumentarian Michael Moore, who criticized the film. "I had my thumb up.\nIt wasn\'t another finger," she said. "We were all thinking that."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Boston Herald opinion: Adriana Cohen: \xe2\x80\x9cSarah Palin is the perfect foil to\ntake on Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.bostonherald.com/news_opinion/columnists/adriana_cohen/2015/01/adriana_cohen_sarah_palin_is_the_perfect_foil_to_take>*\n\n\n\nBy Adriana Cohen\n\nJanuary 25, 2015\n\n\n\nSarah Palin says she\xe2\x80\x99s seriously considering a 2016 presidential run.\n\n\n\nWhy not? The GOP needs women on the ticket for many reasons, not least\nbecause it steals the Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s thunder. They want to be the\n\xe2\x80\x9cfirst\xe2\x80\x9d at breaking cultural barriers and glass ceilings. With Hillary\nClinton expected to be their front-runner in 2016, they\xe2\x80\x99ll use her gender\nas a tactic to gin up support from their base \xe2\x80\x94 especially female voters.\n\n\n\nI can already see Emily\xe2\x80\x99s List pushing out emails nationwide saying, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s\nmake history by electing the first female president of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s imperative Republicans put forward their own female leaders for the\npresidential ticket to counter that Democratic message.\n\n\n\nYes, Sarah Palin was bludgeoned in the 2008 race by the Democratic machine,\nwhich tried to discredit her unfairly and turn her into a cartoon figure.\nBut Americans \xe2\x80\x94 especially Republicans \xe2\x80\x94 understand the game. There\xe2\x80\x99s a\ndouble standard in gender politics.\n\n\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re a female leader on the Democratic ticket, you\xe2\x80\x99re a \xe2\x80\x9chero\xe2\x80\x9d\nregardless of how many times you put your foot in your mouth, embarrass\nyourself or worse.\n\n\n\nWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten Hillary Clinton saying that we should empathize with\nour enemies or that businesses and corporations don\xe2\x80\x99t really create jobs.\nBoth absurd statements that should disqualify any candidate \xe2\x80\x94 male or\nfemale \xe2\x80\x94 from any race, never mind the top slot.\n\n\n\nBut if you\xe2\x80\x99re a female conservative? Watch out! Liberals will pounce and do\neverything they can to marginalize a conservative woman who runs for office\nno matter how educated, or talented, or accomplished she is. Liberals only\n\xe2\x80\x9ctolerate\xe2\x80\x9d others if they agree with them and follow their agenda.\n\n\n\nSkeptics will say Sarah Palin doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a chance in the GOP race because\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s too polarizing. But what about Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen.\nElizabeth Warren? They\xe2\x80\x99re polarizing too, with supporters and haters in\nequal measure.\n\n\n\nThe reality is Sarah Palin draws huge crowds at speaking engagements, has\nmillions of social media followers and just as many supporters across the\nnation.\n\n\n\nHilary Clinton has been giving speeches to half-filled rooms.\n\n\n\nIf Sarah Palin chooses to throw her proverbial hat in the ring for 2016,\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt she\xe2\x80\x99d make the race exciting and bring a welcome woman\xe2\x80\x99s\npoint of view to the GOP field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Wall Street Journal blog: Washington Wire: \xe2\x80\x9cScott Walker Makes His Case to\nIowa Conservatives\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/01/24/scott-walker-makes-his-case-to-iowa-conservatives/>*\n\n\n\nBy Reid J. Epstein\n\nJanuary 24, 2015, 3:26 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa \xe2\x80\x93 Scott Walker offered this case to Iowa Republicans for\nhis presidential prospects: He is new on the national scene, he has already\nenacted conservative reforms, and he plans to compete for their affection\nover the coming year.\n\n\n\nThe Wisconsin governor, making his first in-person introduction to\nconservative activists at Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s Iowa Freedom Summit here, offered a\nlengthy review of his fights with labor unions, during which he said he\ncould \xe2\x80\x9cfeel the power of your prayers.\xe2\x80\x9d There was also a reminder that Mr.\nWalker spent his grammar school years in Plainfield, Iowa.\n\n\n\nThe crowd of about 1,000 people ate it up, offering Mr. Walker the most\nsustained applause thus far of the day-long event. Mr. Walker reciprocated,\nsuggesting strongly in his big finish that he intended to run for president.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pleased to be here in Iowa today, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to come back many more\ntimes in the future,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Walker said to raucous applause at the ornate\nHoyt Sherman Place theater here. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m hoping to work together with you to\nhelp us provide that kind of leadership that is new and fresh and bold and\naggressive. It\xe2\x80\x99s been proven that common sense conservative reform from\noutside of Washington, D.C., can work. With your help, I have no doubt, we\ncan move this country forward, we can have our own American revival.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Wisconsin governor, pacing the stage without a suit jacket and with his\nsleeves rolled up to his elbows, was perhaps the day\xe2\x80\x99s most anticipated\nspeaker. He mentioned none of his presumed opponents by name, but in his\n20-minute speech he foreshadowed how he would draw a contrast between\nhimself and a field of more established figures.\n\n\n\nMr. Walker noted that the state of Wisconsin is \xe2\x80\x9cthe only one in the\ncountry with a fully funded retirement system,\xe2\x80\x9d in a line separating him\nfrom New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who sought to cut pledged payments to\nhis state\xe2\x80\x99s pension system.\n\n\n\nWisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s property taxes are lower now than four years ago, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\nmany governors can say that?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nMr. Walker told a familiar story about clipping coupons at the Kohl\xe2\x80\x99s\ndepartment store, distinguishing himself from millionaire 2012 GOP\npresidential nominee Mitt Romney and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\n\n\nAnd in a barb separating himself from Mr. Bush, vilified among conservative\nactivists as a leading proponent of Common Core educational standards, Mr.\nWalker touted changes to Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s education system that, he said, aimed\nto restore control to local school boards.\n\n\n\nUnlike other speakers here, who offered red-meat applause lines blasting\nPresident Barack Obama or presumed 2016 Democratic presidential\nfront-runner Hillary Clinton, Mr. Walker focused on his own biography. He\nsaid not a word about immigration, nor did he address presidential\nexecutive actions that drew ire from others here.\n\n\n\nInstead he painted himself as someone with a record fighting all manner of\nenemies, especially Democrats. He spoke in detail about threats to him and\nhis family during Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s labor fight, his faith, and, in a line that\ndrew laughter and applause, his glee in watching liberal pundits on MSNBC\non nights when he won re-election.\n\n\n\nAnd Mr. Walker made sure the crowd left with the impression that he had\nprevailed in a tough political environment.\n\n\n\nIn Wisconsin, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cpeople like the direction they\xe2\x80\x99re headed. Maybe\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s why I won the race for governor three times in the last four years.\nThree times, mind you, in a state that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone Republican for president\nsince I was in high school more than 30 years ago, how about that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sec.
