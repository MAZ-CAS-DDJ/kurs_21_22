Will write a check, of course, but\nalso happy to do more, whatever that may be.\n\nPlease give Mae my best -- I haven\'t talked to her for a couple of years\nnow and hope she\'s well.\n\nAnd, since we\'ve not caught up in awhile, attached is a picture of my two\ndaughters -- they\'re a handful!\n\nBest,\n\nJohn\n'
