Stuart Platt\n\nOctober 27, 2014 1:24 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nRecently, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke at Sen. Harry\nReid\xe2\x80\x99s Clean Energy Summit in Nevada, where she announced that climate\nchange is \xe2\x80\x9cthe most consequential, urgent, sweeping collection of\nchallenges\xe2\x80\x9d facing us today. She is right on point. It was a strong\nstatement, in line with her past actions. But what many people might not\nknow is that climate change isn\xe2\x80\x99t just an issue for environmentalists. It\nis also an important one for the armed forces and national security\ncommunities.\n\n\n\nIn March, the Pentagon published the latest quadrennial defense review, a\nstandard-bearing report for military strategy, security threats and defense\nspending. It reads in part:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pressures caused by climate change will influence resource competition\nwhile placing additional burdens on economies, societies, and governance\ninstitutions around the world. These effects are threat multipliers that\nwill aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental degradation,\npolitical instability, and social tensions \xe2\x80\x94 conditions that can enable\nterrorist activity and other forms of violence.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn other words, climate change exacerbates global unrest and worsens\nconditions in already unstable countries. Specifically:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x96\xa0 When droughts and severe storms damage crops, it puts stress on the\nglobal food supply in regions where there is already too little to go\naround.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x96\xa0 When unexpected severe storms sweep through countries and destroy\ninfrastructure, governments struggle to provide social services for their\npeople.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x96\xa0 When people have too few resources, they migrate across borders, leading\nto land disputes and ethnic or religious confrontations\n\n\n\n\xe2\x96\xa0 When crops are the backbone of your economy, crop failures lead to trade\ndisputes and economic struggles\n\n\n\nLike many other complicated ills, climate change knows no barriers. The US\nis not immune, especially to potential flooding problems. A large portion\nof the American population lives in coastal areas.\n\n\n\nIn Virginia, for example, the mission readiness of Naval Base Norfolk could\nbe threatened if major investments are not made to adapt to already rising\nsea levels. The Department of Defense has begun work on this, but if\nserious actions aren\xe2\x80\x99t taken to curb CO2 emissions and mitigate the effects\nof climate change, we will be fighting a losing battle.\n\n\n\nSome regions of the world are at higher risk for conflict than others.\nSyria is an unfortunate example. The country suffered an extreme and\nunusually long drought between 2006 and 2011. Three-fourths of farmers\nsuffered total crop losses, and President Bashar al-Assad mismanaged water\nresources, ultimately displacing 1.5 million Syrians. Many believe that\nthese circumstances, understood by scientists to be partially the result of\nclimate change, contributed to the country\xe2\x80\x99s civil war.\n\n\n\nMilitary experts also are greatly concerned about the impending national\nsecurity challenges beginning to present themselves as Arctic ice melts\n(not to mention how it\xe2\x80\x99s contributing to sea level rise). The melting ice\nis opening up the polar region, creating new and uncharted operating areas\nfor all the world\xe2\x80\x99s navies and commercial vessels \xe2\x80\x94 not just for the US.\n\n\n\nAs shipping routes through the Arctic waters increase, we must be prepared\nto defend our interests. Greater access to the Arctic will require more US\nnaval engagement in the region.\n\n\n\nAnd no matter where a conflict occurs, we are often called upon to bring\nprompt relief to at-risk populations, because America is a global leader.\nIt is a responsibility in which our brave men and women in uniform take\npride.\n\n\n\nIn short, fighting climate change is about much more than warmer\ntemperatures. It\xe2\x80\x99s about famine, borders, the economy and yes, terrorism.\nFighting climate change is one of many critical components to stabilizing\nthe rest of the world. Instability breeds conflicts.\n\n\n\nThis is why Clinton prioritized addressing climate change at the State\nDepartment. As secretary of state, she appointed a special envoy for\nclimate change to serve as an adviser on international climate change\npolicy. She also established the Bureau of Energy Resources, which\naddresses the threat of climate change posed by the world\xe2\x80\x99s energy\nconsumption. These are both important steps for a healthier environment,\nbut they\xe2\x80\x99re also steps towards a safer world.\n\n\n\nAnd so when Clinton says climate change is \xe2\x80\x9cthe most consequential, urgent,\nsweeping collection of challenges\xe2\x80\x9d facing us today, she does so with the\nknowledge that it feeds into other serious global issues. The military\nunderstands that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just about warmer temperatures. It\xe2\x80\x99s about\nAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s basic national security.\n'
