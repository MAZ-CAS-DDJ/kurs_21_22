john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John,\n\nWe believe Benjamin Franklin said it best: "Any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both."\n\nHe\'s right -- and that\'s why we cannot allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation to bully companies like Apple to compromise the security and privacy of their customers. Any attempt by the FBI to force them into creating a "backdoor" to bypass digital locks that protect consumers\' information on iPhones is a clear violation of our individual right to privacy.\n\nJoin Mike Honda in telling the federal government to stop trying to force Apple to violate the privacy and security of its customers.\n\naction.mikehonda.com/page/s/apple?source=em20160223\n\nWe cannot compromise our values because of fear. This is a time to strengthen our resolve and defend the fundamental -- and constitutional -- values that make America great. \n\naction.mikehonda.com/page/s/apple?source=em20160223\n\nThanks,\n\nTeam Honda  \n\n\n\nCONTRIBUTE --> https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/hondapetitionthankyou?refcode=em20160221-apple&amp;amount=10&amp;recurring=yes\n\nPaid For By Mike Honda for Congress\n\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.
