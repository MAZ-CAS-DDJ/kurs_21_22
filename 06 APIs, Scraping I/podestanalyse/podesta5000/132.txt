Wanted to share in case you\nmissed it last month.   A couple other similar outlets, such as Free\nBeacon, picked it up too.\n\n\nhttp://washingtonexaminer.com/three-people-died-in-illegal-human-experiments-carried-out-by-john-podesta-backers-firm/article/2551139\n\n Three\n<http://washingtonexaminer.com/three-people-died-in-illegal-human-experiments-carried-out-by-john-podesta-backers-firm/article/2551139>\npeople died in illegal human experiments carried out by John Podesta\nbacker\'s firm\n BY RICHARD POLLOCK <http://washingtonexaminer.com/author/richard-pollock>\n<https://plus.google.com/115638159795051915448?rel=author> | JULY 23, 2014\n| 5:00 AM\n  TOPICS: WATCHDOG <http://washingtonexaminer.com/watchdog> BARACK OBAMA\n<http://washingtonexaminer.com/politics/barack-obama> CENTER FOR AMERICAN\nPROGRESS\n<http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/center-for-american-progress> FDA\n<http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/fda> ACCOUNTABILITY\n<http://washingtonexaminer.com/watchdog/accountability> JOHN PODESTA\n<http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/john-podesta>\n\nJohn Podesta <http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/john-podesta>, one\nof President\nObama <http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/barack-obama>\'s closest White\nHouse advisers, counts among his key financial supporters Hansjorg Wyss, a\nreclusive Swiss billionaire whose company conducted illegal human\nexperiments that resulted in the deaths of three elderly patients.\n\nJustice Department\n<http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/justice-department> attorneys negotiated\na $23.8 million plea deal\n<http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/CriminalInvestigations/ucm228273.htm> in 2011\nwith Synthes Inc., and Norian Corporation, its wholly owned subsidiary, and\nsent four of its U.S. executives to prison. The money was paid to the\nfederal government.\n\nTwo of the victims died in a California\n<http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/california> hospital and the third\nperished in a Texas <http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/texas> medical\nfacility. One of the California victims was Ryoichi Kikuchi, 83, who died\non the operating table at John Muir Hospital in Walnut Creek on Sept. 19,\n2009.\n\nHe was a prize-winning physicist who analyzed the thermodynamic behavior of\nliquids and gases and worked at scientific centers at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology, the University of California at Berkeley, the Max\nPlanck Institute in Germany <http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/germany> and\nthe National Bureau of Standards.\n\nThe federal judge who heard the case said the company\'s "pattern of\ndeception is unparalleled."\n\nSynthes was a Swiss medical device firm with U.S. corporate offices in West\nChester, Pa. Wyss opened the U.S. office in 1974 and was CEO until the\ncompany was bought by Johnson & Johnson in 2012 for $21.3 billion.\n\nThe *Washington Examine*r asked a White House spokesman whether the\npresident was aware of Podesta\'s relationship with Wyss or of the three\ndeaths when Podesta was invited to join the chief executive\'s inner circle.\nThe spokesman declined to respond.\n\nPodesta, who was White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton\n<http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/bill-clinton>, and Wyss have been\nfinancially linked for years. Among the Swiss billionaire\'s largest gifts\nin recent years have been those made to the Center for American Progress\n<http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/center-for-american-progress>.\n\nCAP received $4.1 million from Wyss during Podesta\'s tenure as the liberal\nnonprofit\'s founding president and chief executive officer. A CAP spokesman\ndeclined to respond to the *Examiner*\'s request for information about the\nPodesta-Wyss relationship.\n\nThe HJW Foundation, which is Wyss\'s private foundation, hired Podesta in\n2013 as a paid consultant, for which he was paid $87,000 that year,\naccording to the presidential counselor\'s financial disclosure statement.\n\nA HJW spokesman declined to respond to the *Examiner*\'s questions about the\nkind of work Podesta performed for the fee.\n\nWyss has a seat on CAP\'s 10-member board of directors, which also includes\nformer Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; former Senate Majority Leader\nTom Daschle, D-S.D.; and Carol Browner, Obama\'s first energy czar and\nadministrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n<http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/epa>under Clinton.\n\nPodesta\'s think tank is the fourth-largest recipient of Wyss money among 27\nliberal nonprofit activist groups the Swiss billionaire has supported since\n2008, according to the HJW Foundation\'sInternal Revenue Service\n<http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/irs> tax returns.\n\nThe IRS 990 tax returns for all of the groups can be reviewed via the\nExaminer\'s Citizen Audit database.\n<http://washingtonexaminer.com/data/citizen-audit>\n\nCAP itself was the largest single recipient of HJW contributions in 2011\nand 2012, according to the foundation\'s IRS filling.\n\nWyss and other Synthes executives decided to enter the highly profitable\nfield of spinal surgery in 2000 with Norian XR, a cement-like mixture of\ncalcium phosphate with barium sulfate.\n\nCompany managers claimed the compound could act like bone when injected in\nthe spine in a procedure called "vertebrosplasty."\n\nFederal prosecutors noted that at the time there was "excitement about\nusing Norian for vertebroplasties" at Synthes, even though the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration <http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/fda> had not\napproved its use on the spine. FDA approval could take at least three years.\n\nCompany managers, however, decided not to seek FDA approval for Norian XR\non the spine. Instead, they conducted unauthorized human experiments over a\nfour-year period that included the three deaths.\n\nFDA officials got wind of the deadly experiments and dispatched Capt.\nJoseph Despins in May 2004 to conduct an unannounced inspection, which kept\nhim at the company until June 18.\n\nDespins\' findings subsequently became the basis for a federal indictment of\nthe company\n<http://www.justice.gov/usao/pae/News/2009/jun/synthesrelease.pdf>, its\nsubsidiary and four of its officers, which was filed June 16, 2009.\n\nU.S. District Judge Legrome D. Davis said during a 2011 sentencing hearing\nfollowing the plea agreement that the two firms ran "rogue clinical\ntrials," conducted "illegal training of spine surgeons" and "in search of\nprofits, chose not to tell the FDA the truth."\n\nHe also said they "did not stop the testing until three elderly patients\nhad died on the operating table over the period of a year. ... This pattern\nof deception is unparalleled."\n\nFour Synthes executives went to jail, each for varying terms of less than\none year, in the plea agreement. They admitted their company had\nfeloniously conspired "to defraud the United States" in an effort "to\nimpair and impede the lawful functions of the Food and Drug Administration."\n\nWyss was not named in the indictment but was referred to as "Person No. 7"\nand the "CEO and a major stockholder of Synthes." Wyss was CEO and major\nstockholder at the time of the indictment and the experiments.\n\nWyss, who now lives in Wyoming\n<http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/wyoming>, is a major donor to scores\nof liberal groups in this country, with his contributions estimated to\ntotal more than $110 million, according to the HJW Foundation\'s tax filings\nwith the IRS since 2008.\n\nThe Swiss Broadcasting Corp. reported last year that Wyss was the\nsecond-richest person inSwitzerland\n<http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/switzerland>. He is the 112th\nwealthiest man in the world, with a net worth estimated at $11.2 billion by\nForbes magazine.\n\nDespite his relationship with Podesta and active role in funding liberal\npolitical activism, Wyss is not well known to the American public.\n\nIn fact, George Soros <http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/george-soros>,\nthe high-profile financial supporter of many liberal groups, has given less\nto CAP than Wyss.\n\nWyss told a Swiss newspaper in a rare interview in 2011 that "nobody knows\nme, and I hope that it stays like this," according to Fortune.\n\nBut federal court documents paint a graphic description of his firm\'s\nbrazen decision to ignore the FDA\'s drug approval procedures, which are\nintended to assure patient safety.\n\nThe FDA had previously approved another Synthes-produced substance for use\nin treating injured bones in the arm.\n\nBut in order for XR to be used in spinal cases, the company had to complete\nthe government\'s Investigational Device Exemption process.\n\nRegardless of whether the company pursued the IDE process, however, the FDA\nrequired Synthes to include a warning label on the XR compound\'s container\nstating it was "not intended for the treatment of vertebral compression\nfractures."\n\nWyss and his subordinates decided during a Nov. 15, 2001, meeting to forgo\nthe IDE process and to proceed with the unauthorized human experiments,\naccording to the indictment.\n\n"Person No. 7 decided that Synthes would not pursue an IDE study," the\nindictment said, referring directly to Wyss. The meeting minutes noted the\nCEO and his subordinates ordered 60-80 test procedures without FDA approval.\n\nIn a pre-sentencing report, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary Crawley described\nWyss\'s role: "After this [November] meeting Wyss, the CEO and major\nshareholder of Synthes, directed that Synthes would not pursue FDA approval\nof Norian XR via an IDE," but "would press on with a \'test market\'" with\nsurgeons.\n\nCrawley also said the Synthes test market programs "were not slow or\ncautious, or careful, or motivated by patient safety."\n\nDavis said at a Dec. 13, 2011, sentencing hearing for Michael D. Huggins,\none of the convicted Synthes executives, that "the safer and lawful\napproval route was expressly rejected."\n\n"One of the most offensive things was the little piddly sentence they got\nfor this," complained Eva Sloan, whose elderly mother, Lois Eskind, died\nduring an XR experiment, according to Fortune.\n\nSloan filed a separate wrongful death lawsuit against the company in 2012\nthat charged "willful, wanton, malicious and reckless misconduct."\n\nThe four executives "could have gone to 7-Eleven and stolen a six-pack of\nbeer and got more time," she said.\n\nSloan\'s lawsuit was settled out of court. Laura Feld, Sloan\'s attorney,\nsaid she could not comment because the settlement included a\nconfidentiality agreement.\n\nDefense attorney Brent J. Gurney told Davis at a sentencing hearing he\nthought Wyss was the missing person at the table.\n\n"There is another person who is not present in this process," he said while\nrepresenting former Synthes executive Richard E. Bohner, "and that is the\nformer chairman, CEO, controlling shareholder of the company, Mr. Wyss."\n\nGurney, a former U.S. attorney, said, "Mr. Wyss was a highly involved owner\nof Synthes. The record shows that at the very beginning, it was he who made\nsome of the very critical decisions that put the company on its ultimate\npathway."\n'
