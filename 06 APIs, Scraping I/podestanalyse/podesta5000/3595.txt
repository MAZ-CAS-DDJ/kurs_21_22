Alice told me she saw you at the annual CAP\nProgressive party last month - I'm sorry that I missed the event and the\nchance to catch up.\n\nAs Alice mentioned, she and I are getting married on Saturday, August 22,\n2015 in Sonoma, CA.  We would absolutely LOVE to have you and your wife\njoin us for the combination American/Chinese/Indian ceremony and\ncelebration.\n\nWe would also be truly honored if you would speak at our wedding.  Would\nthis be possible?\n\nWe will always remain grateful to you and Jen for the part you played in\nour relationship. Your support is what allowed DFA to flourish and without\nthat Alice and I may not have found each other.\n\nYou should have received an invitation a few weeks ago via email and we\nwill be resending them again over the next few days.  We really hope this\nworks out.  It would mean the world to us to have you there.\n\nWarm wishes,\nVivek and Alice\n786-245-4550 (Vivek)\n917-496-9573 (Alice)\n"
