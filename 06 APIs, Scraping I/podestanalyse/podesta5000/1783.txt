We knew Evelyn and always enjoyed seeing her and Ed here or there over the years since those Clinton days.  John got the word yesterday that she had passed and we felt doubly bad because we had not known that she had been sick.

At the White House and elsewhere, Mrs. Lieberman was a mentor and adviser to so many. Her legacy begins with a legion of young women who are now leading lights of policy and politics, changing the world every day: Diane Dewhirst, Mary Ellen Glynn, Julie Mason, Evan Ryan, Kathy McKiernan, April Melody, Jennifer Palmieri, and so many more.\n>>>> Mrs. Lieberman died of cancer on Saturday night in D.C. at age 71, with her husband, Ed, at her side. Per her Smithsonian bio: "Lieberman was the first under secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs at the U.S. Department of State, appointed by President Bill Clinton. ... From 1997 to 1999, Lieberman was the director of Voice of America ... Lieberman was a member of the White House staff from 1993 to 1997. She served as assistant to the President and deputy chief of staff, the first woman to hold that title. She also served as deputy assistant to the President and deputy press secretary for operations and as assistant to the chief of staff in the Office of the First Lady." Evelyn loved this picture of her. http://s.si.edu/1I2nzSh ... Her 2014 commencement at SUNY Buffalo State http://bit.ly/1YdIqDS\n>>>> --John F. Harris and Marin Cogan on Politico, June 10, 2010: "[A]mong Clintonites she was celebrated as the person who usually succeeded in demanding that people who work at the White House not forget they are working at the White House ... Change that dress. Shave that beard. Clean up your act. Clinton himself ... was afraid of crossing her. As deputy chief of staff, Lieberman assigned herself a role that was one part doting Jewish mother and two parts drill sergeant. When she left the post at the end of Clinton\'s first term, chief of staff Leon Panetta praised her for delivering \'the perfect mixture of chicken soup and a kick in the butt.\'" http://politi.co/1miWBvN\xe2\x80\x9d\n>>>>  \n>>>>  \n>>>> Dennis W.
