john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\n\nThe matter I wanted to discuss with you was your possible attendance at the March 16th climate funders table dinner we are hosting in SF.  You may know that Christiana Figueres is confirmed, but it would be terrific to have you there as well.  We should be able to get a great group of people around the table, and we are certainly hoping to discuss how climate and clean energy will play in the 2016 election and beyond.\n\nWe\'d like to send out the invites today, but if you will need more time to figure it out, we\'ll send the invites out without your name and we can let people know later if you can make it.\n\n Happy to discuss at your convenience. 510-710-8269.\n\nNat\n\n\nSent from my iPad\n\nOn Feb 3, 2016, at 4:35 PM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>> wrote:\n\nWhat\'s your number?\n\nOn Wednesday, February 3, 2016, Nat Simons Elan <NSimons@elanmgmt.com<mailto:NSimons@elanmgmt.com>> wrote:\nI must have an old cell number.
