john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear Editor;\n \nIn your editorial, "Homecare Rules in the Homestretch," you fail to  \nunderstand the reality of living on government funded Medicaid, and the Russian  \nRoulette pistol aimed at the heads of the Seniors, People with Disabilities \nand  our Home Care Workers who depend on it, every year when budgets are cut. \n Although overtime pay would be great for IHSS providers, in publicly \nfunded  Medicaid programs, states that are cutting IHSS (In Home Supportive \nServices)  are not likely to provide overtime pay and will instead most likely  \ncut hours worked above 159 hours a month for any one provider.  There  is a \nbig move to push through these Department of Labor rules as written right  \nnow with no consideration of how they\'ll really play out in the homes of \nSeniors  and People with Disabilities and their Caregivers in New York and \nCalifornia  where people have over 159 hours of IHSS a month. \n\nI know of a proud union member, a mother over 60, who has  multiple \ndisabilities of her own and takes care of her adult son with athetoid  cerebral \npalsy who will see her household income of about $2520 a month in  California \ndrop to $1431, as her hours are cut from 280 hours a month to 159  hours. She \ndoesn\'t have the stamina to supplement her income with more jobs and  she \nhas trouble finding other caregivers because her son cannot be understood  \nvery well by others.  The union has taken over $40 a month from her for  check \neach month to lobby for what will cut her income by a pretty big fraction.  \nJerry Brown just got done settling a lawsuit trying to cut the IHSS program \nin  California by 20% and settled for cutting it by about 8 percent.  Do \nyou  really think he\'s going to take time and a half for over 50,000  \nproviders?  His representative on an Olmsted conference said they  wouldn\'t.\nWhen I was in the Young Socialist  Alliance in college, before I had my \naccident, I believed in theories in a  vacuum.  Then I became disabled and saw \nhow these things work out on a  real-life level.  In California, we have the \nmost highly advanced  In-Home Supportive Services program, and the reason \nit was so good is that the  disabled person received money to find somebody \nand all of that money went  directly to the caregiver.  The attendant got all \nthe bang for the  buck.  And while ADAPT American Disabled for Attendant \nPrograms Today  was fighting to get In Home Care, this wonderful program to \nall the  states, they came up with things like "Money Follows the Person" and \n"Community  First Choice Option" where that money continued to go to the \ndisabled person to  pay directly to their caregiver with no middleman. \nBut suddenly all kinds of  profiteering is going on as big bad corporations \nand yes even sometimes big bad  unions behaviors are immerging as monied \ninterests smell a beautiful dollar to  be made in the graying of the baby \nboomers.  On a good day the union is our  greatest blessing on a bad day they \nare our greatest curse.  The only way  to come up with a reasonable solution \nthat takes everyone\'s welfare into account  is to sit down and work it out.  \nI think what\'s been most frightening to me  in all of this is the ease with \nwhich able-bodied regard People with  Disabilities as invisible.  The SEIU \nwould not even sit down at the table  with People with Disabilities to work \nout a compromise.  Would this happen  to a person of color?  Are we the last \npopulation to be seen as a fraction  of a person -- or a person who is \nreally there at  all? \nPeople have been making industries  of people with disabilities for \ndecades, in the nursing home industry, the  charity industry, and now the medical \nindustrial complex and the unions too  on a bad day.  People from ADAPT \nclawed our ways out of nursing homes that  were profiteering off of us and now we \nhave to fight against the nursing agency  industry, managed care \ncorporations, and even at times a union that is so out of  touch with its rank and \nfile providers needs that it would create three crappy  jobs from one not so \ngood one in order to collect two or three union dues on a  one house.  It is \nthe people disabilities and rank-and-file providers, who  are in a symbiotic \nrelationship, huddled together to keep industries and unions  from \nobjectifying us "furniture" in their business plans.  You can  choose to be na\xc3\xafve and \ncome up with lovely little fairy lands in your own mind,  but make no \nmistake, your na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9 will be paid for by the rank-and-file workers  whose pay \nwill be cut badly and people with disabilities who will go back  to nursing \nhomes. \nThe ADAPT-NCIL compromise would  simply eliminate the exemption for third \nparty employers, treating Medicaid  consumers in consumer directed programs \n(including public authorities, fiscal  intermediaries and agencies with \nchoice) the same as private employers so they  can still use the existing \nexemption.  According to the DOL analysis, this  change - alone - would eliminate \nthe companionship exemption for 70% of home  care workers.  It covers all of \nthe "bad players" and concerns raised in  the DOL analysis that exist in \ntraditional home care while minimizing the  negative impact on people with \ndisabilities and preventing the unexpected  consequences such changes would have \non real live people in Medicaid funded  programs.  \nWhere were our points of view in  this newspaper? In the DOL discussions?  \nWhy include us?  It\xe2\x80\x99s only  our bodies and freedom. If anyone had any \nrespect for people with disabilities  we would\'ve included us in the discussion. \nNancy Becker  Kennedy\n\nJoin the IHSS Consumers Union on Facebook at  \n(https://console.mxlogic.com/redir/?2-CqenD4mjhOrhpuK_ssUr01eXrO5qBunMz6HqRc3gKc372lokrl-d0D2looCU-ztAQszH\nFIIcIKorLOoVcsCej79zztPsdxoIgawHqDYKr7fTjvdEIKccECzAQsLFCTPhOr5P22hEw3FkQx8-\nkONEwnlrxapoQgmH2TNxgQglc_4QgbHr2lok9Omd44mP_ErDUvf0srhdK6Qn1NEVppuKrtJEc) \n\n_http://www.facebook.com/groups/IHSS.ConsumersUnion/_ \n(https://console.mxlogic.com/redir/?LFCzBVN5AQsCQmnHLT7e6M0jKSYxmFnBY8NGSJj0Qbz0NMBm56Rvzg9MBm66XY\nCej79zANOoUTsT3omb42EaSF_bCNPZQTPqbbz3a9EVd7bWpJYQsCNsMwAq80Wld8ifBcIq85RmUi\nCmd45GMJYokd45jfNd42WSMBm52sBzh15I_W6V-7PM76QPrxJ5MsqemmnHCZta8RDdzOSkj) \n\n"Nothing  About Us Without Us!"

These \nfamilies could see their household income drop dramatically.   Significantly \ndisabled people with over 160 hours could lose loyal live-in and  live out \ncaregivers they\'ve had for decades, because their work hours will be  cut below \nthe money they need to live.  Or people with severe  disabilities may not be \nable to get providers to help them when one of the  providers needs to \nleave, because the remaining providers will be in danger  working overtime. The \nunintended consequences of this unbalanced approach  to the way private and \npublic in-home supportive services are paid could lead  to widespread misery \nin publicly funded In-Home Supportive  Services. \n\nSenior and Disability Rights Advocates were not  included in discussions \nwhere these Department of Labor rules were  developed.  Now, the National \nCouncil on Disability is trying to explain  this to those who can make a \ndifference.  Their letter is printed  below.  The NCIL/ADAPT compromise could be a \nwin-win  solution for everyone, where privately funded agencies would have \ndifferent  rules than in publicly funded Medicaid In-Home Supportive Services \nin  states where finite revenues determine what can be paid. "Our  \ncompromise creates a win-win solution, covers 70% of attendants and allows us  all \nto be at the table for further discussion,"  says Bruce Darling of  CDR ADAPT.\n\nBelow see the Letter from the National Council on  Disability about these \npossible negative unintended consequences. \nhttp://www.ncd.gov/publications/2013/03192013/  The  Disability and Senior communities and the rank-and-file \nIHSS providers in New  York and California do not seem to of been fully \ninformed or permitted to give  input about the impact of this law as written.  If \nafter reading this  letter, you feel the Office of Management and Budget \nshould delay changing  these rules until they consult with Disability And \nSenior Communities and  make sure it won\'t cut the number of hours providers are \npermitted to work in  publicly funded programs,  \n\nNancy Becker Kennedy\n\nJoin the IHSS Consumers Union on  Facebook at   \n(http://www.facebook.com/groups/IHSS.ConsumersUnion/265103970234336/) \n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/groups/IHSS.ConsumersUnion/\n\n\n\n\n\n"Nothing  About Us Without Us!"
