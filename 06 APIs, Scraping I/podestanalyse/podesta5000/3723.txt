Christopher S. Bond regularly railed against President Obama\'s\neconomic stimulus plan as irresponsible spending that would drive up the\nnational debt. But behind the scenes, the Missouri Republican quietly\nsought more than $50 million from a federal agency for two projects in\nhis state. \n\nMr. Bond was not alone. More than a dozen Republican lawmakers, while\ndenouncing the stimulus to the media and their constituents, privately\nsent letters to just one of the federal government\'s many agencies\nseeking stimulus money for home-state pork projects. \n\nThe letters to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), obtained\nthrough the Freedom of Information Act, expose the gulf between\nlawmakers\' public criticism of the overall stimulus package and their\nprivate lobbying for projects close to home. \n\n"It\'s not illegal to talk out of both sides of your mouth, but it does\nseem to be a level of dishonesty troubling to the American public," said\nMelanie Sloan, executive director of the watchdog group Citizens for\nResponsibility and Ethics in Washington. \n\nIn a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Mr. Bond noted that\none project applying to the USDA for stimulus money would "create jobs\nand ultimately spur economic opportunities." \n\nHe and other lawmakers make no apologies for privately seeking stimulus\nmoney after they voted against it and continue to criticize the plan: "I\nstrongly opposed the stimulus, but the only thing that could make it\nworse would be if none of it returned to the taxpayers of Missouri,"\nsaid Mr. Bond, who is retiring. \n\nBut watchdog groups say the lawmakers\' public talk and private letters\ndon\'t square, highlighting a side of government spending largely\novershadowed by the "earmarking" process. While members of Congress must\ndisclose their earmarks - or pet projects they slip into broader\nspending bills - the private funding requests they make in letters to\nagencies fall outside of the public\'s view. \n\n"There is a definite disconnect between the public statements and the\nprivate letters," said Thomas A. Schatz, president of the nonpartisan\nCitizens Against Government Waste. "It does seem inconsistent to say\nyou\'re against the bill but then you want some little piece of it." \n\nAt a televised meeting with the House Republican caucus late last month,\nMr. Obama chided GOP lawmakers who, he said, took credit for projects\nfunded by the same stimulus bill they voted against - adding that some\nwere even attending ribbon-cutting ceremonies. \n\nBut the USDA letters also reveal a more discreet way for lawmakers to\ntry to steer money to home-state projects. \n\n\'Misguided spending bill\'\n\nSeveral Republicans who sent letters to the USDA for home-state projects\nseeking an infusion of stimulus cash are facing competitive re-election\nraces. \n\nRep. Joe Wilson, South Carolina Republican who became famous after\nyelling, "You lie," during Mr. Obama\'s addresses to Congress in\nSeptember, voted against the stimulus. Nonetheless, Mr. Wilson elbowed\nhis way into the rush for federal stimulus cash in a letter he sent to\nMr. Vilsack on behalf of a foundation seeking funding. \n\n"We know their endeavor will provide jobs and investment in one of the\npoorer sections of the Congressional District," he wrote to Mr. Vilsack\nin the Aug. 26, 2009, letter. \n\n"Congressman Wilson\'s position on the stimulus bill is consistent," said\nspokeswoman Pepper Pennington. She said Mr. Wilson opposed the stimulus\nas a "misguided spending bill," but once it passed, he wanted to make\nsure South Carolina residents "receive their share of the pie." \n\nOn Feb. 13, 2009, Sen. Robert F. Bennett, Utah Republican, issued a\nstatement criticizing the stimulus - but two days earlier, he privately\nforwarded to Mr. Vilsack a list of projects seeking stimulus money. \n\n"I believe the addition of federal funds to these projects would\nmaximize the stimulative effect of these projects on the local economy,"\nhe wrote. \n\nMr. Bennett is up for re-election and facing several Republican\nchallengers. Last month, the conservative anti-tax group Club for Growth\nannounced that it was opposing his nomination for a fourth term. \n\n"It is absurd to require Utah taxpayers to foot their portion of the\nbill associated with stimulus spending and then ask them to forgo\ncompeting for those funds without the input of their congressional\nrepresentatives," said Bennett spokeswoman Tara Hendershott DiJulio. \n\nAlso facing a competitive race, Rep. Pat Tiberi, Ohio Republican, in\nOctober called the final Democratic stimulus bill "loaded with [House\nSpeaker] Nancy Pelosi\'s grab bag of big spending wishes" and that it\n"saddles future generations with mountains of debt." \n\nHe struck a different tone in a letter to Mr. Vilsack. \n\n"While this project is intended to expand rural broadband in Alaska, I\nunderstand that the project could support businesses and jobs in\ncommunities across the country," Mr. Tiberi wrote, citing one such\ncompany in his district. \n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Tiberi said he is just fighting for jobs in his\ndistrict. \n\n"Congressman Tiberi didn\'t support the stimulus bill, but when it comes\ndown to parts of the bill that are actually going to support jobs, he\'s\ngoing to come down on the side of supporting businesses and Ohio jobs,"\nTiberi spokeswoman Breann Gonzalez said. \n\nJob creation?\n\nOther Republican lawmakers who wrote on behalf of projects applying for\nstimulus money don\'t have any re-election worries anytime soon. \n\nBefore his vote against the stimulus, Sen. Mike Johanns, who took office\nlast year from Nebraska, predicted that "the money would simply never\nreach the economy." \n\nA secretary of agriculture under President George W. Bush, Mr. Johanns\nlater told the Grand Island, Neb., Independent newspaper that "it would\nbe hard for me to imagine that we are going to be creating many jobs\nhere." Yet he saw the prospect of at least a few dozen jobs in a letter\nhe later sent to Mr. Vilsack for a home-state project, records show. \n\n"The proposed project would create 38 new jobs and bring broadband to\neight hospitals, five colleges, 16 libraries and 161 K-12 schools," Mr.\nJohanns wrote. \n\nE-mails and calls to Mr. Johanns\' office were not returned. \n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, Tennessee Republican, who easily won re-election\nin 2008, said of the stimulus, "This is spending, not stimulus." \n\nIn a letter to Mr. Vilsack for a project applying for stimulus money,\nMr. Alexander noted, "It is anticipated that the project will create\nover 200 jobs in the first year and at least another 40 new jobs in the\nfollowing years." \n\nJim Jeffries, a spokesman for Mr. Alexander, said the senator believes\nhis constituents have a right to apply for stimulus funds. \n\n"Sen. Alexander voted against the stimulus because it was too much\nspending and too much debt for too little benefit to the economy," Mr.\nJeffries said. "Republicans lost that fight and the money will be spent,\nand because Tennessee taxpayers will end up footing part of the bill,\nthey have a right to apply for the funds." \n\nPete Sepp, vice president of the National Taxpayers Union, called that\nphilosophy troubling. \n\n"It\'s hard to expect lawmakers to behave like angels when this much\nmoney is being airdropped all over the country," Mr. Sepp said. "But the\nmore strident the rhetoric, the worse it looks. For me, with these\ngrants where they\'re saying a project is going to create a certain\nnumber of jobs, it makes you wonder: Do they really believe that? Or is\nit just part of a cynical cash grab?" \n\nGetting their \'fair share\'\n\nRanked among the most conservative members of the House by the American\nConservative Union (ACU), Rep. John Linder, Georgia Republican, posted a\nblog item on his Web site on Oct. 21, stating that recent unemployment\nfigures "only reinforce the fact that the $787 billion \'stimulus\' signed\ninto law eight months ago has done nothing for job growth in this\ncountry." \n\nTwo weeks earlier, Mr. Linder had sent a letter to Mr. Vilsack backing\nan application for stimulus money by the Elauwit Community Foundation,\nrecords show. With unemployment in Georgia topping 10 percent, "the\nemployment opportunities created by this program would be quickly\nutilized," Mr. Linder wrote. \n\nMr. Linder said the letter doesn\'t change his staunch opposition to the\nstimulus. \n\n"I have opposed every stimulus plan that has come before Congress\nbecause it is simply bad policy, but if they pass, the communities in my\ndistrict which are paying for them deserve to be equally considered in\ntheir benefits," Mr. Linder said. \n\nAnother House member who has scored high ACU rankings, Rep. Robert B.\nAderholt, Alabama Republican, also voted against and criticized the\nstimulus. \n\n"Rather than create jobs or stimulate the economy, this massive spending\nbill was a laundry list of programs that focused on states with big-city\nurban communities," he wrote in the Oct. 4 edition of the Daily Mountain\nEagle newspaper. \n\nThree days later, Mr. Aderholt sent a letter to Mr. Vilsack on behalf of\na foundation seeking stimulus money to expand broadband services in his\ndistrict. \n\n"Congressman Aderholt supported some of the ideas in the American\nRecovery and Reinvestment Act, but disagreed with much of it and that\'s\nwhy he voted against it," Aderholt spokesman D.J. Jordan said. \n\n"Since the bill was passed and became law, the congressman wanted to\nhelp a local foundation receive some of the broadband money that\notherwise would go to another state." \n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, Alaska Republican, called the stimulus "excessive"\nand voted against it, though she noted that money in the legislation\nwould benefit her state. She, too, wrote to the USDA to support Alaska\nprojects seeking stimulus funds. \n\n"I opposed the stimulus bill as did most of my colleagues in the\nRepublican caucus, but it was passed in Congress and signed into law,"\nshe said, when asked about her support for project seeking stimulus\nfunds. \n\n"When constituents come to me asking for support in a competitive\napplication process for funding for broadband expansion, I am happy to\nsupport their request. I will always fight to make sure my state gets\nits fair share of available federal dollars," she added. \n\nSen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate\nFinance Committee, was yet another lawmaker who voted against the\nstimulus and later backed applications for stimulus money in two letters\nto the Agriculture Department. \n\n"If the funds are there, Senator Grassleys going to help Iowa, rather\nthan some other state, get its share," spokeswoman Jill Kozeny said. \n\nAccording to records, at least eight other Republicans lawmakers who\nvoted against the stimulus later sent letters to the USDA backing\nvarious projects\' stimulus applications. \n\n \n<http://open.mkt2079.com/open/log/2781727/MTMxMDkyMTgyNTMS1/0/MTcwOTc4NT\nI1S0/1/0> ________________________________________\nJeremy J.
