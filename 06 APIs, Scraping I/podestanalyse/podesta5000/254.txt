john.podesta@gmail.comb'All,\n\nWe just wanted to pass along this AP story about PTSD diagnosis.  This has\nbeen happening for years, we just finally got some evidence to break this\nstory.\n\nBest,\n\nJS\n\n E-mail from VA worker says to avoid PTSD diagnosis\n\nKIMBERLY HEFLING\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON - An internal e-mail written by a Veterans Affairs Department\nemployee suggested avoiding a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder\nfor veterans and instead considering a diagnosis that might result in a\nlower disability payment.\n\nA copy of the e-mail was distributed Thursday by the groups Citizens for\nResponsibility and Ethics in Washington, a congressional watchdog group, and\nVoteVets.org. The e-mail dated March 20 had been forwarded to VoteVets.org,\nan Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans lobbying group opposed to the Bush\nadministration\'s handling of the war and veterans issues.\n\nThe name of the sender and the recipients were blacked out by the groups.\nThe e-mail has the subject title "Suggestion."\n\n"Given that we are having more and more compensation seeking veterans, I\'d\nlike to suggest that we refrain from giving a diagnosis of PTSD straight\nout. Consider a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder, R/O PTSD," the e-mail\nsaid.\n\nIt also said, "Additionally, we really don\'t or have time to do the\nextensive testing that should be done to determine PTSD."\n\nVA Secretary James Peake issued a statement calling the e-mail sender\'s\nsuggestions "inappropriate" and said the employee had been repudiated and\nwas apologetic. The VA did not release the name of the employee.\n\n"We are committed to absolute accuracy in a diagnosis and unwavering in\nproviding any and all earned benefits," Peake said. "PTSD and the mental\nhealth arena is no exception."\n\nJust last week, Peake was called to Capitol Hill to answer questions about\ninternal e-mails that surfaced during a trial that seemed to suggest VA\nofficials were hiding the number of veterans trying to kill themselves. One\ne-mail started with "Shh!" Some lawmakers have said the official who wrote\nit should be fired, but Peake has said he has no plans to do so. Peake\npromised to make the agency more open.\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder is an anxiety disorder that can occur after a\ntraumatic event such as war. Nightmares, flashbacks, and substance abuse can\nbe among the symptoms.\n\nA recent study by the Rand Corp., found that that about one in five troops\nwho found in Iraq or Afghanistan have symptoms of major depression or\npost-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nJon Soltz, an Iraq War Veteran who is chairman of VoteVets.org, said some\nveterans have suspected they received a diagnosis of an adjustment disorder\ninstead of the correct diagnosis of PTSD because the payout to them would be\nless.\n\n"Many veterans believe that the government just doesn\'t want to pay out the\ndisability that comes along with a PTSD diagnosis," Soltz said in a\nstatement, "and this revelation will not allay their concerns."\n\n\n-- \nJon Soltz\nIraq War Veteran\n\nChairman\nVoteVets.org\n\n646-415-8429\n\n303 Park Ave. S., #1293\nNew York, NY 10010\n'
