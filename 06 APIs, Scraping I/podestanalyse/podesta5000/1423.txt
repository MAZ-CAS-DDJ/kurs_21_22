President DeGioia will be joining us in order to celebrate Phil Schrag\x92s many accomplishments.  As many of you know, Georgetown University last fall recognized the remarkable accomplishments of our colleague, Phil Schrag, in bestowing upon him a President\x92s Award for Distinguished Scholar-Teachers.  By this award, Georgetown honors faculty members from across the University who have excelled in both scholarship and teaching, and combined them in imaginative ways, over many years.  When the President\x92s Awards were given out at the last Fall Faculty Convocation, Phil was unable to be present. President DeGioia has generously agreed to come to the Law Center to celebrate Phil\x92s accomplishments with our faculty at our lunch today.\n\nPlease join us  to celebrate a great career in legal education \x96 I look forward to seeing you there.\n\nBest,\nBill\n\n\n\n\n'
