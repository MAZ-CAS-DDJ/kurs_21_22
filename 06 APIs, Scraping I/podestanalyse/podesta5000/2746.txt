George Mitchell is being\nconsidered for Middle East Envoy.  My friends such as Daniel Levy and\nJeremy Ben-Ami of JStreet consider this a very good development. George\nis considered to be a serious and fair-minded diplomat and his\nappointment would indicate a break with the failed policies of former\nMiddle East specialists such as Dennis Ross.    If you have any occasion\nsoon to speak with influential figures such as John Podesta or Hilary\nClinton, you might consider expressing your strong support for George\nMitchell.     \n\n \n\nI don't have any hard evidence that it is the case, but circumstances\nsuggest that there may now exist a counter-campaign sponsored by AIPAC\nto prevent the selection of Mitchell.  Any voices we could motivate in\nsupport of Mitchell would be most useful.\n\n \n\nThanks,\n\n \n\nBill\n\n \n\n"
