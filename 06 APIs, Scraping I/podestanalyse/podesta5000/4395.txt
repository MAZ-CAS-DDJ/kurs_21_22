The cashiers and hourly sales associates at the\n> White Plains Walmart close to your house, for example, live in a city\n> with a living wage of -- as estimated by the MIT Living Wage Calculator\n> -- $13.05, but most hourly Walmart workers are paid thousands of\n> dollars per year below that standard. It\'s no surprise that one\n> Walmart manager even admitted this disconnect between Walmart pay and\n> fair pay by placing a bin out last holiday season to solicit donations\n> from customers for his own needy workers.\n>\n>  Seventy percent of the positions subject to Walmart\'s hourly poverty\n> wage regime are held by women.

Irregular schedules\n> and a miserly sick day policy make Walmart a difficult place for\n> mothers to work.

Worse over,\n> Walmart\'s poverty wage regime drives down the wages and benefits of\n> neighboring stores, again disproportionately hurting women, who make\n> up the majority of the low-wage workforce in America.\n>\n>  Walmart could end this assault on their female "associates" by paying\n> all their workers at least $10.92, which is the inflation-adjusted\n> wage that the lowest paid Walmart workers -- under their founder, Sam\n> Walton -- earned in the late 1960\'s. Before Walton\'s billionaire heirs\n> cry \'Impossible!\', remember: (1) Walmart pays all their workers in\n> Ontario, Canada and Santa Fe, New Mexico over $10 an hour and still\n> remains quite profitable; (2) Walmart had enough funds to issue $51\n> billion in stock buybacks over the past five years, which could have\n> given every American Walmart worker a $3.50 per hour raise over the\n> past five years; and (3) a 2011 U.C. Berkeley economic study showed\n> that even if Walmart raised its starting wage to $12 and passed all\n> the costs onto customers, it would only cost Walmart shoppers 46 cents\n> more per shopping trip.\n>\n>  In 1986, when Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas, you reflected a\n> single case of women\'s empowerment at Walmart by becoming Walmart\'s\n> first female director. During your six years as a Walmart board\n> member, you honorably pushed for women\'s empowerment. Twenty eight\n> years later, we are asking you to make far broader history again for\n> women at Walmart by publicly pressuring your former board to end its\n> poverty wage regime and restore the wages of hundreds of thousands of\n> its female associates.\n>\n>  Here are four ways you can immediately activate your deep Walmart\n> ties to help this important feminist cause:\n>\n> 1. Publicly encourage former Walmart CEO H. Lee Scott, who had dinner\n> at your home in 2006, to build on his minimum wage raise support from\n> nine years ago by urging his successor C. Douglas McMillon to follow\n> in his footsteps by endorsing a minimum wage raise this year.\n>\n> 2. Publicly encourage Alice Walton, the Walmart heiress who donated\n> $25,000 to Ready for Hillary last year, to use her power as a major\n> shareholder to force a raise in the wages of the hundreds of thousands\n> of Walmart associates who make less in a year of work than Walton does\n> in 10 minutes from interest on her inheritance.\n>\n> 3. Publicly encourage Clinton administration advisor Leslie Dach, who\n> you have worked with on labor issues recently, to leverage his role as\n> a former Walmart executive vice president to pressure his successors\n> to end Walmart\'s poverty wage regime.\n>\n> 4. Publicly encourage Walmart director Aida Alvarez, who campaigned\n> for you and was your husband\'s final Small Business Administration\n> leader, to coordinate with other social justice-minded Walmart\n> directors -- such as former Detroit mayor Dennis Archer and civil\n> rights activist Vilma Martinez -- to end Walmart\'s poverty wage\n> regime.\n>\n> Campaign funders like Alice Walton might be \'Ready for Hillary\' to run\n> for President in 2016, but Walmart\'s women have been \'Ready for\n> Hillary\' to stand up for the wages they deserve this year. It would be\n> a shame to have your trailblazing legacy of Walmart women empowerment\n> rolled back. We hope you can keep it alive by pressuring your former\n> Walmart colleagues to raise the wages of its predominantly-female\n> hourly workforce to $11, their inflation-adjusted 1968 level.  This is\n> no big deal: the workers have more than earned an $11 per hour wage,\n> had it taken from them by inflation year after year, and will continue\n> to until they can catch up with 1968, inflation adjusted.\n>\n> Sincerely,\n>\n> Ralph Nader\n>\n> Consumer and Labor Advocate\n>\n> Washington, DC\n>\n> Pete Davis\n>\n> Time for a Raise Campaign\n>\n> Washington, DC\n>\n> The Southern Labor Studies Association\n>\n> Williamsburg, VA\n>\n> Al Norman\n>\n> Director, Sprawl-Busters\n>\n> Georgia Women for a Change\n>\n> Atlanta, GA\n>\n> Maine Women\'s Lobby\n>\n> Augusta, ME\n>\n> Adolph Reed\n>\n> Professor of Political Science\n>\n> University of Pennsylvania\n>\n> Bethany Moreton\n>\n> Author of To Serve God and Wal-Mart\n>\n> University of Georgia\n>\n> Eileen Boris\n>\n> Chair, Department of Feminist Studies\n>\n> University of California, Santa Barbara\n>\n> Michael Pierce\n>\n> Professor of History\n>\n> University of Arkansas\n>\n> C.
