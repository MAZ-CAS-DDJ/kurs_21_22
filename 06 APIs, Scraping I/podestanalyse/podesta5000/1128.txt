It doesn't have to happen.\n\nThe majority of Americans support President Obama's \nbalanced approach to deficit reduction -- add your name \nif you do, too:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Tell-the-GOP-to-Act\n\nSo far, congressional Republicans are refusing to \ncompromise -- all because they don't want to close tax \nloopholes for millionaires, billionaires, vacation homes, \nand corporate jets. Seriously.\n\nThis has very real consequences.\n\nOn the chopping block are 10,000 teaching jobs, more than \n70,000 kids' spots in Head Start, $35 million for local fire \ndepartments, $43 million to make sure seniors don't go \nhungry, and access to nutrition assistance for 600,000 \nwomen and their families. That's just a few of the things we'll \nlose.\n\nPresident Obama has put forth a balanced deficit reduction \nplan with smart spending cuts that protect the critical \ninvestments needed to strengthen middle-class families and \nour economy.\n\nWe need to send a strong signal about where Americans \nstand on this issue.\n\nAdd your name today:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Tell-the-GOP-to-Act\n\nThanks,\n\nMessina\n\nJim Messina\nChair\nOrganizing for Action\n\nP.S. -- If Congress fails to act, this fight doesn't end tomorrow. We'll \nneed to put even more pressure on Republicans to stop these \nbudget cuts and pass a balanced plan.
