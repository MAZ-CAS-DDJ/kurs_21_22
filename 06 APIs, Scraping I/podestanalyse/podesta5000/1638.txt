Tim Ryan\n\nFebruary 6, 2015, 4:00 a.m.\n\n\n\nSecretary Clinton understands our working class values, and that Ohio is a\nstate that is deeply proud of its work ethic and history of innovation. We\nvote for candidates who understand our principles and believe in our future.\n\n\n\nIn the next few years, we must continue to focus on creating good-paying\njobs and building economic opportunity for every citizen. To help make this\ngoal a reality, I\'m joining millions of Democrats across Ohio in my\nexcitement for a potential Hillary Clinton candidacy and the values she\nrepresents. She knows that when you support middle class workers and\nfamilies, you help strengthen the economy and give our citizens the chance\nto succeed.\n\n\n\nSecretary Clinton has the experience and leadership on the issues that\nmatter most to Ohioans. In Arkansas, she expanded childhood education\nthroughout the state. As First Lady, Hillary worked to increase access to\nhealth care for every American. As a senator, she repeatedly fought to\nincrease the minimum wage and extend unemployment benefits and\njob-retraining programs. As secretary of state, Hillary worked to\nstrengthen our country\'s global standing and gained valuable experience\nthat will help her eliminate unfair trade practices that could create\nthousands of jobs in Ohio alone. Most recently, through the Clinton\nFoundation, Hillary has developed initiatives to help children and\nlow-income families. Simply put, Hillary understands the importance of\ninvesting in the fundamental building blocks that make America great.\n\n\n\nAfter all, being a leader is about assuring the safety of our citizens and\ncreating an environment that enables our economy to grow and thrive. That\nis what I have spent more than a decade fighting for on behalf of Ohioans\nin Congress. I believe that one of the best ways to achieve this is by\ndoubling down on our already strong manufacturing base, including old-line\nmanufacturing and the newer field of advanced manufacturing.\n\n\n\nWe must re-establish the United States of America as the world\'s leading\ninnovator in manufacturing, and Ohio should lead the way. Youngstown is\nhome to America Makes, the national additive manufacturing center and the\nnumber one ranked university incubator in the world. In Akron we have the\nBits and Atoms Innovation Center, which gives entrepreneurs a creative\nspace to build and develop new technologies. In Kent, a federal investment\nof $20 million led to over $120 million in other investments that have\ntransformed their downtown.\n\n\n\nThese types of ideas and innovations are happening in places like\nYoungstown, Kent and Akron largely thanks to the type of long-term vision\nand public-private partnerships that Secretary Clinton has spent a lifetime\nforging.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton has consistently been on the frontline of the battles to\nput more money in the pockets of middle-class workers, ensuring that all\nAmericans have the means to support their families. I believe that Hillary\nwould be the best person to continue the fight and to strongly and boldly\nlead Ohio and our country forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*National Journal: Charlie Cook: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Front-Runner\xe2\x80\x99s Peril\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.nationaljournal.com/the-cook-report/the-front-runner-s-peril-20150206>*\n\n\n\nBy Charlie Cook\n\nFebruary 6, 2015\n\n\n\nWhile the fight for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination looks like\nit will be a wild roller-coaster ride, the Democratic contest, at least\ntoday, looks like a pretty boring affair. History suggests that in open\npresidential nomination contests, front-runners rarely go from the starting\nline to the finish without losing a few primaries or caucuses along the\nway. Usually the leader stumbles, or a protest vote develops somewhere in\nthe process, or another candidate catches a bit of luck or sparks a bit of\ninterest. Typically, an element of doubt creeps in at some point, even if\nthe front-runner ultimately recovers and wins the nomination. But more so\nin some races than in others.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, many of us assumed early on that Mitt Romney would win the GOP\nnomination, and he of course ended up with it\xe2\x80\x94but it turned out to be a\npretty rocky trip. In the 2008 Democratic contest, Hillary Clinton started\noff as the front-runner. Barack Obama upset her in Iowa, but then she won\nin New Hampshire. Back and forth it went, with Obama coming out on top, but\nyou could have driven from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to Los Angeles\nwithout passing through a state where Obama won a primary or caucus. (Hint:\nIt is a Southern route that goes through Arkansas.) Even while George W.\nBush was rolling to the Republican nomination in 2000, he lost seven states\nto John McCain. Al Gore\'s 2000 coronation stands out as an exception to the\nrule that front-runners usually face setbacks in some states.\n\n\n\nSo what about Clinton? Could she really lose somewhere to Sen. Bernie\nSanders or to former Sen. Jim Webb? Sure, it\'s possible, but it takes a\npretty fertile imagination to picture it right now without Clinton really\nface-planting somewhere. What about former Maryland Gov. Martin O\'Malley?\nWhile folks in the Washington area, and certainly those in Maryland, know\nthat he left office under less-than-auspicious circumstances (you sure\ncan\'t blame former Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown entirely for the Democrats\' loss\nof the governorship in November), that might not hurt him much in a\nDemocratic fight that is still a long way off. But H-Rod\'s people probably\naren\'t losing a lot of sleep worrying about O\'Malley. If there is any buzz\nat all on the Democratic side about a potential challenge to Clinton, it\'s\naround Sen. Elizabeth Warren, not O\'Malley or anyone else. In a recent\nlunch conversation with 10 Democratic operatives, I heard more people name\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown as a long-shot alternative to Clinton than\nmention O\'Malley.\n\n\n\nWarren and her folks insist that she is not going to run in 2016, and I\nsuspect that if you gave the Massachusetts Democrat a shot of Sodium\nPentothal and wired her to a polygraph machine, the evidence would probably\nindicate that she\'s being forthright (though it would be interesting to see\nif there was any change in breathing, skin clamminess, or other indicators\nof stress). But at the same time, Warren is 65 years old, just two years\nyounger than Clinton. If she ever wants to run for president, this might be\nher last shot, and there appears to be little love lost between the two\nwomen and their camps. Clinton will have to perform a delicate balancing\nact. She must sit far enough to the left to forestall a serious nomination\nchallenge, but not so far that it would jeopardize winning the general\nelection.\n\n\n\nLet\'s face it: Hillary Clinton is the least-liberal Democrat who can\nplausibly win the nomination in 2016. Indeed, if she is not the nominee, it\nprobably will be someone to her left\xe2\x80\x94and also to the left of President\nObama, who is seen by the party\'s more ideological elements as having\ncompromised too much. While the past two Democratic nomination fights, in\n2004 and 2008, were not so much about ideology, if there is a contest in\n2016, it very likely will have more such overtones.\n\n\n\nClinton looks awfully strong for the Democratic nomination, and for good\nreason. We will see if it is true that politics, like nature, abhors a\nvacuum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Washington Post blog: The Fix: \xe2\x80\x9cAre men afraid to run against Hillary\nClinton BECAUSE she\xe2\x80\x99s a woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/02/05/are-men-afraid-to-run-against-hillary-clinton-because-shes-a-woman/>*\n\n\n\nBy Nia-Malika Henderson\n\nFebruary 5, 2015, 3:24 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton is on the glide path to the Democratic nomination, with few\ncredible challengers stepping forward. And Ross Baker, a political\nscientist professor at Rutgers University, thinks he knows why.\n\n\n\nClinton and the political "colossus" that is Nancy Pelosi are scaring away\nall the good male rivals, Nurse Ratched-style. They are "towering and\nintimidating figures, who have sucked the oxygen out of the spheres they\ndominate."\n\n\n\nHe writes more in USA Today:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile the Democratic bench isn\'t as full as it has been, there is still no\nshortage of qualified male candidates who will probably not step forward in\n2016. In the Senate there are potential hopefuls who could win the hearts\nof the very people who consider Clinton too middle-of-the-road: Sens.\nSheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, and Jeff Merkley\nof Oregon. There are well-regarded governors such as Jack Markell of\nDelaware and Andrew Cuomo of New York or former Massachusetts governor\nDeval Patrick. None of them has given the slightest hint that they might\nconsider a run.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFirst off, if I was to make a list of who would mount a run for the White\nHouse if Clinton didn\'t, I\'m not sure many of these people would make it\n(s0rry, Sen. Merkley). Which leads to this: If these candidates were so\nformidable, wouldn\'t they just run against Clinton? If they thought they\ncould amass the millions and millions of dollars it would take to mount a\nrun for the White House -- against Clinton or anyone else -- wouldn\'t they\ndo it? She\'s a clear favorite, yes, but an open primary doesn\'t come around\nevery four years.\n\n\n\nTo Baker, it is Clinton\'s gender that is a big, big stop sign. He doesn\'t\nseem to see a failure on the part of any of these potential male candidates\nto do the years and years of work it requires to become a contender. Nope,\nall of them are just afraid to run against Clinton because she is a woman\n-- not because she has a much higher profile, much better presidential\nresume and political network.\n\n\n\nHe calls this failure or fear of going "toe-to-toe with a powerful woman\nis, in the final analysis, a form of patronizing that ill-becomes a party\nthat has stood so steadfastly for women."\n\n\n\nBut haven\'t male Democrats run against women before, you might ask? Yes,\nthey most certainly have. Like in 2008, for instance. That contest was\nrough and tumble early on, with none of the candidates shaking in their\nboots at the thought of challenging Clinton, who after all was a powerful\nwoman back then, too.\n\n\n\n(Baker argues that Obama\'s race gave him a special angle. He was also a\nmuch better candidate and reshaped the electorate as a result, but never\nmind that).\n\n\n\nSo what to make of Baker\'s argument, one that doesn\'t account for the fact\nthat men dominate every single level of politics and nearly every other\npowerful industry you can think of? I have never thought of Clinton scaring\naway all the good men because of her gender.\n\n\n\nIn fact, she is "scaring away" women candidates too: Elizabeth Warren\n(Mass.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.). Clinton, like\nher or not, has done what many countless men have done before her. She has\nplotted a course to the White House, clearing a path not because of her\ngender, but because of her strength and her power. To suggest otherwise is\nto deny her proper credit and gives too much to those who haven\'t "manned\nup."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Mediaite: \xe2\x80\x9cJon Stewart Mocks Dems \xe2\x80\x98Scared\xe2\x80\x99 of Daring to Challenge Hillary\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.mediaite.com/tv/jon-stewart-mocks-dems-scared-of-daring-to-challenge-hillary/>*\n\n\n\nBy Josh Feldman\n\nFebruary 5, 2015, 11:27 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nJon Stewart tonight broke down the 2016 \xe2\x80\x9cinvisible primary\xe2\x80\x9d and laughed at\nhow Democrats are so utterly \xe2\x80\x9cscared\xe2\x80\x9d of daring to challenge Hillary\nClinton.\n\n\n\nRight now, he said, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s only running against \xe2\x80\x9cnobody\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbupkis,\xe2\x80\x9d\nand \xe2\x80\x9cnot a single Democrat wants to pursue the nomination on the off chance\nthat Hillary may throw her hat in the ring.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut Stewart also had some jabs at Republicans, from Mitt Romney (\xe2\x80\x9csometimes\nunwanted people do self-deport\xe2\x80\x9d) to Chris Christie (and his \xe2\x80\x9ccomfort for\ncorruption\xe2\x80\x9d) to Jeb Bush.\n\n\n\nWatch the video below, via Comedy Central:\n\n\n\n[VIDEO]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Washington Post: \xe2\x80\x9cRules for Benghazi panel fuel Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 suspicion of\npolitical motive\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/rules-for-benghazi-panel-fuel-democrats-suspicion-of-political-motive/2015/02/05/5524c372-ad67-11e4-ad71-7b9eba0f87d6_story.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Greg Miller\n\nFebruary 5, 2015, 5:30 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nA congressional investigation of the 2012 attacks on U.S. facilities in\nBenghazi, Libya, is operating outside rules that require other House\ncommittees to disclose publicly how much money they spend and the issues\nthey intend to pursue, according to Democrats on the panel.\n\n\n\nThe arrangement has added to suspicion among Democrats that the\nRepublican-led committee \xe2\x80\x94 with no budget constraints or clear end-date \xe2\x80\x94\nis politically motivated and aimed primarily at damaging a likely White\nHouse run by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time\nof the attacks in Libya.\n\n\n\nThe House investigation of Benghazi \xe2\x80\x9coperates with no limit on its budget\nor timeframe,\xe2\x80\x9d according to a letter of protest submitted by Democrats to\nthe House Administration Committee, which oversees the chamber\xe2\x80\x99s other\npanels.\n\n\n\nThe letter calls for a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic debate about the amount of additional time\nand money Congress plans to spend\xe2\x80\x9d investigating Benghazi, and for a public\nhearing before the House Administration committee, as is typically required\nof other panels.\n\n\n\nThe Benghazi committee is on course to spend more than $3 million,\nexceeding the annual budgets of long-standing committees that oversee\nveterans affairs and other issues, according to the letter.\n\n\n\nThe letter was signed by all five Democrats on the Benghazi panel,\nincluding Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking minority member. A spokesman\nfor the Republican chairman of the Benghazi committee, Trey Gowdy (S.C.),\ndeclined to comment.\n\n\n\nRep. Candice Miller (R-Mich.), chairman of the House Administration\nCommittee, said in a written response that the issues being raised by\nDemocrats could have been debated on the House floor, and described the\nDemocrats\' letter as "remarkably odd."\n\n\n\nThe conflict reflects the extent to which political tensions persist more\nthan two years after attacks by Islamist militants killed four Americans in\neastern Libya, including the U.S. ambassador to the country at the time, J.\nChristopher Stevens.\n\n\n\nAs many as eight previous investigations have rejected many of the most\npolitically charged Benghazi allegations.\n\n\n\nA two-year inquiry by the House intelligence committee criticized a\n\xe2\x80\x9cflawed\xe2\x80\x9d process that led White House officials to make erroneous\nassertions about the nature of the Benghazi attack, and concluded that the\nState Department facility where Stevens was killed had been inadequately\nprotected.\n\n\n\nBut the committee found no evidence that interference from Washington\nundermined efforts to defend the besieged State compound or a nearby CIA\nfacility, or that there was a politically motivated cover-up afterward.\n\n\n\nDespite those findings, House Republicans created a stand-alone panel last\nyear to focus exclusively on Benghazi. The panel has held three hearings\nsince its inception in May, and been beset by political skirmishes.\n\n\n\nDemocrats have said that they were excluded from interviews that Republican\nmembers conducted with Benghazi witnesses, meetings that Democrats said\nthey found out about only after Gowdy had mentioned them publicly.\n\n\n\nBoth sides have voiced frustration over the committee\xe2\x80\x99s pace. Gowdy has\naccused the Obama administration of being slow to turn over records, and\nrecently vowed to \xe2\x80\x9cratchet up\xe2\x80\x9d pressure on the executive branch.\n\n\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who serves on the panel and is also the\nranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said during a recent\nhearing that the Benghazi inquiry has already taken longer than previous\nHouse probes \xe2\x80\x94 including a 2005 examination of the response to Hurricane\nKatrina \xe2\x80\x94 with no clear finish line.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis committee has such an indefinite scope, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re looking for,\xe2\x80\x9d Schiff said.\n\n\n\nThe letter from Democrats said the funding mechanism for the Benghazi\ncommittee amounts to a \xe2\x80\x9cblank check,\xe2\x80\x9d bypassing rules that require other\npanels to outline their budgets and plans in public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*New York Times: First Draft: \xe2\x80\x9cMandy Grunwald to Join Clinton Team\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/02/05/mandy-grunwald-to-join-clinton-team/?_r=0>*\n\n\n\nBy Jonathan Martin\n\nFebruary 5, 2015 5:41 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nMandy Grunwald, an adviser to the Clintons for over two decades and a top\nstrategist to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, is expected to\nserve as a senior adviser for communications to Hillary Rodham Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nall-but-certain presidential bid.\n\n\n\nMs. Grunwald will advise Mrs. Clinton on strategy and make some of the\ntelevision ads along with Jim Margolis, whose firm, GMMB, is expected to\ntake the lead on producing and buying the commercials. The pollster Joel\nBenenson is another senior adviser poised to work for Mrs. Clinton on her\nsecond White House run.\n\n\n\nMs. Grunwald, an original member of Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 1992 presidential\ncampaign team who also worked on Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 White House bid,\nrepresents a nod to continuity after a stream of recent stories about Mrs.\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s plans to hire advisers close to her one-time rival for the White\nHouse, President Obama. Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s camp has put out word that she will\nlook to Mr. Margolis, Mr. Benenson, Robby Mook, John D. Podesta and\nJennifer Palmieri \xe2\x80\x94 each of whom has worked or now works for Mr. Obama \xe2\x80\x94 to\nbuild her campaign. (Some of them, it should be noted, also have ties to\nthe Clintons.)\n\n\n\nThe move to bring Ms. Grunwald onto the nascent campaign also underscores\nhow unlikely it is that Ms. Warren will run for president. Ms. Grunwald\nproduced Ms. Warren\xe2\x80\x99s TV ads in her 2012 Senate campaign, and the two\nremain close; Ms. Grunwald hosted a book party last year to celebrate the\nrelease of Ms. Warren\xe2\x80\x99s autobiography.\n\n\n\nThe decision to tap Ms. Grunwald, as well as Ms. Palmieri as communications\ndirector, could also address questions about gender diversity in Mrs.\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s still-developing campaign team. Mrs. Clinton has a number of\nwomen in her inner circle, including Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin, but\ngrumbles have been growing louder in recent weeks from some female\nDemocratic operatives about the number of men who appear bound to take\nsenior roles on Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s likely campaign.\n\n\n\nMs. Grunwald counts a number of Democratic senators as her clients and is\nparticularly close to several women in the Senate, including Senators Tammy\nBaldwin of Wisconsin, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Jeanne Shaheen of New\nHampshire, who was one of the only Democratic senators last year to fend\noff a Republican challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Bloomberg: \xe2\x80\x9cCan Jennnifer Palmieri Keep Hillary Clinton\'s Presidential\nCampaign On Message?\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-06/can-jennnifer-palmieri-keep-hillary-clinton-s-presidential-campaign-on-message->*\n\n\n\nBy Margaret Talev\n\nFebruary 6, 2015, 5:50 a.m. EST\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] Battle-hardened during the John Edwards scandal, mind-melded\nwith presumptive Clinton campaign manager John Podesta, trusted by the\nmedia, the Obama press aide sends a message about Hillary\'s reset.\n\n\n\nAmong watchers of Barack Obama\'s presidency and Hillary Clinton\'s expected\n2016 campaign launch, the coming departures of two top White House aides\ngot lots of attention: senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer, because he\'s been with\nObama since before his 2008 win, and counselor John Podesta, because he\'s a\nformer chief of staff to President Bill Clinton whose move is all but proof\nof what everyone already assumed was true about Hillary\'s plans to run\nagain.\n\n\n\nBut a more telling figure in the second-term White House departure lounge\nmay actually be Jennifer Palmieri, Obama\'s affable but battle-tested\ncommunications director. Palmieri is leaving this spring to become the\ncommunications director for what doesn\'t yet exist as but will become the\nClinton 2016 campaign.\n\n\n\nPalmieri, 48, is viewed in the White House and national political press\ncorps as accessible and an honest broker whose loyalty to politicians comes\nwith expectations of professionalism and propriety by the candidate, but\nhas its limits (see: John Edwards). Her hiring suggests that Clinton, a\nformer first lady, U.S. senator, failed 2008 presidential candidate and\nsecretary of state, either really is serious about wanting to reset her own\ninfamously antagonistic relationship with the media or at least wants to\nsend that signal.\n\n\n\nKevin Madden, a Republican strategist and former spokesman for presidential\ncandidate Mitt Romney, said Palmieri is "as formidable an opponent as I\'ve\never come across in political campaigns" and is someone so organized that\n"everyone in Palmieri\'s line of sight will know exactly what the campaign\nplan is and what they need to do to execute."  She also has the\ncredentials, Madden said, to push back when she thinks the candidate or\neager-to-please aides are making a mistake.\n\n\n\n"She knows her stuff," Madden said. "That\'s critical when you\'re the\nstaffer that has to stare down the sycophants inside every campaign and\noffer the candidate unvarnished truths. It\'s important when you\'re\ndeveloping the message and strategy privately and when you\'re executing it\npublicly." Palmieri declined to comment for the story.\n\n\n\nWhile Palmieri hasn\'t worked directly for Hillary Clinton before, the two\nwomen have gotten to know one another over the course of the last two\ndecades because Palmieri worked for the Bill Clinton White House both terms\nand during a six-month transition period after he left office. She and\nPodesta also are close with a long history of working well, even between\nthe Clinton and the Obama administrations. Podesta founded the Center for\nAmerican Progress, where Palmieri, during her time there from 2005-2011,\nbuilt a reputation among Democrats for her ability to stand up a\nprogressive war room of sorts, with a communications operation of about 50\npeople. Obama pollster Joel Benenson and Jim Margolis, a media consultant\nwho has advised the Obama campaign as well as Senate Minority Leader Harry\nReid, a Nevada Democrat, are among the other cross-over advisers expected\nto join the Clinton effort.\n\n\n\nIn the world of presidential runs, Palmieri was John Edwards\' 2004 campaign\npress secretary and in a less formal capacity an adviser in 2008. Before\nEdwards\' reputation was felled by an extramarital scandal and a trial, the\n2004 vice presidential nominee was known for his "two Americas"  speech in\nwhich he addressed the gulf between the wealthy and Americans living to\npaycheck to paycheck. With Obama and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren\nprodding for income inequality to be a rallying cry for Democrats in 2016,\nHillary Clinton must consider how she wants to address the issue.\n\n\n\nPerhaps even more important for the Clintons is the value of Palmieri\'s\nexperience with scandal.  A large part of her battle-testing was during the\nextended drama surrounding Edwards\' affair with videographer Rielle Hunter,\nhis trial on charges related to allegations of illegal campaign\ncontributions, and the death from cancer of his embattled wife Elizabeth\nEdwards, to whom Palmieri was a devoted friend.\n\n\n\n"There\'s an old saying in campaign world, you learn more from the losing\nones than the winning ones and there\'s some truth in that," said Mike\nFeldman,  a former top adviser to Vice President Al Gore. "You don\'t\ncontrol all the variables."\n\n\n\n"If you\'re looking to establish trust and credibility from the beginning,"\nhe said of Palmieri, "you couldn\'t do any better."\n\n\n\nDemocrat strategist Bill Burton, a former Obama spokesman, said Palmieri\n"is one of the greatest communicators in the Democratic Party and a huge\nget" for Clinton. "She will help to bridge the White House and the Clinton\ncampaign in a way that few people could," and be "instrumental to Secretary\nClinton\'s success."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sec.
