This is a heavily funded operation controlled by Karl Rove and his well-placed allies at right-wing Super PACs. \n\nThese guys aren't known for their civility and they don't like losing elections. In their minds, 2014 will be their bounce back year and they'll do whatever it takes to win.\n\nWe need to start the year on offense, building a grassroots operation that can compete with them. It can't wait until the fall - I need you now. Can you help out before midnight? \n\nClick here to contribute $250 or more right now to take the fight to the Tea Party and battle back against their 2014 congressional agenda.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/seanmaloney?refcode=20140124-d&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\nTogether, you and I can carry out our own agenda. \n\n-Sean  \n\n\n\n\nContribute -- https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/seanmaloney?refcode=20140124-d&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.\nTo unsubscribe from the Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress email list, please click here: http://action.seanmaloney.com/unsubscribe\n\n\nPAID FOR BY SEAN PATRICK MALONEY FOR CONGRESS\n\n\n"
