Our first regular workshop will be held next Thursday, January 22, when Professor Barry Friedman of NYU and his co-author Maria Ponomaremko (currently serving as a law clerk to Judge Posner on the Seventh Circuit) will be presenting their paper, \xe2\x80\x9cGoverning Policing.\xe2\x80\x9d  The paper can be downloaded at the link below.  Hard copies are also available in faculty support.  We meet from 12:00 to 1:20 in the Hotung Dining Room, and lunch will be served.
