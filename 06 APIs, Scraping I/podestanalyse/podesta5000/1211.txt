john.podesta@gmail.comb"John --\n\nThings aren't looking great:\n\nSpeaker Boehner just flooded the Arizona airwaves with $1,75O,OOO in right-wing cash to blast Ann's record.\nAnn was just named one of the most vulnerable House members in the entire country.\nAs of 2pm, we're still 68 online donations short of our critical Rapid Response goal.\n\nIf we're going to protect Arizona from a far right-wing, special interest vote in Congress, then we can't let Ann fall short. Can we please count on your support to help us close the gap?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/kirkpatrickq32014?refcode=em_FR_2014.09.05_b1_admin_ldnd&amp;recur_weekly=true&amp;amount=25&amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=DC&amp;zip=20016&amp;phone=2162818851&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=\n\nThanks for all you do,\n\nTeam Kirkpatrick\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis message was emailed to: podesta@law.georgetown.edu\n\nTo unsubscribe from this email list, please paste this URL into your browser: \nhttp://action.kirkpatrickforarizona.com/unsubscribe\n\nPaid for by the Kirkpatrick for Arizona\n\n"
