It will begin with a dinner on Friday evening hosted by Emmanuel Macron (French Finance Minister) and the following day there will be two roundtable sessions:\nSession one will address the challenges of economic globalization and technological development, and be focused on how progressive respond on policy front. Session two will evaluate how progressives develop a successful political and economic narrative to counter the right and populists to the left.  \nThe confirmed participants list is pretty impressive. In addition to Valls includes:\nMagdalena Andersson, Swedish Finance MinisterChristine Antorini, MP and former Danish Minister of Education (in the Cabinet of Helle Thorning-Schmidt)Lodewijk Asscher, deputy prime minister, The NetherlandsBjarne Corydon, MP and former finance minister of Denmark (in the Cabinet of Helle Thorning-Schmidt)Carlotta De Franceschi, economic adviser to Italian Prime Minister Matteo RenziJeroen Dijsselbloem, Dutch finance minister and president of the eurozone finance ministers\x92 group Paolo Gentiloni, minister of foreign affairs, ItalySandro Gozi, secretary of state, European Affairs, ItalyMattias Machnig, secretary of state, economy and energy, GermanyEmmanuel Macron, minister of economy, industrial renewal and information technology, FrancePeter Mandelson, president of Policy NetworkJean Pisani-Ferry, French government's commissioner-general for policy planningDavid Sainsbury, former UK minister for science and innovation and member of the House of LordsDiederik Samsom, leader of the Dutch Labour PartyChuka Umunna, UK Shadow Business SecretaryJeromin Zettelmeyer is Director-General for Economic Policy at the German Ministry of the Economy\nThey've asked for help bring some US people over, and are keen to get someone from HRC campaign engaged in possible.
