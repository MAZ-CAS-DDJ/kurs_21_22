I am looking for a new direction to take my career and I was wondering if you had any suggestions to help me move forward.  I have always been interested in the economics of politics and I know that is an area of expertise of yours.  I have attached a copy of my updated resume, please let me know if you have any ideas!\n\n\nThanks much,\n\nJohn Gabrielski\n\n\n<JOHN GABRIELSKI CV pdf.pdf>\n"
