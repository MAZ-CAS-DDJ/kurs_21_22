The monthly cap on Metro transit and Metro parking benefits is now $255 per month.\n\nOur SmartBenefits order for 2/1/16 has already been submitted and cannot be changed at this point.\n\nIf you would like to change your SmartBenefits amount to take effect 3/1/16, you may do so now in GMS (Benefits, Change Benefits, Benefit Event Type, SmartBenefits Enrollment).\n\n*         Biweekly employees need to use Benefit Event Date 1/18/16.\n\n*         Monthly employees need to use Benefit Event Date 2/1/16.\n\n*         You can elect $20 - $255 per month, in $5 increments, to be deducted from your paycheck.\n\n*         CommuterDirect customers should update your account between 2/1/16 and 2/15/16 to apply the increased benefit to your order for 3/1/16.\n\nReminder:\n\n*         Your SmarTrip card will be funded after one full month of deductions have been taken from your paycheck.\n\n*         You are allowed one additional benefit amount change this calendar year.\n\n*         Unused SmartBenefits funds rollover to the next month.\n\nCall or email me if you have any questions.\nThanks,\nMarshall\nMarshall Lucas\nOffice Manager\nFacilities Management and Parking\nGeorgetown Law\n600 New Jersey Avenue, NW - Room 154\nWashington, DC 20001-2022\n202-662-9330\n202-662-9344 fax\nhttp://www.law.georgetown.edu/facilities/\n\n\n'
