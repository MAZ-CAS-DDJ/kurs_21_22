Gov. compares welfare to \x91feeding stray animals\x92\n By Associated Press  |   Sunday, January 24, 2010  |\nhttp://www.bostonherald.com  |\nSouth<http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/south/>\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. - With Democrats calling for an apology, South Carolina\nRepublican Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer agreed Saturday he used a badly phrased\nmetaphor in a speech on government assistance but reiterated that the\n"culture of dependency" created by welfare must change.\n\nAfter The Greenville News reported Bauer drew a comparison between "feeding\nstray animals" and doling out government assistance, Democratic candidates\nfor governor called Bauer\x92s comments despicable, embarrassing and\nunchristian.\n\n"Maybe the metaphor isn\x92t the best metaphor. I agree with them on that,"\nsaid the 40-year-old gubernatorial candidate. "But I think there are a lot\nof people that use issues like this to divide people and never offer\nsolutions. The easiest thing to do is criticize someone for saying\nsomething, other than saying, \x92Maybe we should talk about this.\x92"\n\nAt a town hall meeting Thursday in northwestern South Carolina, Bauer noted\nhis grandmother "told me as a small child to quit feeding stray animals. You\nknow why? Because they breed."\n\n"The problem is, there are so many folks now who don\x92t have to do a thing.\nIn government, we continue to reward bad behavior. Anytime we give somebody\nmoney, we\x92re rewarding them. We\x92re telling them to keep doing what they\x92re\ndoing. Government\x92s got to change," he said. "Babies having babies,\nsomebody\x92s got to talk about. ... Education can not really be improved until\nwe address the real problem."\n\nTo fix that, he said, "If you receive goods or services from the government,\nyou owe something back."\n\nState schools Superintendent Jim Rex, who\x92s also running for governor as a\nDemocrat, called the stray animals comparison "reprehensible."\n\n"If the intent of Lt. Gov. Bauer\x92s remarks was to blame children, who are\nnot responsible for their own predicaments, or to blame adults, who want to\nwork but cannot find jobs, it is regrettable," said Rex, among those who\ncalled for an apology.\n\nSouth Carolina\x92s jobless rate reached yet another all-time high in December\nat 12.6 percent.\n\nBauer reiterated Saturday there are direct links between poverty, lack of\nparental involvement and poor student performance, and other candidates are\ntoo concerned about being politically correct to find solutions.\n\nIn South Carolina, 58 percent of public school students eat free or\nreduced-price meals in school cafeterias. Schools with lots of parental\ninvolvement tend to do well, while schools with the highest poverty rates\npost the worst results, he said.\n\nHe said the government can\x92t afford to keep giving money away, without\nrequiring the recipients to take an active role in bettering their lives and\ntheir children\x92s.\n\nThat means parents of students on free or reduced-lunches should be required\nto go to parent-teacher conferences and PTA meetings, or "bam, you lose your\nbenefits" \x97 just as there are repercussions if people don\x92t pay their taxes\n\x97 he said Thursday.\n\nHe clarified Saturday he did not mean food should be taken from children,\nbut rather their parents should lose welfare benefits.\n\n"We\x92re breeding a culture of dependency," he said. "We have generation after\ngeneration of babies having babies and no vehicle to get them out of that\nsituation. We\x92re doing a disservice to the very people we say we\x92re trying\nto help."\n\nHe noted he was a beneficiary of free lunches after his parents divorced\nwhen he was 11, so he\x92s not bashing the needy. But he said there\x92s a\ndifference between those who are truly needy and those who are just lazy.\n\n"I came from a broken home. I have been in this situation," he said, noting\nhe spent Saturday collecting shoes, blankets and other goods for victims of\nthe Haiti earthquake. "Do I think poor people ought to be helped? Yes. I\x92m\nsaying we\x92ve got to do things to break the cycle."\n\nHe said people on welfare should be required to pass drug tests and be\noffered incentives, such as child care, to earn their GED.\n\n"I believe in charity. I believe in helping people," he said. "I also\nbelieve government, too often in its effort to help people, ends up creating\na bigger problem."\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
