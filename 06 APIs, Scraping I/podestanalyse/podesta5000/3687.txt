Jeff Zeleny\nreports that the best way to break out of the crowded Republican field is\nto distinguish yourself from HRC and that\xe2\x80\x99s what Fiorina was trying to do.\nHRC did not pay much attention to Fiorina. HRC was there for the first time\nsince her 2008 defeat and wanted to reintroduce herself to SC voters.\nZeleny said we heard a line from her we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard before and showed\nfootage of HRC joking about coloring her hair and her age. Zeleny notes\nthat listeners could hear a southern accent but says she is making a point\nby bring up her age, gender, and experience. HRC will be 69 if she wins and\nshe says that\xe2\x80\x99s an asset.\n\n*MSNBC\'s Morning Joe:* HRC returns to South Carolina and Carly Fiorina was\nthere as well where they focused on equal pay for women.

It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t her decision, it was Obama\xe2\x80\x99s. (7:18) Rand\nPaul said the Republicans created ISIS. Discussed if the removal of troop\nwas the right decision or not.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "HRCRapid" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n'
