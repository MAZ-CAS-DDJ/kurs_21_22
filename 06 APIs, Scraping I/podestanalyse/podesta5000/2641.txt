john.podesta@gmail.comb'Shouldn\'t we also add somewhere that Sid was not s government employee and\nthese aren\'t federal records?\n\nHeather -State would not consider these records, correct?\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Jun 24, 2015, at 10:40 PM, Brian Fallon <bfallon@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nBased on conversations today, below is the finalized version of the\nresponse plan:\n\n*Q: The State Department says that at least 16 of the emails\nthat Sid Blumenthal turned over to the Benghazi Select Committee were not\nincluded in the 55,000 pages of materials produced by Hillary Clinton.\nDoesn\'t this prove that Hillary Clinton deleted certain emails at some\npoint before producing them to the Department?*\n\n*ON-THE-RECORD RESPONSE FROM SPOKESMAN NICK MERRILL:*\n\n"Hillary Clinton has turned over 55,000 pages of materials to the State\nDepartment, including all emails in her possession from Mr. Blumenthal."\n\n*ADDITIONAL POINTS ON BACKGROUND FROM CLINTON AIDE:*\n\nNot only did Clinton turn over all emails that she has from Blumenthal, she\nactually turned over more than a dozen emails that were not included in\nwhat Mr. Blumenthal handed over to the House committee.\n\nWe do not have a record of other correspondence between Mrs. Clinton and\nMr. Blumenthal beyond that which was turned over to the State Department.\nIn terms of the documents provided by Mr. Blumenthal to the House\ncommittee, we do not recognize many of those materials and cannot speak to\ntheir origin.\n\n*OFF RECORD, if pressed on whether we are essentially admitting the\npossibility that she deleted some emails:*\n\nLook, we do not know what these materials are, or where they came from.\nJust take a look at them: many of the documents are not even formatted as\nemails.\n\nBut even if Sid is right and some of these documents were at some point\nsent to Clinton, there is nothing in any of these emails that is remotely\nnew or interesting. Indeed, none of these 16 emails are qualitatively\ndifferent than the dozens of others that Hillary already produced to the\nState Department. So it is completely ridiculous to suggest that there\nmight have been any nefarious basis for her to want to delete any of Sid\'s\ncorrespondence.\n\nOn Wed, Jun 24, 2015 at 4:07 PM, Heather Samuelson <\nhsamuelson@cdmillsgroup.com> wrote:\n\n>   Thanks for update Nick\n>\n>  Brian -- I will call you on this.
