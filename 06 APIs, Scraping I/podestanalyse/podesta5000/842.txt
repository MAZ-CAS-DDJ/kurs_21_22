Our first project is a large, mixed-use development here in Denver.\n\nI've also formed Redfish Investments LLC, a real estate company focused on capital formation and other deals.\n\nI can be reached at pcaplan@urbanwestgroup.com<mailto:pcaplan@urbanwestgroup.com> as well as pcaplan@redfishinvestments.com<mailto:pcaplan@redfishinvestments.com>.  Vcard attached.\n\nAll the best,\n\nPhil\n\nP.S.   It's hard to believe, but it's been just over two years since we left DC for Denver. I'm still working with Place Properties on a charter school project, so that email account will stay active.\n\n\nPhillip Caplan\nUrban West Group\n303-733-0889 - office\n703-307-0455 -  cell\npcaplan@urbanwestgroup.com\n\n\n"
