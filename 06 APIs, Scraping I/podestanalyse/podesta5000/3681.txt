Clinton that will\nadvance both the health of the Democratic party, and the aims of the\nClinton campaign. I'm a lifelong Democrat, but I'm repulsed by the BDS\nmovement that has become, in too many minds, a tenet of progressive\northodoxy. As extreme as the most conservative may be, the right wing is\nunswerving in its support of Israel, and shows no tolerance for anti-\nSemitism. I understand fully that the PM of Israel is an opportunist, and\nunsavory. But the larger reality is that the BDS movement, popular among\nacademics, would be gaining adherents no matter who was PM. This is\nfundamentally wrong. It needs to be addressed as a moral issue and the\nSecretary, would, in my opinion, reap the benefits of being ( as we both\nknow her to be ) unequivocally pro- Israel in voters' minds.\n\nCordially,\n\nCharles Bane, Jr.\n\nPalm Beach, Fl.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\nRobert Russo\nDirector of Correspondence and Briefings\nHillary for America\nrrusso@hillaryclinton.com\n"
