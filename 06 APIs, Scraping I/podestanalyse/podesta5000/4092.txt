john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dan - It would be great to HRC to lift up and claim some credit for Tulsa\'s\n"Talking is Teaching" program that she launched with George Kaiser.  For\nexample, she could note that now in Tulsa every new Mom gets visited by a\nnurse and provided information about early brain development and the\nimportance of talking, reading and singing to their babies:\n\n1)     *Hospitals*: A nurse visits every new mother (and father) on the\nhospital newborn floor, providing her with guidance on her first few months\nwith her baby. Each nurse gives the distinctive Too Small to Fail tote bag\nfilled with useful materials and tools for families. Having fully commenced\nin June, these nurses have accounted for more than 4,000 visits.\n\n\nI\'m attaching the full fact sheet on what is happening if you want to use a\ndifferent example, but would be good for her to remind people that she\nhelped make it happen.  Maybe she could say "The last time I was in Tulsa,\nI launched "Tulsa\'s Talking is Teaching" campaign as part of my Too Small\nto Fail initiative and I am so delighted to see the progress in Tulsa.\n\n\nHere is a news article from when she launched the program in May 2014:\n\nhttp://www.tulsaworld.com/news/education/hillary-clinton-touts-new-child-development-initiative-during-tulsa-visit/article_b651b674-7798-53eb-ae04-4837c310fcd6.html\n\nOn Thu, Dec 10, 2015 at 3:36 PM, Emily Aden <eaden@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Good for research\n>\n> On Thu, Dec 10, 2015 at 4:10 PM, Dan Schwerin <\n> dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n>\n>> Trying a new format here after a conversation with HRC about what would\n>> be most useful for her.
