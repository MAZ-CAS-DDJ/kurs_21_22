john.podesta@gmail.comb'\nThanks John.  I hope you\'ve been  keeping abreast of the lawsuit I have \nbeen sending you -- about what\'s  going on with the California Department \nHealthcare Services and how it is not  giving the Duals Demonstration Pilots or \nthe beginning of 0bama Care in  California a good name.  Please help my \npeople in any way you can.  We  especially would like to get this letter below \nwith the articles about our  managed-care transitions are being handled \nascender Jay Rockefeller.  This  can be done but it needs to be done right.  Not \nby neglecting and abusing  Seniors and People with Disabilities in fragile \nconditions.  All the  best.  -- Nancy\n \n \n\nDear Senator Rockefeller, you have been our champion!.  We get  renewed \nhope from your letters to CMS.  Hearing you in the Senate Finance  Committee \nhearing on the Internet about the Duals Demonstration Pilots gave us  hope \nthat governments will not be able to use it to cut the budgets and  endanger us \ninstead of coordinating our care.\n \nWe are members of the IHSS Consumers Union, a grassroots organization of  \nSeniors and People with Disabilities trying to keep our safety and civil  \nrights under transitions to managed care.  What may have started out to  be a \nlaudable project to coordinate the care of people who are eligible for  both \nMedi-Cal and Medicare is being abused by the California Department of  \nHealth Care Services to cut the budget and is endangering very fragile people  \nwith complex conditions in the process of transitioning all people on Medi-Cal \n into managed care.

Until  \nrecently, these Medi-Cal beneficiaries were able to obtain necessary specialty  \ncare in an ongoing and coordinated manner from physicians who treated them \non  a fee-for-service basis. \nDella Saavedra and son Chris. \n"At stake in this lawsuit is the health and safety of Petitioners and  \nthousands of other low-income California Seniors and Persons with  Disabilities, \nwho suffer from complex, often life-threatening, medical  conditions, who \nare eligible and should be exempted from involuntary  enrollment in Medi-Cal \nmanaged care plans so their critical care is not  abruptly disrupted," \nstates Elena Ackel, senior attorney, Legal Aid Foundation  of Los Angeles. \nBeginning in June 2011, more than 240,000 seniors and persons with  \ndisabilities in Los Angeles and 15 other California counties received notices  that \nthey would be transferred to a Medi-Cal Managed Care Plan. These  \nbeneficiaries receive Medi-Cal but not Medicare. Approximately 27,000 of these  \ndisabled beneficiaries filed exemption requests indicating they had complex  \nmedical conditions which allowed them to remain in fee-for-service Medi-Cal. \nUnder state law and regulations, Medi-Cal beneficiaries are entitled to  \nremain with their fee-for-service providers if they are currently receiving  \ntreatment for a number of specifically enumerated complex medical conditions  \nor qualify under a catch-all category. For example, there is a specific  \nexemption for cancer patients if they are undergoing a course of treatment or  \nif they have been approved for a course of treatment. Petitioner Della  \nSaavedra requires treatment for her Multiple Myeloma (a type of cancer),  \nhypertension and diabetes and thus was entitled to be exempt from managed  care. \nNevertheless her claim for exemption was denied because the state was  \napplying a secret and more stringent standard than allowed by law when  reviewing \nexemption requests. Further, the beneficiary and his or her doctor  had no \nnotice of these unwritten standards that were being applied in  reviewing of \nexemption claims. \nAs a consequence, many of the beneficiaries who meet the exemption  \nstandards have been wrongfully transferred to managed care and cannot get the  \nspecialty care and medications that they need. \nRobert Newman, Senior Counsel at the Western Center on Law and Poverty,  \nasserts, "The Department of Health Care Services treats many of these  frail, \nelderly and disabled individuals with complicated medical conditions as  \nthough they have run-of-the- mill problems. A person who is receiving  \ntreatment for cancer or kidney failure cannot suddenly be cut off from their  \nregular treating physicians and told to find new doctors to treat them." \nThis lawsuit seeks an order from the court prohibiting DHCS from continuing \n their unlawful practices, and allowing Petitioners and others like them \nwho  have been wrongfully denied an exemption to resume getting critical \nhealth  care with their previous fee-for-service Medi-Cal providers until those  \ndoctors indicate it is safe for them to be transferred to a managed care  \nplan.\n\n\n\n'
