Also, since it is looking like New Hampshire is going to\ncome down to Romney and McCain, I want to echo the worry that going\nafter Romney could only end up boosting McCain, who would be even worse.\n\n \n\nI also wanted to point out that though we saw smaller attribute shifts\non Romney, our attacks on him actually tested quite well.  Remember, our\nbest attacks on Rudy scored at 30/58 (Will continue Bush policies) and\n29/63 (Unethical).  We have three attacks on Romney that score better.\nSo while we should definitely work to sharpen these attacks to produce\nmore movement, we at least have a sense that these avenues are a good\nstarting point, I think.\n\n \n\nCheers,\n\nAndrewi\n\n            \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAndrew Baumann\n\nAnalyst\n\n \n\n10 G Street NE, Suite 400, Washington, DC 20002\n\nPhone: 202 478 8300 / Fax: 202 478 8301\n\n \n\nabaumann@gqrr.com <mailto:abaumann@gqrr.com>  \n\nwww.greenbergresearch.com <http://www.greenbergresearch.com> \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n"
