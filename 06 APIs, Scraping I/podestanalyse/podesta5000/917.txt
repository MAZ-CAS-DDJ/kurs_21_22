Has Barack Obama suckered them into supporting a \nPresident who will  really govern from the \xe2\x80\x9ccenter-right\xe2\x80\x9d?  The short answer \nis  no. \nSince November 4th there has been growing protestation from right wing  \nintellectuals that America is really a \xe2\x80\x9ccenter-right\xe2\x80\x9d  nation and that Obama\xe2\x80\x99s \nvictory does not indicate that the electorate has  rejected the \xe2\x80\x9ccenter-right\xe2\x80\x9d \nvalue frame that has defined American politics for  the last thirty years. \nThis line of argument has now extended to the contention that while Obama  \nmay have won the nomination and election with the strong support from the left  \nof the Democratic Party, he really intends to govern from the \xe2\x80\x9ccenter-right.\xe2\x80\x9d \n Even the New York Times ran a front page analysis  last Saturday concluding \nthat Obama\xe2\x80\x99s recent cabinet choices, \xe2\x80\x9csuggest that Mr.  Obama is planning to \ngovern from the center-right of his party, surrounding  himself with \npragmatists rather than ideologues.\xe2\x80\x9d \nBoth of these arguments are complete baloney.   \n* Right wing pundits can comfort  themselves with the fantasy that America is \na \xe2\x80\x9ccenter-right\xe2\x80\x9d nation  but it just ain\xe2\x80\x99t so. In fact, all of the polls \nshow that the November  election represented a complete repudiation of right wing \nBush-Cheney top-down  economics and their Neo-Con foreign policy.  Over 80% \nof voters indicated they wanted  fundamental change.  The polling  shows \nmassive majorities in favor of policies that would guarantee health care  for all. \nIt shows overwhelming support for policies that give tax relief to  middle \nincome Americans and increase taxes on the wealthy.  Polls show complete rejection \nof Neo-Con  notions about \xe2\x80\x9cpreemptive\xe2\x80\x9d war and unilateralism.  And Americans \nstrongly favor bold  government action to stimulate the economy \xe2\x80\x93 not the \nfailed laissez faire  economics that have lead to the current economic meltdown.  \n* The fact is that normal people  have supported policies like health care \nfor all and bottom up economics for  decades. They\xe2\x80\x99ve known for years that \neconomic policies that have lowered  their incomes and siphoned off all of our \ngrowth to the top 2% were not in their  interest. Now the market collapse,  \npotential bankruptcy of the country\xe2\x80\x99s biggest firms, and obvious failure of  Neo-Con \nforeign policy have finally forced even the country\xe2\x80\x99s punditry and  \nintellectual opinion leadership to wake up and smell the coffee.  \n* Not only have \xe2\x80\x9ccenter-right\xe2\x80\x9d  policies proven themselves a complete \nfailure, their intellectual and moral  basis has collapsed.  How many  more bail \nouts does someone need before he stops believing that the unfettered  \xe2\x80\x9cfree market\n\xe2\x80\x9d will always lead the \xe2\x80\x9cprivate sector\xe2\x80\x9d (meaning those who control  giant \ncorporations and Wall Street Bankers) to act in the public interest.  How many \ntimes can corporate CEO\xe2\x80\x99s  emerge from their private jets with tin cups in \nWashington before people begin  to question the \xe2\x80\x9ccenter-right\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d claim that the \nprivate sector is inherently  more efficient that the public sector.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s \nface it, it\xe2\x80\x99s getting pretty tough to justify why Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s  \xe2\x80\x9cmasters of the \nuniverse\xe2\x80\x9d deserve to be paid hundreds of millions of dollars  while middle \nclass incomes tank; or why a CEO should make more money before  lunch on the \nfirst day of the year than his minimum wage worker makes all year  long.  \n* Obama ran a campaign that  clearly and unequivocally described priorities \nthat will turn American in a  fundamentally progressive direction.  His cabinet \npicks indicate that he will surround himself with people who  have experience \nand can competently manage the government.  They also indicate his absolute  \ncommitment to unifying the country to make change. But they do not in any way  \ndiminish the fact that America is demanding -- and Obama  intends to enact -- \na sweeping progressive program the likes of which we have  not seen since the \nNew Deal.  \n* Political consultant, activist and author Mike Lux will publish a book  \nearly next year that surveys the history of progressive change in American  \nhistory.  He concludes that  progressive changes happen in big batches. Change doesn\n\xe2\x80\x99t happen incrementally.  I think of it as the \xe2\x80\x9cDrain-O\xe2\x80\x9d  theory of history. \n At key points in history the pressure for  democratizing, progressive change \noverwhelms the forces of the status quo.  Then, as the pipes are suddenly \ncleaned  out, massive numbers of progressive changes can finally flow.  America \nis about to experience one of  those periods.  How much we can  accomplish, and \nhow long this period lasts will depend on many factors that we  don\xe2\x80\x99t yet \nknow -- and one that we do.  It will depend heavily on our  success in continuing \nto mobilize the millions of Americans who elected Barack  Obama into a \nmovement to enact his program. \n* Finally, writers and pundits  who focus on Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Cabinet picks to show he \nwill govern from the \xe2\x80\x9ccenter  right\xe2\x80\x9d need to have a look at history.  Like \nObama, Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln all  installed \npeople in their cabinets who they believed to be effective managers  who could \ndeliver.   They all had their share of outsiders and  progressives, but many were \nold Washington hands.  Yet all of these Presidents faced  historic challenges \nthat demanded and enabled them to make fundamental change.  And all of them \nwere guided by progressive values that were sharply different  from those of \nBush, Cheney, and Delay.  Obama shares and articulates those values more than \nany political leader  since Robert Kennedy died forty years ago.  \nBarack Obama will not govern from  the \xe2\x80\x9ccenter right\xe2\x80\x9d, but he will govern \nfrom the \xe2\x80\x9ccenter\xe2\x80\x9d.  That\xe2\x80\x99s not because he is \xe2\x80\x9cmoving to the  center\xe2\x80\x9d.  It\xe2\x80\x99s \nbecause the center of  American politics has changed.  It has moved where the \nAmerican people are.  It once again resides in the traditional  progressive \ncenter that has defined America\xe2\x80\x99s promise since Thomas  Jefferson penned its \nfounding document over 200 years ago.  \nRobert Creamer is a long time political organizer and strategist and  author \nof the recent book:  Stand Up  Straight: How Progressives Can Win, available \non _Amazon.com._ \n(http://www.amazon.com/Listen-Your-Mother-Straight-Progressives/dp/0979585295/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1213241439&sr=8-1)  \n\n**************One site has it all.
