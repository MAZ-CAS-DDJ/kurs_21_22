Not just about the wisdom and competence\nof John McCain\'s foreign policy, but also about the integrity and the ethics\nthat have shaped his position toward Russia. McCain\'s position may in fact\nhave helped fuel this crisis. It certainly left today a foreign head of\nstate making an extraordinary appeal for help from a capital virtually under\nsiege and calling McCain out by name for not matching deeds to words. Our\nfifth story tonight the price for McCain\'s foreign policy possibly in this\ncase a literal price. Did the nation of Georgia think it had bought John\nMcCain. His rebuke at the hands of that nation\'s leader presently new\ndetails about McCain\'s top foreign policy adviser. *On April 16th Russia\nannounced it would establish legal ties with Georgia\'s two separatist\nregions, South Ossetia and Abkahzia, both friendly with Russia.  Legitimizing\nthem, a move widely seen as undermining Georgia\' sovereignty there.  The\nnext day, the Washington Post now reports, Georgia sought help. Agreeing to\npay $200,000 to a lobbying firm headed by this man, Randy Scheunemann to\nrenew its contract with Scheunamann who is also and was also at the time\nMcCain\'s top foreign policy adviser. That same day Scheunemann participated\nin crafting a strong statement by McCain taking Georgia\'s side, telling\nreporters quote  we must not allow Russia to believe it has free hand. Did\nstatements like that, purchased or not, give Georgian President Mikheil\nSaakashvili to launch his military offensive in South Ossetia last Friday?\nDid it in turn become Russia\'s excuse for invading Georgia? Over the years\nGeorgia has paid Scheunemann\'s firm $800,000. Scheunemann\'s company, the\nAssociated Press reports today, has lobbied McCain and his staff on\nSaakashvili\'s behalf 49 separate times.* With his capital under siege today,\nSaakasvili spoke like a man stuck only with a receipt. Asked about the U.S.\nresponse or lack thereof, he used the word appeasement and put at least\npartial blame for the crisis itself on President Bush [\x85]\n\nOLBERMANN*: McCain responded this is no time to politicize the matter, even\nwhen it was pointed out he and his surrogate Joe Lieberman did exactly that\njust yesterday.* [\x85]\n\nJONANTHAN ALTER: [\x85] I do think it is really unseemly that Randy Scheunemann\nhad this lobbying contract. It\'s always the second raters by the way who are\nforeign agents or lobbying for foreign governments- the top foreign policy\npeople do it in a more subtle way, maybe they\'re consultants, they\'re not\nlobbyists. *So this really stinks, the whole deal of him. Because you don\'t\nknow who\'s he representing? Is he representing the interests of Georgia or\nthe interests of the United States? And you never want to get into a\nsituation like that and it\'s rather, I hate to say it, inexperienced maybe\non John McCain\'s part to be putting up with this kind of thing. And also\nthere\'s the question of whether in his rhetoric toward Putin, he\'s just been\ntoo inflammatory for American interest.* [\x85] The question though is one of\nsubtly and moderation in one\'s approach to foreign policy. *He\'s supposed to\nbe the adult here. You know the mature foreign policy statesman. Those are\nthe grounds on which he has asked us to elect him President. These are not\nwell tempered measured remarks that he\'s been making*. [\x85]\n\nCLARENCE PAGE: [\x85] I\'m just wondering Keith,  how we would have felt if\nBarack Obama had said I speak for all of the people of the United States\nsaying we are all Georgians now. *That, some people would call that a little\narrogant*. [\x85]\n\nOLBERMANN: [\x85] McCain said in the 21st century nations don\'t invade other\nnations. *Do you suppose the irony of what he said was lost on Mr. McCain\nand does he assume nobodies going to draw the obvious parallel with his full\nsupport we invaded Iraq in 21st century and five years later we\'re still\nthere?*\nPAGE: I think he\'s hoping we don\'t draw significance from it but I think we\nwill. You just did.  This is the kind of thing people are looking at in\nassessing John McCain.\n\n*McCain\'s Tough Stance on Russia Could be Due to Leftover Cold War Anger *(CNN\n08/13/08 8:23pm)\nCAMPBELL BROWN: Some of the toughest talk about the Russian invasion of\nGeorgia is coming from the campaign trail.  Today Secretary of State Rice\nrevealed that she has been in regular contact with both Barack Obama and\nwith John McCain as this crisis unfolds.  *Now McCain of course, has been\nblasting the Russian\'s ever since the story broke last week and it has us\nthinking whether or not there might be something going on beyond the\nheadlines, something a little more visceral for him*. [\x85]\n\nTOM FOREMAN: There is no question that McCain has more hands on experience\nwith Russia then Barack Obama does, and he\'s been presenting himself both as\n*the voice of reason and of strength in this latest clash.  But some foreign\naffairs experts are not buying it. *\n\n{Clip of Reagan]\n\nFOREMAN: *In the final years of the Soviet Union Ronald Reagan was\nthundering at the Russians, John McCain was a first term Senator cheering\nhim on.  And 21 years later he still distrusts Russia*. [\x85]\n\n[Clip of McCain in Michigan]\nJOHN MCCAIN: "And I am interested with good relations between the United\nStates and Russia but *in the 21st Century nations don\'t invade other\nnations."*\n\n*FOREMAN: A tough line, especially from a supporter of the Iraq invasion*.\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: "The now Prime Minister of Russia, has been clear for a long\ntime, that I\'ve been concerned about Russian behavior in a broad variety of\nareas."\n\nFOREMAN: And now listen to how this foreign policy expert is reacting.\n\nCHARLES KUPCHAN: Well over the last few years McCain\'s views on Russia seem\nto be getting more and more confrontational.  And I think *he\'s really\naligned himself with the far right, not with the centrist within the\nRepublican Party and in some ways it seems almost that he either thinks the\ncold war is still on or wants it to return. *\n\nFOREMAN: McCain has been critical of efforts to reach out to Russia\npolitically and economically, even those of President Bush.  He has\nrepeatedly attacked Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who is a former\nKGB boss.\n\nMCCAIN: I looked into Mr. Putin\'s eyes and I saw three letters: a K, a G and\na B.\n\nFOREMAN: McCain wrote in foreign affairs magazine: "*Today we see in Russia\ndiminishing political freedoms, a leadership dominated by a clique of former\nintelligence officers.  Efforts to bully democratic neighbors such as\nGeorgia, and attempts to manipulate Europe\'s dependence on Russian oil and\ngas.* " McCain has pushed to have Russia thrown out of the G8, that group of\nthe worlds largest democracies formed to promote economic and political\ncooperation.  He has fought to bring the Soviet Union\'s former republics\ninto NATO, a military alliance of western powers formed to oppose Russia\'s\nmilitary might.\n\nKUPCHAN: *I think it\'s arguably dangerous in the sense that by assuming that\nRussia may be more aggressive than it is, and by pushing Russia\'s back up\nagainst the wall, it\'s possible one can produce a self-proclaiming prophecy.\n *\n\n[\x85]\n\nHighlight #2\n*Dean Reynolds Discusses The New Tough McCain Campaign Tactics, Bush\nStyle*(CBS 08/13/08 6:40pm)\nDEAN REYNOLDS: John McCain decried what he called partisan political\nsniping. [play clip]\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: This isn\'t a time for partisan sniping between the campaigns.\n[end clip]\n\nREYNOLDS: However the sharpest criticism has come from the surrogate\nstanding next to McCain this afternoon. Attacking Barack Obama\'s stand on\nthe crises as quote morally neutral, the sharper edge by his aides and the\ncandidate is further evidence that the McCain campaign has changed. Gone are\nthe bile green backdrops, and the hard to master teleprompter. [play clip]\n\nMCCAIN: He has the audis-audacity to hope you don\'t mind. [end clip]\n\nREYNOLDS: Replaced by splashier events, reminiscent of a previous Republican\ncampaign for the White House. But it\'s more than staging, it\'s tone. The\ncampaign theme is no longer reform, prosperity and peace. It\'s now Country\nFirst. What that means exactly was made clear Tuesday when an\nintroductionary speaker framed the contest with Obama this way: [play clip]\n\nJOE LIEBERMAN: Between one candidate, John McCain, with experience whose\nbeen tested in war and tried in peace, another candidate who has not. [end\nclip]\n\nREYNOLDS: Remember, this was McCain months ago: [play clip]\n\nMCCAIN: I pledge to conduct a respectful campaign. [end clip]\n\nREYNOLDS: But now it frequently seems respect takes a backseat to ridicule.\nThis attack [Hilton celebrity ad] ran during the Olympics.\n\nKEN GOLDSTEIN: McCain ads are much more likely to be negative, and the Obama\nadvertisements are much more likely to be positive.\n\nREYNOLDS: And as often as McCain speaks out against partisanship, there was\na broad Republican consensus that his tamer approach was not working. And\nthat something new was needed. Something like we are seeing today.\n\nHighlight #3\n*Hardball Guests Discuss James Corsi Anti-Obama Book* (MSNBC\nRICH MASTERS: [\x85] James Corsi is making no bones about it he wants to defeat\nBarack Obama. And for legitimate news organizations to give this guy any\nmore credibility than what he deserves,  is really really tough right now.\nIt\'d be almost laughable for a guy who has called Hillary Clinton a fat cow.\n*This is a guy who fundamentally has no journalistic bones in his body. And\nthe reason its number one right now is because there are a bunch of right\nwing think tanks and groups that have purchased this stuff to inflate those\nnumbers so that we are talking about this right now.*  [\x85]\n\nDAVID SHUSTER: Charlie Black said the McCain campaign would make a different\nchoice. Here\'s what Charlie Black said a month ago: "We don\'t want to talk\nabout his patriotism and character, referring to Barack Obama. We concede\nthat he is a patriot and a person of good character. That flies in the face\nof this book. [\x85]\n\nMASTERS*: John McCain could have a Catholic problem right now. You\'ve got\nReverend Hagee who trashed the Catholic Church as the great Satan. Again,\nMcCain didn\'t say one word about that. Now we\'ve got this guy who again\nattacks Pope John Paul. I think John McCain needs to come out because McCain\n\x96these folks who are speaking maybe not on his behalf but he certainly\nhasn\'t disavowed this bunch of lies that is out there. Somebody has got to\nstep up and say it and John McCain who is an American war hero, should have\nthe courage to do what he did four years ago* and condemn this pack of lies.\n[\x85]\n\nHighlight #4\n*Shuster Notes McCain Hypocrisy For Working With Abramoff Connected Ralph\nReed* (MSNBC 08/13/08 7:30pm)\nDAVID SHUSTER: Just a few years ago former Christian Coalition leader Ralph\nReed was caught up in the Jack Abramoff lobbyist scandal. John McCain led a\nSenate investigation into the scandal, ripped the characters involved, and\nbragged about the people who are going to jail. *Well, now it seems John\nMcCain is now singing a different tune- at least about Ralph Reed*. Reed is\nnow a part of McCain\'s victory 2008 fundraising team. And Reed recently sent\nout an e-mail  soliciting donations for McCain. Yes, if you want a\npolitician to forgive and forget, help them collect some campaign cash.\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
