Following a meeting in Paris between Fabius and PA Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, the French Foreign Ministry issued a statement that indicated Paris was beginning to set the groundwork for future French recognition of \xe2\x80\x9cPalestine.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe meeting,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the statement \xe2\x80\x9calso provided an opportunity to prepare for the first French-Palestinian intergovernmental seminar, the first session of which will be aimed at strengthening our relations in the political, economic and cultural spheres.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n** Times of Israel\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n** US may Pull Out Sinai Force Keeping IL-Egypt Peace (http://www.timesofisrael.com/us-may-pull-out-sinai-force-that-helps-keep-israel-egypt-peace/)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Obama administration is quietly reviewing the future of America\xe2\x80\x99s three-decade deployment to Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s Sinai Peninsula, fearful the lightly equipped peacekeepers could be targets of escalating Islamic State-inspired violence. Options range from beefing up their protection or even pulling them out altogether, officials told The Associated Press. The American forces have helped marshal peace in the peninsula since Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s 1979 historic peace treaty with Israel. They mainly monitor and verify compliance, and have little offensive capability. Egypt has battled militants in northern Sinai for years, but attacks against its military and police have expanded since the July 2013 coup of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s army under current President Sissi is trying to snuff out the insurgency. For the United States, the fighting is troublesome, centered in the heart of the volatile Middle East near key maritime trading routes and alongside the most durable peace yet\nestablished between Israel and an Arab state. And it risks putting the so-called Multinational Force and Observers in the cross-hairs.\n\n\n** Ynet News\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n** Pal. Hunger Striker: Resolve my Case or back to Fast (http://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinian-hunger-striker-resolve-my-case-or-ill-step-up-fast/)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPalestinian security prisoner on a two-month hunger strike emerged from a coma Tuesday and warned he will step up his fast if Israel does not resolve his case within 24 hours, a Palestinian group said. The detainee, 31-year-old Mohammed Allaan, \xe2\x80\x9cdeclared in front of his doctors that if there is not any solution to his case within 24 hours he will ask for all treatment to stop and will stop drinking water,\xe2\x80\x9d the Palestinian Prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 Club said in a statement. A lawyer by profession, Allaan has been held in administrative detention \xe2\x80\x94 a preventative security measure when intelligence suggests suspects may be involved in terror activities \xe2\x80\x94 since last November over his alleged membership in the Islamic Jihad terror group. He has been on hunger strike since June 18, taking only water, and lost consciousness Friday morning at the Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon, where he is being treated. Allaan was awakened from his coma and his condition has stabilized, doctors at Barzilai\nsaid Tuesday. Doctors had been giving Allaan water and salts intravenously, and he had also been connected to a respirator.\n\n\n** Ynet News\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n** Five Israelis Hurt from Stones in East Jerusalem (http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4692146,00.html)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA bus and two private cars were pelted with stones on Tuesday evening in the At-Tur neighborhood in East Jerusalem, leaving five people lightly wounded. One Arab Israeli and four Jewish Israelis, passengers who were on the bus, were wounded. Three Jewish teens aged 16-17 who were lightly hurt from broken glass, and a woman in her 50s from At-Tur, were taken to the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem\'s Ein Karem. A fifth person was very lightly hurt and was not taken to hospital. Damage was caused to the windshields of the vehicles. Israeli security forces were searching the area for the perpetrators.\n\n\n** Jerusalem Post\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n** US \'Concerned\' over Treatment of Arab-Americans  (http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Report-Palestinian-Americans-denied-entry-into-Israel-412532)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUS State Department spokesman John Kirby on Tuesday expressed concern over the treatment of Palestinian-Americans traveling to Israel. According to the US State Department\'s website, "many Palestinian nationals or dual nationals seeking to enter via Ben-Gurion have been sent back to the United States upon arrival." "Others have been allowed to enter Israel but told they cannot depart Israel via Ben-Gurion without special permission, which is rarely granted," the website explains. "The US government seeks equal treatment and freedom to travel for all US citizens regardless of national origin or ethnicity," Kirby announced. "Specifically, the US government remains concerned at the unequal treatment that Palestinian-Americans receive at Israel\'s borders and checkpoints."\n\n\n** Ha\xe2\x80\x99aretz\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n** Zionist Union: Talk of Ashkenazi Joining \'Premature\' (http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/.premium-1.671846)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEven though recent days have seen senior officials from the Zionist Union party issue calls to former Israel Defense Force Chief-of-Staff Gabi Ashkenazi to join the party, a senior party official clarified Tuesday that as of now, no negotiations were taking place with the retired general. The offers extended to Ashkenazi were contingent on him being cleared of wrongdoing by the attorney general in what has been called the "Harpaz affair" in which claims were made that documents were forged in order to prevent now Construction Minister Yoav Galant from succeeding Ashkenazi as head of Israel\'s military. \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as the attorney general hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made the final decision not to prosecute (Ashkenazi) there is nothing to talk about. It\xe2\x80\x99s premature. As far as I know, no one is holding substantial talks with him on our behalf,\xe2\x80\x9d said the senior official.\n\n\n** Ynet News\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n** Huckabee in Israel: \'Lose the Land, Lose the Peace\' (http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4692297,00.html)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee reiterated Israel\'s connection to Judea and Samaria, and stated that peace cannot be possible with ongoing incitement in Palestinian schools, during a special interview with Ynet on Wednesday. Huckabee dismissed criticism of Israel\'s settlement policy, saying, "I would love to see a true peace in the world, but the question is does Israel have a right to build bedrooms for the expanding number of people who are coming here, who are making aliyah, to make sure there people have a secure land they can defend; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why anyone on this earth would think that they should surrender that right. "Land for peace has not worked for Israel, They lose the land and they lose the peace."\nSee also,Ynet Interview (Ynet) (http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4692297,00.html)\n\n\n** Yedioth Ahronoth \xe2\x80\x93 August 18, 2015\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n** Netanyahu Scoring an Own Goal against Israel with Danon Appointment (http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4691174,00.html)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDanny Danon is as right wing as one can be: He opposes the two-state solution, wants to annex the entire West Bank but give no civil rights to the Palestinians and in general, he\'s the wet dream of every Israeli hater. So why is Netanyahu sending him to represent Israel at the UN?\n\nBy Ben Dror Yemini\n\n\nDanny Danon is a serious man, who has a very clear and solid worldviews. He\'s not just another right-winger, he is the rightest of the right. He supports annexing the territories; he supports the further expansion of settlements, and not just in the main blocs; he is actually against the term "settlement blocs"; he is against the two-state solution; he staged a campaign against Netanyahu\'s too soft - in his opinion - policy against Hamas; and above all, Danon is a perfect representation of the wet dream of every Israeli hater. This is how they love to hate us. Now, Danon is moving to Israel\'s display window. They can\'t possible ask for a better gift.\n\nDanon caused quite a lot of problems for Netanyahu in the Likud party, so Netanyahu had to get rid of him. When faced with the choice between Netanyahu\'s narrow political interests and Israel\'s national interests - Netanyahu once again chose Netanyahu. Israel loses.\n\nIt\'s not that an excellent ambassador at the UN, a combination of Abba Eban and Yaakov Herzog, would have made Sweden vote in favor of Israel. But Israel\'s ambassador to the UN is a sort of a symbol. So far, Danon represented the dazed right wing, now he\'s representing Israel.\n\nRon Prosor, the current ambassador, is doing an amazing job. He\'s not nice, professionally. Far from it. He knows how to be blunt and aggressive. But he also knows that speaking in support of outposts, for example, is like scoring an own goal against the national interest.\n\nIsrael is facing a massive campaign of demonization and de-legitimization, but the problem is not with the extremists in the core of the BDS movement - they\'re a lost cause. The fight against them, however, is not. When their true faces are revealed - they\'re against peace, they\'re against the two-state solution, they want the destruction of Israel, they lie incessantly - they can be fought against.\n\nBut what exactly is Danon going to say? That he\'s also against the two-state solution? That he is both in favor of annexation and against giving civil rights to Palestinians? It would be a hard sale even to the worshipers at the Orthodox synagogues of New York. But this is what Danon is selling.\n\nIsrael\'s biggest defenders in North America are Professor Alan Dershowitz and Irwin Cotler. They know how to deal with every claim against Israel. Well, almost. Because there is still no serious audience, and that includes supporters of Israel, that is willing to buy the positions held by our new ambassador to the UN.\n\nDanon might have been able to serve as the Likud\'s emissary to the Chabad institutions in Brooklyn, but an official representative of Israel?\n\nWhen Avigdor Lieberman said Israel should accept John Kerry\'s peace deal draft a year and a half ago, it was Danny Danon who put his foot down to Netanyahu and clarified he will not allow that to happen. When Naftali Bennett is talking about annexing Area C of the West Bank, Danon is talking about an annexation of even more territories. So Netanyahu decided to appoint him, of all people, to represent Israel?\n\nIt was only a few weeks ago that Netanyahu declared the anti-Israel campaign was a serious threat. He\'s right. But it was also Netanyahu that fired Danon, because he knows his positions only serve to bolster the anti-Israel campaign. It\'s easy to understand why Netanyahu wants to get rid of him. But why is he punishing Israel?\n\nI wonder what\'s next. Is Daniella Weiss on her way to become Israel\'s ambassador to the European Union?\n\n\n\n** Ha\xe2\x80\x99aretz \xe2\x80\x93 August 18, 2015\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n** Fractured American Jewish Community Is First Victim of Iran Nuclear Deal (http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/west-of-eden/.premium-1.671839)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNetanyahu and AIPAC have sparked a battle royal of Jew vs. Jew, with the most riveting skirmishes playing out in the local Jewish Federations.\n\nBy Chemi Shalev\n\nIn the campaign to convince American Jewish groups to come out against the Iran nuclear deal, Israeli opposition leader Isaac Herzog has emerged as a strategic asset.\n\nIn some of the heated deliberations taking place in national Jewish organizations and local Jewish Federations across America, opponents of the deal with Tehran are using Herzog as a trump card to challenge the motives and loyalties of its supporters: How can a good Jew defend Obama\xe2\x80\x99s deal, they ask, when Herzog and the rest of Israel oppose it?\n\nHerzog may have subsequently dissociated himself from the all-out war that Benjamin Netanyahu and AIPAC are waging against the Obama administration in Congress, but the nuance is lost in the fierce firefights that have broken out among American Jews since the July 14 Vienna signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between the P5+1 countries and Iran. It is a battle royal that is taking place in the boardrooms of Jewish organizations from coast to coast, in synagogues, community centers and social gatherings, behind closed doors or out in the open, in polite debate or, increasingly, in heated emotional dispute. It pits Jews against Jews, conservatives vs. liberals, hawks and doves, Republicans and Democrats, donors against professionals, rabbis against their flock and, in recent days, against one another.\n\nFor every statement for or against there is an immediate rebuttal, for every argument a counterargument, for each manifesto a harsh rebuke. Both sides swear allegiance to the greater good of both Israel and America, but as time goes by, the acrimony grows acute, resentment festers, the bitterness strikes roots. Whether the deal is as good as the Obama administration claims or as bad as Netanyahu says, it has already claimed its first victim: a fractured American Jewish community.\n\nAlready divided in recent years against the backdrop of unprecedented tensions between Obama and Netanyahu and growing disenchantment with many Israeli policies, the community is polarizing, perhaps, as some claim, even splitting at the seams. And it is doing so out in the open, for the world to see.\n\nAlong with its internal convulsions, American Jews are also the subject of intense external scrutiny, justifiable and malicious. A few minutes after New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez predictably announced on Tuesday that he would be joining his Jewish colleague from New York Chuck Schumer in opposing the Iran deal, he was subjected to a harsh torrent of insults and diatribes on social media that were mostly anti-Jewish in nature. These manifestations of anti-Semitism are then cultivated and inflated by cynical Iran deal critics and artificially linked to legitimate if sometimes injudicious remarks made by Obama and other administration officials.\n\nWhile the pro-Israel lobby ducks under cover of this alleged incitement, the community reels from the reemergence of long dormant insinuations and accusations of dual loyalties and undue influence. GOP activists, meanwhile, stoke these flames in the hope that next time around, Jews will finally see the error of their ways and vote Republican.\n\nOn the national level, AIPAC has set the tone, with mainstream organizations such as the American Jewish Committee and the Anti Defamation League following suit; J-Street and smaller organizations stand mostly alone in support of the deal. Many Jewish professionals and executives concur with criticism of the Iran deal, but even those who don\xe2\x80\x99t are wary of their conservative donors, whose voices are often louder and financial pressures more direct than those of their liberal counterparts. Some activists feel compelled to speak out, fearing that silence will render them irrelevant on the most dramatic Jewish issue of the day; others are wary of accusations that they were ignoring the collective opinion of Herzog and other Israelis or repeating the sins of their forefathers who stood by as the Holocaust engulfed the Jews of Europe.\n\nThe most riveting showdowns by far are taking place in the 151 Jewish Federations that have traditionally steered clear of divisive political issues, preferring to stick with fundraising for Israel and Jewish education while providing social services to their community. The Federations\xe2\x80\x99 foray into disputed territory has sparked dissent and outrage among Obama supporters and among some of his opponents as well: a few have threatened to reassess their contributions. Many Federation bigwigs are concurrently active in AIPAC: in recent weeks, the powerful Washington-based lobby has made a point of beginning conference calls with activists with a tally of the Federations that have joined the fight and those that are still sitting on the fence. Some Federation officials have complained of direct pressures being exerted by the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s Office in Jerusalem or in its name.\n\nTo date, 18 Federations have come out against the Iran deal, with most urging their members to lobby members of Congress to vote it down. The list of fighting Federations is slightly more than 10% of the total number, but it includes most of the big hitters, including Chicago, where a fierce battle was waged between opposing sides; Los Angeles, which was forced to issue an acknowledgement of the  \xe2\x80\x9ccomplexity\xe2\x80\x9d of the issue and the \xe2\x80\x9cdiversity\xe2\x80\x9d of opinions after its original statement of opposition sparked a fierce backlash, along with Boston, Miami, Philadelphia and other major Metropolitan areas. The biggest of them all, however, the New York UJA-Federation, has decided to maintain neutrality and steer clear of the divisive battle.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell with which side enjoys more support in the community. The very definition of the target audience is in dispute: does it include all self-professed Jews or only those who participate in communal life or take an interest in Israel. The only reliable poll, at least in this writer\xe2\x80\x99s view, was conducted by Professor Steve Cohen and published in the Jewish Journal a few days after the JCPOA was signed. It showed solid support for the nuclear deal, but that was before Netanyahu, the Republicans and right wing pundits sank their teeth into it, and before AIPAC and other groups began spending tens of millions of dollars advertising its dangers and pitfalls. Among American Jews, like their Israeli brethren, fear and suspicion have a home turf advantage over optimism and hope.\n\n\nJewish officials I have spoken to in recent days are worried, perhaps even scared: they feel helpless despite the earthquake beneath their feet and the irreparable damage that it may cause. Many are frustrated that Netanyahu has chosen to lead the charge without devoting a second thought to how it might weaken the Jewish community.  In a few months Netanyahu will try to enlist American Jews to do battle against the boycott movement, one senior Jewish figure told me, but he could be facing a demoralized and disoriented community that has alienated and distanced many of its members while wasting precious resources and limited goodwill on a campaign that was doomed from the outset.\n\n============================================================\nS.
