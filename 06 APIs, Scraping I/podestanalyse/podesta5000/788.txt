He has never deferred even to a sitting President in pursuing his own agenda, and is not likely to in this case. A meeting could be construed as a tacit endorsement of the trip and the positions that Carter will convey. I would be more open to a meeting after the trip, when Carter can brief the PE on the results of his discussions.\n\nFrom: Denis McDonough\nSent: Monday, November 10, 2008 3:34 PM\nTo: Sara Latham; john.podesta@gmail.com; 'Rahm Emanuel (rahm@friendsofrahmemanuel.com)'; Jim Steinberg; djsberg@gmail.com; ricesusane@aol.com; Susan Rice\nSubject: RE: President Carter\n\nthis is obviously a fairly large problem.\n\nplease let Jim, Susan, Mark and me work this and come back to you with a proposal.\n\nDenis\n\nFrom: Sara Latham\nSent: Monday, November 10, 2008 2:29 PM\nTo: john.podesta@gmail.com; 'Rahm Emanuel (rahm@friendsofrahmemanuel.com)'; Denis McDonough; Jim Steinberg; djsberg@gmail.com; ricesusane@aol.com; Susan Rice\nSubject: FW: President Carter\n\nsee email below - President Carter requesting to meet with Pres-Elect  regarding his upcoming trip to Syria and Lebanon - Dec. 8 - 15th.\n\nFrom: Sara Latham [mailto:sara@lathamgroup.co.uk]\nSent: Monday, November 10, 2008 1:05 PM\nTo: Sara Latham\nSubject: Fwd: President Carter\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n\nFrom: Rick Jasculca <rickj@jtpr.com<mailto:rickj@jtpr.com>>\nDate: 10 November 2008 18:03:19 GMT\nTo: Sara Latham <sara@lathamgroup.co.uk<mailto:sara@lathamgroup.co.uk>>\nSubject: President Carter\n\n\nSara, I need your help on behalf of President Carter.  I also have contacted\nLiz Sears, Rahm's Senate COS, to see if she could lend an assist; however,\ngiven your knowledge of President Carter and White House experience, you are\nlikely to know the best and fastest route.\n\nIn August, President Carter met with David Axelrod at the Denver Hyatt and\nshared with him his plans for a trip to the Middle East this fall, including\nSyria and Lebanon.  That was followed by a phone call between President\nCarter and then-Senator Obama days after the Convention.  President Carter\nlast spoke with President-Elect Obama on Election Night...an obviously very\nbrief phone call.\n\nThis morning, I heard from President Carter and his long-time scheduler,\nNancy Konigsmark.  President Carter is seeking a meeting this month with\nPresident-Elect Obama, at any location the President-Elect chooses, to\ndiscuss President Carter's upcoming trip to Syria and Lebanon.\n\nI am not sure if this is a Rahm, John Podesta, Joe Biden or Alyssa\nissue...perhaps all of the above, but I was certain you could most\nexpeditiously put this into the right hands and hopefully get Nancy and I in\ntouch with whoever can make this happen.\n\nI fully understand everyone is swamped.  But, this trip has been long\nscheduled and is a follow-on to the Middle East trip earlier this year by\nPresident Carter and former Rep. Steve Solarz.  A number of high level and\nsensitive meetings have been scheduled, and President Carter feels it is\nimportant to have a consultation with the President-Elect before he departs.\nI've got to believe that President-Elect Obama will at least want to be in\nthe loop on this.\n\nThank you for your assistance.\n\nRick Jasculca\n312-337-7400 ofc\n312-953-6858 cell\n\n"
