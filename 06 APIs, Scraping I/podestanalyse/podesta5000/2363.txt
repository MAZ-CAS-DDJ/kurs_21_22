john.podesta@gmail.comb"Dear colleagues,\nI\x92m writing to share the news that Erin Jay, Assistant Director of Special Events, has been offered an incredible career opportunity with the National Parks Conservation Association as the Associate Director of Special Events. This is a huge loss for Georgetown Law, however I know that NPCA will benefit from having Erin join their team.\n\nDuring Erin\x92s more than five years with us, she has been a tremendous asset to our team. Whether the tasks were as small as handing out name tags or as large as managing enormously complicated, high-profile events, Erin's diligence, attention to detail, time and endless energy all contributed to our success and made working with her a pleasure.  Her contributions and accomplishments measurably elevated the quality of our events and of the Office of Special Events itself.\n\nPlease join me in congratulating Erin on the fantastic job she\x92s done the past five+ years and wishing her well at the National Parks Conservation Association.\n\nWe\x92ll be hosting an Open House in Erin\x92s honor on Monday, November 3rd in the Special Events Office from 3:00 until 4:30 PM. I hope you will be able to stop by to wish Erin well in her new job!\n\nSharon\n___________________________________\nSharon R.
