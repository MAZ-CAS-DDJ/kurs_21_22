These standards will not only help struggling families by creating an estimated 570,000 jobs, but they are also predicted to save us $8,000 on the life of every new car. Additionally, by making our cars go further on a tank of gas, we will drastically cut down our oil consumption, lowering the amount of carbon pollution that puts our health at risk and fuels global warming.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the fact that the major U.S. automakers, the United Auto Workers, consumer advocates, health professionals and environmental and science-based groups have all come together to support these standards speaks to the extraordinary scope of the new rules and the enormous positive impact they will have on our country.\n\nThank President Obama for making this landmark decision to protect our health and our planet: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=oCTp3wcCFYIR5qsrqhDKYw .\n\nIf we want to curb global warming and keep our families healthy, we need bold initiatives like this from our government. While enacting these standards was a very important move, President Obama may face a backlash from oil companies that don't want to see a dip in their obscene profits.\n\nSo, I hope you'll join me in sending President Obama a message right now to thank him for fighting for strong clean energy policies.\n\nThanks,\n\nGene Karpinski\nPresident\nLeague of Conservation Voters\n\n\n\nUpdate Your Profile\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=UzqR-AioNPC4ZlNx-W1Y6Q\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=5FgRxc0I_1vfz1G2kNDxAVDDs5Y3x0T1&cid=0\n\n1920 L Street, NW Suite 800\nWashington, DC 20036\n202-785-8683\n\n"
