john.podesta@gmail.comb'Just re- read this note from Jon.\n\nIt reaffirms my concern with relying on argument that his plans don\'t add\nup as contrast.  It\'s the kind of argument that makes his argument stronger\n- his supporters will draw energy from her saying what he wants isn\'t real\nor can\'t add up.\n\nI think arguing that you can\'t be a single issue candidate and showing his\nideas are bad is better terrain.  Single issue reinforces a strength of\nHRC\'s (her ability to do all part is the job).  Doesn\'t add up reinforces a\nnegative view of her (she\'s part of the establishment and won\'t ever\naccomplish kind of change we need).\n\n\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Feb 18, 2016, at 3:35 PM, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nSharing this advice from Favreau, for what it\'s worth.  As you know, much\nof this is very much in line with my own thinking over the past several\nmonths. And I\'d say he raises useful cautions about not letting our\n"breaking barriers" message become a recitation of interest groups or isms,\nand not letting "the math doesn\'t add up" critique turn her into a wet\nblanket.  That said, I think he\'s undervaluing the importance of keeping a\nstrong economic thrust at the heart of our message... anyway, food for\nthought.\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n\n*From:* Jon Favreau <jon@fenwaystrategies.com>\n*Date:* February 18, 2016 at 1:34:04 PM EST\n*Subject:* *Hillary *\n\nVery scattered thoughts, starting with a few things I\'ve read and seen that\nmade me think "Ah, this should be her message":\n\n1. The awesome DREAMer video you guys put out\n\n2. The race speech\n\n3. This David Brooks column (I know, I know, I\'ll go kill myself):\nhttp://nyti.ms/1KTjYqJ\n\n4. The Love and Kindness story\n\nHer most important job right now is to inspire people, and generate\nenthusiasm. And she will not succeed by playing the pragmatist to Bernie\'s\nidealist. No young person - no any person - who isn\'t the most committed\nvoter will head out to the polls or knock on doors for someone who tells\nthem that they should have more realistic expectations for what politics\ncan achieve (even though they should!). In 2008, we would purposely bait\nher into playing the wet blanket so we could turn around and whack her for\nit. The line from the New Hampshire primary night speech, "In the unlikely\nstory of America, there has never been anything false about hope" was a\ndirect retort to Hillary\'s line about Obama "giving everyone false hopes."\nAnd it was devastating.\n\nFar more effective has been what she\'s been doing recently - saying that\nBernie is a single issue voter and that there are a lot more issues at\nstake than Wall Street. This idea that class is the only divide and\neconomic issues are all that matter is a very white male centric view of\nthe world (a Bernie Bro view, if you will). It also reminds me of the\nhilarious joke that Brian Buetler keeps making every time some asshole says\nsomething horribly racist about Obama or sexist about Hillary or prejudice\nabout immigrants and Muslims - oh, let\'s not blame them, they\'re just\neconomically anxious.\n\nPeople are of course economically anxious, and Bernie is tapping into that\nvery well. But that\'s only half the equation. They\'re also being told to\nblame other groups for all their problems - blacks, gays, immigrants,\nMuslims, women, political correctness, etc. Fighting that intolerance and\ndivisiveness is just as important as fighting inequality - arguably more so\nin this election because Trump has made it the defining issue. And she is\nway better equipped and qualified to make that argument than Bernie is.\nThat\'s true because she\'s a woman. That\'s true because she was America\'s\nchief diplomat. That\'s true because she\'s fought for these issues her\nentire life.\n\nAs far back as Audacity of Hope, Obama often talked about our ability to\ncoexist peacefully in a shrinking world as a central challenge of the 21st\ncentury. Bill Clinton used to talk about interdependence on one another as\nour central mission.\n\nHillary can pick up the mantle here in a very inspiring way. She just has\nto tweak it and be careful that it doesn\'t sound like she\'s listing off\ninterest groups - here\'s my black speech, here\'s my Latino policy, here\'s\nmy woman\'s event, etc. She needs to combine her policies with her record\nwith a vision of the country and the world where we\'re stronger together\nthan we are divided against each other. That\'s different than "stronger\ntogether than we are on our own," which would be more of a Bernie/Obama \'12\nmessage that\'s all about right-wing economics. This is an evolution of that\nmessage that\'s primarily a response to the intolerance and bigotry of Trump\nand the right.\n\nShe should be talking about love and kindness. She should be talking about\nmutual respect and tolerance. She should be talking about rebuilding the\nbonds of community and rebuilding friendships, not just between nations,\nbut between people all over the world. Not just compassion for compassion\'s\nsake - but because we\'re stronger when we\'re pulling together\' when\neveryone feels like they\'re part of the team.\n\nIt reminds me of one of my favorite passages from any speech - Cuomo\'s 84\nconvention address:\n\n"It\'s an old story. It\'s as old as our history. The difference between\nDemocrats and Republicans has always been measured in courage and\nconfidence. The Republicans -- The Republicans believe that the wagon train\nwill not make it to the frontier unless some of the old, some of the young,\nsome of the weak are left behind by the side of the trail. "The strong" --\n"The strong," they tell us, "will inherit the land."\n\nWe Democrats believe in something else. We democrats believe that we can\nmake it all the way with the whole family intact, and we have more than\nonce. Ever since Franklin Roosevelt lifted himself from his wheelchair to\nlift this nation from its knees -- wagon train after wagon train -- to new\nfrontiers of education, housing, peace; the whole family aboard, constantly\nreaching out to extend and enlarge that family; lifting them up into the\nwagon on the way; blacks and Hispanics, and people of every ethnic group,\nand native Americans -- all those struggling to build their families and\nclaim some small share of America. For nearly 50 years we carried them all\nto new levels of comfort, and security, and dignity, even affluence. And\nremember this, some of us in this room today are here only because this\nnation had that kind of confidence. And it would be wrong to forget that."\n\nWho better to deliver that message than First Lady-turned-Secretary of\nState who could become America\'s first female president?\n'
