Waxman (D-Beverly Hills), have made a series of concessions that\nsubstantially soften its effect on coal -- at least over the next decade or\nso.\n\nAs a result, the Environmental Protection Agency projects that even if the\nemissions limits go into effect, the U.S. would use more\ncarbon-dioxide-heavy coal in 2020 than it did in 2005.\n\nThat\'s because the bill gives utilities a financial incentive to keep\nburning coal by joining the cap-and-trade system -- a kind of marketplace\nwhere polluters could reduce their emissions on paper by buying pollution\nreductions created by others. These so-called offsets, for example, could be\ncreated and sold by farmers who planted trees, which filter carbon dioxide\nfrom the atmosphere.\n\nEnvironmental groups also say the bill could set off a boom in the\nconstruction of new coal plants because of provisions that would restrict\nlegal efforts to block such projects.\n\nLeading Democrats -- and some major conservation groups, such as the Natural\nResources Defense Council -- say the moves have helped attract coal-district\nDemocrats to support the bill without undermining the plan\'s environmental\ngoals.\n\n"We\'ve ensured a role for coal" in the nation\'s energy future, said Rep.\nRick Boucher (D-Va.), one of the leading coal champions in the House.\n\nBut some environmentalists remain skeptical that offsets can reduce\ngreenhouse gases to avoid catastrophic warming of the atmosphere.\n\n"This is greens making a deal with the devil," said Ted Nordhaus, chairman\nof the Breakthrough Institute, an environmentalist think tank that recently\ncompleted a detailed critique of the bill\xe2\x80\x99s coal\nprovisions<http://www.thebreakthrough.org/writing.shtml>\n.\n\nObama and House leaders "gave the coal guys everything they wanted," said\nMichael Shellenberger, the institute\'s president. "The result is legislation\nthat, when all is said and done, will increase coal generation and make it\nharder to move away from it."\n\nThe EPA projects Obama\'s plan would slow the growth in coal over what would\nhave occurred in the absence of emission limits. Emissions from coal would\ngrow at roughly the same rate as overall coal use, until "clean coal"\ntechnology becomes commercially viable.\n\nUnder the plan, the EPA projects that after 2020, conventional coal use\nwould begin to fall quickly. That prediction rests on a still-uncertain\nassumption that new nuclear power plants would begin to come on line.\n\nThe analysis also assumes scientists will master advanced technologies that\ncould make coal more attractive from an emissions standpoint. As of now, no\none has on a commercial scale.\n\nObama\'s Energy Department\nannounced<http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-coal-plant13-2009jun13%2C1%2C1053308.story>this\nmonth that it would spend more than $1 billion to restart a\ncarbon-capture demonstration plant in Mattoon, Ill.\n\nThe focus on coal in climate legislation is directly linked to its\nabundance. Coal has been burned for heat since the time of cavemen. It\nstoked the smokestacks of the Industrial Revolution and powered the first\nsteam engines. It remains the source of half of the electric power in the\nUnited States and is the nation\'s most abundant fossil fuel.\n\n"Whatever the ideal vision of the future," said David G. Hawkins, director\nof climate programs for the NRDC, "coal will be there for decades at least."\n\nThe coal industry spent $38 million in the 2008 presidential campaign to\npush its message, and it has succeeded in changing the nature of the debate.\n\n"In the past, there was a drive to use climate policy as a wedge to take\ncoal out of the energy mix," said Joe Lucas, senior vice president of\ncommunications for the industry-funded American Coalition for Clean Coal\nElectricity. "There\'s just been a fundamental shift."\n\nSeveral of the most coal-dependent utilities have endorsed the House bill,\nbut the coal coalition has not -- it wants caps on the price of emission\npermits, among other amendments. But Lucas said the bill was "closer" than\nit had ever been to industry acceptance.\n\nStill, most Republicans, particularly those from coal-heavy regions, say the\nbill is still not a good deal for coal consumers, who include many of the\npoorest Americans.\n\n"Why is it that the wealthy parts of our country continue to attack the\nlifestyles of the rural poor?" Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.), a longtime coal\nchampion, asked at a hearing on the energy bill last month. "If you\'re going\nto put a price on carbon emissions now, later or in the future, those that\nrely on [coal] are going to be harmed."\n\n\nOn Tue, Jun 23, 2009 at 4:04 PM, Joshua McNeil <joshua_mcneil@lcv.org>wrote:\n\n>  *\n> *\n> FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n> June 23, 2009\n> Contact: *joshua_mcneil@lcv.org*; 202.454.4573\n>\n> *League of Conservation Voters to Deny Endorsement to Any Member of\n> Congress Who Votes No On American Clean Energy and Security Act *\n>\n>\n> The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) believes that H.R. 2454, the\n> American Clean Energy and Security Act, is the most important piece of\n> environmental legislation to ever come before the House of Representatives.\n>  The historic bill has the potential to transform America by creating clean\n> energy jobs, improving our national security, and protecting our planet from\n> global warming pollution.\n>\n> In light of the tremendous importance of this legislation, LCV has made the\n> unprecedented decision that the organization will not endorse any member of\n> the House of Representatives in the 2010 election cycle who votes against\n> final passage of this bill.
