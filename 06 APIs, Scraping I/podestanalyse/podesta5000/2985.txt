Did it.\n\nMarriage equality for all. Check.\n\nA global agreement to tackle climate change. Count it.\n\n69 straight months of private-sector job growth. And still going.\n\nUnemployment down to 5 percent. Done.\n\nJohn, these are huge victories for our country, and they \nwouldn't have been possible without your support.\n\nWill you chip in right now to keep the momentum going next \nyear? \n\nhttps://my.barackobama.com/Keep-Up-The-Momentum\n\nPresident Obama has committed to making the most out of\nthese next 13 months, and you can bet that the special\ninterests and extreme voices in Congress will be doing\neverything they can to take away our progress. There's still\nmore work to do -- and it's up to us to help get it done.\n\nVolunteering, pitching in where you can, and never giving up \nthe fight for real, lasting change is how OFA volunteers did it \nin 2015 -- and that's how we're going to do it in 2016.\n\nWe're closing the books on this year soon -- and we're \nlooking ahead. Chip in $10, or whatever you can, and say \nyou're in:\n\nhttps://my.barackobama.com/Keep-Up-The-Momentum\n\nThanks,\n\nSara\n\nSara El-Amine\nExecutive Director\nOrganizing for Action\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for Action\n\nContributions or gifts to Organizing for Action are not tax deductible.\n\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo update your address, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/change-address?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe from these messages, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscription\nOrganizing for Action, P.O.
