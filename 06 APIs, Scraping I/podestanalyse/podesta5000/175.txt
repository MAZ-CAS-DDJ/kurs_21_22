And I'm up to 95% on a health care bill this year.\n \nMost impressed with the work of your group, and would be happy to help, participate, or hang out and be the Party person whenever/if you need me.  Let me know how I can be of service.\n \nThanks for your kind words as well.  Alice\n \n \n \nAlice Germond\nSecretary, Democratic National Committee\n430 So.
