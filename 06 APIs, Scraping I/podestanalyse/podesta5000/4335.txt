Seems Erdogan faction is\nmaking substantial investments in U.S. to counter opposition (CHP, Kurds,\nGulenists etc.) outreach to policymakers and USG. Am told that the Erdogan\ncrew also tries to make inroads via donations to Democratic candidates,\nincluding yours. Two names that you should be aware of are *Mehmet Celebi*\nand *Ali Cinar*. Happy to elaborate on the phone, provided you are not\nshopping at the liquor store.\n\nM.\n'
