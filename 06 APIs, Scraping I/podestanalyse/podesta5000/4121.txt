Which is odd to say because I\'m\nsure she feels she\'s sticking her neck out for the Muslim community. I\ntotally empathize with, and understand, the desire not to lump all of Islam\ninto a clash of civilizations framework and provide fodder for radical\nIslamists to recruit. But here\'s how I\'d respond: 1) if we try to defend\nthe "true Islam" and say it\'s peaceful, we are doing the work for Muslims\nthat they need to do themselves; I would rather encourage them to feel like\n"these damn ISIL/AQ are giving us a terrible name and we have to do\nsomething about it because the Americans are saying there\'s a radical\nIslam" (they are less incentivized if we\'re carrying water by saying "don\'t\nworry, we\'ll defend your religion for you"); 2) "radical Islam" should be\nembraced not to describe violent radicals, but generally anti-progressives\n(people who ideologically hate gays/women/jews/christians); that\'s our\nlonger and more enduring campaign; 3) it really has little effect in the\nISIL propaganda war if we\'re hesitating to say "radical Islam", they are\nalready calling themselves the Islamic State after all\n\n\nOn Sun, Dec 6, 2015 at 8:56 PM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n> POTUS?\n>\n> HRC today on George?\n'
