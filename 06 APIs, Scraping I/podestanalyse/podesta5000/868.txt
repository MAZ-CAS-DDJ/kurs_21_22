You're helping us reach more and more voters every single day, and our first TV ad is now airing in markets across New York.\n\nWe're close to our goal but I need your help to raise $26,325 by midnight tonight.\n\nYou can contribute online at:\n\nwww.kirstengillibrand.com/september30th\n\nThis really is a team effort, which is what I love about it. Your contribution fuels our campaign.\n\nThanks for your kind and generous support.\n\nKirsten\n \nSent from my iPhone\n\n \n \n\n\nThis message was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.
