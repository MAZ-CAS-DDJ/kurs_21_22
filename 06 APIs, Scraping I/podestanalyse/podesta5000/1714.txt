Men and women fought and died for the right to vote, we should be expanding access to voting, not restricting it.\n\nThat's why I'm proud to have joined forces with civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis to introduce The Voter Empowerment Act in the U.S. Senate. By passing this bill, Congress can restore access, integrity and accountability to our voting process.\n\nBut I need you to join the fight. The Democratic Governors Association and I have launched a nationwide call to action to urge Republicans to stop disenfranchising voters and support the Voter Empowerment Act. Please add your name to the growing chorus of Americans calling for expanded voting rights. \n\n[ http://action.kirstengillibrand.com/t/11999/petition.jsp?petition_KEY=543 ]\n\nThe Voter Empowerment Act would expand access to voting by modernizing the voter registration process, allowing online and same-day registration around the country. This bill would make sure that provisional ballots are available and are counted at all polling locations and would restore integrity to our voting process by setting standards for voting machines, which require voters to receive confirmation of their vote so they can be assured the vote they cast was in fact counted. And it would also ensure that the votes of our youth and those living or serving in the military overseas are counted. \n\nAs we have seen over the past two years, our voting laws need to be strengthened to ensure the most Americans are able to use the precious right that Rep. John Lewis and so many of his peers in the civil rights movement fought so hard for.\n\nPlease join me and the Democratic Governors Association to urge Republicans to stop disenfranchising voters and support the Voter Empowerment Act so all Americans' votes can be counted.\n\n[ http://action.kirstengillibrand.com/t/11999/petition.jsp?petition_KEY=543 ]\n\nThank you for joining the fight to end GOP voter suppression!\n\n- Kirsten\n \n \n \n\nWe are only asking for up to $5,000 per year from individuals and federally registered PACs for DGA Action.
