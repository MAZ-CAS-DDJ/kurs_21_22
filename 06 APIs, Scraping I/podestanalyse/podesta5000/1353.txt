Would\nthere any dates we know in early October that might work in Brooklyn?\n\nHeather, let me know if you'd like to discuss first and then I'll need to\ncircle back with Tim Foley.\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Sep 1, 2015, at 5:27 AM, Alex Hornbrook <ahornbrook@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nShe will be in Midtown briefly 1-2 times in Sept for a couple hours that,\nfrankly, are already over booked. She will be there briefly on 9/8 for our\nLena Dunham interview (not even 100% confirmed this is at our office) and\ncouple quick videos between finance and Ellen taping and very briefly on\n9/16 for the NEA tele town hall between finance and Jimmy Fallon.  What\nexactly would be required of her for this SEIU 1199 meeting?\n\nOn Monday, August 31, 2015, Marlon Marshall <mmarshall@hillaryclinton.com\n<javascript:_e(%7B%7D,'cvml','mmarshall@hillaryclinton.com');>> wrote:\n\n> Adding Alex\n> I don't think she is in the midtown office in Septermber but will let him\n> update\n>\n> On Mon, Aug 31, 2015 at 10:49 PM, Heather Stone <hstone@hillaryclinton.com\n> > wrote:\n>\n>> I spoke with Robby and Nikki today.
