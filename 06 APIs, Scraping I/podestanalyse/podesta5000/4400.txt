john.podesta@gmail.comb'John -- \n\nThe headlines are rolling in about this new poll:\n\n"John McCain, Ann Kirkpatrick neck and neck in latest poll"  - ABC 15\n"Poll: McCain, Kirkpatrick in statistical tie in Senate race" - Arizona Daily Star\n"Poll: Kirkpatrick has a shot at unseating McCain" - Tucson Sentinel\n\nWhen John McCain said this would be his toughest race ever, he wasn\'t kidding. Now we\'re proving it.\n\nJohn -- our hard work has helped Ann get to this point. We have got to keep it up. Can you help us capitalize on this? \n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ake160204?refcode=ake160204_B&recurring=true&amount=25.00\n\nTwo major takeaways from this poll. One -- it makes crystal clear that "Senator Kirkpatrick" could be a reality. \n\nAnd two -- we really need to step up our game. John McCain\'s dark money pals read numbers just like we do. And when they see their allies getting threatened, they start writing checks. \n\nWe need to get $3,800 into our Rapid Response Fund in the next 34 hours to capitalize on this. Can you chip in?  \n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ake160204?refcode=ake160204_B&recurring=true&amount=25.00\n\nThanks!\n\nTeam Kirkpatrick\n\n----\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.\n\nTo unsubscribe, go to: \nhttp://kirkpatrickforsenate.com/subscriptions\n\n\nPaid for by Kirkpatrick for Senate\n\n'
