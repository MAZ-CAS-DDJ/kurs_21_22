We will be done around 330 pm, so I\'ll be able to talk then.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Tapper, Jake\r\nTo: john.podesta@gmail.com ; Jennifer Palmieri\r\nSent: Mon May 04 11:19:01 2009\r\nSubject: Fw: following up\r\n\r\nWhat\'s the plan? To try to intimidate reporters who ever report on anything the White House disapproves of?

No one pressured him, no one peddled anything to him, and no one reached out to him to cover this. Indeed, the first he heard of Mark Levin pushing this story was in your post."\r\n\r\n"Jake first heard of this story when he overheard a radio reporter talking about Mr. Lauria\'s interview with WJR-AM. Having covered the Chrysler deal for ABC News, and having spoken to many Obama administration officials about the hedge funds whom President Obama disparaged, Jake was also interested in hearing the other side of the story."\r\n\r\n"He did due diligence on Lauria, found he was a leading bankruptcy attorney who represents players in this debate, with no discernible partisan bias, and called him up. He also reached out to the White House and got its denial of the story. Your implication is completely different from what actually happened."\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nEmily Lenzner\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Faiz Shakir [mailto:FShakir@americanprogress.org]\r\nSent: Monday, May 04, 2009 10:39 AM\r\nTo: Tapper, Jake; \'john.podesta@gmail.com\'\r\nCc: Lenzner, Emily A; Schneider, Jeffrey W; Jennifer Palmieri\r\nSubject: Re: following up\r\n\r\n\r\nThe post is actually a pretty straight presentation of facts.

That\'s shoddy journalism, and it\'s simply not reflective of the truth.\r\n\r\nAs I told you, I heard of Lauria\'s claims when I overheard Ann Compton talking with someone at ABC News radio about Lauria\'s interview. That was the last I heard of it.\r\n\r\nI was interested in speaking with someone representing the hedge funds since President Obama spoke so strongly against them. Friday I was busy with Justice Souter\'s story, so I didn\'t get a chance to look into it.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, I found Lauria\'s interview on the WJR-AM website. I looked into Lauria, found him to be a credible voice, a leading bankruptcy attormey who indeed had represented the firm in question. Moreover, he had recently given $10,000 to the DSCC so he had no discernible partisan motives.\r\n\r\nI reached out to the White House, they denied Lauria\'s story, which we gave prominence in the story.\r\n\r\nNothing in your story about my reporting on this matter is accurate. No one pressured me, no one peddled anything to me, and no one reached out to me to cover this. Indeed, the first I heard of Mark Levin pushing this story was on your post.\r\n\r\nThe fact that you don\'t mention Lauria\'s giving money to Democrats is quite telling.\r\n\r\nThis is inaccurate and you should be ashamed to have written it after I told you what happened.\r\n\r\nJake\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Faiz Shakir <FShakir@americanprogress.org>\r\nTo: Tapper, Jake <Jake.Tapper@abc.com>\r\nSent: Mon May 04 09:53:50 2009\r\nSubject: RE: following up\r\n\r\nhere\'s the story. feel free to let me know what I got wrong (of course, I\'m always happy to print an on the record response from you):\r\n\r\nhttp://thinkprogress.org/2009/05/04/right-wing-radio-tapper/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Tapper, Jake [mailto:Jake.Tapper@abc.com]\r\nSent: Monday, May 04, 2009 8:56 AM\r\nTo: Faiz Shakir\r\nSubject: RE: following up\r\n\r\noff the record, i assume youll mention that the WH denial of the story first appeared in my blog, which highlighted their disputing of the story\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Faiz Shakir [mailto:FShakir@americanprogress.org]\r\nSent: Monday, May 04, 2009 07:52\r\nTo: Tapper, Jake\r\nSubject: Re: following up\r\n\r\n\r\nHow did you first learn of tom lauria\'s comments on the frank breckmann show?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\nSent from my BlackBerry Wireless Device\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Tapper, Jake\r\nTo: Faiz Shakir\r\nSent: Mon May 04 07:46:14 2009\r\nSubject: Re: following up\r\n\r\nWhat is the question you\'re seeking me to comment on?\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Faiz Shakir <FShakir@americanprogress.org>\r\nTo: Tapper, Jake <Jake.Tapper@abc.com>\r\nSent: Mon May 04 07:47:21 2009\r\nSubject: Re: following up\r\n\r\n202 247 0038\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\nSent from my BlackBerry Wireless Device\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Tapper, Jake\r\nTo: Faiz Shakir\r\nSent: Sun May 03 23:53:14 2009\r\nSubject: Re: following up\r\n\r\nWhat\'s your number?\r\n\r\n----- Original Message -----\r\nFrom: Faiz Shakir <FShakir@americanprogress.org>\r\nTo: Tapper, Jake <Jake.Tapper@abc.com>\r\nSent: Sun May 03 23:38:33 2009\r\nSubject: RE: following up\r\n\r\nThanks Jake -- I appreciate your honesty.
