He\nthought going could affect timing of contribution to some extent, but\nwill not secure the $ this year. I think he generally supports going,\nbut up to the President\n8) He thinks he's signed off on salary bands/structures. Terry, do you\nneed anything else?\n9) Suggests holding on any doc review at the archives until he returns\nto Little Rock. Two exceptions--White House requests he can handle by\nemail; if any other emergency request comes up, I can process. I'm\nholding a TS clearance. \xa0Scott, you may need to figure out what we\nneed to do to add me to the review authority. \xa0Hopefully, this won't\nbe an issue and can just slide till he gets back there.\n10) Suggests I take his place on Haiti investment decisions. Laura,\ncan you let Jean-Marc know. I am going to be in China next week, so if\nearly decisions/calls need to be set up, might be tricky. \xa0I'm back\nnext Friday afternoon.\nAnything else you guys have hanging?\n\n\nOn Wed, Nov 9, 2011 at 12:49 PM, Ana Maria Coronel\n<acoronel@clintonfoundation.org> wrote:\n> When: Monday, November 21, 2011 4:00 PM-5:00 PM (GMT-05:00) Eastern Time (US\n> & Canada).\n> Where: Large Conference Room - Water St Office or Dial-in: 866-652-0222\n> Code: 212-348-7159\n>\n> Note: The GMT offset above does not reflect daylight saving time\n> adjustments.\n>\n> *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\n>\n>\n>\n"
