john.podesta@gmail.comb'John --\n\nLast week, devastating budget cuts went into effect because Congress\nfailed to compromise -- with some Republicans choosing to protect tax \nloopholes for millionaires and billionaires over programs that millions of \nmiddle-class families rely on.\n\nThis is frustrating, and it\'s at times like these when Washington feels more \nbroken than ever. But here\'s what President Obama had to say:\n\n"The question is: Can the American people help persuade their members of \nCongress to do the right thing? And I have a lot of confidence that over time, \nif the American people express their displeasure about how something is \nworking, that eventually Congress responds."\n\nSo today, we\'re asking that Organizing for Action supporters do one easy thing \nto make their voice heard -- share this graphic on Facebook:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Congress-Needs-to-Act\n\nBy keeping the conversation going on Facebook, you\'ll be making sure your \nfriends and family are in the loop and have the tools to make their voice heard. \nPublic opinion is going to persuade Congress to act -- but we all have to do our \npart in speaking up.\n\nThanks,\n\nJon\n\nJon Carson\nExecutive Director\nOrganizing for Action\n\nP.S. -- If you\'re on Twitter, keep an eye on the hashtag #CutsWeCantAfford all day to \nsee folks around the country speaking up, too.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for Action\n\nContributions or gifts to Organizing for Action are not tax deductible.\n\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo update your address, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/change-address?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe from these messages, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscription\nOrganizing for Action, P.O.
