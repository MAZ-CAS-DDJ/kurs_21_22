Gives me stuff to think about. Glad for you that you won\'t be called this direction over the summer, but sorry for me -- definitely our loss!\n\nI hope you have lots of fun this summer with the family, and get at least a little rest and relaxation too.\n\nSee you soon!\nAll the best,\nBecky\n\nFrom: Erskine [mailto:erskine@2bowles.com]\nSent: Tuesday, June 09, 2015 10:00 AM\nTo: Kramer, Katie (NBCUniversal); Quick, Rebecca (NBCUniversal)\nSubject: Re: CNBC\'s Squawk Box - Guest Co-Host Invitation\n\nKatie. Happily for me no NY this summer. I\'m on two large corporate boards that hold all their meetings in NY , thankfully except for the ones in late July -- having lived in the City for 12 years I\'m certainly grateful for that. Our PE firm business also takes me to NY more than I wish ,but happily none are now scheduled in NY. I will however be there plenty in the fall.\nIf I come to the show , I\'d hope to focus on the need to get these political candidates in both parties to discuss the following fiscal issues :\n(1) Before doing anything else how to spend the money we are spending now more wisely ( something business , not for profits , and families in general must focus on and federal budgets largely ignore );\n(2) How to reform our tax code in a progressive manner such that America becomes more globally competitive and we produce more revenue ;\n(3) How to slow the rate of growth of health care spending and to make Social Security sustainably solvent ( It\'s $800b cash negative over the next decade ) so it will actually be there for the people who need it ;\n(4) How to at least partially replace the mindless , senseless , across the board cuts in the Sequester with more rational cuts in other mandatory items ( no business makes their cuts across the board , they make them surgically reducing those which will have the least adverse effect on productivity ) ;\n(5) How to use these additional resources to (a) reduce the debt , and (b) make the smart investments we must in defense , education , infrastructure , and high value added research so America is secure and globally competitive ; and\n(6) How they envision increasing economic mobility in the US ( today if you are in the bottom 5th of the income level in America your child is 5 times less likely to get to the top 5th compared to a child born to parents in the top 5th ( Warren\'s " lucky gene pool" ) , but if that kid born in the bottom 5th of the income level in America and gets a college degree that kid is 3 times more likely to move to the top .\n(7) These are the issues I\'m concerned about today. I believe if MY generation doesn\'t put the ultra partisanship on the Left and Right aside and pull together , not apart , and make some of these really tough decisions , WE will be the first generation of Americans to leave the Country worse off than we found it.\nErskine\n________________________________\nFrom: Kramer, Katie (NBCUniversal) <katie.kramer@nbcuni.com<mailto:katie.kramer@nbcuni.com>>\nSent: Tuesday, June 9, 2015 6:46:10 AM\nTo: Erskine\nSubject: RE: CNBC\'s Squawk Box - Guest Co-Host Invitation\n\nHi Erskine,\nHoping all is well with you since we spoke last in February.  We\x92d love to have you on CNBC\x92s Squawk Box when you\x92re next in town, for a longer chat.  Would be great for you to see our new midtown studio!\n\nLet me know if your schedule allows it and talk soon,\nKatie\n\nFrom: Kramer, Katie (NBCUniversal)\nSent: Wednesday, February 25, 2015 9:35 AM\nTo: \'Erskine\'\nSubject: RE: CNBC\'s Squawk Box - Guest Co-Host Invitation\n\nThanks, Erskine, so much for the reply and I\x92ve passed on your thoughts to Becky.  Happy to work with you when this fits in your NY schedule. I know what you mean, it\x92s another dark season in Washington, but your outlook sounds optimistic.  As you say, we will see.\nAll best,\nKatie\n\nFrom: Erskine [mailto:erskine@2bowles.com]\nSent: Monday, February 23, 2015 12:16 PM\nTo: Kramer, Katie (NBCUniversal)\nSubject: Re: CNBC\'s Squawk Box - Guest Co-Host Invitation\n\nKatie. I will do this when I\'m up there for a board meeting. I\'d hope to tie it to a time when anything remotely positive was possible in Washington. While there are numerous action forcing events on the horizon , it looks mighty dark now. I still feel the politics on both sides will drive the need to have positive accomplishments to point to that can only be done through legislation -- The president for legacy reasons and the Republican majorities to prove they can actually govern and thereby protect those majorities and Chairmanships. We will see.\nThank Becky for me. I will email you when I see a window.

Becky Quick asked me to reach out \x96 she enjoyed seeing you at the Alfalfa Dinner a few weeks ago! \x96 do you have any plans to come to New York this winter or spring?  We\x92d love to have you join us as a guest co-host for an hour of Squawk Box when you\x92re free.  We\x92ve moved to a great new studio in midtown at the corner of 51st Street and 6th Avenue,  so can save you the trip to NJ!\n\nAre there any dates coming up that may work?  We are live between 6 am and 9 am ET each weekday morning.\n\nThanks so much, and all the best,\nKatie\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\nKatie Kramer | Sr. Talent Producer | Phone: 201-735-2394 | Cell: 201-956-0458 | [Follow Us]  @kramer_katie\n[cnbc-logo]\nFirst in Business Worldwide\n900 Sylvan Avenue|Englewood Cliffs, NJ 07632\n\n'
