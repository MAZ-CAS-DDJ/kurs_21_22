john.podesta@gmail.comb'We\'ve got a real opportunity to make true progress on climate  change.\nGive to League of Conservation Voters today and join the fight >> http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=1G8xdRIG7Xre28VdkFbMTg\n\nJohn,\n\nLet me be clear: The environmental movement has a choice  to make. You\nhave a choice to make.\n\nWe can seize the momentum of our wins in November and  stand with\nPresident Obama as he ramps up his efforts to tackle climate change.\nHe said it clearly in his State of the Union address, "We can choose\nto believe in the overwhelming judgment of science  and  act before\nit\'s too late."\n\nOr we can sit back and let the dirty energy industry and  its allies\nonce again try to undo the incredible things we\'ve achieved.\n\nI\'m ready to fight  but I know that I can\'t do it alone. Make a gift\nto LCV now and take a stand  for our environment >> http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=7_DSZrP_srB7vmZn0LVQMg\n\nI know it seems like a daunting task to take on Big Oil and Dirty\nCoal. They are  some of the most profitable companies on the planet\nand to make matters  worse, they\'re still subsidized by taxpayer\ndollars.\n\nBut when people like you and me join with LCV and stand up to Big\nOil, I know we can win.\n\nWith  your support, we can stop the Keystone pipeline and block plans\nto drill in the  Arctic. We can push for better media coverage on\nclimate change. And when Big  Oil comes out swinging against our\nefforts to curb global warming pollution and  end taxpayer subsidies,\nyour support will give LCV the power to fight back.\n\nEven though Big Oil faced resounding defeats in 2012,  they haven\'t\ngiven up. They\'re terrified of what people like you, me and  thousands\nof other LCV supporters can do together, and they are gearing up\ntheir efforts.\n\nLet\'s show Big Oil and Dirty Coal that enough is enough. Make your\ncontribution  to LCV today so it has the support it needs to fight for\nreal progress on  climate change: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=o_n5Rsa28a9iFqHYZIZ8pA\n\nThis  is a real moment for the environmental movement  and I know LCV\nhas what it takes to make a difference. But only with your help: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=e8ZRVjux36iFoZRFzwB9SA\n\nThank you for putting families ahead of corporate polluters.\n\n\xa0\nElizabeth\n\n*****************\n\nUpdate Your Profile\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=lYVSI6hlavgMt9AvM7zNTw\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=-_IEhXCmzebaJfLV2aGarw5C8mnGZnYX&cid=0\n\n1920 L Street, NW Suite 800\nWashington, DC 20036\n202-785-8683\n\n'
