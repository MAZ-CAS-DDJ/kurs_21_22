A powerful set of victories for HRC\nand a real vindication of the campaign's message and delegate strategy.\n\nWhile I do not want to look too far ahead with 35 states to go, I want to\nyou to know I have flexibility at GU to take time and work quietly on\nresearch or transition projects.\n\nIn the meantime, I will continue to help on campaign policy committees,\nfundraising, and walking.\n\nJohn\n\nOn Fri, Jan 8, 2016 at 1:27 PM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n> Thanks John.
