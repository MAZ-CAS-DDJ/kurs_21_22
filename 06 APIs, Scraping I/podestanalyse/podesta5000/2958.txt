We really enjoyed all of it and especially the chance to visit with him at the villa Friday evening.  As I may have mentioned, Dan had not seen him since \xe2\x80\x9992 in Concord.\n>>  \n>> Below is the radio interview request from Jack Heath who has the top rated morning radio talk show in NH.  When the president was running and in office, Jack was the news director at WMUR-TV, our ABC affiliate.  Jack interviewed him numerous times up here and at least once in the oval office. He was always respectful and very fair and I am pretty sure WJC will remember him.  The Governor, Legislature and Secretary Gardner are making a big deal out of the 100th anniversary of our primary over the next year.  A special Commission on which I serve was set up to oversee the commemorative events etc.  In my opinion no one has done more to shine a light on the NH Primary and keep it first than WJC with his supportive comments nationally over the years so it is most fitting that he be interviewed about his campaign here and talk about what the NH Primary means for candidates, the races and selection of the ultimate nominees. \n>>  \n>> If you or anyone else has any questions, please do not hesitate to let me know.  My cell is 603-496-9919; office number is below.  As noted, Jack would like to do this before Feb. 9, but I am sure will do whatever he can to accommodate the president\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.

I am interviewing Bill Gardner, NH Secretary of State and one of his favorite reference points is when Bill Clinton finished 2nd in 1992 but essentially won. \n>> As you know, I have interviewed President Clinton on several occasions, including in the Oval Office when I was News Director of WMUR TV. Mr. Clinton also invited me to interview him in White Plains NY when he was President. \n>> My show airs daily on WGIR AM 610, 96.7FM in Portsmouth and on iHeartRadio live daily from 6 to 9am. I would request a pre tape call in interview with President Clinton some morning any day between next week and before February 9th. \n>> The call in number is 6036416565. \n>> Again, the sole topic is his reflection on the NH Primary, why it works and why it is special. \n>>  \n>> Thanks,\n>> Jack Heath, 6037142607\n>> Reference sites www.wgiram.com and NewsRadio 96.7FM. \n>>  \n>>  \n>> Sent from my Verizon Wireless 4G LTE Smartphone\n'
