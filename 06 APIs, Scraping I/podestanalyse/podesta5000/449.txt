But we know\nthat actually engaging voters in one-on-one conversations\ncan help cut through a lot of that clutter and make them\nmore likely to come out and cast a vote for the President\nand other Democrats this fall.\n\nOrganizers here have been hitting the streets every weekend\nto get the truth out and ask folks to step up and\nvolunteer. We've made some amazing progress -- and I know\nthe volunteers here will be excited to work side-by-side\nwith folks from D.C.\n\nCome out this weekend, and help Virginia go our way this\nyear:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/DC-Canvass-to-Virginia\n\nThanks,\n\nGrant\n\nGrant Lahmann\nVirginia General Election Director\nOrganizing for America\n\nP.S. -- Can you offer a ride?
