McClure, co-founder of *TKS* and founder of *McClure's Weekly.  *\n\nI am proud to say that the legacy continues to this day, with the news that\nover the weekend, the Society of Professional Journalists named *TKS *the\nbest non-daily student newspaper in Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky.  This\nis  only one of the honors that RKS has achieved in recent years, but is an\nextraordinary honor for a school of our size and richly deserved.\n\nTeresa\n\n-- \n*************************************\nTeresa L.
