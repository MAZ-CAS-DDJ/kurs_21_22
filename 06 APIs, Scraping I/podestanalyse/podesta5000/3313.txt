They would not do the automatic upgrade, no matter what fare\n> class was purchased for any flights that day.  United Global Svcs said this\n> is likely because it is a Sunday flight, but we purchased you the highest\n> class available that is compatible with global upgrades. An upgrade will\n> only be deducted if you get to use it.
