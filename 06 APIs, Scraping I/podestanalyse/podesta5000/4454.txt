One of my opening comments will be that every new president names his own team on the civilian side in Defense, as elsewhere.  Last week, all political appointees at DoD assumed that they would be leaving on January 20, unless asked to remain in place until a successor is confirmed.  What was assumed last week should still be assumed even after today's announcement.  The President-elect will nominate his own team of people to appointive positions in Defense and all should plan accordingly.\n\nSeparate matter.  I do not want to lose people I want to keep because they are left uncertain about their future.  Tomorrow afternoon, I want to tell my immediate office staff and those who support me directly (speech-writers, advance, protocol, press spokesman) that I want them to stay.  If there is still some concern about press spokesman, remind folks that an open position is Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, where I welcome their recommendations.  I do not want to combine the positions of Assistant Secy and press spokesman because the former both will manage the larger Pentagon public affairs operation (more than a thousand people, I think) but also focus on strategic communications.  The press spokesman is a Deputy Assistant Secretary who reports to the Assistant Secy but in reality, day to day, works directly with me.\n\nI thought this morning went well.\n\nBob\n"
