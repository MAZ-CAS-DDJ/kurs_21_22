john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John,\n\nIt was such a delight to be included in yesterday evening\'s celebration.  Congratulations again!  Trust you have spent today securing an invitation to a white tie event...\n\nYou were extremely generous to mention me in your remarks.  Thank you.  I know how fortunate I was to have you at the White House during those rocky times.\n\nI loved all the stories over dinner from "peeling off" to North Korea to taking the bus to NYC.  If there is any way that GMF can be helpful to you, please let me know.  For example, if you ever want to "peel off" to a European destination, it would be a privilege to host you at any of our seven European offices.\n\nAll best,\nKaren\n\nDr. Karen Donfried\nPresident\nThe German Marshall Fund of the U.S.\n1744 R St. NW\nWashington, DC 20009\n202-683-2600\n\n'
