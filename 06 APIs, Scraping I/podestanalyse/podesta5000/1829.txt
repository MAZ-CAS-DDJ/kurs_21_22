We have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed.  While we should have a larger conversation in the near future about a broader strategy for reengaging the beat press that covers HRC, for this we think we can achieve our objective and do the most shaping by going to Maggie.\n>  \n> What:\n> Mechanically, the story will have three basic components.  First, a list of names that we agree upon beforehand that we will give to a reporter on background, both policy people and campaign people.  Second, some information provided on background that explains what is happening and why and third, a quote on-the-record that affirms all of this in an official capacity, making clear that this is a sanctioned story.\n>  \n> 1)    Names:\n> a.

Paul Volcker\n> * More names available if and when it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful. And we should revisit if and how to give people a heads up beforehand.\n>  \n> b.

Teddy Goff?\n>                                           iii.     Wendy Clark?\n>  \n> 2)    On Background as someone familiar with HRC\xe2\x80\x99s thinking:\n>  \n> After the midterms, HRC turned in earnest to thinking through a decision, as she always said she would.  She\xe2\x80\x99s taking on the two big questions she posed at the end of her book: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your vision for America?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCan you lead us there?\xe2\x80\x9d  During the midterm campaign, you heard her lay out a lot of the challenges we face, particularly stagnant incomes and the middle class squeeze that is preventing a lot of Americans from feeling the recovery.  So now she\xe2\x80\x99s focusing on potential solutions.  She\xe2\x80\x99s casting a wide net, with a particular emphasis on new voices and new ideas.  Talking to Joe Stiglitz about inequality. Talking to Paul Volker about financial reform.  When you include outreach by her team, there have been discussions with more than 100 policy experts across the country.  As for the second question -- can you lead us there? --  she\xe2\x80\x99s also talking to people about what a successful, forward-looking and technological advanced campaign would look like, one that would allow her to have a conversation with the American public about these ideas and do so in innovative ways.  And just like on the policy side, she\xe2\x80\x99s especially interested in new voices and new talent.  It\xe2\x80\x99s no accident she\xe2\x80\x99s talking to so many people from the Obama orbit.  Joel Benenson, for example.  If she runs, this is going to be a different kind of campaign, from top to bottom.\n>  \n> 3)    On the record: \n>  \n> She is thinking through a decision and doing so with a big-tent approach that allows her to hear from lots of people across the Democratic party.  She wants to hear new voices and new ideas. She's using this time to look at bold new ideas for helping the middle class and what it would take to build an inclusive, thoughtful and technically advanced campaign, so that if she decides to run, she'll be ready.\n>  \n> When:\n> Next week probably makes the most sense, but after we have an agreed-upon plan in place we should reconvene early next week by email or phone and make a decision.\n> \n> \n> From: Philippe Reines <pir@hrcoffice.com>\n> Date: Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 8:32 PM\n> To: Cheryl Mills <cheryl.mills@gmail.com>, Robby Mook <robbymook2015@gmail.com>, Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com>, Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com>, John Anzalone <john@algpolling.com>, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>, Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com>, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>, NSM <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>, Jim Margolis <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com>\n> Subject: Re: Follow-up Media Call\n> \n> Robby, I agree with you about the next discussion needing to be about specific implementation. Towards that end, Nick will reply all with the memo he drafted \xe2\x80\x93 which has languished with me, not him.  I can do anytime tonight, but a 10pm call two years before Iowa seems a bit much \xe2\x80\x94 especially since there won\xe2\x80\x99t be anyone left to call us tomorrow, they all hit in one fell swoop this afternoon. So my suggestion is that everyone absorbs Nick\xe2\x80\x99s draft overnight, and Marissa Astor sets up a call tomorrow for tomorrow on the early side with the benefit of reading all these stories. Again though, I\xe2\x80\x99m free at 10pm if the group thinks we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait. Huma & Robby, entirely up to you.\n> \n> Since I procrastinated though, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just add here what I was going to incorporate: Yes HRC learned from 2008, as she has learned from every experience of her life. But we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let people forget that 2007 was eight years ago. She has had many experiences since and they have been part of the learning/growing process. So the question of what she will do in 2016 isn\xe2\x80\x99t without a basis to answer as if she\xe2\x80\x99s been in a coma since she last ran. Look at what she did for President Obama in the general. Look at how she handled his wanting her to join the cabinet. Look at how she did the job of Secretary of State. Look at what she has done since, particularly on the philanthropic front. She has made hundreds of policy, management and personnel decisions over that span, and by and large they\xe2\x80\x99ve turned out pretty well. \n> \n> If you want to know what someone is going to do, a good place to start is what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done. In 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014.\n> \n> \n> From: Robby Mook <robbymook2015@gmail.com>\n> Date: Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 8:16 PM\n> To: Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com>\n> Cc: Mandy Grunwald <GrunCom@aol.com>, John Anzalone <john@algpolling.com>, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>, Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com>, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>, PIR <pir@hrcoffice.com>, Jim Margolis <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com>\n> Subject: Re: Follow-up Media call\n> \n> Great--I just want something to react to because we have a rough strategy--I think we're in a good spot to talk next steps now.\n> \n>> On Tue, Jan 13, 2015 at 8:15 PM, Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com> wrote:\n>> I know PIR will weigh in shortly\n>>  \n>> From: Robby Mook [mailto:robbymook2015@gmail.com] \n>> Sent: Tuesday, January 13, 2015 8:04 PM\n>> To: Mandy Grunwald\n>> Cc: Huma Abedin; John Anzalone; Dan Schwerin; Joel Benenson; John Podesta; Nick Merrill; Philippe Reines; Jim Margolis\n>> \n>> Subject: Re: Follow-up Media call\n>>  \n>> Also, to be clear, are we reacting to a proposed plan of action or just discussing?  I would strongly prefer to react to something because we discussed strategy on our last call and at this point I would like to discuss implementation. There was agreement that we should shape likely leaks in the best light for HRC and supplement with bits of policy that show her focused on helping the MC.  I'd like to just move forward in that strategy.
