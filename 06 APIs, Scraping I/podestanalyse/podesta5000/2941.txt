john.podesta@gmail.comb'John --\n\nIn Washington, extreme Republicans are once again pushing to defund Planned Parenthood and dismantle a woman\'s right to make her own healthcare decisions.\n\nThe New York Times called these Republicans out for their "campaign of deception" and said in their editorial that these politicians "care nothing about the truth here, being perfectly willing to undermine women\'s reproductive rights any way they can."\n\nIf you\'re with us -- and want a new way forward that puts women, doctors, and access to healthcare ahead of politics, please sign this petition:\n\nhttp://act.NewWay4NJ.com/Planned-Parenthood\n\nWhen Governor Chris Christie defunded Planned Parenthood here in New Jersey, it forced the closure of health centers that provide cancer screenings, prenatal care, and birth control to working and middle-class women.\n\nAnd now, Governor Christie is bragging about this as he criss-crosses the country campaigning.\n\nNew Way for New Jersey will always defend a woman\'s right, together with her doctor, family and faith, to make her own healthcare decisions -- sign the petition:\n\nhttp://act.NewWay4NJ.com/Planned-Parenthood\n\nThank you, \n\nPhil \n\nPhilip D.
