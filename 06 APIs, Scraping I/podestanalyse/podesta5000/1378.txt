Otherwise, the message said, greedy insurance companies would increase premiums 39 percent and who could afford that?\n\nThe message came from Americans United for Change<http://www.americansunitedforchange.org/>, a group that was formed in 2005 to challenge President Bush\'s efforts to privatize Social Security. Until last year, the group was headed by Brad Woodhouse<http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Brad_Woodhouse>, who is now director of communications and research for the Democratic National Committee. Health care is now one of the liberal group\'s big issues.\n\nIs it true that insurers are trying to get premium increases of 39 percent?\n\nAnthem Blue Cross of California said it plans to increase premiums 39 percent on some of its customers this spring. An article in Health Care Finance News<http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/anthem-blue-cross-takes-additional-heat-over-39-percent-premium-increase> describes how Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius "questioned the steep premium increase in the face of reported 2009 fourth quarter earnings of $2.7 billion."\n\nThe article quoted her as saying: "As we continue the health insurance reform debate in Washington, this announcement reminds us that too many Americans can be left with unaffordable insurance each time the rates or rules change in the private market."\n\nI\'ve been hearing a lot about Anthem\'s proposal. But are other insurers jumping in to raise premiums? Are they trying to raise rates in case Congress passes health care legislation?\n\nSebelius issued a report saying similar increases are being seen around the country, despite healthy profits for insurers, according to the Associated Press<http://www.healthkey.com/a-z/health-reform/sns-health-obama-trend,0,7170272.story>. She issued a report that named five other states: Maine, Michigan, Connecticut, Oregon and Rhode Island.\n\nThe article said that the people targeted are "the most vulnerable," those who buy their insurance individually, rather than through an employer.\n\nI\'ve heard from a couple of groups in Austin who said they had to switch insurers or have their employees premiums that they considered to be unaffordable. It appears Texas is not exempt.\n\nThe health care legislation would require most people to have insurance and provide subsidies to those needing help buying it.\n\nPresident Barack Obama is now seeking an up or down vote on the legislation, according a New York Times article the Statesman published today<http://www.statesman.com/news/nation/obama-demands-up-or-down-vote-on-health-315363.html>. That article says that Sebelius will meet at the White House today with health insurance industry executives to spotlight the rate increases.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has said it does not expect premiums to go up - or to go up much - under the health care legislation. It seems that premium increases are a Democratic strategy to rally public support for the bill.\n\nPermalink<http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/health/entries/2010/03/04/group_using_robocalls_to_rally.html> | Comments (5)<http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/health/entries/2010/03/04/group_using_robocalls_to_rally.html#comments> | Post your comment<http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/health/entries/2010/03/04/group_using_robocalls_to_rally.html#postcomment> Categories: Health care reform<http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/health/entries/health_care_reform/>\n\nSCRIPT:\nI\'m calling from Americans United for Change.\nYou\'ve seen the news:  Individuals and small businesses will be hit by increases in health insurance premiums....as high as thirty nine percent!\nInsurance companies deny our claims, drop us when we\'re sick, and pay their CEOS huge bonuses -- now they want a thirty-nine percent increase!  That\'s just greedy.  Who can afford such huge increases?\nSend Congress a message:  Enough of this greed.    It\'s time to stand up to health insurance companies.  Pass health care reform.  Call Congress at 202-225-3121.\n\n\n________________________________________\nJeremy J.
