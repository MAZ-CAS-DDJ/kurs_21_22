Just a head's up that Markey and four Senate colleagues, including Sanders, sent a letter to the DOJ and FCC calling for higher scrutiny of the Charter-Time Warner deal.  It's not a surprising development, and we don't anticipate the letter getting much play, but it could come up on your end given Sanders' involvement.  Please keep us in the loop if it becomes an issue for you. Happy to get you or someone on your team more information if need be. Much appreciated.\n\nMany thanks,\nAndy\n\n\nAndy Spahn\nPresident\n\nGONRING | SPAHN\n100 Universal Plaza, Building 5121\nUniversal City, CA 91608\nTele: 818-733-7336  Fax: 818-733-7329\nTwitter: @andyjspahn\nwww.gonringspahn.com<http://www.gonringspahn.com/>\n\n\n"
