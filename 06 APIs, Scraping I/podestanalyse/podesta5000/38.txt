What a send-off for you:  glowing articles, and\ndeservedly so.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been enjoying consulting, Brookings, and boards since I stepped down\nfrom USTR last year.\n\nI wanted to seek your advice on how I can be most helpful to the beginning\nof Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.  I understand economic and foreign policy briefings\nteams are getting organized to help keep her current and get out in front\non message.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a co-chair of the National Finance Council for Ready\nfor Hillary and ready to help there too.\n\nLooking forward to learning what I can do to help now, and to seeing you\nagain soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMiriam\n\n__________________________________\n*Ambassador Miriam Sapiro*\n*Principal | Summit Strategies *\n*Non-Resident Senior Fellow | Brookings*\nOffice: +1.202.362.1909\nMobile: +1.202.431.0635\nhttp://www.brookings.edu/experts/sapirom\n'
