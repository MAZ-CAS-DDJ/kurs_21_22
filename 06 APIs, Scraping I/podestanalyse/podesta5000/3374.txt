Early voting has already started.\nNow under heavy fire on TV for his participation in a prostitution ring, something he admitted only elliptically to in 2007, Vitter is up today with a television ad that shows him sitting with his wife and kids around a kitchen table.\n&#8220;Fifteen years ago, I failed my family but found forgiveness and love,\xe2\x80\x9d the senior senator says to camera. \xe2\x80\x9cI learned that our falls aren\xe2\x80\x99t what define us, but rather how we get up, accept responsibility and earn redemption. Now Louisiana has fallen on hard times \xe2\x80\xa6 And as your governor, I&#8217;ll get up every day to fight for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Watch:\n\nThis comes in response to Democrat John Bel Edwards going on the air over the weekend with the most provocative attack ad of the year. A female narrator notes that Edwards served as an Army Ranger in the 82nd Airborne Division before noting that Vitter missed a 2001 House vote honoring 28 slain soldiers at roughly the same time that he took a call on his cell phone from the D.C. Madam.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cDavid Vitter chose prostitutes over patriots,\xe2\x80\x9d a female narrator says. \xe2\x80\x9cNow the choice is yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Watch:\n\nVitter got just 23 percent in last month\xe2\x80\x99s jungle primary. [In Louisiana, all the candidates square off on the same ballot and then the top two finishers face each other in a runoff a few weeks later.] Republican Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne, one of Vitter\xe2\x80\x99s opponents, endorsed the Democrat last week. The other Republican in the race, Scott Angelle, has refused to endorse Vitter and kept a low profile.\nFunny: The initial title for the Vitter ad was \xe2\x80\x9cHard Times.\xe2\x80\x9d After getting mocked\xc2\xa0on social media because of the connotations,\xc2\xa0the campaign changed it\xc2\xa0on YouTube to \xe2\x80\x9cDifficult Times.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCan Vitter overcome this? Did the hooker attack go too far?\xc2\xa0Vitter is underwater, viewed more unfavorably than favorably. The redemption play is part of a broader strategy to increase his positives. He needs to get more Republicans to like him in order to win.\xc2\xa0Comparing the ad to Jack Conway\xe2\x80\x99s Aqua Buddha spot against Rand Paul, Republicans call it desperate. Democrats say you can\xe2\x80\x99t rest on your lead in a red state like Louisiana and argue that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of questions Vitter has still never answered about the scandal.\nTo be sure, Vitter has a clear path to victory in the deep-red Pelican State, which hasn&#8217;t elected a Democrat statewide since 2008. The president remains toxically unpopular in the state (his approval rating is in the low 30s). While Edwards acknowledges voting for Obama, it\xe2\x80\x99s a much harder sell to tie him to\xc2\xa0Obama than it was with Mary Landrieu in last year\xe2\x80\x99s Senate race.\nOne reason Landrieu got crushed so badly last year was that her bottom fell out with whites, especially pro-life Catholics. Exit polls showed that one in five white voters supported her reelection. Edwards, who opposes abortion rights, has been faring well among these voters in the polls. About a third of the electorate could be African-American, which gives Democrats a natural base to build from.\nOutgoing Gov. Bobby Jindal is not popular back home, which in theory makes him a drag on Vitter, but it is widely known inside the state just how much the two guys despise each other. That makes it hard for Dems to link them.\nWe should still be a little bit cautious about handicapping. The polls were wrong ahead of last week\xe2\x80\x99s off-year election in Kentucky. Not a single survey showed Republican Matt Bevin in the lead, yet he won by 9 points. Larry Sabato\xe2\x80\x99s outfit, the University of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s Center for Politics, moved the contest yesterday from Leans Republican to Toss-Up.\xc2\xa0Louisiana State University plays Ole Miss, on the road, at 3:30 the Saturday of the runoff, which could dampen turnout.\nA debate tonight could be pivotal. Edwards and Vitter will go at each other mano a mano for the first time. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe the gloves will be off,\xe2\x80\x9d Edwards told the New Orleans Advocate. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be entertaining for a lot of folks.\xe2\x80\x9d You can watch a livestream of the 7 p.m. Central/8 p.m. Eastern debate here.\nIf Vitter loses next week, there is buzz among Republicans in Louisiana and Washington that he would NOT run for reelection to the Senate in 2016. A loss in the gubernatorial contest would open him up to a serious GOP challenger, and it would be much harder to hit up the donors who have spent this year funding his campaign. Vitter only had $26,216 in his federal campaign account at the end of September.\nDemocratic candidate for governor John Bel Edwards, left, speaks after Republican Lt. Gov.

The U.S. Appeals Court for the 5th Circuit of New Orleans blocked implementation of Obama&#8217;s action to allow children who entered the U.S. illegally to stay, and to permit immigrant parents of U.S. citizens to apply for work permits. Immigration advocates hope the administration will appeal quickly to the Supreme Court, in time for a June ruling. (David Nakamura)\nBen Carson at the last debate (Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images)\n&#8211;Ben Carson remains the most popular candidate among Republicans, despite persistent questions about his statements, a new Washington Post/ABC News poll\xc2\xa0reveals this morning.\xc2\xa0Seventy-one percent of Republicans view Carson favorably, as do 50 percent of Americans. He&#8217;s followed by Donald Trump, who posted a 68 percent favorability rating among GOPers. But Carson&#8217;s edge is in how intensely he is liked by GOP voters &#8212; 39 percent have a &#8220;strongly favorably&#8221; view of him compared to 26 percent for Trump. The poll was conducted last Wednesday through Sunday, meaning it didn&#8217;t capture the tail end of the furor surrounding Carson&#8217;s biography.\xc2\xa0 Marco Rubio is the only other GOP candidate not underwater with all Americans in terms of how much they like him &#8212; 41 to 37 percent.

Quick debate preview\xe2\x80\x94\nDo facts still matter? Will candidates get away with just making stuff up again? Raising the curtain on tonight\xe2\x80\x99s debate in Milwaukee, Jenna Johnson and David A. Fahrenthold note that the outsider candidates are copying Donald Trump in shamelessly and constantly fibbing. \xe2\x80\x9cAs Trump has become the defining character of this Republican presidential primary contest, the race itself has seemed to take on elements of his personality \xe2\x80\x94 in particular, his aggressive, seemingly shameless rejection of the idea that he has ever been wrong. The influence is especially strong in Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson, the two other political outsiders, who have risen in Trump\xe2\x80\x99s slipstream. All three will be onstage Tuesday evening for the fourth televised GOP debate. As with Trump, some of these outsiders\xe2\x80\x99 most memorable debate moments have come when they uttered statements that turned out to be exaggerated or untrue. And, like Trump, they have played to a distrustful electorate by criticizing the fact-checkers and refusing to acknowledge that any facts were wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d The story has some great examples.\nComing attractions \xe2\x80\x93 The New York Times reports that Bush allies, including the super PAC, are threatening to go nuclear on Rubio. Shockingly, one of the issues they might attack him on is abortion. \xe2\x80\x9cThe cash-rich group aiding Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s White House run has filmed a provocative video casting his rival Rubio as ultimately unelectable because of his hard-line stand against abortion,\xe2\x80\x9d Maggie Haberman and Michael Barbaro report. \xe2\x80\x9cThat group, which has raised more than $100 million, has asked voters in New Hampshire how they feel about Mr. Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s skipping important votes in the Senate. And the group\xe2\x80\x99s chief strategist has boasted of his willingness to spend as much as $20 million to damage Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s reputation and halt his sudden ascent in the polls, according to three people told of the claim. Seething with anger and alarmed over Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s rise, aides to Bush and his allies are privately threatening a wave of scathing attacks on his former prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 in the coming weeks, in a sign of just how anxious they have become about the state of Bush\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRubio campaign manager Terry Sullivan quickly capitalized on the story by e-mailing their fundraising list:\n&nbsp;\n\nWAPO HIGHLIGHTS:\nRoberts leaves his mark \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cChief Justice favors some when assigning court\xe2\x80\x99s major decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d by Robert Barnes: \xe2\x80\x9cJohn Roberts is a stickler for evenly distributing the workload of the Supreme Court, but he plays favorites among his eight colleagues when assigning the court\xe2\x80\x99s most important decisions. Not surprisingly, Roberts calls his own number more than anyone else\xe2\x80\x99s and assigns the second-highest number to Anthony Kennedy, the pivotal justice on the ideologically divided court, according to a new study by Harvard law professor Richard J. Lazarus. On the other hand, Roberts has never assigned Sonia Sotomayor the court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in a major case in her six terms on the court, Lazarus found, an omission that he wrote \xe2\x80\x98could be a bit portentous.\xe2\x80\x99 In looking broadly at the chief justice\xe2\x80\x99s 10 years on the job, Lazarus found that Roberts hesitates in assigning big decisions to the court\xe2\x80\x99s most conservative and liberal members \xe2\x80\x94 Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas on the right, and Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the left.&#8221;\n&#8212; \xe2\x80\x9cObama and Netanyahu stress \xe2\x80\x98shared interests\xe2\x80\x99 at White House meeting,\xe2\x80\x9d by Steven Mufson and Ruth Eglash: \xe2\x80\x9cPresident Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House on Monday, and each said to the other what he most wanted to hear: Netanyahu declared that he still believes in a two-state road to peace, and Obama declared that he remains devoted to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security and nailing down a new military aid package. In a meeting that lasted just over two hours, the two sought to move beyond their rhetorical combat earlier in the year over the Iran nuclear deal. This was the 16th meeting between the two leaders since Obama became president, and it was their first conversation since July, when Obama called Netanyahu to announce the Iran nuclear deal hours after Netanyahu had called it a \xe2\x80\x98mistake of historic proportions.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n&#8212; \xe2\x80\x9cKentucky\xe2\x80\x99s newly insured worry about their health under next governor,\xe2\x80\x9d by Amy Goldstein: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was in Pikeville, Kentucky that Mindy Fleming handed a wad of tissues to Tiffany Coleman when she arrived, sleepless and frantic, with no health insurance and a daughter suffering a 103-degree fever and mysterious pain. An hour later, Coleman had a WellCare card that paid for hospital tests, which found that 4-year-old Alexsis had an unusual bladder problem. Such one-by-one life changes are the ground-level stakes ushered in by the election last week of businessman Matt Bevin as Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s next governor. The second Republican elected to the office in 48 years, he wrapped his campaign around a pledge to dismantle Kynect, the state\xe2\x80\x99s response to the federal health-care law. If he follows through, the Bluegrass State would go from being perhaps the nation\xe2\x80\x99s premier ACA success story to the first to undo the law\xe2\x80\x99s results, razing a state insurance exchange and reversing its considerable expansion of Medicaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ\nCurated by Elise Viebeck (@eliseviebeck)\n&#8212; ZIGNAL VISUAL: Trump and Carson have dominated the chatter in the two weeks since the CNBC debate. Carson has struggled at times under the media klieg lights, while Trump has lost some of the media interest that he had during the summer. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s Ted Cruz, who continues to be at the back of the pack when it comes to mentions on television by the mainstream media but remains very strong on social media. Among all GOP presidential candidates, Cruz had just 6 percent of total\xc2\xa0broadcast mentions but 12 percent of social media mentions. The relative social media strength belies Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s outside popularity with the grassroots.
