Here are two more people I propose for our team::\n\n(1)  Sara Aronchik -- Sara worked with Jason and Austan in Chicago during the campaign.  She's a terrific young generalist who can help us on an unpaid basis.\n\n(2)  David Kamin - David is a budget specialist with whom Jason has worked extensively in the past; he was also helpful to Jason during the campaign.  He is back in school now, but was formerly at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (Bob Greenstein's center) and worked for Peter Orszag at CBO one summer.  He would help Jason with budget items.  I would propose we pay him at an annualized rate of $60,000.\n\nThanks.\n\nDan\n"
