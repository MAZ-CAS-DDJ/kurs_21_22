Times just reported that the DWP union SuperPAC behind Wendy Greuel\'s campaign wrote a single check and bought $500,000 worth of television commercials. That\'s what we\'re up against. Special interests with deep pockets, devoting the next 3 weeks to tearing down Eric. That\'s why we\'re fighting back from the grassroots.\n\nClick here to make a grassroots donation of $500 before Saturday night. <https://garcetti.ngpvanhost.com/crmapi/contribute/donate/050213>\n\nIf we can get to 1,000 grassroots donors by midnight Saturday, we\'ll send a strong message: We don\'t need special interest money when we\'ve got people on our side. "":https://garcetti.ngpvanhost.com/crmapi/contribute/donate/050213\n\nEric can\'t do this without you. Donate $300, $500, $1300 or whatever you can, right now. <https://garcetti.ngpvanhost.com/crmapi/contribute/donate/050213>\n\nAlready this week, more than 350 people like you have invested in this campaign. Those donations are already at work, buying materials for phone banks, printing fliers, and spreading our message via TV and radio. This is what a grassroots campaign looks like, but we still have a long way to go.\n\nPlease give. <https://garcetti.ngpvanhost.com/crmapi/contribute/donate/050213>\n\nThank you,\nStephanie Daily Smith\nFinance Director\n\n\n-=-=-\nEric Garcetti- Los Angeles Mayor 2013 - Los Angeles, CA, United States \nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.
