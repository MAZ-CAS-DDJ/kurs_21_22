john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear Health Law Colleagues,\n\nFirst, a quick note of congratulations to our 2014 Healthcare Compliance Certification Program Student Scholarship recipients, who represented their schools admirably:\n\n\n*         Srishti Miglani - Saint Louis University School of Law\n\n*         Yesenia Perez - DePaul University College of Law\n\nAlso, please note that the application deadline for the 2015 Healthcare Compliance Certification Program Student Scholarship for JD students is Friday, February 6, 2015.  You and/or your law school should have received a poster last fall detailing the eligibility requirements.  I have attached a copy of the scholarship rules to this email, and encourage you to circulate it to your most promising health law students.\n\n2015 scholarship applications may be submitted via email to HealthLaw@shu.edu<mailto:HealthLaw@shu.edu>, and you can also contact me at 973-642-8190 with any questions.\n\nUp to two scholarships (each a $2,400 value) will be awarded in 2015 for the Healthcare Compliance Certification Program in Newark, New Jersey, and up to one scholarship ($2,500 value) will be awarded in 2015 for the Life Sciences Compliance Program in California.  Scholarship recipients must be able to attend the U.S. Healthcare Compliance Program taking place June 8-11, 2015, at Seton Hall Law School, or the Life Sciences Compliance Program in February/March 2016, as awarded.  Please note that travel, transportation, and hotel costs are not included.  Please also note that for the Life Sciences Compliance Program award, preference will be given to nominees currently attending law school in the Western United States.\n\nCurrent JD students who do not receive the scholarship may opt to take the course for two credits (subject to individual school approval).\n\nMany thanks,\n\nAmy Cattafi, JD\nDirector, Healthcare Compliance Certification Program\n[cid:image001.png@01CE7CD5.A4728550]\nOne Newark Center\nNewark, NJ 07102\nph: 973.642.8190<tel:973.642.8863>\nlaw.shu.edu/compliance\n\n[Seton Hall Law on Facebook]<https://www.facebook.com/setonhalllaw>[Follow us on twitter]<http://www.twitter.com/setonhalllaw>[Connect on LinkedIn]<http://www.linkedin.com/>[See our photos on Flickr]<http://www.flickr.com/photos/shulaw>[Seton Hall Law on Instagram]<http://instagram.com/setonhalllawadmissions?ref=badge>\n\n'
