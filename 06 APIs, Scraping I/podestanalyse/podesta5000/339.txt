john.podesta@gmail.comb'In advance of tomorrow\'s House GOP economic roundtable, we assembled brief biographies of the leading participants\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s like a who\'s who of advocates and architects of the Bush administration\'s disastrous economic policies.\n\nWho Is Sitting At The GOP\xe2\x80\x99s Economic Roundtable?<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/12/02/gop-economic-council/>\n\nhttp://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/12/02/gop-economic-council/\n\nHouse Republicans, \xe2\x80\x9cpromising not to be flat-footed<http://thehill.com/homenews/house/70099-house-gop-looks-to-play-offense-on-jobs>on efforts to revive the economy,\xe2\x80\x9d are preparing what they\xe2\x80\x99ve called a \xe2\x80\x9cone-two punch<http://thehill.com/homenews/house/70099-house-gop-looks-to-play-offense-on-jobs>\xe2\x80\x9d this week, in an attempt to counter the jobs summit<http://www.rollcall.com/news/41016-1.html?CMP=OTC-RSS> that is being held at the White House tomorrow. With the CBO report yesterday showing that the stimulus package \xe2\x80\x94 derided by Republicans for months \xe2\x80\x94 has saved or created between 600,000 and 1.6 million jobs<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/12/01/cbo-jobs/>, the GOP is trying to roll out a jobs plan<http://www.heritage.org/press/events/ev120209c.cfm> that it can call its own.\n\nThe administration\xe2\x80\x99s summit will feature \xe2\x80\x9cmore than 100<http://www.rollcall.com/news/41016-1.html?CMP=OTC-RSS> business, union and nonprofit leaders and economists,\xe2\x80\x9d so House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-OH) has organized an parallel economic roundtable<http://www.rollcall.com/news/41016-1.html?CMP=OTC-RSS>, to provide a platform \xe2\x80\x9cfor economists who have a different perspective<http://www.rollcall.com/news/41016-1.html?CMP=OTC-RSS> on how Obama\xe2\x80\x99s agenda has affected the economy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo who is the GOP betting on to design policies adequate for combating the effects of the great recession? Mostly former Bush administration and McCain campaign staffers, who have advocated disastrous tax and budget policies. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a rundown:\n\nBush Tax Cut Architect Larry Lindsey: Lindsey was Director of the National Economic Council under President George W. Bush, and Bush\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclosest economic adviser<http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/dec/16/usa.uselections2000>.\xe2\x80\x9d Lindsey was the architect of the Bush tax cuts<http://money.cnn.com/2002/12/06/news/oneill/>, which he characterized as an \xe2\x80\x9cinsurance policy<http://reason.com/archives/2001/02/08/boom-bust-whatever>\xe2\x80\x9d against a recession. He responded to charges that the cuts overwhelmingly favored the wealthy by saying \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9dI don\xe2\x80\x99t think thatjealousy is what matters<http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1295/is_4_65/ai_72686614/?tag=content;col1> to the American people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDeficits Double-Talker Douglas Holtz-Eakin: Despite being a former CBO Director, during the campaign, Holtz-Eakin repeatedly asserted that McCain\xe2\x80\x99s economic plans would balance the budget<http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601070&sid=a72L7_AJ5P9c>(which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/05/15/mccain-deficit/>) and that McCain would cut taxes for everybody<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/10/15/dhe-taxes-everbody/>in America (also not true<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/10/15/dhe-taxes-everbody/>). Since leaving the campaign trail, he has been pushing the absurd notion that repealing the estate tax<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/08/05/bloomberg-dhe/>would create millions of jobs<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/06/10/dhe-estate-tax/>.\n\nKevin \xe2\x80\x9cDow 36,000\xe2\x80\xb3 Hassett: Hassett was chief economic adviser<http://www.politico.com/arena/bio/kevin_a_hassett.html>for McCain\xe2\x80\x99s 2000 presidential bid, and advised both<http://www.politico.com/arena/bio/kevin_a_hassett.html> the Bush \xe2\x80\x9804 and McCain \xe2\x80\x9808 campaigns. He is best known for penning the 1999 book Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting from the Coming Rise in the Stock Market, which predicted a huge surge in stock prices. As of last night, the dow stood at 10,485<http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/stocks/market-update-wednesday-dec-2-2009-20352/>, after falling below 7,000<http://money.cnn.com/2009/03/02/markets/markets_newyork/index.htm> for a time.\n\nDiana \xe2\x80\x9cNo Recession\xe2\x80\x9d Furchtgott-Roth: In December 2007, when the U.S. wasalready in a recession<http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/01/news/economy/recession/index.htm>, Furchtgott-Roth penned a piece saying that it was unlikely<http://www.american.com/archive/2007/december-12-07/the-great-recession-of-2008> that a U.S. recession would occur. She also claims that medical bankruptcy is a \xe2\x80\x9cmyth<http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2009/07/30/the_medical_bankruptcy_myth_97335.html>,\xe2\x80\x9d despite the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cthe proportion of all bankruptcies attributable to medical problems has increased by 50%<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/06/04/78-percent-of-bankruptcy-filers-burdened-by-healthcare-expenses-had-health-insurance/>\xe2\x80\x9d since 2001.\n\nBudget-Buster Jim Capretta: Capretta was President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Associate Director<http://www.thenewatlantis.com/authors/james-capretta> of the Office of Management and Budget, and was the lead official <http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/nov/18/health-programs-have-history-of-cost-overruns//print/> on the budget-busting<http://www.forbes.com/2009/11/19/republican-budget-hypocrisy-health-care-opinions-columnists-bruce-bartlett.html>Medicare Part D plan.\n\nStimulus Critic Alex Brill: Brill served on President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Council of Economic Advisers<http://www.aei.org/scholar/123> and blasted both the stimulus package for not working<http://www.american.com/archive/2009/october/about-that-stimulus-the-shovel-wasnt-ready> (though it is<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/12/01/cbo-jobs/>) and President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s tax plan for raising taxes on the middle class<http://www.american.com/archive/2008/august-08-08/the-folly-of-obama2019s-tax-plan> (which it isn\xe2\x80\x99t<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/06/12/obamas-tax-plan-not-mccains-helps-americans-who-actually-need-it/>).\n\n\n###\n\n-----\nAdam Jentleson\nCommunications Director, Progressive Media\nCenter for American Progress Action Fund\najentleson@americanprogressaction.org<mailto:ajentleson@americanprogress.org>\najentleson (AIM)\n202-247-8614 (cell)\n\n\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
