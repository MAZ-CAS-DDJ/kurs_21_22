john.podesta@gmail.comb"Team, I'd love your thoughts on this draft for Friday's Wing Ding dinner in\nIowa.\n\nIt starts with the back-and-forth over our college plan and then goes to\nthe broader contrast, embodied by what was said and unsaid at the GOP\ndebate.  And, like at the Hall of Fame dinner, it includes a local hit on\nthe governor's veto, which remains a hot issue on the ground.\n\nI look forward to your feedback. (Also, if anyone has a funny email/server\njoke, please send it my way.)\n\nThanks\nDan\n"
