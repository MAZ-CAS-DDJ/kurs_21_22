On his desk he had two machines \xe2\x80\x93 one was a\nsecure state dept machine that handled secure material; the other was a\nlaptop he used for emails that he sent on an  unclassified system.\n\n\nWhen asked if he thought HRC\xe2\x80\x99s email situation was serious, he says he\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t answer. Two IG\xe2\x80\x99s working on it, FBI working on it. Best not to\ncomment.\n\n\n\n*Roundtable (Brokaw/Hugh Hewitt/Joy Reid/Kearns Goodwin): Discussion on new\nNBC/Marist poll on GOP #\xe2\x80\x99s  and Trump\xe2\x80\x99s disastrous interview with Hugh\nHewitt on foreign policy issues.*\n\n\n\n*Clip from Interview with Richard Trumka:*\n\n\nTrumka is asked what it would take for Labor movement to work hard for HRC\nand he says it all depends where she comes down on TPP, and that will\ndetermine whether people will work hard for her or just vote for her.\nTrumka also says Joe Biden has been a champion for working people his\nentire life. Biden and HRC both would be good presidents. (Trumka will be\nw/ Biden tomorrow).\n\n\n*Next, roundtable discusses new poll #\xe2\x80\x99s. *\n\n\nChuck says we did Andrea interview in part b/c her polls are tanking.\nHighlighted new polls.\n\n\nMoved to inevitability discussion. Brokaw reminds everyone how important\norganizing is to wining IA, so polls are less significant in caucus states.\nSays HRC made huge mistakes in Andrea interview, saying he was \xe2\x80\x9cstunned\xe2\x80\x9d\nHRC said she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t think about her email construct when she entered the\nState Department. Says that takes away from big argument that she has\nintegrity.\n\n\nChucks  says we\xe2\x80\x99re now moving into an electability problem. New poll shows\nBiden runs stronger against Trump and Jeb. Kearns Goodwin says hard for HRC\nto keep saying \xe2\x80\x9cin time the email situation will be clear\xe2\x80\x9d  b/c she\xe2\x80\x99s lost\ntime and integrity and says she has to address this issue more aggressively\nthan she already has. DKG also says many are supporting Sanders b/c they\nwant to be part of a \xe2\x80\x9cmovement\xe2\x80\x9d - and they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel there is a movement\nw/ HRC \xe2\x80\x93 lack of energy amongst women and girls.\n\n\nJoy Reid reminds panel Biden doing ok in polls b/c he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been attacked\nyet by the media the way HRC/other candidates have. Says HRC needs more\nenergy and more excitement among women. Maybe Biden getting in energizes\nHRC\xe2\x80\x99s supporters.\n\n\nChuck says as bad as her poll #s are, Republicans would love to have them.\n\n\nHewitt says an even bigger problem for HRC moving forward will be Syrian\ncrisis; Chuck says he thinks her separation from POTUS on how she would\nhave handled Assad regime was most overlooked news of Andrea interview.\n\n-- \n\nAdrienne K.
