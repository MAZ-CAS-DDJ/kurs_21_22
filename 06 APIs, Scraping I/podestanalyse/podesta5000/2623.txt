However most of  the very big donors -- the fikes, louise gund, ann earhardt, vincent mai, reiner beewkes, the halls etc won't be included since they are givers and not raisers.  I wanted to see how you would feel about doing a dinner for 25 people or so (all 100k funders(only of cap and pa if you would like)).\n\n\n\nI think given the cattle call most other events will be it would be super nice for them and good for you.   If it were 30 people at $100 per person it wouldn't cost more than $5000 and I could definetly find an underwriter\n\n\n\nI will send you a list later in the day of people I think we could invite.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n\n\nMP\n\n"
