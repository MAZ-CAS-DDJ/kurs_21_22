They had not and at that time, Wendy didn't want any. One of our key questions related to turnover especially since TFA provided inadequate training time, especially in class management, which meant that if many left after 2 or 3 years, they would be leaving before they would start to be effective. Their refusal to permit evaluations was a big factor in not supporting them. \n\nhttp://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-09/most-teach-for-america-instructors-plan-to-flee-teaching\n\n\nSent from my iPad"
