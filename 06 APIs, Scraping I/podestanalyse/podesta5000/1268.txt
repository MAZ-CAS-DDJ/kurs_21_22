john.podesta@gmail.comb'ABA New Book Release  \n\nOne Size Never Fits All: Business Development Strategies Tailored for Women (and Most Men) \nWomen are achieving equality in professional service firms by many metrics, but they are continuing to trail their male counterparts at the top leadership positions. In large part, this is due to a real inequality in the amount of business generated by female partners. Most firms continue to encourage the use of traditional business development strategies, but these strategies have failed women. Through her original research, detailed in the book, Dr. Arin Reeves discovered: \n\n--women often are more successful in the early stages of business development (networking, establishing relationships) \n--women are blocked in many ways from closing the sales and reaping the benefits \n--why most women (and also most men) fall prey to this flaw in the traditional business development approach \n\nThis important resource offers a series of alternative approaches that both firms and individual professional women can adopt and institute in their business development strategies. Reeves\'s research and solutions are groundbreaking, and have the potential to revolutionize business development for women--and with it, to finally propel women to the top of firms in numbers equal to their male counterparts. \n  \n \n$34.95  List Price  \n$29.95  ABA Member  \nBy Arin N.
