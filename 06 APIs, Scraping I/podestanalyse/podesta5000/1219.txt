The road ahead will be long; our climb \nwill be steep; we may not get there in one year or even in one term. But, America, \nI have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise \nyou, we as a people will get there. ... but there\'s so much more to do."\n\nEveryone should be proud of what we\'ve accomplished since then, but as the \nPresident said, there\'s so much more to do. What happens on November 6th, \n2012, is up to us.\n\nCommit to volunteer:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Commit-to-Volunteer-for-2012g\n\nThanks,\n\nMessina\n\nJim Messina\nCampaign Manager\nObama for America\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Obama for America\n\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo update your address, go to: http://www.barackobama.com/change-address?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscription\n\n'
