john.podesta@gmail.comb'The below is a note from a new book group started by members of this list, Progressive Exchange, Progressive Communicators of Washington, D.C. and other progressive lists.  If you\'d like to join us for our April or May meetings or want more information, please email khartwich@hotmail.com<mailto:khartwich@hotmail.com>.\n\nWe have chosen books for the next two months.  For April we\'ll read the hot new tale of the financial/economic crisis, THE BIG SHORT: Inside the Doomsday Machine by Michael Lewis.  Lewis has written eminently readable books about challenging subjects before and early reviews are that he\'s managed to make economics and finance interesting even for those of us who loathe the topic (review below).\n\nAnd for May we\'ll read Desert Queen, The Extraordinary Life of Gertrude Bell: Adventurer, Adviser to Kings, Ally of Lawrence of Arabia By Janet Wallach.  I understand this is a gripping, insightful story, not only of a person, but of a region and of the political happenings of an age (review below).\n\nOnce a room is confirmed, we\'ll send a note about date, time and location, but we will generally shoot for 1pm on the third Thursday of the month (please pencil in April 15 and May 20).  And please feel free to let friends or colleagues know about our little reading and discussion group.\n\n\nDesert Queen, The Extraordinary Lifeof Gertrude Bell: Adventurer, Adviser to Kings, Ally of Lawrence of Arabia\nBy Janet Wallach\n\n\nReview by Robert C. Jones\nWhen members of London\'s Royal Geographical Society gathered on the evening of April 4, 1927 -- less than a year after her death -- to pay her tribute, everyone seemed to agree that Gertrude Bell had been "the most powerful woman in the British Empire in the years after World War I."\n\nBorn July 14, 1868, the cherished and brilliant daughter of the brilliant and admired Hugh Bell, Gertrude Bell grew up surrounded by the highest examples of "morality, self-discipline and hard work." Despite this fairy-tale environment, adversity tempered her character. At the age of three she had lost her mother; at 25 she had lost her fiance, Henry Cadogan. In January 1900, after five years of restless wandering, she arrived in Jerusalem to study Arabic, "her goal to enter the Arab world."\nFor the rest of her life, Gertrude Bell\'s destiny and fortunes would be linked with the Middle East. Although her personal life shriveled into spinsterhood and her professional life proved to be a lonely path, the Arabs made her one of their own. She became a famous author, an acknowledged archaeologist, a daring traveler dressed in extravagant clothes who penetrated dangerous regions of the Arabian desert.\n\nDuring World War I, the Victorian adventurer became the only woman to earn the grade of Political Officer -- and after the Great War, the only woman to be named to the post of Oriental Secretary. Her experiences -- among them, six long desert treks -- made her a formidable expert, more knowledgeable about the personalities and politics of the Arabs in Northern and Central Arabia than anyone else.\n\nThe Cairo Conference of 1921 underscored the importance of Gertrude Bell\'s contributions to, and influence on, the political and economical status of the post-World War I Middle East. As Janet Wallach comments: "The meeting had gone almost exactly according to Gertrude\'s plan. It was she who had set her sights on Faisal as King of the new Arab state [of Iraq]; it was she who had fought to include the vilayhets of Basrah, Baghdad and Mosul, and to embrace Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds; it was she who had decided the borders and drawn the lines in the sand around Iraq. All that she had envisioned was beginning to take shape." As if to confirm that vision, King Faisal himself had told her, with a kind of loving respect, "You\'re an Iraqui. You\'re a Bedouin."\nBut that high water mark was also the turning point in Gertrude Bell\'s life. As the new Arab state took on its own momentum, her influence and importance became less. In early summer of 1926, she wrote, "One has the sharp sense of being near the end of things with no certainty as to what, if anything, one will do next. . . . It is a very lonely business living here now."\n\nOn Sunday, July 11, 1926, three days before her 58th birthday, Gertrude Bell took an extra dose of the sleeping pills on her nightstand, turned out the light, and fell into a deep sleep from which she never awoke.\n\nGertrude Bell first came to Janet Wallach\'s attention more than 20 years ago, when Wallach was about to make her first visit to the Middle East. The intrepid Victorian woman\'s accounts of "journeying alone in the early 1900s, surrounded only by Arab men, speaking almost no English, sleeping in tents, riding camel or horse through dangerous regions, risking robbery and even death," Wallach writes, aroused her curiosity and won her admiration.\n\nDuring the Gulf War in 1991, when references to Gertrude Bell began appearing in newspapers, books, and periodicals, she seemed an ideal subject for a biography. "Little did I know," Wallach confesses, "just how marvelous a subject she would be." Marvelous, indeed! Desert Queen is more than just a fascinating portrait of an extraordinary person: it is also a thoughtful and intriguing study of how the past -- particularly in the Middle East -- continues to intrude upon the present. Desert Queen should be required reading, this political season, for anyone wishing information about and insight into the troubled and troublesome relationships between East and West.\n\n\nTHE BIG SHORT: Inside the Doomsday Machine    By Michael Lewis, (Review by Steve Pearlstein , Washington Post).\n\nIf you read only one book about the causes of the recent financial crisis, let it be Michael Lewis\'s, "The Big Short."  That\'s not because Lewis has put together the most comprehensive or authoritative analysis of all the misdeeds and misjudgments and missed signals that led to the biggest credit bubble the world has known. What makes his account so accessible is that he tells it through the eyes of the managers of three small hedge funds and a Deutsche Bank bond salesman, none of whom you\'ve ever heard of. All, however, were among the first to see the folly and fraud behind the subprime fiasco, and to find ways to bet against it when everyone else thought them crazy.\n\n    Nor would anyone -- including Lewis, I\'m sure -- claim this is an even-handed history that reflects the differing views of investment bankers, rating-agency analysts and industry analysts, all of whom he holds up to ridicule for their arrogance, their cynicism and their relentless incompetence.\n\n    In many ways, this is the same smart-alecky Michael Lewis who brilliantly exposed and skewered the ways of Wall Street 20 years ago in "Liar\'s Poker," written when he was fresh out of the training program at the once-mighty but now forgotten Salomon Brothers. But as he says in his introduction, those days of $3 million salaries and $250 million trading losses look almost quaint compared with the sums made and lost by the most recent generation of Wall Street fraudsters and buffoons.\n\n    What\'s so delightful about Lewis\'s writing is how deftly he explains and demystifies how things really work on Wall Street, even while creating a compelling narrative and introducing us to a cast of fascinating, all-too-human characters.\n\n    From their tales, we learn that Wall Street banks think nothing of stealing the trading strategies of their clients and peddling them to other customers. We learn that the investment bankers knew as early as 2006 about the rising default rate on subprime mortgages but engaged in elaborate ruses to hide that reality from ratings agencies and investors. We learn that when investor demand for subprime mortgages outstripped the supply, Wall Street filled the gap by creating "synthetic" mortgage-backed securities whose performance would mirror that of the real thing.\n\n    We learn that Goldman Sachs and other banks conspired to inflate the price of mortgage-backed securities well into 2007, even when they knew the true value was falling, only marking them down in value after their own hedging strategies were in place. And we learn that top executives were largely clueless about the risks their organizations were taking.\n\n    There is nothing subtle about the dark portrait Lewis creates of the financial community. Through his lens, all bond salesmen are out to cheat their customers, all top executives are clueless and all ratings analysts are second-raters who could not get jobs in investment banks.\n\n    Even discounting for its generalizations and exaggeration and limited frame of reference, however, "The Big Short" manages to give us the truest picture yet of what went wrong on Wall Street -- and why. At times, it reads like a morality play, at other times like a modern-day farce. But as with any good play, its value lies in the way it reveals character and motive and explores the cultural context in which the plot unfolds.\n\n###\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
