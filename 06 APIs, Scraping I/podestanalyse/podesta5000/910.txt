On this day, however, the Republicans in Congress seem very proud of themselves for voting to protect the profits of insurance companies that see absolutely nothing wrong with raising premiums as high as 75 percent.  They\'re patting themselves for siding with the big insurance companies over their constituents that went bankrupt<http://blogs.consumerreports.org/health/2009/06/health-care-bankruptcy-on-rise-medical-debt-medical-bills-how-to-avoid-bankruptcy.html> after they got sick and had their coverage rescinded.  They stood up unanimously for an industry that considers domestic violence<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/14/when-getting-beaten-by-yo_n_286029.html> or having had a C-section<http://www.americansunitedforchange.org/press/releases/new_tv_ad_to_get_insurance_first_get_sterilized/> to be "pre-existing conditions."  And many of the same Congressional Republicans that claim to be champions on issues of life chose to ignore the 45,000 Americans that die each year<http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/17/harvard-medical-study-links-lack-of-insurance-to-45000-us-deaths-a-year/> because they don\'t have insurance and can\'t get the care they need.\n\n"These Republicans made a different kind of history today by voting to deny giving the struggling families they represent access to the same kind of insurance they enjoy very much as members of Congress.  If it\'s good enough for them, shouldn\'t it be good enough for their constituents?\n\n"When the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is ultimately signed into law, it will be interesting to see how many Republicans campaign on a promise to repeal it and effectively strip 32 million Americans of their health coverage, roll back the ban on lifetime and annual insurance caps, restore the \'donut hole\' prescription drug coverage gap for seniors, kick young adults from their parents\' policies, take back the tax credits issued to families and small businesses in their districts, take the nation off a path towards reducing the deficit by $1.2 trillion<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/18/AR2010031801153_pf.html>, and undo the sweeping new protections for all Americans from the worst insurance industry practices."\n\n\n-30-\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
