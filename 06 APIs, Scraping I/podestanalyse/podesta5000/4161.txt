Her campaign announced the speech with a press release promising that Clinton would be offering an "economic vision" and a "framework for an economy that grows faster, fairer and more sustainably."\n\n\n\nGreece\'s Economy Is a Lesson for Republicans in the U.S.<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/opinion/paul-krugman-greeces-economy-is-a-lesson-for-republicans-in-the-us.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=opinion-c-col-left-region&region=opinion-c-col-left-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region&_r=0>\n\nNew York Times - Paul Krugman\n\nGreece has nonetheless played an outsized role in U.S. political debate, as a symbol of the terrible things that will supposedly happen - any day now - unless we stop helping the less fortunate and printing money to fight unemployment. And Greece does indeed offer important lessons to the rest of us. But they\'re not the lessons you think\n\n\n\nWhen Algorithms Discriminate<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/upshot/when-algorithms-discriminate.html?rref=upshot&abt=0002&abg=0>\n\nNew York Times - Claire Cain Miller\n\nThe online world is shaped by forces beyond our control, determining the stories we read on Facebook, the people we meet on OkCupid and the search results we see on Google. Big data is used to make decisions about health care, employment, housing, education and policing. But can computer programs be discriminatory?\n\n\n\nAn Income Tax on Carried Interest Couldn\'t Be Avoided<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/business/dealbook/an-income-tax-on-carried-interest-couldnt-be-avoided.html?ref=business>\n\nNew York Times - Victor Fleischer\n\nRevenue can drive the tax legislative process in the short run, but it is our values and ideals that shape tax policy in the long run. The best case for changing the tax treatment of carried interest has always been grounded in arguments about fairness and distributive justice, not revenue.\n\n\n\nA Living Wage for Caregivers<http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/organizing-for-the-right-to-care/?ref=opinion>\n\nNew York Times - David Bornstein\n\nOne-quarter of domestic workers are paid below the minimum wage, according to a national survey - with the average annual pay for all being just above $17,000. Few workers receive overtime. In Manhattan, health care and personal care are among the lowest paid occupations; only food preparers and servers do worse.\n\n\n\nUber is fighting a lawsuit that could upend its business<https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/07/09/uber-is-fighting-a-lawsuit-that-could-upend-its-business/>\n\nWashington Post - Cecilia Kang\n\nUber on Thursday struck back in a high-stakes class action labor lawsuit that could upend its business model built on low-cost freelance workers.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush Wants You to Work More, Whether You Like It or Not<http://www.newrepublic.com/article/122274/dont-believe-jeb-bushs-latest-walkback>\n\nThe New Republic - Brian Beutler\n\nThe real controversy arises not from the bloodlessness of the words he chose, but from the tactics he would use to extract the necessary labor.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush Was Right: Americans Need to Work Longer Hours<http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/jeb-bush-was-right-americans-need-to-work-longer-hours/>\n\nFiveThirtyEight - Ben Casselman\n\nJeb Bush\'s claim Wednesday that Americans "need to work longer hours" may have been bad politics, but he got the economics pretty much right.\n\n\n\nStretchy ends: The shape of income inequality<http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/social-mobility-memos/posts/2015/07/09-stretchy-ends-inequality-reeves>\n\nSocial Mobility Memos (Brookings Institute Blog) - Richard V. Reeves and Emily Cuddy\n\nThere are complex and contested relationships between inequalities of one kind and another-between, for instance, opportunity and outcome; earnings and income; income and wealth; wealth and political power; and so on. It is clear that inequalities overlap and reinforce each other. But it is less clear to what extent and with what implications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOya Aktas\n\nIntern\n\n\n\nWashington Center for Equitable Growth\n\noaktas@americanprogress.org<mailto:oaktas@americanprogress.org> | (918) 557-5014\n\n\n\n\n'
