No, not *that* Doris\nDay. The Doris Day who is married to Col. Bud Day, Congressional Medal of\nHonor recipient, fighter pilot, Vietnam POW and roommate of John McCain at\nthe Hanoi Hilton.\n\nAs we ate near the Days\' home in Florida recently, I heard things about Sen.\nMcCain that were deeply moving and politically troubling. Moving because\nthey told me things about him the American people need to know. And\ntroubling because it is clear that Mr. McCain is one of the most private\nindividuals to run for president in history.\n [image: [Getting to Know John Mccain]]AP Col. (Ret.) Bud Day with John\nMcCain at a campaign stop in Pensacola, Fla., in January.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a president, the American people want to know more\nabout a candidate than policy positions. They want to know about character,\nthe values ingrained in his heart. For Mr. McCain, that means they will want\nto know more about him personally than he has been willing to reveal.\n\nMr. Day relayed to me one of the stories Americans should hear. It involves\nwhat happened to him after escaping from a North Vietnamese prison during\nthe war. When he was recaptured, a Vietnamese captor broke his arm and said,\n"I told you I would make you a cripple."\n\nThe break was designed to shatter Mr. Day\'s will. He had survived in prison\non the hope that one day he would return to the United States and be able to\nfly again. To kill that hope, the Vietnamese left part of a bone sticking\nout of his arm, and put him in a misshapen cast. This was done so that the\narm would heal at "a goofy angle," as Mr. Day explained. Had it done so, he\nnever would have flown again.\n\nBut it didn\'t heal that way because of John McCain. Risking severe\npunishment, Messrs. McCain and Day collected pieces of bamboo in the prison\ncourtyard to use as a splint. Mr. McCain put Mr. Day on the floor of their\ncell and, using his foot, jerked the broken bone into place. Then, using\nstrips from the bandage on his own wounded leg and the bamboo, he put Mr.\nDay\'s splint in place.\n\nYears later, Air Force surgeons examined Mr. Day and complemented the\ntreatment he\'d gotten from his captors. Mr. Day corrected them. It was Dr.\nMcCain who deserved the credit. Mr. Day went on to fly again.\n\nAnother story I heard over dinner with the Days involved Mr. McCain serving\nas one of the three chaplains for his fellow prisoners. At one point, after\nbeing shuttled among different prisons, Mr. Day had found himself as the\nmost senior officer at the Hanoi Hilton. So he tapped Mr. McCain to help\nadminister religious services to the other prisoners.\n\nToday, Mr. Day, a very active 83, still vividly recalls Mr. McCain\'s\nsermons. "He remembered the Episcopal liturgy," Mr. Day says, "and sounded\nlike a bona fide preacher." One of Mr. McCain\'s first sermons took as its\ntext Luke 20:25 and Matthew 22:21, "render unto Caesar what is Caesar\'s and\nunto God what is God\'s." Mr. McCain said he and his fellow prisoners\nshouldn\'t ask God to free them, but to help them become the best people they\ncould be while serving as POWs. It was Caesar who put them in prison and\nCaesar who would get them out. Their task was to act with honor.\n\nAnother McCain story, somewhat better known, is about the Vietnamese\npractice of torturing him by tying his head between his ankles with his arms\nbehind him, and then leaving him for hours. The torture so badly busted up\nhis shoulders that to this day Mr. McCain can\'t raise his arms over his\nhead.\n\nOne night, a Vietnamese guard loosened his bonds, returning at the end of\nhis watch to tighten them again so no one would notice. Shortly after, on\nChristmas Day, the same guard stood beside Mr. McCain in the prison yard and\ndrew a cross in the sand before erasing it. Mr. McCain later said that when\nhe returned to Vietnam for the first time after the war, the only person he\nreally wanted to meet was that guard.\n\nMr. Day recalls with pride Mr. McCain stubbornly refusing to accept special\ntreatment or curry favor to be released early, even when gravely ill. Mr.\nMcCain knew the Vietnamese wanted the propaganda victory of the son and\ngrandson of Navy admirals accepting special treatment. "He wasn\'t\ncorruptible then," Mr. Day says, "and he\'s not corruptible today."\n\nThe stories told to me by the Days involve more than wartime valor.\n\nFor example, in 1991 Cindy McCain was visiting Mother Teresa\'s orphanage in\nBangladesh when a dying infant was thrust into her hands. The orphanage\ncould not provide the medical care needed to save her life, so Mrs. McCain\nbrought the child home to America with her. She was met at the airport by\nher husband, who asked what all this was about.\n\nMrs. McCain replied that the child desperately needed surgery and years of\nrehabilitation. "I hope she can stay with us," she told her husband. Mr.\nMcCain agreed. Today that child is their teenage daughter Bridget.\n\nI was aware of this story. What I did not know, and what I learned from\nDoris, is that there was a second infant Mrs. McCain brought back. She ended\nup being adopted by a young McCain aide and his wife.\n\n"We were called at midnight by Cindy," Wes Gullett remembers, and "five days\nlater we met our new daughter Nicki at the L.A. airport wearing the only\nclothing Cindy could find on the trip back, a 7-Up T-shirt she bought in the\nBangkok airport." Today, Nicki is a high school sophomore. Mr. Gullett told\nme, "I never saw a hospital bill" for her care.\n\nA few, but not many, of the stories told to me by the Days have been written\nabout, such as in Robert Timberg\'s 1996 book "A Nightingale\'s Song." But Mr.\nMcCain rarely refers to them on the campaign trail. There is something\nadmirable in his reticence, but he needs to overcome it.\n\nPrivate people like Mr. McCain are rare in politics for a reason. Candidates\nwho are uncomfortable sharing their interior lives limit their appeal. But\nif Mr. McCain is to win the election this fall, he has to open up.\n\nAmericans need to know about his vision for the nation\'s future, especially\nhis policy positions and domestic reforms. They also need to learn about the\nmoments in his life that shaped him. Mr. McCain cannot make this a\nbiography-only campaign \x96 but he can\'t afford to make it a biography-free\ncampaign either. Unless he opens up more, many voters will never know the\nexperiences of his life that show his character, integrity and essential\ndecency.\n\nThese qualities mattered in America\'s first president and will matter as\nAmericans decide on their 44th president.\n\n*Mr. Rove is the former senior adviser and deputy chief of staff to\nPresident George W.
