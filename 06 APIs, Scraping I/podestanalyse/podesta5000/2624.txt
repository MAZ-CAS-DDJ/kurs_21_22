Clinton called for State to expedite their release this week\n> in Iowa, saying "nobody has a bigger interest in getting [the emails]\n> released than I do."\n>\n> A congressional panel investigating the Benghazi attacks, meanwhile, has\n> had the emails related to Benghazi and Libya since February.\n>\n> Details of Clinton\'s email habits that have trickled out over the past few\n> months suggest she used email sparingly, mostly for logistics and to\n> forward information to aides. She\'s said previously that she was careful to\n> never use email to exchange classified information, and the initial batch\n> isn\'t expected to show otherwise \xe2\x80\x94 the highest classification of messages\n> was "sensitive but unclassified."\n>\n> On Thursday, the New York Times published a portion\n> <http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/22/us/politics/document-emails.html?_r=0> of\n> the emails relating to Benghazi, which include a handful from controversial\n> Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal tipping Clinton off to volatile conditions\n> on the ground in Libya, including one blaming the Benghazi attacks on an\n> anti-Muslim video, which he later walked back.\n>\n> The top Democrat on the Benghazi committee released a statement praising\n> the State Department\'s decision to release all of the emails pertaining to\n> the attacks at once and said they would vindicate Democrats\' assertion that\n> Clinton did nothing inappropriate in her response.\n>\n> "Instead of the selective leaking that has happened so far, the American\n> people can now read all of these emails and see for themselves that they\n> contain no evidence to back up claims that Secretary Clinton ordered a\n> stand-down, approved an illicit weapons program, or any other wild\n> allegation Republicans have made for years," Rep. Elijah Cummings said in\n> the statement.\n>\n> He added: "The Select Committee should schedule Secretary Clinton\'s public\n> testimony now and stop wasting taxpayer money dragging out this political\n> charade to harm Secretary Clinton\'s bid for president."\n>\n> But panel chairman Trey Gowdy vehemently disagreed, characterizing the\n> emails released as providing a selective and incomplete picture because a\n> team of attorneys working for Clinton chose which ones to send to State,\n> and saying "unresolved questions" still remain about Benghazi.\n>\n> "We will not reach any investigative conclusions until our work is\n> complete, but these emails continue to reinforce the fact that unresolved\n> questions and issues remain as it relates to Benghazi," he said.\n>\n> Gowdy said that to get a full picture, Clinton should turn over her\n> servers to a "a neutral, detached, independent third party for review."\n>\n> "The Committee\'s interest is in building a complete record from which the\n> final, definitive accounting regarding the terrorist attacks in Benghazi\n> can be provided. The best way to answer all questions related to the\n> attacks in Benghazi continues to be having access to the full public\n> record, not a "record" controlled, possessed and screened exclusively by\n> Secretary Clinton\'s personal lawyers."\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> *From:* Ian Sams [mailto:isams@hillaryclinton.com]\n> *Sent:* Friday, May 22, 2015 12:50 PM\n> *To:* Josh Schwerin; Tyson Brody\n> *Cc:* Christina Reynolds; HRCRR; Jennifer Palmieri; Kristina Schake; John\n> Podesta; Robby Mook; Huma Abedin; Cheryl Mills; Jake Sullivan\n> *Subject:* RE: CLIPS ON EMAIL RELEASE\n>\n>\n>\n> *Chad Pergram* <https://twitter.com/ChadPergram>\n>\n> @ChadPergram <https://twitter.com/ChadPergram>\n>\n> Schiff says Clinton email releases only makes "transparent" the\n> "motivation" to "attack the potential Democratic presidential nominee."\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> *From:* hrcrr@hillaryclinton.com [mailto:hrcrr@hillaryclinton.com] *On\n> Behalf Of *Josh Schwerin\n> *Sent:* Friday, May 22, 2015 12:46 PM\n> *To:* Tyson Brody\n> *Cc:* Christina Reynolds; HRCRR; Jennifer Palmieri; Kristina Schake; John\n> Podesta; Robby Mook; Huma Abedin; Cheryl Mills; Jake Sullivan\n> *Subject:* Re: CLIPS ON EMAIL RELEASE\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> *From:* Hoffman, Jennifer\n> *Sent:* Friday, May 22, 2015 12:38 PM\n> *To:* Hoffman, Jennifer\n> *Subject:* RELEASE: Cummings Commends State Department for Complying with\n> Democratic Request to Release Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Benghazi Emails\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> *For Immediate Release:*\n>\n> May 22, 2015\n>\n> *Contact:*\n>\n> Jennifer Hoffman/Paul Bell\n> 202-225-7100\n>\n>\n>\n> *Cummings Commends State Department for*\n>\n> *Complying with Democratic Request to*\n>\n> *Release Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Benghazi Emails*\n>\n>\n>\n> Washington, DC (May 22, 2015) \xe2\x80\x93 Today, Rep.
