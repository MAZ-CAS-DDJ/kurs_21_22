john.podesta@gmail.comb'\nIn yesterday\'s YouTube video posted by Marty Chalfie\n(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAr0MesBfXo), the 2008 Nobel Prize\nwinner in Chemistry, he referred to the fact that all three science\nLaureates for 2008 had endorsed Obama. Now it is official. From the\nObama campaign; "With one voice, 65 of the nation\'s greatest minds,\nthe largest number of Nobel Laureates to ever endorse a political\ncandidate for office, have encouraged the American public to vote\nObama on November 4th."\n\nThe updated Nobel letter of endorsement is here (\nhttp://sefora.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/nobel_letter4.pdf ).\nMarty Chalfie\'s YouTube video is here (\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAr0MesBfXo ).\n\nI have pasted the text of the letter below as well.\n\n-- \nMichael Stebbins, Ph.D.\nSEA Action Fund\n703-625-1512\nhttp://www.SEforA.org\n\nAn Open Letter to the American People\n\nThis year\'s presidential election is among the most significant in our\nnation\'s history. The country\nurgently needs a visionary leader who can ensure the future of our\ntraditional strengths in science\nand technology and who can harness those strengths to address many of\nour greatest problems:\nenergy, disease, climate change, security, and economic competitiveness.\nWe are convinced that Senator Barack Obama is such a leader, and we\nurge you to join us in\nsupporting him.\n\nDuring the administration of George W. Bush, vital parts of our\ncountry\'s scientific enterprise\nhave been damaged by stagnant or declining federal support. The\ngovernment\'s scientific\nadvisory process has been distorted by political considerations. As a\nresult, our once dominant\nposition in the scientific world has been shaken and our prosperity\nhas been placed at risk. We\nhave lost time critical for the development of new ways to provide\nenergy, treat disease, reverse\nclimate change, strengthen our security, and improve our economy.\n\nWe have watched Senator Obama\'s approach to these issues with\nadmiration. We especially\napplaud his emphasis during the campaign on the power of science and\ntechnology to enhance\nour nation\'s competitiveness. In particular, we support the measures\nhe plans to take \x96 through\nnew initiatives in education and training, expanded research funding,\nan unbiased process for\nobtaining scientific advice, and an appropriate balance of basic and\napplied research \x96 to meet\nthe nation\'s and the world\'s most urgent needs.\n\nSenator Obama understands that Presidential leadership and federal\ninvestments in science and\ntechnology are crucial elements in successful governance of the\nworld\'s leading country. We\nhope you will join us as we work together to ensure his election in November.\nSigned,\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
