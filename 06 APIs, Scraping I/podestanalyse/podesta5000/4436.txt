john.podesta@gmail.comb"John --\n\nI'd like to thank you for the warm welcome I've received as the newest member of this campaign.\n\nWhat you and Barack have accomplished over the past 19 months is incredible, and it's an honor to be part of it.  I'm looking forward to rolling up my sleeves and getting involved.\n\nI recorded a short video message about how I hope to help in the weeks ahead.\n\nPlease take a minute to watch the video and share it with your friends:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/bidenvideo\n\nOver the next few weeks, I'll be doing a lot of the things you've done to grow this movement -- reaching out day after day in neighborhoods all across the country, connecting with people who are hungry for the change we need.\n\nThis is no ordinary time, and this is no ordinary election.  I plan to do everything I can to help Barack take back the White House.\n\nI don't need to tell you that John McCain will just bring us another four years of the same. You can't change America when you supported George Bush's policies 95% of the time.\n\nBarack has the vision and the courage to bring real change to Washington.  But even he can't do this alone.\n\nJoin me by getting involved in your community -- and reach out to your friends and family to get them involved as well.\n\nPlease watch this video and pass it on:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/bidenvideo\n\nThank you,\n\nJoe\n\n\nDonate: https://donate.barackobama.com/wecan\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Obama for America\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscribe\n\n"
