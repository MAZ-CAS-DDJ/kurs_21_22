john.podesta@gmail.comb'President Clinton confirmed that he can present the Ansel Adams award to you on June 18. But... Jamie wants your advice on how to proceed / what to offer him:\n\n"I need to call Sen. Heinrich as he is not yet aware about Clinton coming.  I would like to get John\xe2\x80\x99s advice on whether I should ask Martin to introduce President Clinton, or say something at the reception, or just let him off the hook politely.  I had confirmed him to present the award (as I had not heard anything from the Clinton folks until yesterday), but this changes things of course."\n\nSince you have a meeting with him on Thursday, this is quite timely.
