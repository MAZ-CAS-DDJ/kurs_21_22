President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\ntrip followed a trip that Chelsea and then-First Lady Hillary Rodham\nClinton made the year before. In May 2000, he signed the African Growth and\nOpportunity Act (AGOA), which led to a new era of opportunity for African\ncountries by enabling deeper trade and investment ties. He also pushed for\nlarger and faster debt relief through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\n(HIPC) Initiative. Additionally, the Clinton Administration invested\nheavily in the global fight against AIDS and Tuberculosis. Since then,\nexports under AGOA have increased more than 500 percent, reaching $53.8\nbillion as of 2011.\n\nSince their initial trips, President Clinton and Chelsea Clinton have\ncontinued to build upon their longstanding commitment to Africa through the\nwork of the Clinton Foundation, providing investment, opportunity, and\nhealth access to underserved communities. In July 2012, both President\nClinton and Chelsea Clinton traveled to Africa to visit Clinton Foundation\nand CHAI projects in South Africa, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Uganda, and in\nOctober 2012, Chelsea visited Nigeria for the launch of the Nigerian\ngovernment\xe2\x80\x99s Save One Million Lives Initiative to reduce child mortality.\nIn 2013, President Clinton and Chelsea Clinton returned, visiting Clinton\nFoundation and CHAI projects in Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania (including\nZanzibar), Rwanda, and South Africa marking President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s ninth trip\nto the continent since leaving office.\n\n\n*PROGRAM VISITS \xe2\x80\x93 SUBJECT TO CHANGE*\n\nSome of the Clinton Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s work on this visit will include:\n\n*ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT*\n\nThe Anchor Farm Project is a commercial farm in Tanzania operated by\nthe *Clinton\nDevelopment Initiative (CDI).* Upon taking over, CDI introduced improved\nseeds, fertilizer, and liming, a spraying procedure that increases soil pH\nand fertility. Due to CDI\xe2\x80\x99s efforts, 1,000 acres of crop have been planted\nand are expected to produce 5-6 ton yields\xe2\x80\x94compared to the 30 acres that\nwere planted in the past.  CDI also restored and revamped all of the\nbuildings on the property. Additionally CDI also supports thousands of\nneighboring smallholder farmers by providing them with access to quality\ninputs for maize and soy production as well as training and market access.\nThe project\xe2\x80\x99s farmers have access to improved seeds and to training in\nadvanced agronomic techniques.\n\nMembers of the *Clinton Global Initiative (CGI)* have made 1,018\ncommitments that include Africa in their geographic scope and 498 that\ndesigned to help Africa exclusively. These have a total estimated value of\n$35.4 billion. The largest portion of these commitments is addressing\nglobal health and empowering women and girls. This trip will highlight\nseveral of these commitments including:\n\nThe Solar Sisters program which empowers women in Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria,\nand Uganda to be entrepreneurs. These women generate income by selling\nenvironmentally friendly products in their community, such as solar lights\nand cookstoves. Solar Sisters connects these women to training\nopportunities, and micro-financing groups to increase savings and\ninvestment.\n\nWings to Fly, a CGI Commitment to Action in Kenya, was launched in 2010 by\nEquity Bank Limited and the MasterCard Foundation. The commitment aims to\nbuild the financial capacity and entrepreneurship of youth and women\nthroughout the country. The program expands access to financial services to\nyoung people, ensures gender equity, and provides transformative leadership\ntraining. Since it was launched, Wings to Fly has provided 10,000 secondary\nstudents with training, with 98 percent of those students graduating\nsecondary school and 94 percent going on to college.\n\n*GLOBAL HEALTH*\n\nThe *Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI)* supports the government of\nTanzania in a program that procures the pneumonia and rotavirus (the\nleading cause of diarrhea) vaccines. The program has strengthened the\nsupply chain for these vaccines, and ensures that they are effective by\nkeeping them at the proper temperatures from delivery to health facility\nstorage.\n\nCHAI has been supporting the government of Liberia in combatting HIV/AIDS,\nimproving maternal and child health, and overall health system\nstrengthening for the past decade. They also provided integral support\nduring Ebola epidemic, including assisting the Ministry of Health in\nselecting and prioritizing items of the greatest need, placing orders for\nessential drugs to jumpstart essential health services, and coordinating\nsupply chains. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) also played a critical\nrole as they coordinated members for early support for Ebola, including\nsecuring the delivery of medical equipment and supplies.\n\n*EMPOWERING WOMEN & GIRLS*\n\nAt the 2014 CGI Annual Meeting, Secretary Clinton announced a Clinton\nFoundation collaboration of more than 30 companies, civil society\norganizations, multilaterals and governments to improve learning and\nleadership opportunities for young women and girls. This collective effort,\nCHARGE \xe2\x80\x93 Collaborative for Harnessing Ambition and Resources for Girls\xe2\x80\x99\nEducation \xe2\x80\x93 has committed over $600 million dollars to reach 14 million\ngirls over five years. In Kenya, President and Chelsea Clinton will visit a\nschool that is a part of the CHARGE initiative and lead a conversation on\nparticipation of women and girls globally, as part of the Clinton\nFoundation\xe2\x80\x99s *No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project.*\n\n*CONSERVATION*\n\nThe Partnership to Save Africa\xe2\x80\x99s Elephants is a CGI Commitment to Action\nlaunched in 2013 by Save the Elephants and other partners to prevent\nfurther elephant poaching by directly targeting the chief drivers of\npoaching. This commitment has facilitated anti-poaching enforcement in\nAfrica, supported efforts to crack down on international ivory markets, and\nraise awareness of the impact and risks of ivory sales to the survival of\nthe African elephant. A key component of the innovative technology Save the\nElephants created is a tracking system which uses GPS collars and\ntechnology to monitor elephants\xe2\x80\x99 hourly movements and uploads it into a\nsystem which can be accessed anywhere with internet access. This way they\ncan monitor if the elephant is moving too fast, which could indicate they\nare being chased by a poacher, or if they have stopped moving which could\nindicate injury or death. This technology has given Save the Elephants a\nmajor advance in terms of combating poaching.\n\n*SCHEDULE \xe2\x80\x93 SUBJECT TO CHANGE*\n\n****The following schedule is tentative and subject to change****\n\nPresident Clinton and Chelsea Clinton will visit the following projects.\nFor information about media access to these events please e-mail a request\nto press@clintonfoundation.org for assistance.\n\n*Tanzania: *Tuesday, April 28 through Thursday, April 30\n\n   - CDI anchor farm and smallholder farms visit\n   - CHAI vaccines program  \xe2\x80\x93 dispensary visit\n   - CGI commitment \xe2\x80\x93 Solar Sisters visit\n\n*Kenya: *Thursday, April 30 through Sunday, May 3\n\n   - No Ceilings women and girls\xe2\x80\x99 conversation \xe2\x80\x93 school visit\n   - CGI commitment \xe2\x80\x93 women and girls\xe2\x80\x99 leadership training center visit\n   - CGI commitment \xe2\x80\x93 elephant conservation and anti-poaching project visit\n\n*Liberia:* Monday, May 4\n\n   - CGI and CHAI work combatting the Ebola epidemic\n\n*Morocco: *Tuesday, May 5 through Thursday, May 7\n\n   - CGI Middle East and Africa Meeting\n\n*Information on Visas, Travel, and Accommodations*\n\nVisa information:\n\n*Tanzania*: Business visas for journalists can range in price for U.S.\nPassport Holders from $1,000 USD (standard rate) to $3,000 USD (expedited\nrate).
