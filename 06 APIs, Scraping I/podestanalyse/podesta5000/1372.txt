I am looking for a new direction to take\nmy career and I was wondering if you had any suggestions to help me move\nforward.  I have always been interested in the economics of politics and I\nknow that is an area of expertise of yours.  I have attached a copy of my\nupdated resume, please let me know if you have any ideas!\n\n\nThanks much,\n\nJohn Gabrielski\n"
