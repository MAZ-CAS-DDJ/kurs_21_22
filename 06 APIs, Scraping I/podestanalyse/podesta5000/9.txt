In some cases, the groups will be\nwrapping up their efforts while others are beginning to ramp up.\n\n\n\n"Everyone has a lane," said former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, the\nco-chair of Priorities USA Action and an adviser to Ready for Hillary. "We\nare going to work together and seamlessly so there\'s no infighting."\n\n\n\nReady for Hillary, which was founded in 2013, has signed up more than 1.5\nmillion people promising to help Clinton if she runs and has raised more\nthan $10 million to harness a grassroots community of volunteers for\nClinton. The group expects to fold if Clinton launches her presidential\ncampaign and then transfer its data and list of supporters to the former\nfirst lady\'s campaign.\n\n\n\nPriorities USA Action, a Democratic super PAC that raised $70 million in\n2012 to air tough ads targeting Republican Mitt Romney, has maintained a\nlow profile this year but is reconnecting with donors to prepare for next\nyear. Correct the Record, a rapid-response media organization that has\ndefended Clinton in her post-State Department period, expects to continue\nas a part of research arm American Bridge.\n\n\n\nThe gathering is not authorized by Clinton, who will be speaking at an\nevent in New York on Friday promoting the use of cook stoves in developing\nnations. But it will feature plenty of Democrats who have worked with her\nand her husband, former President Bill Clinton: ex-White House adviser\nHarold Ickes; Clinton campaign strategists James Carville and Paul Begala;\nJonathan Mantz, who served as Hillary Clinton\'s national finance director;\nand Karen Finney, a former Hillary Clinton campaign aide.\n\n\n\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor who backed\nClinton\'s presidential campaign, will speak at the meeting as a private\ncitizen, aides said.\n\n\n\nDonors will also hear from Democratic strategists who could play senior\nroles in a future Clinton campaign, including Guy Cecil, the executive\ndirector of the Senate Democrats\' campaign arm and a former Hillary Clinton\ncampaign aide; Stephanie Schriock, the president of EMILY\'s List; Ace\nSmith, a California-based Democratic strategist who directed Hillary\nClinton\'s 2008 primary campaigns in three states; and Mitch Stewart, a\nformer Obama campaign aide who has advised Ready for Hillary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Bloomberg: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton\'s Campaign-In-Waiting Grows Restless\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-11-21/hillary-clintons-campaigninwaiting-grows-restless>*\n\n\n\nBy Lisa Lerer and Julie Bykowicz\n\nNovember 21, 2014, 5:48 a.m. EST\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] The latest round of fundraisers highlights the breadth of\nClinton\'s support, and and a possible problem.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton is close to being ready. Now, she just has to find a way to\ntame the legions of loyalists who have been ready since their last\npresidential ride ended.\n\n\n\nThe complicated political machine known as Clintonland is revving its\nengine, as outside groups, top donors, and prospective aides begin\npreparing for an anticipated formal announcement of her presidential\ncandidacy early next year. In the coming week alone there will be a\nhalf-dozen fundraisers aimed at greasing the path toward her 2016 debut.\nSome events are aimed at scooping up checks for existing pro-Clinton\ngroups, while others will pocket financial "commitments" for a future\ncampaign account.\n\n\n\nThe main event is Friday\'s all-day donor gathering in New York City,\nfeaturing Clinton confidants from Arkansas to the State Department.  Next\nup, would-be campaign financiers are holding 30-person dinners in Newark\nand New York City. They\'re like traditional fundraisers\xe2\x80\x93all they lack is a\ncandidate.\n\n\n\nWhile people close to Clinton caution that no final decisions have been\nmade, they say the former secretary of state has shifted her focus from\npublic events and paid speeches to private conversations about the guts of\na campaign\xe2\x80\x93messaging, staff, money. Her goal, they say, is to launch with a\nfully formed political operation.\n\n\n\nThat would be difficult for any candidate, but that\'s particularly so for\none with the last name Clinton. Unlike President Barack Obama, who\'s known\nfor his tight circle of friends and advisers, the Clinton universe is a\nsprawling international club of foreign dignitaries, Hollywood stars and\nmoguls, former administration officials and Wall Street executives. The\nvastness worries some supporters, who fret that the hordes of people who\nconsider themselves close to the Clintons could complicate strategy. They\nwant to avoid a campaign besieged by unsolicited advice, competing\ninterests, and fierce rivalries. It\'s not so much a nightmare as a\nflashback to the 2008 primary.\n\n\n\nWithin months of Clinton leaving the State Department in 2013, four outside\ngroups declared themselves devoted to her potential candidacy and formed a\nsort of campaign-in-waiting, each with its own fiefdom. Priorities USA\nAction, the big-money super-PAC, plans to handle paid media. Emily\'s List,\na group that backs the campaigns of Democratic women who support abortion\nrights, started Madam President as an early effort to assess voter views on\nthe idea of a female president. Correct the Record, founded by Clinton\nbacker David Brock, has established itself as the research arm, publicly\ndefending her from Republican attacks. And Ready for Hillary, which has a\nlist of 3 million supporters to sell her campaign if she gets in the race,\nis the base camp for activists.\n\n\n\n"I felt like the rationale of grassroots support and building lists is a\nreally important lesson she learned from the last go-round," said Jennifer\nSelendy, a litigation partner at Kirkland & Ellis in New York, who donated\n$25,000 to Ready for Hillary. "If she gets into the race, I\'m sure I will\ncontribute."\n\n\n\nWhile the groups have tried to define separate missions, there\'s some\noverlap, including among major donors whose checks come with a fair number\nof opinions.\n\n\n\nAlready, Clinton\'s circle is engaged in an internal debate over when she\nshould formally announce her candidacy. Some argue that sooner is better,\nallowing her to maximize the time her campaign and supportive super-PACs\nhave to raise money for what\'s expected to be at least a $1 billion\nenterprise. Others\xe2\x80\x93friends, mostly\xe2\x80\x93say Clinton should take her time because\nthe moment she announces she\'ll be pounded with Republican attacks. Why\nwear the "Hit Me" sign any sooner than necessary?\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, Clinton emissaries are quietly reaching out to possible\nstaffers. And while political strategists in Washington have not quite\nstarted looking for housing in White Plains, N.Y.\xe2\x80\x93a city not far from the\nClinton home in Chappaqua, and therefore a potential headquarters\nlocation\xe2\x80\x93they\'ve begun speculating on the merits of living in New York City\nversus the suburbs.\n\n\n\nSeveral Clintonites are being eyed for senior positions. Robby Mook, who\nmanaged the campaign of longtime Clinton fundraiser and Virginia Governor\nTerry McAuliffe, is being considered as campaign manager. That possibility\nwas underscored by a preliminary strike against him from an opposing camp:\nthe leak of his private messages from a 150-member "Mook Mafia" email list\nhe ran with another Democratic operative.\n\n\n\nGuy Cecil, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign\nCommittee, is another name mentioned by people close to Clinton for\ncampaign manager or another top position. White House counselor John\nPodesta, a former chief of staff during President Bill Clinton\'s\nadministration, is on any short list. "If she runs, as I hope she will, I\nwill do whatever she asks me to do," he told Bloomberg\'s Al Hunt in an\ninterview on Charlie Rose. "I talk to her from time to time."\n\n\n\nWith the midterm elections over, Clinton\'s path to harness the Democratic\nParty is clear\xe2\x80\x93so far, no serious 2016 primary challengers are on the\nhorizon. Former Virginia Senator Jim Webb, who lacks the campaign skills\nand machine of the Clintons, opened an exploratory committee this week. A\nnumber of Obama\'s top aides have joined the organizations that will become\npart of her campaign apparatus, and at least a few top officials who\nrefused to back her eight years ago have already endorsed her candidacy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m frequently introduced as the highest-ranking woman in U.S. office; I\xe2\x80\x99d\nlike to give up that title. And soon,\xe2\x80\x9d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi,\nwho resisted endorsing Clinton in 2008, told a cheering crowd in San\nFrancisco last month.\n\n\n\nThe various components of the campaign-in-waiting now must decide their\nnext steps, including whether to continue to exist.\n\n\n\nPriorities USA Action officials are beginning to court big check-writers in\none-on-one visits. The super-PAC says it won\'t formally accept donations\nuntil Clinton announces. "We played a critical role in helping elect a\nDemocratic president in 2012 and we look forward to doing the same in\n2016," said Peter Kauffmann, a spokesman for the organization.\n\n\n\nReady for Hillary was designed to be different. Instead of hoarding piles\nof cash to unleash in a barrage of television ads, this group has existed\nsolely to cultivate a vast base of small donors for Clinton. It has spent\nnearly all of the $10 million it raised since two Clinton lifers set it up\nin January 2013. Once Clinton announces, Ready for Hillary plans to lease\nits list of supporters to the campaign and is likely to dissolve. No matter\nits future, Ready for Hillary served another purpose\xe2\x80\x93locking down\noperatives and showing off Clinton\'s dominance to potential rivals. The\ngroup also became a clearinghouse for surrogates such as Senators Mark\nWarner of Virginia, Chuck Schumer of New York, and Claire McCaskill of\nMissouri.\n\n\n\n"For people wondering when we\'re done, we\'re done if and when she runs,"\nsaid Tracy Sefl, an adviser to the group. "Right now, we\'re going to keep\ndoing the work and we\'re thrilled with what we\'re accomplishing."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Business Insider: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton Praised Obama\'s Big Immigration Speech\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-just-fully-endorsed-obamas-immigration-order-2014-11>*\n\n\n\nBy Colin Campbell\n\nNovember 20, 2014, 9:09 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton strongly endorsed\nPresident Barack Obama\'s executive action on immigration reform minutes\nafter his speech concluded Thursday night.\n\n\n\n"I support the president\'s decision to begin fixing our broken immigration\nsystem and focus finite resources on deporting felons rather than\nfamilies," Clinton said in a statement.\n\n\n\nClinton had previously avoided weighing in on the issue as it became\napparent the Obama planned to take executive action.\n\n\n\nIn her reaction to the president\'s remarks, Clinton agreed with Obama\'s\nclaim House Republicans forced him to unilaterally address immigration\nreform. The Senate, which is currently controlled by Democrats, previously\npassed an immigration bill that stalled in the lower legislative chamber.\n\n\n\n"I was hopeful that the bipartisan bill passed by the Senate in 2013 would\nspur the House of Representatives to act, but they refused even to advance\nan alternative. Their abdication of responsibility paved the way for this\nexecutive action, which follows established precedent from Presidents of\nboth parties going back many decades. But, only Congress can finish the job\nby passing permanent bipartisan reform that keeps families together,"\nClinton continued.\n\n\n\nClinton further urged the American public to take an even-keeled approach\nto the hot-button issue.\n\n\n\n"Our disagreements on this important issue may grow heated at times, but I\nam confident that people of good will and good faith can yet find common\nground. We should never forget that we\'re not discussing abstract\nstatistics \xc2\xad we\'re talking about real families with real experiences. We\'re\ntalking about parents lying awake at night afraid of a knock on the door\nthat could tear their families apart, people who love this country, work\nhard, and want nothing more than a chance to contribute to the community\nand build better lives for themselves and their children," she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*MSNBC: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton: GOP \xe2\x80\x98abdication\xe2\x80\x99 forced Obama\xe2\x80\x99s hand on\nimmigration\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-gop-abdication-forced-obamas-hand-immigration>*\n\n\n\nBy Alex Seitz-Wald\n\nNovember 20, 2014, 10:07 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nIn a rare public statement, Hillary Clinton said she supports President\nObama\xe2\x80\x99s new executive action on immigration, lamenting that Republicans\nforced his hand.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI support the president\xe2\x80\x99s decision to begin fixing our broken immigration\nsystem and focus finite resources on deporting felons rather than\nfamilies,\xe2\x80\x9d the former secretary of state and likely presidential candidate\nsaid Thursday evening. \xe2\x80\x9cI was hopeful that the bipartisan bill passed by\nthe Senate in 2013 would spur the House of Representatives to act, but they\nrefused even to advance an alternative. Their abdication of responsibility\npaved the way for this executive action.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRepublicans have called the action a dangerous usurpation of executive\nauthority. But Clinton, like her husband, said she thinks Obama\xe2\x80\x99s move\nfollows \xe2\x80\x9cestablished precedent from Presidents of both parties going back\nmany decades.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nObama\xe2\x80\x99s policy is expected to temporarily spare up to 5 million\nundocumented immigrants from deportation. The president announced the plan\nin a speech Thursday night, saying many immigrants could finally \xe2\x80\x9ccome out\nof the shadows and get right with the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton, like Obama, said Congress must \xe2\x80\x9cfinish the job by passing\npermanent bipartisan reform.\xe2\x80\x9d That should both keep families together and\nprotect the border, she added.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe should never forget that we\xe2\x80\x99re not discussing abstract statistics \xe2\x80\x93\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re talking about real families with real experiences. We\xe2\x80\x99re talking\nabout parents lying awake at night afraid of a knock on the door that could\ntear their families apart,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n\n\n\nLike most Democrats, Clinton has long supported immigration reform, and was\nin the White House when her husband took his own executive actions\nenforcing immigration laws. In the Senate, she voted in favor of overhaul\nsupported by President Bush that ultimately failed.\n\n\n\nDuring her 2008 presidential campaign, however, Clinton ran into some\ntrouble when she waffled on her position on giving drivers licenses to\nundocumented immigrants. This year, she\xe2\x80\x99s been confronted and heckled by\nDREAMers, young undocumented immigrants, at several events.\n\n\n\nThe fact that Clinton even put out a statement at all is notable. Since\nstepping down as secretary of state, she has kept a low profile and avoided\nweighing in on issues of the day unless asked about them \xe2\x80\x93 and sometimes\neven then dodging. She has been criticized, for instance, for not taking a\nstance on the Keystone XL pipeline and waiting to speak out on the events\nin Ferguson.\n\n\n\nThe quick, strong, and proactive response to Obama\xe2\x80\x99s speech Thursday is\nusual, and could signal a new paradigm as she gets closer to a potential\ncampaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Hill: \xe2\x80\x9cHouse Oversight chairman to put spotlight on Clinton, Benghazi\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://thehill.com/homenews/house/224902-chaffetz-plans-spotlight-on-clinton-benghazi#.VG5bS7rDkgI.twitter>*\n\n\n\nBy Cristina Marcos\n\nNovember 20, 2014, 4:15 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nThe incoming chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform\nCommittee plans to put the spotlight on Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with The Hill on Thursday in his Capitol Hill office, Rep.\nJason Chaffetz (R-Utah) set out a broad agenda that will include hearings\non embassy security in light of the September 11, 2012 attack on the U.S.\nconsulate in Benghazi, Libya that left four Americans dead.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecretary Clinton created a fiasco. And we\'re going to investigate it,\xe2\x80\x9d\nChaffetz said of the former secretary of State.\n\nBenghazi is now under the jurisdiction of a House select committee, but\nChaffetz indicated it is one of several issues spearheaded by outgoing\nOversight Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) that his panel will continue to\nmonitor \xe2\x80\x94 even as Clinton is expected to prepare for a 2016 White House bid.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour years of her reign at State is something that we\'re still going to\nhave to clean up and we have to address. We can\'t just ignore it,\xe2\x80\x9d Chaffetz\nsaid.\n\n\n\nChaffetz said probes of the Secret Service, the Justice Department\'s \xe2\x80\x9cFast\nand Furious\xe2\x80\x9d gun-tracing program and the Internal Revenue Service that\nbegan under Issa will be ongoing.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are investigations, obviously, that will continue,\xe2\x80\x9d Chaffetz said.\n\n\n\nChaffetz suggested his inaugural hearing as chairman could be on the\ncomments from ObamaCare consultant Jonathan Gruber that the healthcare law\npassed because of voter \xe2\x80\x9cstupidity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut he\'s also \xe2\x80\x9cleaving open the possibility\xe2\x80\x9d to a hearing early in his term\non President Obama\'s unilateral action to change immigration laws.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is on everybody\'s radar screen. I don\'t know if we would necessarily\nlead out on it, but we might,\xe2\x80\x9d Chaffetz said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are bigger, broader\nissues with immigration and securing the border that I\'m sure we will dive\ninto. No doubt about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nChaffetz said he thinks he can work effectively with Democrats and that he\nwants to avoid overtly personal confrontations that marred Issa\xe2\x80\x99s\nreputation.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\'t want things to get personal,\xe2\x80\x9d Chaffetz said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to be fair.\nI\'m not going to let up on my tenacity or my passion on getting to the\ntruth, but I ultimately want to be fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nChaffetz wants to hold hearings on the number of federal workers on paid\nadministrative leave, something he thinks can be a bipartisan issue.\n\n\n\nHe cited an example of an Environmental Protection Agency employee who was\nplaced on paid leave \xe2\x80\x94 but not fired \xe2\x80\x94 after he was caught viewing porn on\nhis computer for several hours a day.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can guarantee you we\'re going to have a hearing about the fact that\nthere are more than 4,000 people on paid administrative leave. Four\nthousand. We pay these people. It\'s like a paid vacation. That\'s not a\npartisan issue,\xe2\x80\x9d Chaffetz said.\n\n\n\nStill other potential hearings on Chaffetz\'s list would be on the use of\ninformation technology across the federal government, public lands, renewal\nof the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program and postal reform.\n\n\n\nWhile Democrats remain skeptical that Chaffetz will adhere to pledges to\ntake a different approach than Issa, the new chairman thinks he can improve\nrelations with the other sie of the aisle.\n\n\n\nFor one, Chaffetz said he\'ll try to be more judicious with subpoenas. Issa\ncame under criticism for issuing more than 100 subpoenas without the\nsign-off from the committee\'s ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings\n(D-Md.). At one hearing earlier this year, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen\ninsisted the subpoena was unnecessary given that he had willingly appeared\nbefore the House Ways and Means Committee just days earlier.\n\n\n\nSo far, Chaffetz hasn\'t heard from the Obama administration since winning\nthe Oversight gavel apart from a congratulatory email from the White House\nOffice of Legislative Affairs.\n\n\n\nBut starting in January, they\'ll likely be at odds over the committee\'s\ninvestigations.\n\n\n\nFor his part, Chaffetz said he hopes he won\'t even have to issue a single\nsubpoena during his tenure as chairman.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope to never issue one. It\'s more dependent on the White House than it\nis on me,\xe2\x80\x9d Chaffetz said. \xe2\x80\x9cSubpoenas, in my mind, are a last resort.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut Chaffetz warned he would subpoena documents or witnesses if it appears\nthere\'s no other way to access them.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they are as open and transparent as they claim, I\'ll never have to\nissue one,\xe2\x80\x9d Chaffetz said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if they\'re going to play games and hide the\ndocuments, then we\'re going to start issuing subpoenas.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The New Republic: \xe2\x80\x9cSherrod Brown Should Challenge Hillary Clinton for\nPresident\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120351/sherrod-brown-president-2016-he-should-challenge-hillary-clinton>*\n\n\n\nBy Michael Kazin\n\nNovember 20, 2014\n\n\n\nAt the risk of seeming ridiculous, I think Sherrod Brown should run for\npresident. I know that, barring a debilitating health problem or a horrible\nscandal, Hillary Clinton is likely to capture the Democratic nomination. I\nrealize too that Brown, the senior senator from Ohio, has never hinted that\nhe may be tempted to challenge her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m really happy where I am,\xe2\x80\x9d he told\nChris Matthews last winter, when the MSNBC\xe2\x80\x99s paragon of impatience urged\nhim to run.\n\n\n\nYet, for progressive Democrats, Brown would be a nearly perfect nominee.\nDuring his two decades in the House and Senate, he has taken strong and\narticulate stands on every issue which matters to the party\xe2\x80\x99s broad, if\ncurrently dispirited, liberal base. When George W. Bush was in office and\nriding high, Brown opposed both his invasion of Iraq and the Patriot Act.\nHe has long been a staunch supporter of abortion rights and gay marriage,\nand is married to Connie Schultz, a feminist author who writes a nationally\nsyndicated column.\n\n\n\nBrown\xe2\x80\x99s true mission, however, is economic: He wants to boost the\nwell-being of working Americans by any means necessary. Brown has been\ntalking and legislating about how to accomplish it for years before\nElizabeth Warren left Harvard for the Capitol. During Obama\xe2\x80\x99s first term,\nhe advocated a larger stimulus package, called for re-enacting the\nGlass-Steagall Act to rein in big banks, and stumped for comprehensive\nimmigration reform. He champions the rights of unions and the power of the\nNational Labor Relations Board and criticizes unregulated \xe2\x80\x9cfree trade\xe2\x80\x9d for\ndestroying manufacturing jobs at home. He also led the charge among Senate\nDemocrats that pressured Obama to drop his plan to appoint Larry Summers to\nhead the Federal Reserve and appoint Janet Yellen instead.\n\n\n\nOn his lapel, Brown wears a canary pin to honor the workers\xe2\x80\x99 movement that\n\xe2\x80\x9cgave us all food safety laws, civil rights, rights for the disabled,\npensions and the minimum wage.\xe2\x80\x9d Like the canaries which miners once took\nwith them into the pits to warn them of toxic gas, the pin symbolizes the\nneed to stay on guard against any employers and politicians who threaten\nthose gains.\n\n\n\nThere are other Democrats\xe2\x80\x94Warren is the best known\xe2\x80\x94who also skillfully\ncombine a politics of economic populism with a commitment to gender\nequality and civil liberties. But only Brown represents a populous swing\nstate that has voted for the victor in every presidential election since\n1960. In both his Senate races, Brown faced well-known and well-financed\nRepublican opponents\xe2\x80\x94and creamed them. In 2006, his unexpected 12-point\nmargin over Mike DeWine was aided, in part, by the anti-Bush wave that gave\nDemocrats control of Congress. Still, DeWine was a two-term incumbent who\nhad been elected previously by landslides. In 2012, Brown faced Josh\nMandel, the popular young state Treasurer. After what became that cycle\xe2\x80\x99s\nmost expensive Senate race, Brown won by six points. He outpolled Barack\nObama in Ohio by over 160,000 votes.\n\n\n\nBrown\xe2\x80\x99s success, like that of many politicians who are popular in swing\nstates, relies, in part, on charm. He relishes going to hundreds of town\nmeetings around the state, where he answers any question thrown at him.\nWhether in public or talking to an interviewer in his office, he comes off\nas relaxed, witty, curious, and rhetoric-free. Two years ago, when I spoke\nwith him in Washington, we spent so much time talking and laughing about\nhis Ohio predecessors\xe2\x80\x94who included the formidable Mark Hanna, the\nRepublican who, in 1896, pioneered the big-money, mass media national\ncampaign\xe2\x80\x94that we barely had enough time to talk about Brown\xe2\x80\x99s career and\npolicies. I have never enjoyed myself so much with any politician,\nparticularly one who was, at the time, fighting to keep his seat.\n\n\n\nBut Brown earns his popularity by refusing to trim his progressive faith or\napologize for it. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you remember who you are,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t\nhave to move to the center, wherever the center happens to be at any\nmoment.\xe2\x80\x9d He keeps insisting that America will not become a decent society\nunless the labor movement regains some of its strength and corporations\nlose a good deal of their power over campaigns and politicians.\n\n\n\nLast summer, George Will paid Brown a kind of tribute. \xe2\x80\x9cHe looks, sounds\nand acts like a real, as opposed to faculty club, leftist,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Will in a\nrare moment when he put his irony, if not his hauteur, aside. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough he\nis a Yale graduate, he has the rumpled look and hoarse voice of someone who\nspent last night on Paris barricades, exhorting les miserables to chuck\ncobblestones at the forces defending property.\xe2\x80\x9d Will did have a point when\nhe contrasted Sherrod Brown\xe2\x80\x99s good-natured, steadfast populism with Hillary\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crisk-averse careerism\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cjoyless plod\xe2\x80\x9d toward the Democratic\nnomination.\n\n\n\nIf nothing else, Sherrod Brown could help push the plight of \xe2\x80\x9cthe\nstruggling middle class\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which is really composed of men and women who work\nfor wages or a mediocre salary\xe2\x80\x94to the forefront of the Democratic primary\ncampaign, where it deserves to be. And no journalist could accuse him of\naltering his views to do so. According to exit polls from the midterm\nelection, nearly two-thirds of Americans believe their government favors\nthe wealthy. Senator Brown must be less \xe2\x80\x9chappy\xe2\x80\x9d now when he contemplates\nspending the next two years objecting again and again to the deeds of the\nnew Republican majority. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he speak liberal truths to power\xe2\x80\x94in\nhis party and the nation\xe2\x80\x94instead?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*MSNBC: \xe2\x80\x9cJim Webb, Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley present first 2016 challenges for\nClinton\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/jim-webb-martin-omalley-present-first-2016-challenges-clinton>*\n\n\n\nBy Alex Seitz-Wald and Jane C. Timm\n\nNovember 20, 2014, 1:22 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nTwo potential challengers to Hillary Clinton, former Sen. Jim Webb and\nMaryland Gov. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, have clearly signaled their intent to enter\nthe 2016 campaign.\n\n\n\nWebb launched an exploratory committee late Wednesday to consider a 2016\nrun. The committee gives him the ability to fundraise, spend, and organize\nlike a presidential campaign, without officially declaring just yet.\n\n\n\nThe popular ex-senator from Virginia has moderate, anti-war credentials\nthat might ring true with liberals and moderates voters sick of gridlock\nand overseas military operations.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver the past few months, thousands of concerned Americans across the\npolitical spectrum have asked me to run for president,\xe2\x80\x9d Webb said in a\nvideo posted to his website. \xe2\x80\x9cA constant theme runs through these requests.\nAmericans want positive, visionary leadership that they can trust.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, outgoing Maryland Gov. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley has hired a former adviser to\nHillary Clinton to lead policy development at his political action\ncommittee. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley has only two more months left in office in Annapolis,\nbut his Washington-based O\xe2\x80\x99Say Can You See PAC is adding staff. One major\naddition is Sarah Miller, who served on the policy team of Hillary\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 presidential campaign and was a close aide to longtime\nClinton confidant John Podesta at the Center for American Progress, a\nleading liberal think tank.\n\n\n\nAt the Center for American Progress, Miller served as a speechwriter and\npolicy adviser to Podesta, who founded the think tank before moving to the\nWhite House as counselor to President Obama late last year. Podesta served\nas Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s White House chief of staff and will likely hold a very\nsenior role in another Clinton presidential campaign. After CAP, Miller\njoined the Treasury Department, but has remained close to Podesta.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley, who says he is seriously considering a presidential bid, has a\npolicy record in Maryland that could excite progressives. And lately, he\xe2\x80\x99s\nbeen vocal in taking the liberal positions on issues of the day. He came\nout for net neutrality just before President Obama made his own\nannouncement on the matter, and called on Congress to vote down the\nKeystone XL pipeline ahead of a much-watched vote this week.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Webb has cast himself as an economic populist. He has\ntouted his varied credentials\xe2\x80\x94eight years of active duty military,\nincluding deployment in Vietnam, five years at the Pentagon mostly as\nAssistant Secretary of Defense and Assistant Secretary of the Navy, four\nyears working behind the scenes in Congress, and six years in Congress. His\nanti-interventionist views will differentiate him from Clinton, who voted\nfor the war in Iraq while in the Senate and encouraged the Obama\nadministration\xe2\x80\x99s intervention in Libya.\n\n\n\nBut credentials aside, few Americans even know Webb\xe2\x80\x99s name and few are\ntalking about his candidacy for president: in a Washington Post/ABC News\npoll from June, he garnered support from only 2% of Democrats.\n\n\n\nAt an event in September, Webb acknowledged his likely opponent, Hillary\nClinton.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not here to undermine her,\xe2\x80\x9d Webb said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m here just to explain where\nmy concerns are as someone whose been involved in military and foreign\npolicy all of my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*MSNBC column: Krystal Ball: \xe2\x80\x9cIs Jim Webb 2016\xe2\x80\x99s Barack Obama?\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/jim-webb-2016s-barack-obama>*\n\n\n\nBy Krystal Ball\n\nNovember 20, 2014, 3:58 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nJust when we thought the 2016 Democratic presidential primary would turn\ninto a bloodless coronation of Hillary Clinton, the race gets a whole lot\nmore interesting. Jim Webb, former Virginia Democratic senator and\nSecretary of the Navy under President Ronald Reagan, just announced he\xe2\x80\x99s\nforming a presidential exploratory committee. Webb writes:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to take a few minutes of your time to ask you to consider the\nmost important question facing America today: Is it possible that our next\nPresident could actually lay out a vision for the country, and create an\nenvironment where leaders from both parties and from all philosophies would\nfeel compelled to work together for the good of the country, despite all of\nthe money and political pressure that now demands they disagree?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe letter doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mention Hillary Clinton, but Webb\xe2\x80\x99s background,\nrhetoric, and persona stands in stark contrast to the presumed Democratic\nfrontrunner. On issues of national security and economic justice, Webb\ncould be the credible challenger to Secretary Clinton that some Democrats\nhave been looking for.\n\n\n\nWhile Clinton is hawkish and famously supported President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s\nIraq War, Jim Webb has been a forceful and credible non-interventionist\nvoice. While Clinton has attempted to shift her rhetoric to match the\ncurrent mood of economic populism, Webb has a long track record of focusing\non poverty, inequality, and economic justice. But perhaps more than\nanything, Webb\xe2\x80\x99s very persona stands in direct opposition to that of\nHillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nIn 2006, at a time when Hillary Clinton was serving in the Senate and\nconsidering whether or not to renounce her support for the Iraq War, Jim\nWebb was stumping for a Senate seat  in combat boots as an ode to his son\nwho was serving in the military there. Before Webb\xe2\x80\x99s opponent, George\nAllen, made \xe2\x80\x9cmacaca\xe2\x80\x9d a household word, Webb was making a name for himself\nin Virginia politics based on his combination of decorated military service\nand opposition to the Iraq War.\n\n\n\nWebb\xe2\x80\x99s consistent and principled opposition led to a memorably\nuncomfortable exchange with then-President George W. Bush shortly after\nWebb\xe2\x80\x99s election. At a White House reception for incoming Senate freshmen,\nBush tracked Webb down and asked him: \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s your boy?\xe2\x80\x9d To which Webb\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to get them out of Iraq, Mr. President.\xe2\x80\x9d Bush tried\nagain: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not what I asked you. How\xe2\x80\x99s your boy?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s between me\nand my boy, Mr. President,\xe2\x80\x9d Webb said ending the conversation.\n\n\n\nWebb has since stuck to his guns as a non-interventionist, opposing U.S.\ninvolvement in Libya and Syria. If Americans are afraid of being drawn back\ninto Iraq or being goaded by ISIS into another full-scale military\nconflict, Webb\xe2\x80\x99s anti-war stance \xe2\x80\x93 combined with his deep knowledge and\ncredibility as a military veteran \xe2\x80\x93 could be a potent challenge to\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s hawkishness.\n\n\n\nEconomic populism could provide another area of potential vulnerability for\nHillary Clinton. The former secretary of state has attempted to match her\nrhetoric to the Democratic mood of the day by highlighting inequality and\nadvocating for a minimum wage increase. But it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped criticism of\nher continued coziness with Wall Street, including the generous\ncompensation she has received for speeches to Goldman Sachs. Clinton has\nyet to stake out a position at odds with the corporate and Wall Street\nexecutives who are expected to fund her campaign.\n\n\n\nWebb, on the other hand, has already taken positions that would set him\nagainst the economic elite. In a recent interview with Ryan Lizza of The\nNew Yorker, Webb pointed out the absurdity of hedge fund managers paying\nlower tax rates than wage earners saying: \xe2\x80\x9cFairness says if you\xe2\x80\x99re a\nhedge-fund manager or making deals where you\xe2\x80\x99re making hundreds of millions\nof dollars and you\xe2\x80\x99re paying capital-gains tax on that, rather than\nordinary income tax, something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, and people know something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWebb has also decried the fact that both Republicans and Democrats are\nbeholden to Wall street financial interests.\n\n\n\nWebb\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy could also undercut the supposed promise of Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s\nelectability. Some have argued that Clinton, given her Arkansas ties and\nprevious success appealing to white working class voters, would be able to\nexpand the electoral map and compete in Southern states that were out of\nbounds for President Obama. Webb, who is of Scotch-Irish decent and whose\nancestors hail from Appalachia, would likely have the same electoral\nappeal. His exploratory letter highlights his concern for both the inner\ncities where you \xe2\x80\x9csee the stagnation, poverty, crime, and lack of\nopportunity that still affects so many African Americans\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cpoorest\ncounties in America \xe2\x80\x93 who happen to be more than 90 percent White, and who\nlive in the reality that \xe2\x80\x98if you\xe2\x80\x99re poor and White you\xe2\x80\x99re out of sight.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMost potently, Webb and Hillary Clinton could not be any more different\nstylistically. While Clinton seemingly can\xe2\x80\x99t get enough of hobnobbing with\neconomic elites and cultivating donors, Webb has clear antipathy for the\nentire political fundraising process. When he was in the Senate, his\nfundraising approach consisted primarily of an occasional letter, penned by\nWebb himself explaining his work and asking for donations. If you did see\nWebb at political fundraisers, you would likely find him off to the side,\nspeaking only to those who approached him, rather than working the\nwealthiest and most powerful individuals as most other politicians would.\n\n\n\nSenator Tim Kaine, who replaced Webb in the Senate, explained to The\nWashington Post: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not a backslapper. There are different models that\nsucceed in politics. There\xe2\x80\x99s the hail-fellow-well-met model of\nbackslapping. That\xe2\x80\x99s not his style.\xe2\x80\x9d In all the ways that Hillary is\ncareful, Webb is direct. In the ways that she\xe2\x80\x99s polished, he\xe2\x80\x99s rough. And\nin all the ways that Hillary eagerly embraces the political game, Webb\ndistances himself from it. But his authenticity could also be a liability:\nWebb has no established donor network and no appetite for politics.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama showed how a potent combination of outsider status, anti-war\ncredibility and deep grassroots enthusiasm could propel an insurgent\ncandidate into a position to win the nomination against the formidable\nClinton political war machine. Despite the lessons of 2008, the nascent\nHillary Clinton campaign seems to have corrected little of its\ntone-deafness or overconfidence. At the same time, Clinton is unlikely to\nallow her organization to be out-executed the way she was by Obama, who\ncapitalized on his campaign\xe2\x80\x99s organizational competence and managerial\ndiscipline to win the Democratic nomination.\n\n\n\nThough Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s tone-deafness and hubris might still befuddle Hillaryland\nin 2016, you can be sure they would have their caucus states organized and\nnot be asleep at the wheel. And a candidate as fundamentally cautious as\nHillary Clinton is unlikely to have the aforementioned \xe2\x80\x9cmacaca\xe2\x80\x9d moment that\nignited Webb\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely 2006 Senate candidacy against George Allen. 2006\nwas also a spectacular year for Democrats, when national forces came to\nWebb\xe2\x80\x99s aid and made up for his many organizational sins and fundraising\ndisadvantages.\n\n\n\nWebb has never proven he can run the type of campaign organization that\ncould execute the complex, precinct-by-precinct war it would take to\ndislodge Hillary. Nor is he the type of charismatic figure that electrified\nthe national stage the way Obama did during his 2004 Democratic convention\ndebut. But as the 2016 field comes together, a combination of factors could\nconspire to unleash a type of grassroots firestorm for Webb: disdain for\npolitics as usual, the unaddressed fury of blue collar white voters, a deep\nlonging for authenticity, and a likely post-Obama backlash against\ntransformational, rhetorically charismatic leaders. An Obama-to-Webb\ntransition isn\xe2\x80\x99t the most natural, but given their shared disdain for\nhawkish adventurism and anti-establishment credibility, Webb\xe2\x80\x99s bid for the\ncoalition of the ascendant is not unreasonable.\n\n\n\nHowever, before getting the politically cynical millennials to knock down\ndoors for him, Webb will also have to explain to the Democratic base his\npositions on gun control, immigration and women\xe2\x80\x99s rights. A 1979 article he\nwrote titled \xe2\x80\x9cWomen Can\xe2\x80\x99t Fight\xe2\x80\x9d is tough to square with a Democratic party\nthat champions women\xe2\x80\x99s empowerment and equality.\n\n\n\nStill, for those looking for an alternative to Hillary Clinton and hoping\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll face a real challenge in the Democratic primary, Jim Webb\xe2\x80\x99s\ncandidacy will certainly be an interesting one to watch. In his letter\nannouncing his exploratory committee, Webb writes: \xe2\x80\x9cI can assure you that\nwe will be focusing not on petty politics or how to match a position with a\npoll, but on the future of our country and on solutions that will rebuild\nand unite us.\xe2\x80\x9d Lots of politicians could write those words. Webb is one of\nthe very few who could write them and actually be believed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Daily Beast: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Gets a Challenger and He\xe2\x80\x99s a Marine\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/20/hillary-gets-a-challenger-and-he-s-a-marine.html>*\n\n\n\nBy David Freedlander\n\nNovember 20, 2014\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] Jim Webb is officially exploring a 2016 run.

He laid out his biography\xe2\x80\x94Vietnam vet, secretary\nof the Navy under Ronald Reagan, antiwar Democrat in the U.S. Senate\xe2\x80\x94his\nrecord as a lawmaker, which included criminal-justice reform and a new GI\nBill, and the rationale for his campaign: \xe2\x80\x9cA strong majority of Americans\nagree that we are at a serious crossroads. In my view the solutions are not\nsimply political, but those of leadership.\xe2\x80\x9d (The text, spread out over\npages, was helpfully posted directly below the video.)\n\n\n\nIt has all the trappings of a campaign as vanity project, the type of\npresidential exploration designed not to excite convention delegates but to\nboost a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s name ID before cable-TV bookers. Webb, after all, would\ncome into a Democratic primary with considerable baggage\xe2\x80\x94never mind that he\nwould likely be squaring off against Hillary Clinton, the most overwhelming\nfavorite in an open Democratic primary in history. There is the fact that\nWebb used to be a Republican, a point he proudly points to in the video\nwhen he mentions his service in the Reagan administration. Or the fact that\nWebb, who decided not to run again after only one term in elective office,\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have the stomach for the degradations of politics. And the\nfact that Webb\xe2\x80\x99s base of support lies among working-class whites, who are a\ndiminishing constituency in a party made up more and more of liberals,\nminorities, and the professional classes. (\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a na\xc3\xafve and stupid thing\nto think that Democratic primary voters want,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote The Daily Kos in\nresponse to Webb\xe2\x80\x99s kickoff video, calling Webb a hopeless crank and comic\nrelief in the mold of Herman Cain.)\n\n\n\nBut veterans of his campaign for Senate and people close to him insist that\nWebb is taking a serious look. Webb\xe2\x80\x99s video announcement last night makes\nhim the first Democrat to officially declare his interest, and as the party\nwaits for the near-inevitable Clinton kickoff, some Webb supporters say\nthat is not as inevitable as many pundits believe. And should Clinton jump\nin, some in Webb world say they think she is the wrong candidate at a time\nwhen the nation is disgusted with politics as usual and when the declining\nprospects of the middle class is the most important issue facing the nation.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJim is not a trial-balloon guy. A lot of people send trial balloons up\nbecause they want to see if they have a chance, or if people like them,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Steve Jarding, a strategist on Webb\xe2\x80\x99s 2006 run. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not Jim. He\nsays \xe2\x80\x98I have a message and I am going to move that message.\xe2\x80\x99 He challenges\nthe Democratic Party to say what it stands for.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nJarding acknowledged that Webb faces long odds\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAt this point, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nbet on him\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but noted that his win in what was thought to be deeply\nRepublican Virginia in 2006, against a popular incumbent, was unlikely as\nwell.\n\n\n\nAnd he conceded that Webb didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much of a taste for politics, but\nsuggested that the former senator could be a stand-in for Americans who\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t have much of a taste for the process either right now.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cApparently 90 percent of Americans agree with him. They don\xe2\x80\x99t like\npolitics much these days either. Maybe Americans are willing to look at\nsomeone who does something different from the calculated. He gives those\nAmericans a voice who say, \xe2\x80\x98You know what, they are all crooks and bastards\nup there on Capitol Hill and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have anything to do with\nthem.\xe2\x80\x99 I mean, look at that video! With all due respect, it was like\nsomething out of the 1970s. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what you would see from an insider\npolitician.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn Friday, some of Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s biggest supporters, who have banded\ntogether under the Ready for Hillary super PAC to raise millions of dollars\nand garner millions of email addresses, will gather in Midtown Manhattan to\nbask in their successes in preparing the groundwork for her run. Webb has\nkept a low profile since leaving the Senate, and will be running for\npresident \xe2\x80\x9cthe old-fashioned way,\xe2\x80\x9d in the words of one aide\xe2\x80\x94waiting to\nannounce before trying to gather support.\n\n\n\nAnd Clinton, his aides insist, is a non-factor.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t about Hillary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mudcat Saunders, a longtime Virginia\nstrategist who worked on Webb\xe2\x80\x99s Senate campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about bring the\nAmerican dream to the forefront once again for working people and small\nbusiness. The working people and small business\xe2\x80\x94they haven\xe2\x80\x99t had any\nrepresentation in years. And they know it.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmericans want to do something about this coin-operated government.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe early line on Webb had been that he would be challenging Clinton from\nthe right. It is a reasonable assumption, considering his roots in the\nRepublican Party, in the Marines, and his proud Scots-Irish roots. But\nWebb\xe2\x80\x99s aides insist it isn\xe2\x80\x99t true. He is to the left of Hillary on foreign\nintervention, and is more populist on economic matters as well, talking\nabout not just curbing the power of big banks but about an inequality\nagenda that goes beyond raising taxes and the minimum wage in order to help\nlower middle-class families gain more of a foothold. They see him bringing\nworking-class whites and Southerners into the fold in a way that no other\nDemocrat could.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe talks about taking the Democratic Party back to its populist roots,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Jessica Vandenberg, a longtime political operative who just moved back\nto her native Iowa and is helping lay the groundwork for the Webb campaign\nin that first-in-the-nation caucus state. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a debate about the\ndirection of the Democratic Party, and it is good to have that debate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*National Journal: \xe2\x80\x9cMoveOn Warns Clinton: Back Keystone, Lose Your Base\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.nationaljournal.com/energy/moveon-warns-clinton-back-keystone-lose-your-base-20141120?ref=t.co&mrefid=walkingheader>*\n\n\n\nBy Ben Geman\n\nNovember 20, 2014\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] The controversial oil-sands pipeline is cropping up in the\nnascent 2016 battle for the White House.\n\n\n\nThe progressive group MoveOn.org is pressing Hillary Clinton to come out\nagainst the Keystone XL oil-sands pipeline, warning that she could lose\nDemocratic voters if she doesn\'t take a stand against the project.\n\n\n\n"Hillary Clinton\'s refusal to take a position raises the possibility that\nshe is worse on climate change than 80 percent of the incoming Senate\'s\nDemocratic Caucus," said Anna Galland, executive director of MoveOn.org\nCivic Action.\n\n\n\nShe warned: "If she\'s considering a run for president and wants the support\nof the party\'s base, Hillary Clinton should clarify that she opposes this\ndirty and dangerous pipeline."\n\n\n\nClinton, the Democratic front-runner if she decides to enter the White\nHouse race, has repeatedly declined to offer an opinion on Keystone.\n\n\n\n"I can\'t really talk about it because I was in the office that has primary\nresponsibility for making the decision. I don\'t want to inject myself into\nwhat is a continuing process or to in any way undermine my successor as he\ntries to make this decision," she said at an event in Canada last month,\nreferring to John Kerry, who followed Clinton as secretary of State.\n\n\n\nBut Bill Snape, senior counsel for the Center for Biological Diversity,\nsaid there\'s no formal restriction preventing Clinton from offering an\nopinion on the pipeline. "She\'s a private citizen now," said Snape, whose\ngroup opposes Keystone. "Nothing in Clinton\'s secretary of State job would\nprevent her from taking a policy position at this point."\n\n\n\nThe State Department is heading the federal review of the project, but the\nfinal decision is expected to come from the West Wing.\n\n\n\nPolling shows that Democrats are divided over Keystone. A Pew Research\nCenter poll released Nov. 12 showed that 43 percent of Democrats surveyed\ncurrently favor construction, compared with 54 percent in March of 2013.\nOverall, Pew\'s survey found that 59 percent of the public supports the\nproject.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to Clinton, outgoing Maryland governor and potential 2016\nDemocratic White House candidate Martin O\'Malley is bashing the pipeline.\n"It\'s time to reject the either/or and smallball choices facing us on\nenergy. I hope the Senate rejects #KeystoneXL--it\'s too much carbon\ndioxide, and not nearly enough jobs (only about 50 jobs permanent once\nconstruction is finished)," he said on Facebook ahead of a Senate vote on\nthe project earlier this week.\n\n\n\nAmong the other potential 2016 challengers to Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders\nof Vermont strongly opposes Keystone. But former Virginia Democratic Sen.\nJim Webb, who has just announced an exploratory committee for a White House\nrun, voted in favor of the pipeline in 2012.\n\n\n\nThe MoveOn.org statement comes two days after legislation to approve\nTransCanada\'s pipeline, which would bring crude oil from Canadian oil-sands\nprojects to Gulf Coast refineries, failed by a single vote in the Senate.\nThirty-nine Democrats and two independents aligned with their caucus\n(Sanders and Sen. Angus King) voted against the bill Tuesday, while 14\nDemocrats supported it.\n\n\n\nBill McKibben, a prominent climate-change activist and leading Keystone\nfoe, supported MoveOn.org\'s push to get Clinton to take a stand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sec.
