john.podesta@gmail.comb'So, that really happened, friend.\n\nAfter officially nominating Ken Cuccinelli as their\ncandidate for Governor this weekend, Republicans selected\nhis ideological twins -- E. W. Jackson and Mark Obenshain --\nto round out their ticket.\n\nApparently, having Ken Cuccinelli as their party\'s standard\nbearer wasn\'t enough for Virginia Republicans. They doubled\n(or tripled) down on their extreme vision for Virginia.\n\nIf we don\'t fight back today, we could be left with a\ngovernment in Richmond that is more concerned about limiting\naccess to women\'s health care or rolling back gay rights\nthan creating jobs.\n\nWill you donate $5 and help make sure that doesn\'t \nhappen?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/its_official?refcode=20130520_nomination_kicker_a\n\nCuccinelli, Jackson, and Obenshain are three peas in a pod.\nThey\'ve made divisive social rhetoric a cornerstone of their\ncareers.\n\nIn past emails, I\'ve highlighted some of Cuccinelli\'s more\nextreme rhetoric, but I wanted to share some of Jackson &\nObenshain\'s:\n\n- Jackson said, "[Homosexual\'s] minds are perverted,\n   they\'re frankly very sick people psychologically,\n   mentally and emotionally." \n- Jackson also said, "I wholeheartedly support the \n   comparison of abortion with slavery." \n- In addition to cosponsoring Cuccinelli\'s bill that tried to \n   ban common forms of birth control like the pill, \n   Obenshain sponsored a bill that would force women to \n   report miscarriages to the police within 24 hours.\n\nAs Terry said on Saturday, we need all Virginians to learn\nwhat will happen if Cuccinelli and his running mates are\nelected. Once they do, we know they\'ll understand the\nimportance of this election. But we need your help to get\nout our message.\n\nIf you don\'t want to live in a state represented by Cuccinelli, \nJackson, or Obenshain please donate $5 right now \nand support our campaign:\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/its_official?refcode=20130520_nomination_kicker_a\n\nThanks for supporting Terry and his vision for Virginia,\n\nEmily Aden \nResearch Director \nTerry McAuliffe for Governor\n\n------ On Sat, May 18, 2013 at 11:02 AM, Terry McAuliffe\nwrote:\n\nWow, they really did it.\n\nMoments ago, the Republican Party of Virginia officially\nnominated Ken Cuccinelli as their candidate for Governor.\n\nWe knew this was coming, but I want to make sure you know\nwhat it means.\n\nIf Ken Cuccinelli is elected Governor, he\'ll spend the next\nfour years pushing his divisive social agenda instead of\nfocusing on what\'s critically important for Virginia right\nnow: creating jobs and building our economy.\n\nWill you donate $5\nright now to support my campaign?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/its_official?refcode=20130520_nomination_kicker_a\n\nKen Cuccinelli\'s been clear about his vision for Virginia --\nhe wants to roll back gay rights, limit women\'s access to\nhealth care, and spend your tax dollars trying to\ndelegitimize climate science.\n\nRepublicans at the convention weren\'t just okay with that\nextreme vision -- they rallied behind it. And Cuccinelli\'s\ndeep-pocketed allies are pouring money into his campaign to\nmake it a reality.\n\nI know that when people learn what living in Cuccinelli\'s\nVirginia would really be like, they\'ll understand the\nimportance of this election. But I need your help to get\nthat message out.\n\nIf you can\'t imagine living in Cuccinelli\'s Virginia, donate\n$5 right now to\nsupport my campaign:\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/its_official?refcode=20130520_nomination_kicker_a\n\nThanks for everything you do,\n\nTerry\n\n\n\n---\nPaid for by Terry McAuliffe for Governor\n---\n\nUnsubscribe: http://action.terrymcauliffe.com/page/unsubscribe?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\n\n'
