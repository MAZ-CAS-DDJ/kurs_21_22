john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear Subscriber,\nWe are pleased to invite you to join us on Thursday, October 2 (11am PT / 2pm ET / 18:00 GMT) for the season\'s first Talking  ( http://www.geneticsandsociety.rsvp1.com/s1b98ahch3OB )Biopolitics, ( http://www.geneticsandsociety.rsvp1.com/s17a8bhch3OF ) a series of live web-based conversations with cutting-edge thinkers about the social meaning of human biotechnologies.\n( http://www.geneticsandsociety.rsvp1.com/s1be0ahch3OH )\n( http://womensstudies.berkeley.rsvp1.com/s1bf4ahch3OK ) Charis Thompson ( http://womensstudies.berkeley.rsvp1.com/s17c4bhch3OO ), Chancellor\'s Professor and Chair of Gender and Women\'s Studies at the University of California, Berkeley will talk with David Winickoff ( http://ourenvironment.berkeley.rsvp1.com/s1758bhch3OR ), Professor in Bioethics and Society in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management at Berkeley &ndash; and with you &ndash; about her new book, Good Science: The Ethical Choreography of Stem Cell Research ( http://mitpress.mit.rsvp1.com/s1b68ahch3OV ).\nThompson\'s book makes a convincing case that good science depends upon good ethics, and provides a map for the kinds of choreography that are needed to get there.\nShe raises valuable and timely questions: How has the controversy over human pluripotent stem cell research evolved over the past fifteen years? What political, ethical, and scientific developments have emerged, and how have they shifted the conversation about biopolitics today?\nHighlighting an emergent framing of innovation that she terms "procurial," Thompson examines concerns about a pro-cures mandate and a range of bio-curatorial practice. She shows how "ethical choreography" has allowed biomedical research to continue throughout controversy, and what may be possible moving forward.\nBroadening the biopolitical paradigm, she addresses the relevance of health disparities, disability justice, and militarization, as well as the complexities of animal and human research subjecthood that she has seen in stem cell research.\nAbout the Author\nCharis Thompson ( http://womensstudies.berkeley.rsvp1.com/s1b2cahch3OY ) is Chancellor\'s Professor and Chair of Gender and Women\'s Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, while on leave from the Department of Sociology at the London School of Economics and Political Science.
