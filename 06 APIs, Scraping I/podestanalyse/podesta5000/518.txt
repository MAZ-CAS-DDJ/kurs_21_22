Streams of water circled around the mountains and valleys.\n\nBut now, more than 70 years later, Jack's native land is much different.\n\nOnce dense forests have been largely chopped down. Ordinarily predictable rainfall patterns have become erratic. And water ? an essential farming resource ? has become scarce. For Jack and many of his fellow farmers, the changing climate and years of deforestation have had a devastating effect on their livelihoods and sources of income.\nBut where there is hope, there is opportunity.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are many opportunities for Kenya to fight climate change and restore these critical ecosystems that support millions of people in Kenya. With our partners, we're working to educate local communities ? like Jack's ? on the importance of trees and the benefits of conserving natural resources. With this training, community members learn how to work together to protect and rehabilitate their forests, not only improving lives now, but for many generations to come.\nAnd that's just the beginning.\n\nWith our help, Jack has gained the tools, knowledge, and skills to become a leader in his community. To date, Jack and others have raised nearly 72,000 indigenous seedlings and planted over 50,000 more across Kenya.\n\nWhile climate change continues to threaten and challenge many farmers across the globe, Jack's story proves that ? even in one individual's lifetime ? together, we can accomplish so much.\n\nAnd I can't wait to see what kind of progress 2016 will bring ? I look forward to sharing more of these Impact Stories with you in the new year.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nDonna E. Shalala\n\nPresident\n\nClinton Foundation\nEnjoy this Impact Story?
