A couple follow up questions:\n\nMost devices these days come with the Windows operating system. Is that what you want or were you considering Mac or Google operating systems?\n\nMost the size you want are touch screen or flip over into a tablet. Do you care about any of these features?\n\nAll laptops will slow down without getting cleaned up after a year or so. That's even with normal use. So we need to keep that in mind for this time next year. \n\nOften these devices can be purchased directly through Verizon, which makes the internet bundling easier. I'll see what they have. Is your intention that this be paid via reimbursement every month, or the campaign tech/comms fund directly? Fine if we don't know yet.  \n\nSent from my iPhone"
