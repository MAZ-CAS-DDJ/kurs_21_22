john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear Friend,\n\nIt\'s very simple \xe2\x80\xa6 this is it.\n\nToday is the last day of our fundraising quarter ... and we are $12,000 short of reaching our goal.\n\nPolitics is about momentum \xe2\x80\xa6 and having the resources to win.\n\nWe rode the wave of momentum into our primary victory \xe2\x80\xa6 now we want to ride it into the summer campaign with the resources to win!\n\nPlease make a contribution of $25, $50, $75, $100, $250 or more, to help us reach our goal \xe2\x80\xa6 and fund our summer operations \xe2\x80\xa6 that we launch this July 4th weekend!\n\nContribute: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=ejun30link1\n\nThis election cycle an ideological battle is being waged by my opponent, Congressman Pat Toomey, here in Pennsylvania ... a battle between "the failed ideology of the past" versus "a pragmatic future."\n\nCongressman Toomey is a right-wing ideologue with an American Conservative Union rating of 97%, ten points higher than "conservative icon" former GOP Senator Rick Santorum.\n\nPlain and simple \xe2\x80\xa6 Congressman Toomey is an extreme ideologue out of touch with our nation\'s challenges and our values.\n\nHe wants to privatize Social Security; pass laws that benefit large corporations over small businesses; cut off unemployment assistance for struggling families; and deny seniors $250 to begin to close the "Donut Hole" in prescription drug coverage. He defends bonuses for "bailed-out bankers" but votes against bonuses for veterans and supports oil drilling in our fresh-water Great Lakes.\n\nFor the past 18 months, our nation has had to deal with the problems caused by the failed policies of the Bush Administration that was populated by ideologues. Congressman Toomey, on the campaign trail, is advocating \xe2\x80\xa6 clamoring \xe2\x80\xa6 for a return to those failed polices \xe2\x80\xa6 rather than blazing a path to the future.\n\nPennsylvania and our nation simply cannot afford to have an ideologue like Pat Toomey in the U.S. Senate representing our interests \xe2\x80\xa6 he is simply "too extreme" and "too out of touch."\n\nEverything that you, I and our supporters everywhere have worked for \xe2\x80\xa6 and built with our campaign organization over the past year \xe2\x80\xa6 will go for naught, unless we continue our drive forward ... unless we reach our fundraising goal for the quarter.\n\nContribute: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=ejun30link2\n\nThe stakes are that high!\n\nThis is it \xe2\x80\xa6 time to take action.
