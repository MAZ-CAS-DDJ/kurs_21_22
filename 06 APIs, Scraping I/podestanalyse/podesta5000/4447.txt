They wouldn't have sent you so many emails unless it was critical.\n\nCan you donate before it's too late? http://action.thehousemajoritypac.com/5hoursleft\n\nThe deadline is 5 hours away. It's now or never.\n\n- Tara\n\n----- Original Messages -----\n\n>From Tammy Duckworth:\n\nJohn:\n\nWatching the Tea Party stop anything from getting accomplished in Washington has made me cringe since I was elected in 2012.\n\nI am determined that it doesn't have to be this way, which is why I am writing you today. My friends at House Majority PAC are working day and night to kick the Tea Party out of Washington. They're fighting back against hundreds of millions of dollars in attacks against Democrats nationwide. But standing up against people like the Koch brothers isn't easy.\n\nHouse Majority PAC's FEC deadline is just one day away and if they're not able to meet their fundraising goals, they will fall behind. That is why I need your help. Can you click here and donate today?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/suit_bo?refcode=em092014_5&amp;amount=25.00&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;zip=20016&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=&amp;phone=&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=\n\nEven a small contribution would go such a long way to help House Majority PAC stand with Democrats across the country.\n\nThanks for standing with the Democrats Who Fight Back,\n\nTammy\n\n\n\n>From Jim Messina:\n\nWashington isn't working. President Obama is trying hard to do so much, but with Speaker Boehner and the Tea Party, something has to change.\n\nHere's what we're up against:\n\nA Tea Party focused on playing politics by relentlessly attacking the president\nTea Party radicals pushing for the largest GOP majority in 60 YEARS!\nA Tea Party determined to impeach Obama\nThat is why my friends at House Majority PAC need your help before their HUGE FEC deadline - the last quarterly deadline before Election Day. They're standing with President Obama, but they need your help. Can you click here and donate before it's too late?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/suit_bo?refcode=em092014_5&amp;amount=25.00&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;zip=20016&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=&amp;phone=&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=\n\nStanding up for the president means that we stop the GOP from continuing their assault on a woman's right to choose, stop the GOP's attempts to destroy our environment, and pass the rest of the president's agenda.\n\nBut House Majority PAC can't do it alone. Can you click here and donate before their HUGE FEC deadline? Your donation will be put to work instantly stopping the Tea Party and supporting the president's agenda.\n\nThanks for standing up for the president,\n\nJim\n\n\n\n>From Leader Nancy Pelosi:\n\nI just left a meeting on the outside spending in some of our tightest races and it's downright SCARY. The latest numbers show that if we don't get a huge surge, we could lose BIG, even in states like New York and California!!!\n\nBut, that's where you come in. My friends at House Majority PAC (HMP) need your urgent support before their biggest FEC deadline of the year! HMP was founded after the 2010 elections to counter Koch-fueled attacks and provide Democrats air support. We need 3 more people from Washington to step up NOW.\n\nIf they don't have our support, President Obama and Democrats everywhere will fall behind. Look, can you click here and donate before it's too late?\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/suit_bo?refcode=em092014_5&amp;amount=25.00&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;zip=20016&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=&amp;phone=&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=\n\nIf House Majority PAC misses this deadline, Democrats fall further behind to Koch-fueled attacks. They're already spending millions -- and could spend more -- donating today is the only way to fight back.\n\nJohn, can you click here and donate before it's too late?\n\nThanks,\n\nNancy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeader Pelosi is only asking for a donation of up to $5,000 from individuals.
