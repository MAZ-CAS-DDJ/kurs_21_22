He's let travel and political know that's his\ndecision.\n\nWe have a 10:30 Vamoose ticket for you for tomorrow morning if you want it.\nE-ticket in your inbox. If not, the campaign can keep the credit in the\nVamoose bank for next time. They also can keep the credit with Megabus.\n\nSorry again about all this. I hope this is a good outcome.\n\nMilia\n\n-- \nMilia Fisher\nSpecial Assistant to the Chair\nHillary for America\nmfisher@hillaryclinton.com\no: 646.854.1198 c: 858.395.1741\n"
