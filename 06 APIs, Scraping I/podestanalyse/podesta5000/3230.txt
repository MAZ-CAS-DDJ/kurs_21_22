One year later, the Nevada Democrat steered tens of millions of\ndollars in federal grant money to the California biofuel company.\n\nFulcrum is one of at least nine corporate donors\n<http://cleanenergyprojectnv.org/partners-project> to the Clean Energy\nProject (CEP) that have secured federal financing for themselves or a\nclient due in part to Reid\xe2\x80\x99s behind-the-scenes advocacy\xe2\x80\x94activity that\nwatchdogs warn could be construed as unethical.\n\nRebecca Lambe, Reid\xe2\x80\x99s top political strategist who has been directed by Reid\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/reid-im-running-in-2016-115066.html>\nto take the lead in hiring for his 2016 reelection campaign, founded\n<http://www.cassidy.com/team/79/> CEP in 2008 and served as its executive\ndirector <http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CEP-990-2008.pdf>.\nReid\xe2\x80\x99s former chief of staff Susan McCue served as CEP\xe2\x80\x99s president at that\ntime. Lambe is now an adviser to CEP, according to her official bio\n<http://www.cassidy.com/team/79/>. McCue is a member of its board\n<http://cleanenergyprojectnv.org/board-directors>.\n\nMcCue and Lambe also run Senate Majority PAC\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/top-harry-reid-advisers-build-big-money-firewall-to-protect-senate-democrats/2014/09/16/991381b6-3cdf-11e4-9587-5dafd96295f0_story.html>,\na powerhouse Super Pac with close ties to Reid that spent $67 million\n<http://realtime.influenceexplorer.com/committee/senate-majority-pac/C00484642/>\nto elect Senate Democrats last year.\n\nFar from denying a role in steering subsidies to donors to aides\xe2\x80\x99 group,\nReid\xe2\x80\x99s office brags about it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSenator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s leadership on creating clean energy jobs in Nevada is\nsomething we like to talk about at every opportunity and we are glad you\nhave chosen to cover this topic,\xe2\x80\x9d Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson said in an\nemailed statement.\n\nJentleson pointed to his office\xe2\x80\x99s 2013 staff report\n<http://www.reid.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/clean-energy-guide.pdf>\non the benefits that green energy companies such as Ormat Geothermal, which\nReid helped secure a $350 million loan guarantee, were bringing to Nevada.\n\nA news release on the staff report quoted\n<http://www.reid.senate.gov/press_releases/reid-releases-nevada-report-playing-to-win-in-clean-energy>\nLydia Ball, until February\n<http://cleanenergyprojectnv.org/projects/our-new-executive-director> CEP\xe2\x80\x99s\nexecutive director, about the benefits of an \xe2\x80\x9caggressive clean energy path\nfor Nevada.\xe2\x80\x9d It didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention that Ball is a former Reid aide, that Ormat\nhas donated to her organization\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20121127154013/http://www.cleanenergyprojectnv.org/about/partners-of-the-project>,\nor that the company\xe2\x80\x99s president has donated to Reid\n<http://www.opensecrets.org/indivs/search.php?name=BRONICKI%2C+YORAM&cycle=All&sort=R&state=&zip=&employ=&cand=reid&submit=Submit>\n.\n\nWhile on Reid\xe2\x80\x99s staff, Ball was in charge of advising\n<https://www.linkedin.com/pub/lydia-ball/4/65b/103> Nevada companies on how\nto obtain financing through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,\nbetter known as the stimulus.\n\nShe also helped organize the National Clean Energy Summit, an annual\nconference cosponsored by Reid and CEP where environmentalists,\npoliticians, and green energy executives discuss the need for more\ngovernment \xe2\x80\x9cinvestment\xe2\x80\x9d in green companies.\n\nFulcrum contributed to CEP in 2013\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20130905210433/http://cleanenergyprojectnv.org/about/partners-of-the-project>\nand 2014. It attended the 2014 summit, where Agriculture Secretary Tom\nVilsack announced\n<http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2014/09/0195.xml&printable=true&contentidonly=true>\na $105 million grant for the company. The Defense Department awarded\n<http://www.reid.senate.gov/press_releases/2014-09-19-reid-announces-70-million-for-fulcrum-bioenergy>\nit another $70 million two weeks later.\n\nThe Center for American Progress has sponsored the summit\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20120901153308/http://www.cleanenergyprojectnv.org/about/cep-board>\nsince it was created in 2008. John Podesta, CAP\xe2\x80\x99s founder and former\nchairman was a CEP board member until at least September 2013\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20130905205113/http://cleanenergyprojectnv.org/about/cep-board>.\nHe is expected to work for the 2016 presidential campaign of Hillary\nClinton, who was the 2014 summit\xe2\x80\x99s keynote speaker.\n\nThe Podesta Group, the lobbying firm founded by Podesta and his brother\nTony, began representing\n<http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=264c0e46-c1ca-455a-97f3-7f3e9b12c102&filingTypeID=1>\nFulcrum in April 2014, five months before that year\xe2\x80\x99s CEP summit\xe2\x80\x94and the\n$175 million in federal grants that followed.\n\nThe firm reported lobbying\n<http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=fedae6bf-1d38-4c62-876f-43e9bdfa0cfe&filingTypeID=69>\nthe Executive Office of the President during the third quarter of 2014,\nwhen Fulcrum received the grants. That remains the only reporting period in\nwhich it has done so.\n\nReid took credit\n<http://www.reid.senate.gov/press_releases/2014-09-19-reid-announces-70-million-for-fulcrum-bioenergy>\nfor delivering the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s money. \xe2\x80\x9cSenator Reid wrote Secretary [Chuck]\nHagel in support of Fulcrum\xe2\x80\x99s grant application earlier this year,\xe2\x80\x9d his\noffice said.\n\nMost of CEP\xe2\x80\x99s corporate supporters are companies that have benefitted or\nstand to benefit from policies that subsidize green energy\ntechnologies\xe2\x80\x94policies that Reid routinely pushes for in the Senate.\n\nTheir donations to the CEP suggest \xe2\x80\x9ca vehicle to promote pay-to-play\npolitics,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ken Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy\nCenter, an ethics watchdog group.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is run by Reid insiders, funded by those who want Reid\xe2\x80\x99s political\nfavors, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a track record of Reid dispensing favors to those who\nfund it,\xe2\x80\x9d Boehm said in an email. \xe2\x80\x9cAs the late Senator [Sam] Ervin said,\nsometimes things are what they look like.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAsked whether donations to CEP bought or rewarded Reid\xe2\x80\x99s legislative\nsupport, Jentleson noted the 5,500 Nevada jobs\xe2\x80\x94temporary, permanent, and\n\xe2\x80\x9cindirect\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94created by Reid-supported CEP donors.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith specific regard to the projects you mention, Senator Reid is\nextremely proud of his involvement in each one of them,\xe2\x80\x9d Jentleson said.\n\nMcCue denied that political considerations played any part in donations to\nCEP or Reid\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to steer subsidies to those donors.\n\nThe group \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not do any federal lobbying on behalf of its supporters,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said in an emailed statement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSen. Reid has long worked to make Nevada the clean energy capital for the\ncountry, successfully bringing new companies and thousands of good new jobs\nto the state,\xe2\x80\x9d McCue said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would, and will, do that whether they\nsupported CEP or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGood government advocates say donations to independent groups with ties to\nprominent politicians can raise red flags.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGifts from moneyed interests to politicians\xe2\x80\x99 pet charities always merit\nadded scrutiny and concern,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of\nthe Center for Responsive Politics.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are innumerable ways that money can be used to help shape policy and\none of those is supporting a nonprofit connected to the politician or\npolitical operative,\xe2\x80\x9d Krumholz said in an interview for a separate story.\n\nCEP did not respond to a request for comment by press time.\n\nThe group\xe2\x80\x99s website listed Ormat Geothermal as a donor in 2012, a year\nafter Reid helped it obtain a $350 million loan guarantee. He also helped\nsecure\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/business/a-us-backed-geothermal-plant-in-nevada-struggles.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0>\nnearly $100 million in federal financing for Nevada Geothermal, which\ncounted Ormat as a contractor.\n\nReid pressured the Department of the Interior (DOI) to expedite permit\napprovals for Nevada green energy projects, according to the *New York\nTimes*\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/business/a-us-backed-geothermal-plant-in-nevada-struggles.html?pagewanted=all>.\nSeven companies <http://freebeacon.com/issues/interior-motives/> eventually\nreceived fast-track treatment from DOI, including Ormat, Nevada Geothermal,\nand CEP donors <http://cleanenergyprojectnv.org/partners-project> Abengoa,\nFirst Solar, and SolarReserve.\n\nAlso at bat for Ormat was Cassidy and Associates, a lobbying firm and CEP\ndonor that boasts Lambe as a senior adviser. Cassidy lobbyist Kai Anderson,\nReid\xe2\x80\x99s former deputy chief of staff, continues to represent the company.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2009, Ormat had three loan-guarantee applications\nrejected for being \xe2\x80\x9cnon-competitive.\xe2\x80\x9d Cassidy inked its contract\n<http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=76c4ec45-0faa-455a-b676-e7915060a299&filingTypeID=1>\nwith Ormat in April 2009. Five months later, Reid sent a letter to\nPresident Obama expressing concern about the slow pace of DOE loan\nguarantee approvals, though he did not ask for specific projects to be\napproved.\n\nOrmat received its $350 million loan guarantee in 2011. Reid thanked Obama\nand then-Energy Secretary Steven Chu in a statement\n<http://www.reid.senate.gov/press_releases/reid-announces-finalized-loan-guarantee-for-ormat-geothermal-projects>\nfor \xe2\x80\x9cfor their commitment to putting Nevadans back to work and boosting\nNevada\xe2\x80\x99s clean energy economy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnother former Reid aide was working behind the scenes to secure that\nfinancing. Paul Thomsen, then Ormat\xe2\x80\x99s in-house lobbyist, handled\n<https://www.linkedin.com/pub/paul-thomsen/6b/670/915> \xe2\x80\x9cemerging energy\nresources, and public land issues\xe2\x80\x9d on the senator\xe2\x80\x99s staff. He also starred\nin a 2010 campaign ad <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvI_AY68BjQ> for the\nsenator.\n\nThomsen is a former lobbyist for Lionel Sawyer & Collins. All four of\nReid\xe2\x80\x99s sons have also worked for the firm, as has CEP board member and\nformer Reid staffer Brent Heberlee, who says he\n<http://www.nossaman.com/bheberlee?no_redirect=true> \xe2\x80\x9cmaintains a strong\nworking relationship with the Senate Minority Leader.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOrmat\xe2\x80\x99s ties to Reid caught the attention of the House Oversight and\nGovernment Reform Committee, which began investigating the Obama\nadministration\xe2\x80\x99s support for green energy projects in 2011.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe strong ties between the company and the Senate Majority leader raise\nquestions about whether the DOE acted in the best interests of the American\npeople when it approved [Ormat\xe2\x80\x99s] loan guarantee,\xe2\x80\x9d the committee wrote in a\n2012 report\n<http://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/final-doe-loan-guarantees-report.pdf>\n.\n\nInternal DOE emails reveal that Reid pressured the department to speed\napproval of stimulus-funded loan guarantees. One email from Jonathan\nSilver, who directed DOE\xe2\x80\x99s loan programs office, suggested that Reid was\ndetermined to secure pork for Nevada businesses through DOE\xe2\x80\x99s\nstimulus-funded loan guarantees.\n\nCEP donor SolarReserve was among the companies that took advantage of\nReid\xe2\x80\x99s aid in securing financing. He pushed\n<http://www.reid.senate.gov/press_releases/reid-urges-swift-use-of-stimulus-funds-for-renewable-energy-and-transmission-projects>\nDOE in 2010 to speed approval of a $737 million loan guarantee for the\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s Nevada manufacturing facility.\n\nCEP donor NV Energy, the state\xe2\x80\x99s largest utility, got a $138 million\nstimulus grant after, Reid said\n<http://www.reid.senate.gov/press_releases/reid-announces-138-million-grant-to-build-nevadas-smart-grid-pave-pathway-to-a-clean-energy-future>,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI advocated for this funding.\xe2\x80\x9d He also touted his work\n<http://www.solarcity.com/newsroom/press/solarcity-expand-nevada> in\nextending solar power tax credits in announcing that SolarCity, another CEP\ndonor, would build a new manufacturing facility in Nevada.\n\nSome of CEP\xe2\x80\x99s donors are members of the Solar Energy Industries\nAssociation, the industry\xe2\x80\x99s trade association. SEIA itself is a CEP donor,\nand represents a host of other companies <http://www.seia.org/directory>\nthat have benefitted from federal green energy policies, including several\nthat Reid has backed.\n\nCEP board member Rose McKinney-James represents Amonix\n<https://www.leg.state.nv.us/AppCF/Lobbyist/reports/LobbyistDetail.cfm?lobbyist=647&Session=76>,\na solar company that received federal backing after Reid went to bat on its\nbehalf. \xe2\x80\x9cI made sure the Recovery Act included almost $6 million in tax\ncredits to help Amonix open this facility,\xe2\x80\x9d Reid said\n<http://www.reid.senate.gov/press_releases/reid-announces-hundreds-of-new-clean-energy-jobs>\nin 2010 of the company\xe2\x80\x99s Las Vegas production plant.\n\nReid has also aided McKinney James client Bombard Renewable Energy\n<http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1440454/bill_to_lift_solar_power_halted_by_republicans/>.\nHer clients also include the Valley Electric Association\n<https://www.leg.state.nv.us/AppCF/Lobbyist/reports/LobbyistDetail.cfm?lobbyist=651&Session=78>,\na CEP donor. She sits on the board of MGM Resorts International, according\nto the company\xe2\x80\x99s website\n<http://mgmresorts.investorroom.com/index.php?s=116>. That company sponsored\n<http://www.cleanenergysummit.org/> last year\xe2\x80\x99s summit.\n\nAnti-cronyism watchdogs were skeptical of the benefits of Reid\xe2\x80\x99s dealings.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course these businesses viewed their donations as investments,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nWilliam Yeatman, a senior fellow and energy policy expert at the\nCompetitive Enterprise Institute.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe entire green energy industry\xe2\x80\x94every bit of it\xe2\x80\x94is dependent on political\nfavoritism,\xe2\x80\x9d Yeatman said in an email. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd with whom better to curry favor\nthan the Senate Majority Leader\xe2\x80\x94especially during the stimulus era, a\nperiod during which oversight was shortchanged for speed of disbursement.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn Thu, Mar 5, 2015 at 11:34 AM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n> I can\'t open this.
