But in fact, \nthe  agency is currently being probed for doing exactly that on a different \nissue.   \nLast  night, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, who chairs the oversight subcommittee of \nthe House  intelligence committee, _told_ \n(http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=385x314073)   MSNBC\'s Ed Schultz \n(h/t Democratic Underground): \nOn our subcommittee we are beginning an inquiry into a  situation ... \ninitiated by the ranking minority member to look at a situation  where the CIA \ndid mislead the Congress ... a documented issue of the CIA  misleading the \nCongress. \nA  Schakowsky spokesman told TPMmuckraker that she was referring to the \nfindings  of a CIA inspector general report, portions of which were released \nlast fall,  which concluded that the agency had withheld crucial information \nfrom Congress  and DOJ investigators who were probing whether CIA personnel \ncommitted crimes  relating to the shooting of a missionary plane in Peru in \n2001.   \nAs the  New York Times _described  it_ \n(http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/21/world/americas/21inquire.html?_r=1&ref=americas&pagewanted=print)  last \nNovember: \nA C.I.A. surveillance aircraft mistakenly identified  the plane as a \ndrug-smuggling aircraft, and a Peruvian military jet shot it  down, killing an \nAmerican missionary and her 7-month-old daughter. The Justice  Department \nclosed its investigation into the matter in 2005, declining to  prosecute agency \nofficers for any actions related to the episode.   \nBut [the  inspector general\'s] report, parts of which were made public on \nThursday, said  that the Justice Department investigators  and Congress were \nnever allowed access to internal C.I.A.  reviews that portrayed the downing \nas one mistake among many  in the agency\'s counternarcotics program in Peru. \nThe  report said the agency routinely authorized interceptions of suspected \ndrug  planes "without adequate safeguards to protect against the loss of \ninnocent  life." (our itals)   \nIt  continued:  \nThe inspector general\'s report said that after the  downing of the \nmissionaries\' plane, the C.I.A. had conducted internal reviews  "that documented \nsustained and significant violations of required intercept  procedures." But it \nsaid that the agency had denied Congress, the Department  of Justice and \nthe National Security Council access to these findings.\n...   \nThe  report ... says that C.I.A. lawyers from the office of the general \ncounsel  "advised agency managers to avoid written products lest they be \nsubject to  legal scrutiny" in connection with the downing of the  plane. \nWho was  it who released portions of the report last fall, and, according \nto  Schakowsky, initiated the current inquiry?  \nThat  would be Rep. Pete Hoekstra, the ranking Republican on the intel \ncommittee. At  the same time that he released the report\'s excerpts, Hoekstra \nsaid he was  asking DOJ to look into whether the CIA had obstructed justice, \nand called the  incident "about as ugly as it gets." Schakowsky told Schultz \nlast night that  Hoekstra is "furious" about the incident. \nThat\'s  the same Pete Hoekstra, of course, who\'s been front and center in \nportraying  the agency as the embodiment of transparency and integrity in an \neffort to  vilify Pelosi over the torture briefings. Appearing on CNN \nyesterday, Hoekstra  _called_ \n(http://features.csmonitor.com/politics/2009/05/18/did-nancy-pelosi-lie-new-poll-shows-americans-are-divided/)   Pelosi\'s claims \nthat the CIA had misled her "outrageous accusations."   \nBut given  that the agency is currently being probed on similar grounds -- \nin an inquiry  initiated by Hoekstra himself -- perhaps Pelosi\'s claims \naren\'t quite so  outrageous after all. \nTrevor Kincaid \nCommunications Director \nOffice of Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky,  IL-09 \n2367 Rayburn House Office Building \nWashington, DC 20515 \nDirect: 202-226-6898 \nCell: 202-374-1098 \nEmail: _trevor.kincaid@mail.house.gov_ \n(mailto:trevor.kincaid@mail.house.gov)  \n\n\n\n**************Recession-proof vacation ideas.
