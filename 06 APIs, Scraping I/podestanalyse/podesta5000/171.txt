I hope you'll join me in thanking him today >> \n\nWhile I support paid sick leave and will work to defend and further our President's expansion of it in Congress, we're currently one of the only countries that doesn't mandate paid sick leave. And that means we're falling behind when it comes to protecting our workers.\n\nNow, with everyone talking about why we don't require paid sick leave nationwide, President Obama's actions opened the door towards righting this wrong permanently.\n\nPlease, sign your name to join me and thank President Obama for protecting our workers:\n\nhttp://go.anthonybrown.com/sick-leave\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nAnthony Brown----\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.\n\nTo unsubscribe, go to: \n  http://go.anthonybrown.com/unsubscribe\n\n"
