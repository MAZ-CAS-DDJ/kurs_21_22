Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, and Ted\nCruz.\n\nEven without a punchline, that\'s the scariest knock knock\njoke I\'ve heard in years.\n\nThese three guys who desperately want to be the next\nPresident of the United States believe that the Virginia\ngubernatorial election is the first sign of what will happen\nin 2014 congressional races and they think it\'ll help them\nwin the big kahuna -- 2016\'s presidential election.\n\nSo they\'re on their way to Virginia to shill for Ken\nCuccinelli and guarantee headlines about Republican momentum\nin every newspaper in America come November 6th.\n\nThat\'s why it\'s no laughing matter that my friend Terry\nMcAuliffe is still $47,103 short of his August Rapid\nResponse fund goal. Will you donate $5 before tomorrow\'s\nmidnight deadline and make sure he gets all the way there?\n\nhttps://donate.terrymcauliffe.com/bellwether\n\nI\'m a big fan of history. And you don\'t have to look back\nfar to know what could happen if these guys get their way\nand beat Terry.\n\nNot only would it mean that Virginia is stuck with a\ngovernor who has a long track record of rolling back women\'s\naccess to health care, removing protections against\ndiscrimination for gay Virginians, and pursuing legal action\nagainst scientists whose conclusions he disagrees with -- it\nwould also mean that the Republican Party has big momentum\ngoing into upcoming elections.\n\nIn 2009, Bob McDonnell won big in Virginia\'s gubernatorial\nelection and then, in 2010, Democrats got shellacked\nnationwide. Even after a great year last year, we\'re still\noutnumbered in the House by 33 Republicans because of what\nhappened just three years ago.\n\nAnd as the only 2013 election in a "purple" state, Virginia\nis the bellwether ambitious Republicans are focusing on.\n\nHelp me deal a blow to Cuccinelli, Rubio, Paul, and Cruz by\ndonating $5 to Terry before tomorrow\'s midnight deadline:\n\nhttps://donate.terrymcauliffe.com/bellwether\n\nThe polls in this race are closer than close, which means we\nhave as good a shot as any to start the next three years\nwith momentum on our side. But it also means that Cuccinelli\nand his right wing friends could win too.\n\nI\'m counting on you to make sure that doesn\'t happen.\n\nThanks,\n\nJames Carville\n\n\n\nCONTRIBUTE NOW: https://donate.terrymcauliffe.com/bellwether\n\n\n\n\n---\nPaid for by Terry McAuliffe for Governor\n---\n\nUnsubscribe: http://action.terrymcauliffe.com/page/unsubscribe?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\n\n'
