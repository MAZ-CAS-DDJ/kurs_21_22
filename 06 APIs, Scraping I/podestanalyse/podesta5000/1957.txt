john.podesta@gmail.comb"Sounds good.  I'll brain storm with our friends around NNU, ATU, APWU and\nCWA, see what we can come up with and keep everyone posted.\n\nRegarding AFSCME, they have a format proposal of what they would like this\nevent to look like for their endorsement process.  They are requesting a\ntownhall style event, 60 minutes with 40 AFSCME members that would be held\nin Iowa.  Amanda, do you mean check in with Matt/Molly on where this event\nwould fit into schedule?  I know the scheduling team is working on this\ntoo.\n\nOn Sat, Jul 18, 2015 at 8:59 PM, Amanda Renteria <\narenteria@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\n> Agree on whip strategy.\n>\n> Nikki, Looking at the priorities below can you touch base w our Iowa folks\n> and see what something could look like btwn now and sept10.
