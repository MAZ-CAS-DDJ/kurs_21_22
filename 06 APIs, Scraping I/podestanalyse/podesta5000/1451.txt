Biden will heighten the level of environmental discourse on the campaign trail and, as Vice President, will be a strong voice for a new, clean energy future for this country.\n\n"With a lifetime LCV environmental score of 83%, Joe Biden recognizes that ending our addiction to oil is vital to our national security," LCV President Gene Karpinski said.  "Senator Biden is a long-time leader on key energy and environmental issues, and the members of LCV enthusiastically support Senator Obama\'s choice."\n\nIn 2007 alone, Biden voted to strengthen CAF\xc9 standards and to repeal unjust subsidies to oil companies.  In 1986, he introduced the first bill designed to limit global warming pollution.\n\nBiden has been a leader on global warming issues, chairing Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on the national security implications of unchecked global warming. He teamed with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to co-author and pass a resolution calling on the Bush Administration to return to international negotiations to address climate change.   He has sponsored and supported numerous bills throughout his career that would decrease America\'s dependence on foreign oil and increase investment in new technologies and renewable fuels.  Biden has sponsored a bill to increase fuel economy standards for all automobiles, voted yes on reducing oil usage by 40% by 2025, and rejected drilling in ANWR; measures that have strong environmental and economic benefits for America.\n\n"Barack Obama\'s plan for global warming and energy independence is the most substantive, comprehensive plan ever put forward by a nominee for President," said Karpinski. "Biden\'s progressive energy stance will only serve to augment Obama\'s visionary plan.  They will usher in a new era of environmental leadership."\n\n\n# # #\n\n[cid:3302321395_17436242]\n\n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
