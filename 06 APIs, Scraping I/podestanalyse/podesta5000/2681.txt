I will send over some notes from Mike and\nDennis ASAP. They're not sure yet if it will just be you or if Stephanie\nSmith from the finance team will join. Timothy (finance staffer driving\nyou) will get directions and drive you there.\n\n*TONIGHT- Spahn, Nides, Katzenberg Dinner *\nAndy Spahn invited you to join him and Nides at the Katzenberg's home for\ndinner at 8:00pm. They reached out to me as well to see if you can join.\nYour HFA event ends at 8:00pm downtown. The Katzenberg's house in Beverly\nHills is a solid 35 minute drive away, but it's close to your hotel (the\nBeverly Hilton). *You could join late or just join for a drink-- let me\nknow what you'd like to do. *\n\n-- \nMilia Fisher\nSpecial Assistant to the Chair\nHillary for America\nmfisher@hillaryclinton.com\nc: 858.395.1741\n"
