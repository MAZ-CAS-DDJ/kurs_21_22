Today, tens of thousands of\nworkers, students, religious groups, and concerned citizens are\nturning out once again in Madison to protest Walker's attack on\nteachers, nurses, social workers, and other public employees. The\nstandoff in Wisconsin has focused the attention of the entire nation\non the consequences of right-wing fiscal irresponsibility.\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=FsVjkQY4u-0XLiR7pGXEpg..\n\nTomorrow, Colorado stands with them. Will you join us?\n\nWhat: Stand in Support of Wisconsin\nWhere: Colorado State Capitol, Denver\nWhen: Tuesday, February 22, 2011 12:00PM\n\nHere in Colorado, we are fortunate to have largely avoided the\nextremist takeover of state government that's provoking the crisis in\nWisconsin. Gov. Walker of Wisconsin is manipulating his state's budget\nto attack his own workers; we're gratfeul that Colorado made better\nchoices, and that's not what is happening here. But our state still\nfaces a daunting budget shortfall for the coming year, and our own\nteachers, nurses, and working families across our state are going to\nsuffer. What Colorado needs right now is a plan for the voters to end\nour state's chronic inability to pay for basic and essential\nfunctions--once and for all.\n\nThat's our message to Colorado lawmakers, and to our friends in\nWisconsin. Join us tomorrow at the Colorado State Capitol, and let's\nmake sure everyone hears it.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlan Franklin\n\n\n\n\xa9 2010 ProgressNow Colorado.
