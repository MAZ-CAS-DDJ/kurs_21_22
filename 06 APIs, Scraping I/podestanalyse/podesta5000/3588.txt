NNU Endorsement-The coverage of the NNU endorsement has included\nmention that their CA affiliate endorsed Nader in 2000, that this was not a\nsurprise endorsement for our campaign and that NNU does not put financial\nresources behind their endorsement.  We also provided a AFT Nurse leader\nand rank and file member to speak with the press.  AP spoke with the AFT\nnurse Local President.  Shout out to AFT to pulling this together.\n\n2.  UFCW-They are beginning their internal endorsement process which will\nbegin with a member survey of candidates.  They will circle back on the\nresults and engage.  They are requesting that the Secretary attend their\nRetail Conference on October 20th.  I will flag that for the scheduling\nteam.  I wanted to make sure you knew they were moving a process.\n\n3. Trade Unions (IUPAT, Operating Engineers and BAC) are getting anxious to\nmove to endorse HRC.  I am coordinating with the Building Trades Council.\nI suspect the Operating Engineers, who are close with the Carpenters, are\ninterested in moving soon now that they've heard the Carpenters might move\nsoon.  An endorsement by the Operating Engineers is a big deal...they do\nnot traditionally endorse in primaries.\n\n4.  We had at least 39 call ins from labor today to the College Compact\npre-call with Ann O'Leary, including President Randi Weingarten.  AFT also\nissued a press release in support of the plan today.\n-- \n\n\nNikki Budzinski\nLabor Outreach Director\nHillary for America\n646-854-1442 (direct)\n"
