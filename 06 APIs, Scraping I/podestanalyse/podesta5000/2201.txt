Polls show him deadlocked with Barbara Comstock, but his record is being smeared 24 hours a day on Virginia T.V.\n\nSo, I\'m asking. Can you pitch in for John before tonight\'s fundraising deadline so he has the resources to set the record straight?\n\nALL GIFTS MATCHED\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/foustq42014?refcode=em_FR_2014.10.25_b2_jf_ldnd&amp;amp;amount=25&amp;amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;amp;firstname=John&amp;amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;amp;city=Washington&amp;amp;state=DC&amp;amp;zip=20016&amp;amp;phone=2162818851&amp;amp;occupation=&amp;amp;employer=&amp;amp;recur_weekly=true\n\nSome of John\'s strong supporters have agreed to match dollar for dollar any funds raised from this email.\n\nhttp://act.foustforvirginia.com/Fight-For-Virginia\n\nThanks for everything,\n\nTim\n\n\nThis message was emailed to: podesta@law.georgetown.edu\n\nTo unsubscribe from this email list, please paste this URL into your browser: \nhttp://act.foustforvirginia.com/unsubscribe\n\nPaid for by John Foust for Congress\n\n'
