But she saved her strongest words for\ncriticizing the Republican contenders, who she said \xe2\x80\x9cseemed determined to\nlead us right back into the past\xe2\x80\x9d on those and other issues.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of trying to turn back the clock, they should be joining us in\nsaying loudly and clearly saying no \xe2\x80\x94 no to discrimination, once and for\nall,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am asking them, please, don\xe2\x80\x99t make the rights,\nthe hopes of any American into a political football for this 2016 campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFollowing the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision Friday morning, several Republican\npresidential hopefuls, including Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Gov. Bobby\nJindal of Louisiana, and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, called for a\nconstitutional amendment allowing states to define marriage as they wish.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton, who has repeatedly argued for \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense\xe2\x80\x9d gun control\nmeasures since the shootings last week, also drew attention to a vote by\nthe Republican-led House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday against an\namendment that would have channeled increased funding to the Centers of\nDisease Control to study gun violence.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you watch massacre after massacre and take that vote?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\nClinton said.\n\n\n\nShe proceeded to critique the Republicans systematically on a long list of\nissues, from the Affordable Care Act to climate change to women\xe2\x80\x99s\nreproductive health, and without using his name, again rebuked Donald J.\nTrump for referring to Mexican immigrants in his campaign announcement\nspeech this week as rapists and criminals.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton opened her speech, though, by addressing the court\xe2\x80\x99s same-sex\nmarriage ruling directly. She called it a triumph for love, equality and\nthe country, and read aloud the concluding portion of the court\xe2\x80\x99s majority\nopinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x99s decision confirms we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working toward equality as a nation,\nstep by step, case by case, court by court, and that equality has been\nright there in the Constitution all along,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is\nsomething quite remarkable about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHer remarks came before the Democratic Party of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s annual Jefferson\nJackson Dinner at George Mason University here. Before taking the stage,\nshe spent the afternoon in Charleston, where she attended the funeral of\nRev. Clementa C. Pinckney, a state senator and the pastor of Emanuel\nAfrican Methodist Episcopal Church, who was killed there along with eight\nothers in a mass shooting last week.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Virginia was the first since declaring her\ncandidacy in April. It is also one of her first campaign events outside the\nearly primary states. She has close ties to Democrats in the state, but\nVirginia is expected to be hotly contested in 2016.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton is already campaigning in Virginia, and this is why.\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/hillary-clinton-is-already-campaigning-in-virginia-and-this-is-why/2015/06/26/15371652-1b7b-11e5-bd7f-4611a60dd8e5_story.html>\n// WaPo // Rachel Weiner \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nDemocratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton will make her campaign debut\nin Virginia on Friday night, her first stop as a presidential candidate in\na state that Republicans feel they must win if they are to recapture the\nWhite House.\n\n\n\nClinton will headline a Democratic rally at the Patriot Center at George\nMason University in Fairfax, which has replaced the annual party dinner in\nRichmond. Democratic leaders are hoping enthusiasm for the former secretary\nof state will inspire activists to start mobilizing for this fall.\n\n\n\nThe visit is one of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s first forays outside the early primary\nstates, a sign of how critical Virginia is to both Democrats and\nRepublicans in 2016. State legislative elections in November, with control\nof the state Senate at stake, will be an early sign of which party is\nbetter mobilized for 2016.\n\n\n\nVirginia Democratic Party spokeswoman Morgan Finkelstein said the goal is\nfor attendees to come away thinking that \xe2\x80\x9cthe time to kick it into gear has\ncome \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s not September, it\xe2\x80\x99s not next fall, it\xe2\x80\x99s now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s task is to deliver that burst of enthusiasm. With the official\nlaunch of her campaign earlier this month, she has been shifting from small\nroundtables to larger rallies. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), her\nsocialist-leaning Democratic rival, is competing with her on that front,\ndrawing huge crowds in Iowa and elsewhere as he attacks Clinton from the\nleft.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s reached Virginia early because Virginia is going to be probably one\nof the two or three most important states,\xe2\x80\x9d said Quentin Kidd, director of\nthe Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t perform well, if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t energize and kind of send a\nlittle bit of energy through the core of the Democratic Party in Virginia,\nit could just make things in Virginia more difficult for her to get going.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nTo repeat President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s success in the state in 2008 and 2012, Clinton\nwill need to in particular turn out Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s Hispanic and African\nAmerican voters in large numbers.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign would not offer any details on her\nspeech, beyond that she will be \xe2\x80\x9csharing her vision for Virginians that\nwill help them get ahead, and stay ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRepublicans see the state as equally critical. Republican National\nCommittee Chairman Reince Priebus is giving a news conference Friday\nafternoon outside the site of the Clinton event, joined by state party\nchairman and 2014 U.S. Senate candidate Ed Gillespie.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA quick stop in the state for a Democrat fundraiser won\xe2\x80\x99t win back the\ntrust of the voters still waiting for answers from Hillary Clinton,\xe2\x80\x9d RNC\nspokeswoman Ali Pardo said in a statement.\n\n\n\nGillespie and Priebus have been helping to rebuild a state party that is\nfractured and financially strained by ideological division. The GOP has\nbeen recruiting minority candidates in Virginia in an effort to expand its\nbase.\n\n\n\nGov. Terry McAuliffe (D), a close friend of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s who will introduce\nher Friday evening, has said repeatedly that the best way to help her win\nis to focus on the state\xe2\x80\x99s economy.\n\n\n\nBut he has also made several recent moves that will appeal to the\nDemocratic base. He engaged in the state primaries, helping unseat a\nconservative Democrat and propel his preferred candidates to victory. He is\nphasing out Confederate license plates in the state, launching a study of\nwhether to bring back parole and easing the restoration of voting rights\nfor ex-felons. In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable\nCare Act, he is pushing again for Medicaid expansion despite firm\nRepublican opposition.\n\n\n\nThousands are expected to turn out for Clinton, but the shift from a\nrelatively intimate dinner in a hotel ballroom to a giant event has vexed\nsome party activists.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople were disappointed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry Wiggins, chairman of the Prince\nWilliam County Democratic Party, who is not attending the event. \xe2\x80\x9cI think a\nlot of people were surprised that it\xe2\x80\x99s turning into essentially a pep\nrally.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFinkelstein said the party was planning to hold a more traditional dinner\nlater this year.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople do not like change,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairfax Democratic Party Chairwoman Sue\nLangley. But she said she was looking forward to the Clinton rally,\nespecially because \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t have to dress up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*LGBT Issues, Racism, Immigration: Hillary Clinton Pitches Herself As A\n\xe2\x80\x9cFighter\xe2\x80\x9d For All Occasions\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/lgbt-issues-racism-immigration-hillary-clinton-pitches-herse#.goz646VgW>\n// Buzzfeed // Ruby Cramer \xe2\x80\x93 June 27, 2015*\n\n\n\nFAIRFAX, Va. \xe2\x80\x94 On a Saturday night in April \xe2\x80\x94 hours before Hillary Clinton\ndeclared herself a candidate for president \xe2\x80\x94 advisers previewed her\ncampaign message for the first time. The crux was this: She would be a\n\xe2\x80\x9ctenacious fighter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nLater that week, she unveiled the pillars of her campaign \xe2\x80\x94 the \xe2\x80\x9cfour\nfights.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd at her first rally two months later \xe2\x80\x94 when she ascended an H-shaped\nstage on Roosevelt Island to explain, with a careful mixing of biography\nand position, her reasons for running \xe2\x80\x94 she cast herself repeatedly as a\n\xe2\x80\x9cfighter for all Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe characterization, reinforced in official memos and emails and reprinted\nfrequently in the press, has acted increasingly as the discernible\nthrough-line in a campaign that has already sought to address a vast spread\nof policy issues: mass incarceration, immigration, small businesses, voting\nrights, the economy.\n\n\n\nAt a Virginia Democratic Party dinner here on Friday night, the Clinton\ncampaign turned to the same theme again to address the last nine days \xe2\x80\x94 a\nperiod that began with a mass shooting at a black church in Charleston,\nSouth Carolina, and ended with the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in favor of\nnationwide same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\nTerry McAuliffe, the governor of Virginia and an old friend of the\nClintons, introduced the candidate at George Mason University\xe2\x80\x99s Patriot\nCenter. Clinton, he said, was \xe2\x80\x9csmart.\xe2\x80\x9d She was \xe2\x80\x9ctough.\xe2\x80\x9d She was\n\xe2\x80\x9ccompassionate.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he paused. \xe2\x80\x9cBut most of all, why do I love Hillary\nClinton?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause Hillary Clinton is a tenacious fighter,\xe2\x80\x9d McAuliffe told the crowd\nof 2,000 in the arena. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s been beaten up, she\xe2\x80\x99s been knocked down, but\nevery time she does, she gets right back up. She dusts herself off, and she\ngets right back in that arena again, folks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhile other political figures were reticent to discuss the racial\nmotivations behind the shooting, McAuliffe said, Clinton \xe2\x80\x9cstepped forward\nand began a national conversation about race [and] gun violence.\xe2\x80\x9d The week\nafter nine died in Charleston, Clinton described the killings \xe2\x80\x9can act of\nracist terrorism.\xe2\x80\x9d And earlier on Friday, she attended the funeral of one\nof the victims, Rev. Clementa Pinckney.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s tempting to dismiss a terrible tragedy like Charleston as\nan isolated incident, to believe that in today\xe2\x80\x99s America bigotry is largely\nbehind us,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said on Friday night.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut despite our best efforts, and our highest hopes, America\xe2\x80\x99s long\nstruggle with racism is far from finished. And let\xe2\x80\x99s be honest, let\xe2\x80\x99s be\nhonest, despite today\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, our struggle to end LGBT discrimination is\nalso far from finished.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s because fear and hatred are far from finished. And so our march\ngoes on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn one, long line that closed her speech \xe2\x80\x94 and moved the arena into a\nstanding ovation \xe2\x80\x94 Clinton pitched herself as the president to best wage\nthat fight.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go to bat for the successful, the striving, and the struggling; for\nthe innovators and the inventors; for the factory workers and food servers\nwho stand on their feet all day; for the nurses who work the night shift;\nfor the truckers who drive for hours,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, starting to lose her\nbreath, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the farmers who feed us; for the veterans who served our\ncountry; for the small business owners who took a risk; for the gay couple\nwho loved each other; for the black child who still lives in the shadow of\ndiscrimination; and the Hispanic child who still lives in the shadow of\ndeportation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as Terry said,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton told the crowd, winding down, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m on the\nside for everyone who\xe2\x80\x99s every been knocked down but refused to be knocked\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will always stand my ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhen she finished speaking, Clinton moved from the podium to shake hands\nbelow the stage, and the loudspeakers filled the hall with a song by pop\nsinger Kris Allen that the campaign will no doubt play again and again and\nagain.\n\n\n\nThey could knock you down and make you fall\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll get back up cause after all\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re born to be fighters.\n\n\n\n*Clinton camp weekend plans: Energize states besides Iowa and New Hampshire\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/26/politics/clinton-campaign-grassroots-muscle/index.html>\n// CNN // Dan Merica \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\'s campaign aides have long said they are focused on Iowa,\nNew Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada - the four critical early\nnominating states. This weekend, the campaign turns its focus to the other\n46 states.\n\n\n\nClinton campaign aides, volunteers and supporters will hold over 200\nactivities and events in the 46-non early nominating states this weekend,\ncampaign officials told CNN on Friday.\n\n\n\nEvents will include phone banks, happy hours and house parties. Volunteers\nwill canvas at a farmer\'s market in Oahu, Hawaii, march in a gay pride\nparade in San Francisco and make phone calls at a bingo hall in Durant,\nOklahoma, among other events.\n\n\n\nThe 72-hour push -- called the "Weekend of Action" -- serves multiple\npractical and symbolic purposes for the campaign.\n\n\n\nSymbolically, the simultaneous activities will also help aides rebut\nquestions about the excitement around the Clinton campaign. Since the\nformer first lady announced, political watches and critics have questioned\nwhether Democrats are as excited for Clinton as they were for President\nBarack Obama in 2008.\n\n\n\nIt is unclear whether each event this weekend will be well attended and the\nproof of success in sparking excitement will be good turnout, but aides\nwill likely use the 200-event push to show Clinton\'s broad support across\nthe country.\n\n\n\nDespite describing themselves as a small, scrappy operation, the Clinton\ncampaign has grown quickly since the former secretary of state announced\nher presidential run in April. Shortly after announcing, the campaign\ndispatched at least one volunteer to each state and territory.\n\n\n\nThis 72-hour spree is meant to serve a similar purpose: It is a way for the\ncampaign to flex its grassroots muscle, especially to other Democratic\ncampaigns who don\'t currently have the operation to put together this kind\nof a show of force.\n\n\n\n*SOCIAL MEDIA*\n\n\n\n*Ben Jacobs (6/26/15, 6:27 AM)*\n<file:///C:\\Martin%20O\'Malley\\%20%22there%20are%20real%20lessons%20to%20be%20learned%20from%20the%20tragedy%20in#Benghazi.">*\n- Martin O\'Malley: "there are real lessons to be learned from the tragedy\nin #Benghazi."*\n\n\n\n*Ben Jacobs (6/26/15, 6:28 AM)*\n<https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/614425052302471168>* - This speech\nis the first time any Democrat has mentioned #Benghazi in 2016*\n\n\n\n*Ben Jacobs (6/26/15, 6:28 AM)*\n<https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/614424973382418432>* - O\'Malley now\nmentions Ambassador Chris Stevens in discussing #Benghazi*\n\n\n\n*Alex Seitz-Wald (6/26/15, 6:28 AM)*\n<https://twitter.com/aseitzwald/status/614425244095389700>* - O\'Malley\ninvokes Benghazi, but quickly moves on.

She celebrated on Thursday the court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling to affirm a key\npart of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Affordable Care Act, writing on Twitter: \xe2\x80\x9cYes!\nSCOTUS affirms what we know is true in our hearts and under the law: Health\ninsurance should be affordable & available to all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd she has implored the justices to rule that states cannot ban same-sex\nmarriage.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton will likely address both cases in the Virginia address, but\nthe state, with its large black population, will also present her the\nopportunity to continue her remarks on race and what she calls \xe2\x80\x9ccommon\nsense gun control\xe2\x80\x9d in the aftermath of the attack at a black church in\nCharleston, S.C.\n\n\n\nVirginia represents a trend indicator of sorts in the 2016 race. For the\nClinton campaign, the goal will be to appeal to a broad cross-section of\nblack and white voters.\n\n\n\nSenator Barack Obama won the state in 2008, the first time a Democratic\npresidential nominee captured Virginia since President Lyndon B. Johnson in\n1964. President Obama also defeated Mitt Romney in Virginia in 2012.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton has deep ties to Virginia. A longtime ally and fund-raiser for\nBill and Hillary Clinton, Terry McAuliffe, was elected governor in 2013.\n\n\n\nMr. McAuliffe\xe2\x80\x99s campaign manager in that close election, Robby Mook, now\nruns Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign and is introducing a similar data-driven\ngrass-roots strategy. He brought with him an army of young operatives (the\nso-called Mook Mafia), many of whom helped Mr. McAuliffe defeat his\nconservative Republican opponent, Ken Cuccinelli.\n\n\n\n*Clinton Volunteers On Hunt For Brooklyn Apartments\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/realestate/clinton-volunteers-on-hunt-for-brooklyn-apartments.html?_r=0>\n// NYT // Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nWhen Jesse Lehrich heard he might have a chance to work on Hillary Rodham\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign, he did what most young staffers did. He\nmoved to New York as an unpaid volunteer until Mrs. Clinton officially\nannounced her candidacy and opened her headquarters in Downtown Brooklyn.\n\n\n\nFirst, he stayed with his brother in a one-bedroom in Carroll Gardens,\nBrooklyn, until his eight boxes of clothes in the living room started to\nbecome annoying.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said: \xe2\x80\x98I hope this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a long-term solution, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t let you\nsleep on the street,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Lehrich, who turns 26 this weekend, said of his\nolder brother.\n\n\n\nEventually, he found a room in an East Village apartment just above the\nglowing red silhouette of a rooster that marks the famed gay bar the Cock.\n\n\n\nMr. Lehrich has three roommates and his room does not have windows, but at\n$1,700 a month (partly paid for with his saved-up bar mitzvah money), the\nprice was right. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing is working and sleeping,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cso\nwho needs windows?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFor decades, idealistic twenty-somethings have shunned higher-paying and\nmore permanent jobs for the altruism and adrenaline rush of working to get\na candidate to the White House. But the staffers who have signed up for the\nClinton campaign face a daunting obstacle: the New York City real estate\nmarket.\n\n\n\nIn Iowa and New Hampshire, \xe2\x80\x9csupporter housing,\xe2\x80\x9d the practice of locals\nhosting the army of young volunteers who descend on the state each election\ncycle, is a time-honored tradition. Every political organizer has tales of\ntalking about the days of F.D.R. with an old lady in Waterloo or sharing a\nbunk bed with the son of a union organizer in Manchester. But in New York,\nthe situation is not so straightforward. Few New Yorkers have the extra\nspace of, say, a farmhouse in Iowa. The wealthy donors who contribute to\nMrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign have proved more comfortable cutting a check than\nopening their TriBeCa lofts and Upper East Side townhouses to strangers.\nAnd Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign prides itself on living on the cheap and\nkeeping salaries low, which is good for its own bottom line, but difficult\nfor those who need to pay New York City rents.\n\n\n\nThe lack of affordable housing has put an added burden on the Clinton\ncampaign to play a Craigslist-like role in finding staffers a place to\nsleep, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s pairing them with roommates or pleading with supporters\nfor a spare room.\n\n\n\nJasmin Harris, a 22-year-old Clinton campaign worker, had been matched with\na middle-age couple who agreed to host her in their Brooklyn Heights\napartment. They even did her laundry. But after six weeks, they had\nout-of-town family coming to visit and needed the spare room back, and Ms.\nHarris was waiting on a recent afternoon for the campaign to pair her with\nanother supporter. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly where I\xe2\x80\x99m going, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\nsomewhere else tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have my bags packed and am waiting\nfor an email.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA recent email from the campaign pleaded with donors to provide staffers\nwith \xe2\x80\x9ca spare room \xe2\x80\x94 or just a spare couch!\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cyou and I both know\nthat finding a place to live in New York can take longer than an afternoon\nof apartment hunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMarc Lasry, a hedge fund manager, a major Democratic donor and a friend of\nthe Clintons, let the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s communications director, Jennifer\nPalmieri, stay in his family\xe2\x80\x99s Manhattan home, a penthouse on Central Park\nWest, for a handful of nights early on. The city, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis expensive,\nparticularly for young people. We have five children, so we are used to\nhaving a lot of people around, and we\xe2\x80\x99re happy to put up folks from the\ncampaign.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Lasry is not the norm. When the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s finance director, Dennis\nCheng, reached out to New York donors, some of them seemed concerned with\nthe prospective maze of campaign finance laws and with how providing\nupscale housing in New York City might be interpreted. Several of the hedge\nfund managers and finance titans who support Mrs. Clinton hosted would-be\naides before the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s start in April, but ended the practice once a\nformal campaign existed. (A campaign finance lawyer, Kenneth A. Gross of\nSkadden, Arps, said, however, that hosting campaign workers would not be\nconsidered an in-kind donation.)\n\n\n\nScott Murphy, a former congressman representing the area outside Albany,\nhosted Josh Schwerin, 29, a press aide on the campaign who previously\nworked for Mr. Murphy, in his Upper West Side co-op before the campaign\nstarted.\n\n\n\nMr. Schwerin got what used to serve as a maid\xe2\x80\x99s room. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could touch both\nwalls if you were on the air mattress, and the bathroom was through the\nkitchen, so he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of privacy,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Murphy said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cit was in line with what he paid for it.\xe2\x80\x9d (Which was, of course,\nnothing.) Mr. Schwerin later found an apartment near Fort Greene Park, a\n12-minute walk to the office.\n\n\n\nMany of the campaign workers who moved to Brooklyn from across the country\nwere unfamiliar with the borough and thought it would offer cheaper prices\nthan \xe2\x80\x9cthe city\xe2\x80\x9d (read: Manhattan). But in the past year, average rents in\nBrooklyn have risen by 4.3 percent, nearly twice the increase of those in\nManhattan, to $3,252 a month. Rents in Brooklyn Heights, a neighborhood\nadjacent to campaign headquarters, are the highest in the borough,\naccording to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller\nSamuel.\n\n\n\nThe campaign has worked with the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce for guidance\non where staffers could find housing. The chamber suggested Clinton Hill,\nBedford-Stuyvesant, Bensonhurst and Dyker Heights, but has not made much\nprogress in convincing staffers to consider these less gentrified\nneighborhoods, said Carlo A. Scissura, the president and chief executive of\nthe chamber.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese folks are coming from all parts of the country to work for Hillary,\nand the broker says, \xe2\x80\x98I want 15 percent of annual rent,\xe2\x80\x99 and they\xe2\x80\x99re like\n\xe2\x80\x98What are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d said David J. Maundrell III, the founder of\naptsandlofts.com, a real estate brokerage specializing in Brooklyn.\n\n\n\nSome have had luck at a rental building on the edge of Downtown Brooklyn,\nAvalon Fort Greene, where at least six Clinton aides have taken up\nresidence, prompting some campaign staffers to affectionately call it \xe2\x80\x9cthe\ndorm,\xe2\x80\x9d a reference to their small quarters and proximity to one another.\n\n\n\nAdrienne Elrod, 39, a campaign spokeswoman, is originally from Arkansas but\nmoved to Brooklyn from Washington with her corgi-terrier mix, Bernie (not\nnamed after Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s primary opponent Senator Bernie Sanders). If she\nstretches her arms far enough in her tidy studio in \xe2\x80\x9cthe dorm,\xe2\x80\x9d she can\nalmost touch the foot of her bed and her kitchen countertop at the same\ntime.\n\n\n\nAn exercise aficionado, Ms. Elrod has a bike resting against a patch of\nbare wall. Her refrigerator is adorned with a few stickers, including the\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x9d logo with an arrow that symbolizes Hillary for America.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a 10-minute walk from the office,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Elrod said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s easy to come\nhome in the middle of the day to walk the dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMarlon Marshall, 35, a veteran organizer who is now the director of state\ncampaigns and political engagement for the Clinton campaign, crashed in the\nspring with the pollster Joel Benenson in his Upper East Side co-op.\n\n\n\nMr. Benenson recalled sleeping on a friend\xe2\x80\x99s couch in New York City during\nMario Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s campaign for governor in 1994, when his family was living in\nAlbany. And in 2008, during the Obama campaign, when Mr. Benenson still\nlived in New Jersey, he and his wife, Lisa, played host to four young\norganizers.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe refer to them as our Obama kids,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. So when he was asked to\nhouse campaign staffers this time, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate. \xe2\x80\x9cWe hardly ever saw\nMarlon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of Mr. Marshall, who primarily used the place to sleep for\na few hours before going back to work.\n\n\n\nMr. Marshall, who had never lived in New York before, ended up renting a\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s two-bedroom apartment in a Fort Greene co-op, an eight-minute walk\nfrom the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters.\n\n\n\nHe now hosts a rotating cast of staffers in his spare bedroom and in his\nfree time explores the borough. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been to the Smorgasburg, and it is\nthe greatest thing in my life,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Marshall said of the borough\xe2\x80\x99s popular\nweekly food festival.\n\n\n\n*Cheering Marriage Decision, Hillary Clinton Heads to Provincetown\n<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/26/cheering-marriage-decision-hillary-clinton-heads-to-provincetown/>\n// NYT // Amy Chozick \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton transformed her H-and-an-arrow campaign logo into a\ngay-rights rainbow on Friday to mark the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s same-sex marriage\nruling. She issued a statement calling the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9can affirmation\nof the commitment of couples across the country who love one another.\xe2\x80\x9d Her\ncampaign sells a variety of branded \xe2\x80\x9cHillary\xe2\x80\x9d items timed to June\xe2\x80\x99s Gay\nPride Month.\n\n\n\nBut on Thursday, Mrs. Clinton will make perhaps her most gay-friendly move:\nShe will visit Provincetown, Mass.\n\n\n\nThe seaside enclave \xe2\x80\x94 in the state that was first to legalize same-sex\nmarriage \xe2\x80\x94 has long been a Shangri-La for gay men and lesbians who enjoy\nraucous, romantic or just relaxing weekends in the scenic city at the\nnorthern tip of Cape Cod.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, the Census reported that Provincetown had 163.1 same-sex couples\nper 1,000 people, the most of any city in the country.\n\n\n\nAs much as it may call to mind drag-queen pool parties or kitschy\nrainbow-festooned nightclubs, Provincetown has served a far more serious\npurpose: Historically, it was one of the few resort locales where gay men\nand lesbians could openly enjoy a vacation without the threat of\ndiscrimination or worse.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton, who maintains strong support among gay people, and whose\ncampaign recently released a video showing same-sex couples before and\nduring their weddings, will attend a fund-raiser in Provincetown hosted by\nBryan Rafanelli, an event planner, and Alix Ritchie, a prominent gay-rights\nactivist. The event is part of a string of fund-raisers Mrs. Clinton has\narranged in and around Boston in early July.\n\n\n\nIt was planned weeks ago \xe2\x80\x94 but just became extremely well timed.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Long Road to Supporting Gay Marriage\n<http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/06/26/hillary-clintons-long-road-to-supporting-gay-marriage/>\n// WSJ // Peter Nicholas \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton applauded the Supreme Court ruling that legalizes gay\nmarriage nationwide, putting out a statement Friday praising the gay rights\nactivists who \xe2\x80\x9csacrificed so much for this victory.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nYet it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so long ago that these same activists might have seen Mrs.\nClinton as an adversary on the issue.\n\n\n\nFor most of her career in politics Mrs. Clinton supported many gay-rights\nstances but opposed same-sex marriage, favoring arrangements like civil\nunions that fell short of marriage. Not until 2013 did she take the\nposition that gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry.\n\n\n\nHer evolution has largely tracked public opinion. As the country has gotten\nmore comfortable with same sex marriage, Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s opposition has\nsoftened.\n\n\n\nFacing re-election in 1996, her husband Bill Clinton signed the Defense of\nMarriage Act, which described marriage as the union of a man and a woman.\n\n\n\nThat was Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s position on the matter, too.\n\n\n\nRunning for a U.S. senate seat in New York, Mrs. Clinton in 2000 said:\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarriage has got historic, religious and moral content that goes back to\nthe beginning of time, and I think a marriage is as a marriage has always\nbeen, between a man and a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhatever her position on gay marriage, she maintained strong political ties\nto members of the gay community. In that same Senate race, she collected\n$125,000 from a fundraising event organized by a gay activist in New York,\nThe Wall Street Journal reported at the time.\n\n\n\nAs a sitting senator in 2004, she spoke on the Senate floor against a\nproposed constitutional amendment barring same sex marriage. Yet she\nmaintained that \xe2\x80\x9cmarriage is not just a bond, but a sacred bond between a\nman and a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA wrinkle emerged in 2006 when, according to press reports, she told a\ngroup of gay elected officials that if New York state officials were to\nlegalize gay marriage, she would not oppose such a move.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cObviously my friends and people who spoke to me \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99ve had many long\nconversations and I think \xe2\x80\xa6 that the way that I have spoken and I have\nadvocated has certainly evolved and I am happy to be educated and to learn\nas much as I can,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nShe maintained her opposition to same sex marriage as a candidate for\npresident in 2008 \xe2\x80\x93 as did the ultimate winner, Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nA secretary of state doesn\xe2\x80\x99t normally wade into politically-fraught\ndomestic debates. So, as Mr. Obama and Vice President Joe Biden announced\ntheir support for same sex marriage in 2012, Mrs. Clinton didn\xe2\x80\x99t choose to\nweigh in. In March 2013, though \xe2\x80\x94 two after she stepped down as secretary\nof state \xe2\x80\x94 she proclaimed her support for same sex marriage.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI support it personally and as a matter of policy and law,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nEvaluating whether she has flip-flopped, PolitiFact, an independent\nfact-checker, wrote last week that when it comes to gay marriage, \xe2\x80\x9cwe give\nClinton a Full Flop.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Undisclosed Clinton Emails Seen Prompting Broader Congressional Inquiry\n<http://www.wsj.com/articles/undisclosed-clinton-emails-seen-prompting-broader-congressional-inquiry-1435368333>\n// WSJ // Bryon Tau \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON\xe2\x80\x94Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s failure to turn over\nat least 15 work-related emails to the State Department is expected to\nprompt a broader congressional inquiry into her email practices while she\nserved in the Obama administration.\n\n\n\nThe State Department revealed this week that a small number of emails were\nmissing in part or in whole from their archive of more than 55,000 pages of\nwork-related emails that Mrs. Clinton gave to the department last year.\n\n\n\nThose emails were obtained by the House Select Committee investigating the\n2012 Benghazi attacks from Sidney Blumenthal, a close confident and former\naid of Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\n\n\nRepublican lawmakers involved in the investigation said the revelations\nraised new and troubling questions about the Democratic presidential\ncandidate\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the law.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks like the State Department didn\xe2\x80\x99t give us everything that\nBlumenthal did, and Hillary Clinton didn\xe2\x80\x99t give everything to the State\nDepartment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican on the panel\ninvestigating the matter.\n\n\n\nAs Secretary of State, Mrs. Clinton exclusively used her own email account\nrun off a personal server for all her work-related correspondence in an\narrangement that was legal though discouraged during her time in\ngovernment. The arrangement has prompted questions about whether Mrs.\nClinton has complied with records laws that require preservation of federal\nrecords.\n\n\n\nThe emails\xe2\x80\x99 absence in State Department records contradicts Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\npublic claims that she turned over all relevant federal records before\ndeleting her entire email server. In a March news conference, Mrs. Clinton\nassured reporters that her attorneys did a thorough search before turning\nover all work-related correspondence as required by federal record-keeping\nlaws.\n\n\n\nThe revelations also intensified calls for Mrs. Clinton to turn over her\npersonal email server to a neutral third party\xe2\x80\x94a call that Republicans on\nthe Benghazi committee have been making for months.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe not only want to see it\xe2\x80\x94but the American people deserve to have those\nofficial documents that were contained on her private server,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rep.\nMike Pompeo about the email server.\n\n\n\nThe State Department acknowledged Friday that the 15 missing emails\nappeared to be work-related and not personal\xe2\x80\x94and therefore should have been\ngiven by Mrs. Clinton to the department.\n\n\n\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said he couldn\'t account for why they\nweren\'t produced by Mrs. Clinton initially and that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t certain that\nthe department was in possession of her full set of emails.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless you have another inventory to check it against, like in this case\nwe had Mr. Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s emails\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for Mrs. Clinton said that \xe2\x80\x9cshe has turned over 55,000 pages of\nmaterials to the State Department, including all emails in her possession\nfrom Mr. Blumenthal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Pompeo, a Republican member of the panel, said he was \xe2\x80\x9cdoing everything\nthat we have the power to do\xe2\x80\x9d to get answers from Mrs. Clinton.\n\n\n\nMr. Kirby said that the department wouldn\'t itself investigate whether it\nwas in possession of all of Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s emails. The department\xe2\x80\x99s\nindependent inspector general is conducting a general review of information\nmanagement, but a spokesman for the IG didn\xe2\x80\x99t say whether Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nemails would be part of the scope of the investigation.\n\n\n\nDemocrats have accused the Benghazi panel of straying from its original\nmission of investigating the 2012 terrorist attack. \xe2\x80\x9cThis Benghazi select\ncommittee has become the committee to investigate Hillary Clinton. Period,\xe2\x80\x9d\nRep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the panel, said last week.\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) has said he is open to the\npossibility of subpoenaing the server. A spokesman declined to comment.\nBenghazi committee chairman Trey Gowdy (R., S.C.) said he was \xe2\x80\x9cconsidering\ncarefully\xe2\x80\x9d his committee\xe2\x80\x99s next steps.\n\n\n\nRichard Painter, a White House ethics lawyer under President George W.\nBush, said that running one\xe2\x80\x99s own personal server email server instead of\nusing government email means \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re stuck with the consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have hundreds of thousands of emails and you start using your\npersonal emails, stuff could get lost,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\n*From opposition to embrace: Obama\'s and Clinton\'s public evolution on\nsame-sex marriage\n<http://www.startribune.com/for-obama-and-clinton-twisty-paths-to-yes-on-gay-marriage/310249391/>\n// AP // Jim Kuhnhenn and Lisa Lerer \xe2\x80\x93 June 27, 2015*\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 When President Barack Obama praised the Supreme Court\'s\nwatershed same-sex marriage ruling, he held it up as evidence that a "shift\nin hearts and minds is possible."\n\n\n\nObama may well have been describing his own public trajectory on gay unions\n\xe2\x80\x94 a complicated path that took him through opposition and ambivalence to\nenthusiastic embrace.\n\n\n\nHis journey is not unlike the rest of America. But over the years he has\nworn his uncertainty on his sleeve, publicly musing about his stance before\nbecoming a full-throated advocate for marriage and other aspects of gay\nrights.\n\n\n\n"When all Americans are treated as equal, we are all more free," Obama\ndeclared Friday.\n\n\n\nAs far as political figures go, Obama\'s road to "yes" is hardly unique.\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton\'s presidential campaign jumped on the Supreme Court\ndecision, changing its red campaign logo to a rainbow colored H, releasing\na gauzy video of gay wedding ceremonies, and blasting out supportive tweets\naimed at building its campaign list.\n\n\n\nIn a fiery speech Friday night to Democratic activists in Northern\nVirginia, Clinton said that "love triumphed in the highest court" and\ndeclared: "We can sum up the message from the court and the American people\nin just two words: Move on."\n\n\n\nBut like Obama, such expressions of support mark a remarkable shift for\nClinton, who opposed gay marriage for more than two decades as a first\nlady, a U.S. senator and a presidential candidate. Just three months ago,\nClinton\'s position was that while she personally supported gay marriage the\nissue was best left for individual states to decide \xe2\x80\x94 a policy stance held\nby most of the Republican presidential field.\n\n\n\n"It has been an evolutionary process," said Fred Sainz of the Human Rights\nCampaign, a national gay rights group. But he said Obama now stands as one\nof the great champions of gay rights, up there with the likes of Harvey\nMilk. As for Clinton, he said, "she connects with gay people on a level\nthat is beyond explanation."\n\n\n\nObama has carefully staked out his position on same-sex marriage throughout\nhis political career. During his 1996 Illinois state Senate race, he\nreplied to a questionnaire from a gay newspaper in Chicago: "I favor\nlegalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such\nmarriages." Two years later, he declared himself undecided.\n\n\n\nBy 2004, as he ran for the U.S. Senate, he said he opposed gay marriage for\npolitically strategic reasons, saying Republicans would exploit the issue,\nand he advocated instead for gay civil unions. In his 2006 book, "The\nAudacity of Hope," he cited his own faith as a reason to oppose same-sex\nmarriage, though he also wondered whether "in years hence I may be seen as\nsomeone who was on the wrong side of history."\n\n\n\nHe came out firmly for same-sex marriage in 2012 and called for it in his\nsecond inaugural address. But earlier this year, his former top strategist,\nDavid Axelrod, wrote that Obama had feigned opposition to gay marriage for\nmost of his political career, grudgingly taking Axelrod\'s advice that\nAfrican-American religious leaders and others would oppose him if he let it\nbe known he supported gay marriage.\n\n\n\n"If Obama\'s views were \'evolving\' publicly, they were fully evolved behind\nclosed doors," Axelrod wrote.\n\n\n\nObama disputed the account, telling BuzzFeed News that he thought civil\nunions were "a sufficient way of squaring the circle," but that "the pain\nand the sense of stigma that was being placed on same-sex couples who are\nfriends of mine" changed his mind.\n\n\n\n"I think the notion that somehow I was always in favor of marriage per se\nisn\'t quite accurate," Obama told BuzzFeed.\n\n\n\nBut even after he endorsed gay marriage, he took his time embracing other\naspects of the gay community\'s agenda.\n\n\n\nIt wasn\'t until July 2014 that Obama gave employment protection to gay and\ntransgender workers in the federal government and its contracting agencies.\n\n\n\nStill, gay rights advocates hold him up as one of their biggest political\nadvocates.\n\n\n\n"It\'s absolutely right to note that this administration did not get off to\na good start with LGBT advocates," Sainz said. "But the sheer volume of\nwhat he has done will be hard for another president to replicate, simply\nbecause so much of what he has done has been so incredibly powerful,\nmomentous and life changing for LGBT people."\n\n\n\nClinton\'s path into the embrace of the gay community has been similar. She\nbacked her husband\'s Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, described marriage\nbetween a man and a woman as a "fundamental bedrock principle" in a 2004\nSenate floor speech, and dodged the question when asked in 2007 whether she\nagreed with Gen. Peter Pace, then the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, that\nhomosexuality was immoral.\n\n\n\nBut as secretary of state, Clinton emerged as a champion of gay rights,\ndeclaring that "gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay\nrights," at a 2011 conference in Geneva.\n\n\n\nSainz said that in Clinton, the LGBT community sees a kindred spirit. "It\'s\nin our DNA to support her," he said. "We have been forced to deal with some\nof lives greatest indignities and have come out on the other side."\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton slams GOP as \'party of the past\'\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/hillary-clinton-lgbt-fairfax-virginia-rally-119494.html#ixzz3eFVTekSs>\n// Politico // Gabriel Debenedetti \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nFAIRFAX, Va. \xe2\x80\x94 Hillary Clinton looked to draw a red line for her Republican\nrivals on LGBT rights in her first large swing-state rally outside of the\nearly-voting states on Friday night, pointedly urging them not to turn \xe2\x80\x9cthe\nhopes of any American into a political football for this 2016 campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of turning back the clock, they should be joining us in saying\n\xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99 to discrimination for once and for all,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said in a\nfiery speech at a fundraising rally for the Democratic Party of Virginia\nhere in Fairfax just hours after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage\nnationwide.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning, love triumphed in the highest court in our land. Equality\ntriumphed. America triumphed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said before quoting the final paragraph\nof Justice Anthony Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\n\n\n\nWhile the event was not intended to be a Clinton rally, it quickly turned\ninto one as speaker after speaker praised the former secretary of state in\nfront of the crowd of around 2,000. She was introduced by her longtime\nfriend Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who himself spoke after Democratic Sens. Mark\nWarner and Tim Kaine \xe2\x80\x94 who also left no doubt about where their political\nloyalties lie.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic front-runner did not call out any of the Republican White\nHouse hopefuls by name, but she derided the calls from some of them to pass\na constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, insisting that the\nlesson of a week that saw the Supreme Court affirm the legality of\nObamacare and that saw a widespread backlash against the Confederate flag\nwas that Republicans should \xe2\x80\x9cmove on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x99s decision confirms we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working toward equality as a nation\nstep by step, case by case, court by court, and that equality has been\nright there in the Constitution all along,\xe2\x80\x9d said the former first lady and\nsenator, who didn\xe2\x80\x99t support marriage equality when she first ran for\npresident in 2008.\n\n\n\nComing straight to the rally from the Charleston funeral of the Rev.\nClementa Pinckney \xe2\x80\x94 who was killed along with eight other African-American\nchurchgoers in the shooting last week \xe2\x80\x94 Clinton also promised to fight for\na \xe2\x80\x9cbetter, smarter, safer, approach to getting the gun violence in this\ncountry under control.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton sat in the front row at the afternoon service, at which President\nBarack Obama delivered a eulogy for Pinckney that the former secretary of\nstate said \xe2\x80\x9cstirred\xe2\x80\x9d her. Hours later, in perhaps the most political of her\ncampaign speeches so far, she applauded both South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Republican\ngovernor Nikki Haley and McAuliffe for speaking out against public use of\nthe Confederate flag.\n\n\n\nBut she was also withering in her criticism of some Republican rivals in\nparticular.\n\n\n\nResponding to Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of Mexican immigrants as\n\xe2\x80\x9cbringing drugs, they\xe2\x80\x99re bringing crime, they\xe2\x80\x99re rapists,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton\nsuggested \xe2\x80\x94 without using Trump\xe2\x80\x99s name \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cmaybe he\xe2\x80\x99s never met them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd on a day after new polls showed that Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s primary Democratic rival\nfor the nomination Bernie Sanders is gaining on her in some early-voting\nstates, she made clear that she would keep her focus on Republicans, not\nher fellow party members.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAcross the board, they are the party of the past,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to applause.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the party of the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Gay marriage ruling: A political gift to Hillary Clinton?\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/gay-marriage-supreme-court-ruling-hillary-clinton-boost-119475.html?hp=lc3_4>\n// Politico // Annie Karni \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nYou might say the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to make same-sex marriage a\nnationwide right was an in-kind contribution to Hillary for America.\n\n\n\nNever mind that the 5-4 ruling could easily have gone the other way: It\ngives her a chance to stress the importance of nominating liberal Supreme\nCourt justices, and creates a moment of enthusiasm in the LGBT community\nthat her campaign needs to ride. It places her squarely in the mainstream\nof public opinion. And it puts her stance in sharp relief against the\nRepublicans fulminating, to various degrees, at the majority\xe2\x80\x99s break with\ntradition.\n\n\n\nIt also delivers to her opponents in the Democratic primary a chance to\ntell voters that they were on the right side of history first \xe2\x80\x94 but that\nmight not matter much.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlong with millions of Americans, I am celebrating today\xe2\x80\x99s landmark\nvictory for marriage equality, and the generations of advocates and\nactivists who fought to make it possible,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said in a statement\nFriday morning. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom Stonewall to the Supreme Court, the courage and\ndetermination of the LGBT community has changed hearts and changed laws.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe said the ruling \xe2\x80\x9crepresents our country at its best: inclusive, open,\nand striving towards true equality.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWith about 60 percent of Americans supporting gay marriage, according to\nrecent polls, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s position in favor of a constitutional right to\nsame-sex marriage offers a winning contrast with most of the Republican\nfield \xe2\x80\x94 especially among younger voters. The Supreme Court ruling takes\naway some of that drama, now that the issue no longer hangs in balance.\n\n\n\nBut Democrats said there are still opportunities for Clinton to position\nherself as a fighter for civil rights. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a backlash\namong religious conservatives to this ruling today,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilary Rosen, a\nDemocratic strategist and loyal Clinton supporter. \xe2\x80\x9cThere will be plenty of\nleadership opportunities for Hillary Clinton and other politicians to\noppose the whittling away of this victory, with trumped-up exemptions.\nRepublicans will make the mistake, I predict, in raising the rhetoric\nlevel.\xe2\x80\x9d She pointed to Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s controversial religious freedom law as an\nexample.\n\n\n\nIn her statement, Clinton hinted that the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling hadn\xe2\x80\x99t put\nthe issue to bed. \xe2\x80\x9cFor too many LGBT Americans who are subjected to\ndiscriminatory laws, true equality is still just out of reach,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile we celebrate today, our work won\xe2\x80\x99t be finished until every American\ncan not only marry, but live, work, pray, learn and raise a family free\nfrom discrimination and prejudice. We cannot settle for anything less.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton is also expected to speak in the coming weeks about the importance\nof electing a president who can nominate progressive Supreme Court\njustices, a campaign aide said. This week\xe2\x80\x99s court rulings \xe2\x80\x94 on Obamacare,\nfair housing and same-sex marriage \xe2\x80\x94 highlight how galvanizing a political\nissue the appointments of justices can be, and the Clinton camp is eager to\nseize the moment.\n\n\n\nIn terms of the Democratic primary, however, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s rivals might be\ntempted to ask why it took her so long to support the constitutional right\nto same-sex marriage \xe2\x80\x94 just last year, she said it was an issue left to the\nstates to decide. Her opponents in the primary, former Gov. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\nand Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, were well ahead of her at the time.\n\n\n\nAs governor, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley led Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 fight to legalize same-sex\nmarriage \xe2\x80\x94 and likes to remind primary voters of that fact. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad\nSecretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s come around to the right positions on these issues,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid in April in a rare direct jab at the Democratic frontrunner. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\ngrateful to the people of Maryland for leading the way on this important\nissue of human dignity and equality under the law,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a brief\nstatement Friday morning.\n\n\n\nSanders, meanwhile, voted against the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996,\nsigned into law by President Bill Clinton. And Vermont was the first state\nto legalize same-sex unions in 2000. He supported the legalization of gay\nmarriage in 2009. \xe2\x80\x9cFor far too long our justice system has marginalized the\ngay community,\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders said in his statement Friday, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am very glad\nthe Court caught up to the American people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not yet clear whether either candidate can take advantage of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nchanging views.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Iowa, some Democratic activists are very proud of having been in the\nlead on this issue early in the game,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenneth Sherrill, political\nscience professor emeritus at Hunter College. \xe2\x80\x9cIf O\xe2\x80\x99Malley or Sanders are\nable to say, \xe2\x80\x98I was with you during your period of trouble,\xe2\x80\x99 that might be\nhelpful to them. On the question of who is a courageous leader, who\xe2\x80\x99s\nwilling to take risks in the name of justice, they may use this to picture\nClinton as cautious and late to the game.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe LGBT community, however, has been fired up for Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy, and\nseemingly willing to overlook her less-than-perfect record on the issue of\ngay marriage. Many leaders in the community stressed that all mainstream\nnational Democrats have been evolving on the issue \xe2\x80\x94 and they\xe2\x80\x99re simply\nhappy that the time has come that a Democratic frontrunner for president\ncan embrace a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of her platforms is equality for all, which is not something we saw in\n2008,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eunic Ortiz, president of the Stonewall Democrats of NYC, which\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t endorse any candidate until 2016. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something she has evolved on.\nThis is now equality for all, and we are looking forward.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton was fully embracing the decision Friday morning online. On Twitter,\nthe campaign changed her banner to say the word \xe2\x80\x9cHISTORY,\xe2\x80\x9d in an all-caps,\nrainbow-colored font.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s certainly going to rejoice about the decision,\xe2\x80\x9d Sherrill said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt\nleast she can say she came out for marriage equality before the Supreme\nCourt did.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Republican National Committee Files FOIA Request on Hillary Clinton\nPersonnel Practices\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-26/republican-national-committee-files-foia-request-on-hillary-clinton-personnel-practices>\n// Bloomberg // Billy House \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nThe Republican National Committee is pressing the State Department for\ninformation on whether former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and her\nchief of staff at the department, Cheryl Mills, failed to disclose a\nspecial arrangement allowing Mills to hold outside jobs.\n\n\n\nA Freedom of Information Act request the RNC sent to the department Friday\ndemands a copy of all records related to Mills\' "selection, approval,\nstatus, and/or classification of Mills" as a special government employee in\n2009 and again in 2013. Coming on the heels of a disclosure that Clinton\'s\nrelease of business-related emails she sent on a private account was\nincomplete, the RNC\'s latest move underscores Republicans\' determination to\nmaintain a relentless focus on the Democratic presidential frontrunner\'s\nmanagerial practices.\n\n\n\nThe RNC request follows a report that Mills had a special arrangement in\n2009 that enabled her to continue to hold outside positions with the\nWilliam J. Clinton Foundation, New York University, and as a board member\nfor the school\'s UAE-funded Abu Dhabi campus.\n\n\n\nAt issue, for the RNC, is why Mills then was not included on a list of all\nspecial government employees for the year 2009, released by State last year\nin response to a FOIA request from ProPublica. She was included in a list\nfor the year 2013.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s campaign had no immediate comment on the FOIA request.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s top State Department aide was allowed to\nreceive outside income while serving as her Chief of Staff, and failed to\ndisclose it is troubling," says RNC Research Director and Deputy\nCommunications Director Raj Shah. "Now we are seeking to determine Mills\xe2\x80\x99\nand Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s roles in covering it up."\n\n\n\nThe FOIA request Friday from the RNC calls for all records related to\n\xe2\x80\x9cProPublica\xe2\x80\x99s FOIA request regarding State Department special Government\nemployees\xe2\x80\x9d including any discussion related to why Mills may have not been\nincluded in the 2009 list.\n\n\n\n"To clarify, this request includes any records that may exist about\nProPublica\xe2\x80\x99s FOIA and why Cheryl Mills\xe2\x80\x99 2009 special Government status was\nexcluded from the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s FOIA response," the FOIA request\nstates.\n\n\n\nA State Department spokesman said the agency does not typically comment on\nFOIA requests.\n\n\n\nPrevious news accounts have reported another close Clinton aide, Huma\nAbedin, had been given special government employee status under Clinton,\nwhich also allowed her to have outside work along with being a part-time\nemployee of the State Department.\n\n\n\nThe RNC has previously sent the State Department FOIA demands focused on\nMills and other top aides who served there under Clinton, including Abedin\nand another longtime political adviser, Philippe Reines, regarding anything\nthat said the words \xe2\x80\x9cFreedom of Information Act\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cFOIA\xe2\x80\x9d for discussions\non the topic or other matters in which they may have intervened.\n\n\n\nThe RNC had not previously asked "for all records pertaining to any\nindividual FOIA request or any matter outside of FOIA policy, such as\nemployees receiving Special Government Employee status," said Shah.\n\n\n\n*Prominent Clinton backers to host open houses\n<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/06/26/clinton-prominent-supporters-host-open-houses/29331657/>\n// Des Moines Register // Tony Leys \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\'s campaign is having prominent Democratic supporters host\nvolunteer organizing events over the next two weeks.\n\n\n\nThe supporters will host open houses at offices around the state,\nspokeswoman Lily Adams said.

Terry McAuliffe, in one of the first major rallies of her second\npresidential campaign.\n\n\n\nShe said she was thrilled to be speaking to Democrats on \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a historic\nday for our country.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nJust hours ago, Clinton had attended the funeral for slain South Carolina\npastor Clementa Pinckney, and before that celebrated the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s\nmarriage equality decision. She called it \xe2\x80\x9can emotional roller coaster of a\nday,\xe2\x80\x9d pleased that \xe2\x80\x9clove triumphed in the highest court in our land.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut she cautioned that the fight on both LGBT rights and race relations is\nnot over. She also vowed, \xe2\x80\x9cI for one am never going to stop fighting\xe2\x80\x9d for\ngun control.\n\n\n\nInside the cavernous Patriot Center arena on the campus of George Mason\nUniversity, it felt more like June 2016 than June 2016.\n\n\n\nThe screaming fans who often rose to their feet and chanted Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s name,\nthe many invocations of \xe2\x80\x9cour next president,\xe2\x80\x9d and setting in a key swing\nstate, made the rally feel like a general election pep rally. That, even\nthough Clinton aides have said she is squarely focused on the primary\ncampaign and even as Sen. Bernie Sanders surges in polls.\n\n\n\nSpeaker after speaker praised Clinton as if the Democratic nomination were\na fait accompli. \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton is our choice for the future!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sen.\nMark Warner, the state\xe2\x80\x99s popular Democratic senator, to cheers.\n\n\n\nAnd Clinton kept her sights squarely on Republicans, firing off on them on\nissue after issue. \xe2\x80\x9cAcross the board, they are the party of the past, not\nthe future,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly obliquely mentioned the other Democrats running for the\nnomination before waving them off. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody has a stronger resume to be\npresident of the United States than Hillary Rodham Clinton,\xe2\x80\x9d said Connolly,\nwho welcomed everyone to \xe2\x80\x9cClinton territory.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNearly every speaker said it was time to put a woman in the White House.\n\n\n\nFormer Sen. Jim Webb, who is considering a run and lives in nearby\nArlington, was not mentioned. Neither was former Gov. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, who\nhails from just across the river in Maryland.\n\n\n\nBut more than anything, the event was a chance for Clinton to help her old\nfriend McAuliffe build the Democratic Party in a key presidential\nbattleground state.\n\n\n\nClinton is rushing to fill her coffers ahead of the end of the finance\nquarter next week, but she will make no money from her appearance here. All\nthe proceeds \xe2\x80\x93 more than $1 million, according to officials \xe2\x80\x93 will go to\nthe Virginia Democratic Party.\n\n\n\nMcAuliffe chaired Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 presidential campaign and Bill\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s 1996 reelection run. He\xe2\x80\x99s raised tens of millions of dollars for\nboth Clintons, and is now working to win the Virginia state Senate for\nDemocrats and hold the seat in 2016.\n\n\n\nReunited on stage, McAuliffe now the governor of a large state and Clinton\ncruising to the Democratic nomination after both lots their first tries at\neach, they displayed the easy chemistry of old allies.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is personal for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said McAuliffe of Clinton. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve worked hard\ntogether, we\xe2\x80\x99ve played hard together.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe governor explained that if he and his wife are on vacation with the\nformer first couple, and he wants to enjoy a beer or cocktail in the\nevening, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t go looking for Bill Clinton. I go looking for Hillary\nClinton. She\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more fun that Bill Clinton is!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe love was mutual. Clinton said she was \xe2\x80\x9cstarting to run out of\nsuperlatives\xe2\x80\x9d while praising McAuliffe after he introduced her.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s my kind of leader, a pragmatic progressive,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton added. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\nprefers common ground to scorched earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton will need a strong Democratic Party if she makes it to the general\nelection in 2016 in the Virginia, which has become a key state in\nDemocrats\xe2\x80\x99 post-Obama election electoral map.\n\n\n\nVirginia Democrats have been on a tear lately, and especially under\nMcAuliffe. The party now controls all five statewide offices for the first\ntime in 40 years and has won two presidential elections in a row.\n\n\n\nMcAuliffe and the party are gearing up to try to win control of the state\nSenate in November of 2015, and the political organization they build can\nthen be turned around to support Clinton.\n\n\n\n*Clinton Campaign\'s Amanda Renteria: How They\'re Building Latino Support\n<http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/amanda-renteria-explains-how-hillary-clinton-will-build-latino-support-n381826>\n// NBC News // Suzanne Gamboa \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nNEW YORK -- It may take several knocks on the same door before getting to\nan offer of a cafecito and election talk, but Hillary Clinton\'s national\npolitical director Amanda Renteria is sure those offers will come often as\nLatinos see they are a big part of Clinton\'s campaign focus.\n\n\n\n"The first time, it\'s, \'Thank you very much.\' The second time, it\'s, \'Okay,\nI\'ll listen\' and the third time it\'s like, \'Come on in. Let\'s have a\ncafecito. Let\'s talk about this,\'" Renteria said, talking about the\nDemocratic candidate\'s on-the-ground efforts to reach potential Hispanic\nvoters.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with NBC News, Renteria spoke about how the Clinton\ncampaign is building its relationships with America\'s largest minority\ngroup.\n\n\n\nThe mission is one that has risen in importance as the Latino electorate\nhas grown, even though it performs under its potential, and as campaigns\ntake note of the oncoming onslaught of young Latinos who are turning 18 by\nthe hundreds of thousands every year.\n\n\n\nThe history of the last two presidential elections is fresh enough to\nremind campaigns that President Barack Obama, though he did not win the\nwhite vote, got more than 70 percent of the Latino vote and secured two\nelections with a multiracial coalition that will continue to grow so that\neight presidential elections from now whites will not longer be the\nmajority.\n\n\n\nFor her part, Clinton has been speaking to Latino groups, including two\nrecent visits to Las Vegas, a city whose population is about one third\nHispanic. She\'s met with young immigrants without U.S. legal status as well\nas Latino officeholders, laying out her proposals such as a greater\nemphasis on early childhood education and her support for a path to\ncitizenship for immigrant families.\n\n\n\n"I think speaking Spanish isn\'t enough \xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s about the issues and who has\nbeen fighting for them," said Renteria, who is Mexican American. "I think\nwhen you see things coming from the Republican party and none of the\nRepublicans stood up to the divisive words, the inflammatory words that a\nfriend of theirs said, the community sees that kind of stuff."\n\n\n\nAlthough she didn\'t name him, Renteria was referring remarks by Donald\nTrump, the real estate mogul and reality show TV host whose remarks about\nMexicans and Mexico when he announced his presidential bid have drawn\nstrong backlash. Just Thursday, the Spanish language network Univision\nannounced it was dropping their deal to broadcast Miss Universe pageants\n(Trump is part owner, along with NBC Universal), over his referrals to\nimmigrants crossing the border as rapists, drug users and criminals.\n\n\n\nClinton criticized Trump\'s comments at the time, saying "hotter and more\nnegative" public discourse can trigger people who are less stable, a\nreference to the fatal shootings at a black church in South Carolina last\nweek that ended the lives of nine people.\n\n\n\nAs Renteria sees it, Clinton can draw some affinity between Latino values\nand her life, even if she can\'t claim Hispanic identity or connect through\na Latino spouse or children, as can Republican candidates Jeb Bush, Marco\nRubio and Ted Cruz.\n\n\n\nIn her NALEO speech in Las Vegas last week, Clinton wove through issues\nrelating to values often named by Latinos as part of their makeup: family,\nchildren, education and immigration reform.\n\n\n\nShe also spoke some about her own mother. In future events, Renter\xc3\xada said,\nClinton will talk more about herself and her mother, Dorothy Rodham, who\nwas raised by her severe grandparents after her parents divorced and who\nwas on her own at 14.\n\n\n\n"The whole story of it takes a village, that\'s so like the Latino\ncommunity. It takes the grandparents, the mom, the vecinos (neighbors),\neveryone involved," said Renteria, invoking an African proverb that is a\nfavorite of Clinton and was the title of a children\'s book she wrote.\n\n\n\nPart of Renteria\'s job as national political director is to oversee\ninteraction with coalition groups, those that advocate for Latinos, African\nAmericans and others, and build support among them. She said she likes to\ndescribe her job to her parents as "trying to grow the biggest tent that\'s\never been built."\n\n\n\nShe said that after South Carolina, she finds it more of a responsibility\nto focus on a "welcoming" campaign. "I think it really does affect the\nfabric of our community, the fabric of our country. I think that for me\nthat was a big change in terms of the seriousness of what we are doing \xe2\x80\xa6\nand really building the tent," she said.\n\n\n\nRenteria is part of that tent. From the Central Valley of California,\nRenteria\'s father is an immigrant from Zacatecas, Mexico who worked\nCalifornia\'s farm fields. Her mother was born in the U.S and is of Mexican\ndescent. After studying economics at Stanford and working in the financial\nindustry and as a teacher, Renteria become the first Latina hired as a\nchief of staff in the U.S. Senate. She made a run for Congress last year\nbut lost to Republican incumbent Rep. David Valadao.\n\n\n\n"We as a community need to have a voice in the political environment. I\ndidn\'t grow up in this, but once you realize what kind of impact you can\nhave and how you can help others in public service I hope more Latinos and\ndifferent voices come together and are part of it," she said.\n\n\n\nHoping to build on Obama\'s success in galvanizing multiracial coalitions,\nthe Clinton campaign wants to unite generations and bring together singular\ngroups such as Latinos or African Americans for Hillary, so that they\nbecome for example, People of Color for Hillary, Renteria said.\n\n\n\n"How do you build (support) deep within the communities, across\ngenerations, but also how do you then, bring everyone onto the stage?" she\nsaid, adding that taking a position on voting rights is one way.\n\n\n\nWhen asked what are the issues Clinton will stress as she reaches out to\nHispanics, Renteria said they would include the Democrats\' achievements on\nhealth care access, and elaboration on her early campaign declaration that\nshe would go beyond Obama\'s immigration executive action, including finding\na way for parents of children not legally in the U.S. to remain and work.\n\n\n\n"We already have an idea legally of what we can do a little bit further\nthan the president ," Renteria said, "in large part, because he went as far\nas he did and we learned what worked and what didn\'t and now we get to\ntweak it a little bit more so it can work for more people."\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton hits Republicans over marriage, Obamacare rulings\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/26/politics/hillary-clinton-virginia-marriage/>\n// CNN // Dan Merica \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nThe Democratic frontrunner was speaking at a Jefferson Jackson fundraiser\nfor the Virginia Democratic Party at George Mason University on a night in\nwhich she was repeatedly referred to by fellow Democrats as the next\nPresident of the United States.\n\n\n\n"This morning, they all decried the Supreme Court\'s ruling," Clinton said,\nnoting that "we even heard them call for a constitutional amendment"\nagainst same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\nA fired-up Clinton then seemingly spoke directly at the 13 declared\nRepublican presidential hopefuls.\n\n\n\n"I am asking them, please, don\'t make the rights, the hopes, of any\nAmerican into a political football for this 2016 campaign," she said. "LGBT\nAmericans should be free not just to marry, but to live, learn and work,\njust like everybody else."\n\n\n\nRepublican response to the Supreme Court\'s decision was universally\nopposed, but politically mixed. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush called for\nrespect for the court\'s decision, despite opposing it. On the other side of\nthe spectrum, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said he wants to amend the\nConstitution to leave the decision over who can marry up to each state.\n\n\n\nClinton read the last paragraph of Justice Anthony Kennedy\'s opinion from\nthe stage on Friday, ending with, "And to that I say, amen, thank you."\n\n\n\n"This morning, love triumphed in the highest court in our land," Clinton\nsaid. "Equality triumphed, America triumphed."\n\n\n\nShe did not mention former Maryland Gov. Martin O\'Malley, former Rhode\nIsland Gov. Lincoln Chafee or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during the event,\nall of whom are vying to be the Democratic Party\'s nominee.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s stance on same-sex marriage has evolved over the years. Her\nhusband, President Bill Clinton, signed the Defense of Marriage Act in\n1996, which defined for federal purposes marriage between one man and one\nwoman. As a senator, Clinton backed civil unions and partner benefits for\nsame-sex couples, and came out in favor of same-sex marriage in 2013,\nshortly before the Court struck down a key provision of the 1996 law.\n\n\n\nBut the former secretary of state\'s attacks on Republican hopefuls were not\nlimited to same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\nReacting to the other landmark decision by the Supreme Court this week,\nClinton said, "All the Republican candidates were furious that earlier this\nweek the Supreme Court once again confirmed what we have all known and\nbelieved for years: (Obamacare) is settled law and it is here to stay."\n\n\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court saved Obama\'s controversial health\ncare law on Thursday, ruling that the Affordable Care Act was authorized to\nprovide federal tax credits to states with federal marketplaces.\n\n\n\n"Even after two Supreme Court verdicts and a presidential election, they\nare still fighting to take us backwards," Clinton said, referring to the\n2012 Supreme Court decision on the issue and that year\'s presidential\nelection. "I think we can sum up the message from the Court and the\nAmerican people: \'Move on.\'"\n\n\n\nAs she has in the past, Clinton said she doesn\'t think the health care law\nis perfect, pointing to drug and out-of-pocket costs as two areas that she\nsays need to be addressed.\n\n\n\nBut she embraced Obama throughout the speech, and she applauded the way the\nPresident eulogized Rev. Clementa Pinckney, the South Carolina state\nsenator who was killed along with eight others in last week\'s church\nmassacre in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n\n\nShe referenced the tragedy when she hit House Republicans for voting on\nWednesday to put restrictions on whether the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention can study gun violence and make recommendations.\n\n\n\n"How can you watch massacre after massacre and take that vote?" she asked.\n"That is wrong. It puts our people at risk, and I, for one, am never going\nto stop fighting for a better, safer approach to get the gun violence in\nthis country under control."\n\n\n\nFriday\'s event was meant to focus on the successes of Virginia Democrats --\nincluding longtime Clinton friend and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. But as\nthe program went on, the event started to feel like a Hillary for America\nrally.\n\n\n\nRep. Bobby Scott said he was happy to welcome "the next President of the\nUnited States of America to the commonwealth of Virginia." Sen. Tim Kaine\nsaid, "I\'m so excited we get to be here to welcome Secretary Clinton, our\nnext President." And Sen. Mark Warner added, "I don\'t know about you, but I\nmade my choice. I\'m ready for Hillary."\n\n\n\nMcAuliffe, Clinton\'s 2008 campaign chairman, was even more effusive, to the\npoint of getting personal.\n\n\n\n"Folks, let me say this, this is personal for me," he said. "I have known\nHillary for decades. We have worked hard together, we have played hard\ntogether."\n\n\n\nThe famously blunt governor went on to tell the audience that when he and\nhis wife travel with Bill and Hillary Clinton and the governor wants a\ndrink, "I don\'t go looking for Bill Clinton. I go looking for Hillary\nClinton, because she is a lot more fun that Bill Clinton."\n\n\n\nMcAuliffe described Clinton as a fighter who has "been knocked down" but\ngets up every time and "gets right back in that arena again."\n\n\n\n"And yes, after 239 years," he concluded, "it is time for a woman President\nof the United States."\n\n\n\n*Clinton weathers the summer of Sanders\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/26/politics/hillary-clinton-summer-of-bernie-sanders/index.html>\n// CNN // Jeff Zeleny \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton always insisted she wasn\'t expecting a coronation in her\nsecond presidential bid, but a single-digit lead over Bernie Sanders was\nsurely not what she had in mind.\n\n\n\nIt\'s now clear that Clinton, despite a raft of political advantages that\nmake her the envy of rivals from both parties, faces a stubborn obstacle in\nher quest to win the Democratic nomination.\n\n\n\nShe must weather the summer of Sanders.\n\n\n\nHer once commanding and comfortable lead in New Hampshire has narrowed to 8\npoints, according to a new CNN/WMUR New Hampshire Primary poll. Sanders, a\nsenator from neighboring Vermont, has emerged as the leading progressive\nalternative to Clinton, consolidating support from Democrats who had been\nclamoring for Elizabeth Warren to enter the race.\n\n\n\nAn early sense of curiosity surrounding Sanders, who is drawing Obama-size\ncrowds to his campaign rallies, is now translating into actual support for\nhis candidacy.\n\n\n\n"I think we are probably doing a lot better than you would have thought two\nmonths ago when we got into this, right?" Sanders said in an interview.\n"Clearly, what I do know, is the stronger that I get, the attacks are going\nto come from all kinds of sources."\n\n\n\nYet don\'t expect those attacks to start coming from Clinton, at least not\ndirectly.\n\n\n\nThe Clinton campaign, which has been carefully tracking the Sanders\nmomentum for the last month, has no immediate plans to go after Sanders.\nTaking an aggressive posture could not only elevate him even more in the\neyes of liberals, it could also backfire and create deep divisions inside\nthe Democratic Party that she is still far more likely than not to lead.\n\n\n\nSeveral Democrats close to the campaign, even some who have been\nunderwhelmed by the first three months of her candidacy, tell CNN that\nClinton and her team are far from panicking.\n\n\n\nClinton plans response to Sanders\n\n\n\nBut Clinton does intend to respond to Sanders -- and the progressive wing\nof her party -- in a far more nuanced way this summer. She intends to take\nseveral steps, including:\n\n\n\n** Escalating her direct challenge of Republicans, increasingly calling\nthem out by name, in an effort to cement her image as a fighter for\nDemocratic interests. There\'s nothing more energizing to Democrats than a\nfew well-honed attacks on Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker and the rest\nof the Republican field.\n\n\n\n** Delivering a series of policy speeches throughout the summer, amplifying\nher call for social and economic issues that animate progressives. She\nintends to tackle college affordability, women\'s pay equity and paid family\nleave -- among other issues -- in hopes of making her candidacy more\nacceptable to voters who may be more inclined to favor Warren or Sanders.\n\n\n\n** Campaigning aggressively in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two\ncontests in the primary fight, to demonstrate that she knows she must work\nhard to capture the Democratic nomination and will put in the work needed\nto win over any skeptical liberals.\n\n\n\nClinton struggles on empathy question\n\n\n\nSince jumping into the race, Clinton has struggled to persuade voters that\nshe is empathetic. The latest New Hampshire poll shows 45 percent say\nSanders is the candidate who cares the most about people like you, compared\nwith 24 percent who believe Clinton is.\n\n\n\nSanders, a political independent who proudly calls himself a socialist, is\nheading to New Hampshire for a weekend campaign swing to try and expand\nupon his early support.\n\n\n\nSo far, he has avoided directly going after Clinton, mentioning her by name\nonly when asked by reporters. His aides say he has no plans of changing\nthat strategy.\n\n\n\n"What I am doing is, in fact, speaking to issues that are in the hearts and\nthe minds of the American people in a way that is a little bit bolder than\nother candidates have in the past," Sanders said in an interview. "And I\nthink people are responding to that."\n\n\n\nThe New Hampshire poll shows that many Democrats are responding favorably\nto Clinton\'s candidacy, including 74 percent who say they have a positive\nimpression of her. She also is more trusted to handle the economy and\nhealth care, two of the leading domestic issues in the contest.\n\n\n\nClinton has been spending considerable time in June raising money, eyeing\nthe first campaign fundraising deadline next week. A series of interviews\nwith local Democratic leaders in New Hampshire and Iowa suggests there is a\nhunger among party activists for more -- not less -- of Clinton.\n\n\n\nDesire for a contest\n\n\n\nThere is also a hunger for a competitive primary fight.\n\n\n\n"There are two kinds of groups," said Jean Pardee, the Democratic\nchairwoman in Clinton County, Iowa. "There are those who are concerned that\nHillary\'s baggage will keep her from winning. There is another group who\nlikes the blunt, outspoken answers that Bernie Sanders gives."\n\n\n\nPardee and other party leaders say the growing interest in Sanders is only\na warning sign for Clinton.\n\n\n\n"As of now, I don\'t see it as a problem," Pardee told CNN. "I think it will\nmake her and her staff work a little more carefully and harder. They\ncertainly won\'t take anything for granted, as in 2008 they did."\n\n\n\n*State Department: It\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Hard To Know\xe2\x80\x99 How Many Other Emails Hillary May\nHave Failed To Turn Over\n<http://dailycaller.com/2015/06/26/state-department-its-hard-to-know-how-many-other-emails-hillary-may-have-failed-to-turn-over/>\n// Daily Caller // Chuck Ross \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nA State Department spokesman admitted it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chard to know\xe2\x80\x9d how many\nwork-related emails former Sec. of State Hillary Clinton failed to turn\nover to the agency.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know the degree to which there may be other emails that another\nthird party may have \xe2\x80\x94 in this case Mr. Blumenthal \xe2\x80\x94 that we do not have,\xe2\x80\x9d\nState Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters at a press conference\nFriday.\n\n\n\nHe was responding to Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s bombshell revelation that the agency did\nnot have 15 Libya-related emails sent between Clinton and her longtime\nfriend, Sidney Blumenthal. Blumenthal turned over 60 emails he sent to\nClinton when she was in office. He provided the records to the House Select\nCommittee on Benghazi last week.\n\n\n\nIn doing so, it quickly became apparent that Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s emails included\nsome exchanges which Clinton had not turned over to the State Department in\nDecember.\n\n\n\nThat despite Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s confident assurance at a press conference in March\nthat she \xe2\x80\x9cprovided all\xe2\x80\xa6emails that could possibly be work-related\xe2\x80\x9d to the\nState Department.\n\n\n\nKirby mostly dodged reporters questions on Friday but was forced to admit\nthe State Department has no way to determine how many other official\ngovernment emails Clinton failed to turn over.\n\n\n\nCornered by a reporter about whether the discrepancy revealed in the\nBlumenthal emails indicates Clinton failed to turn over other records,\nKirby said: \xe2\x80\x9cit would appear to be so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless you have another inventory to check it against, like in this case\nwe had Mr. Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s emails, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know,\xe2\x80\x9d Kirby said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe only knew about these 15 because Mr. Blumenthal had them and provided\nthem to the Select Committee so there was something to check it against,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe added.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly hypothesize about what other email traffic that might\nrelate to Benghazi or Libya that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton has made it all but impossible to figure out just how many official\nrecords she failed to turn over. She has said her team went through her\nemail account and picked out work-related emails and deleted the rest. Her\nattorney has also indicated to the Select Committee the personal server she\nused to maintain the email account has been wiped clean. That attorney,\nDavid Kendall, has also said Clinton will not turn over the server.\n\n\n\nIn his comments, Kirby took off the table the one sure way of knowing\nwhether Clinton has been telling the truth. He said that the State\nDepartment has no plans to ask Clinton for her private email server. He\nalso said the agency will not undertake an investigation into Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nemail gap.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know of no such investigation \xe2\x80\x94 certainly not by the State Department,\xe2\x80\x9d\nKirby said.\n\n\n\n*No probe over undisclosed Clinton emails, State says\n<http://thehill.com/policy/defense/246316-no-probe-over-undisclosed-clinton-emails-state-says>\n// The Hill // Martin Matishak \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nThe State Department says there won\'t be an internal investigation into why\nthe agency couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find part or all of 15 emails from former Secretary of\nState Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s personal email server.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know of no such investigation, certainly not by the State Department,\nno,\xe2\x80\x9d State Department spokesman John Kirby said during a Friday press\nbriefing.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s former agency found it lacked the communications following the\nHouse Select Committee on Benghazi\xe2\x80\x99s release of nearly 60 emails it had\nreceived from Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal earlier this month.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were clear about that in our communication with the committee that of\nthe 15 that we did not have, that Mr. Blumenthal had, they were not\nspecifically related to Benghazi, which was the original mandate on the\nselect committee,\xe2\x80\x9d Kirby said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgain, we only knew about these 15 because Mr. Blumenthal had them and\nprovided them to the select committee, so there was something to check it\nagainst,\xe2\x80\x9d he told reporters. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\'t know the degree to which there may\nbe other emails that another third party may have, in this case, Mr.\nBlumenthal, that we do not have.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Clinton, a 2016 presidential candidate, gave her old\nagency around 30,000 emails from the private server she used while serving\nas the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top diplomat.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s attorney later said all data stored on the server has been\ndestroyed.\n\n\n\nThe missing memos all predate the Sept. 11, 2012, siege on the diplomatic\noutpost in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, but the select\ncommittee seized on the discovery as another sign Clinton has not been\nforthcoming about her State Department tenure.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis confirms doubts about the completeness of Clinton\'s self-selected\npublic record and raises serious questions about her decision to erase her\npersonal server \xe2\x80\x94 especially before it could be analyzed by an independent,\nneutral third party arbiter,\xe2\x80\x9d panel Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) said in a\nstatement Thursday night.\n\n\n\nHe said the revelation "is significant and troubling\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chas implications\nfar beyond Libya, Benghazi and our committee\'s work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis conclusively shows her email arrangement with herself, which was then\nvetted by her own lawyers, has resulted in an incomplete public record,\xe2\x80\x9d\nGowdy said.\n\n\n\nKirby said the emails \xe2\x80\x9cwould appear\xe2\x80\x9d to be work-related, thus meeting the\nbenchmark for Clinton set for herself before turning them over.\n\n\n\nBut he said it\xe2\x80\x99s not up to the State Department to determine how the emails\nwere initially missed.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be a matter between the select committee and former Secretary\nClinton,\xe2\x80\x9d Kirby said.\n\n\n\n*Clinton Is Going To Take Fire on Iraq and Benghazi from Democrats, Too\n<https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/06/26/clinton-is-going-to-take-fire-on-iraq-and-benghazi-from-democrats-too/>\n// Foreign Policy \xe2\x80\x93 David Frances \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nThe 2016 Republican presidential field long has poked at two of Democratic\nfrontrunner Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s most visible political vulnerabilities: her\n2002 vote for the Iraq war, and the 2012 attacks against the U.S. consulate\nin Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. A speech\nfrom a member of her own party suggests Democrats will also target those\nAchilles\xe2\x80\x99 heels.\n\n\n\nIn a Friday speech outlining his foreign policy, former Maryland Governor\nand Democratic presidential candidate Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley pointedly mentioned\nIraq and Benghazi. Speaking at the TruCon 2015 conference, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nmention Clinton by name, but it was clear his arrows were aimed toward the\nformer senator and secretary of state.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must recognize that there are real lessons to be learned from the\ntragedy in Benghazi,\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s said. \xe2\x80\x9cNamely, we need to know in advance\nwho is likely to take power\xe2\x80\x94or vie for it\xe2\x80\x94once a dictator is toppled.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nLater, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe invasion of Iraq\xe2\x80\x94along with the subsequent disbanding\nof the Iraqi military\xe2\x80\x94will be remembered as one of the most tragic,\ndeceitful, and costly blunders in U.S. history.\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are still paying the price of a war pursued under false pretenses and\nacquiesced to by \xe2\x80\x98the appalling silence of the good,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy adviser, Doug Wilson, denied the his boss was\ntrying to frame the debate with Clinton. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see no mention of candidates\xe2\x80\x99\nnames in what he had to say. This was not a speech about Hillary Clinton,\xe2\x80\x9d\nWilson told CNN.\n\n\n\nBut O\xe2\x80\x99Malley didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention Iraq and Libya by accident. His statements on\nthe war in Iraq and Benghazi lays the groundwork for future avenues of\nattack for Democrats trying to unseat Clinton from her perch above the rest\nof the field. His other comments on foreign affairs issues like Iran and\nthe Islamic State largely toed the Democratic line.\n\n\n\nRepublicans are taking the same tack as President Barack Obama did in 2008\n\xe2\x80\x94 going after Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s vote as a New York senator to authorize the Iraq\nwar. They also refuse to let the Benghazi issue die. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s comments\nshow the issue is also fair game in the Democratic primary, even though a\n2014 GOP House investigation found Clinton had done nothing wrong.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s clear this week, despite no wrongdoing, that the scandal has yet to\nbreathe its last breath. In May, Clinton released hundreds of pages of\nemails related to Benghazi from a private Internet server she used from\nhome while still serving at the State Department. On Thursday, the State\nDepartment announced that all or part of 15 email exchanges between Clinton\nand her long-time adviser, Sidney Blumenthal, were missing.\nConspiracy-minded critics pounced.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis confirms doubts about the completeness of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s self-selected\npublic record and raises serious questions about her decision to erase her\npersonal server \xe2\x80\x94 especially before it could be analyzed by an independent,\nneutral third party arbiter,\xe2\x80\x9d Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), chairman of the\nHouse Select Committee on Benghazi, said Thursday.\n\n\n\n*Newly disclosed Hillary Clinton emails may undercut her earlier claims\n<http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/26/us-usa-election-clinton-idUSKBN0P62MV20150626>\n// Reuters // Jonathan Allen \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nA batch of 15 newly disclosed Hillary Clinton emails appears to contradict\nher assertion last month that memos about Libya she received from an old\nfriend while she was U.S. secretary of state were "unsolicited."\n\n\n\nClinton did not hand over the emails to the State Department last year when\nshe provided the agency with what she said was a complete record of her\nwork-related emails, the department said on Thursday night.\n\n\n\nThe disclosure that the record was incomplete, for reasons that remain\nunclear, has added to criticism of the favorite to become the Democratic\nParty\'s nominee for the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\n\nPolitical opponents say Clinton side-stepped federal record-keeping and\ntransparency laws by using a private email server in her home for\nwork-related correspondence. The Republican Party said on Friday it was\nrenewing its demands that Clinton relinquish the server to be examined.\n\n\n\n"Greetings from Kabul!" Clinton wrote in one of the newly disclosed emails\nin July 2012, in reply to a memo on the Libya election from her old friend\nand informal adviser Sidney Blumenthal. "And thanks for keeping this stuff\ncoming!"\n\n\n\nBlumenthal was barred from a job at the State Department by aides to\nPresident Barack Obama because of lingering distrust over his role advising\nClinton\'s run against Obama in the acrimonious 2008 Democratic primary,\naccording to the New York Times.\n\n\n\nA Clinton spokesman did not immediately respond to questions about whether\nthe newly disclosed emails undercut Clinton\'s comments at a campaign stop\nin Iowa last month on her relationship with Blumenthal.\n\n\n\n"He\'s been a friend of mine for a long time and he sent me unsolicited\nemails, which I passed on in some instances," Clinton said of Blumenthal in\nMay.\n\n\n\nIn a March 2012 email, Clinton replied to an email from Blumenthal about\npossible French and British actions in Libya. "This strains credulity based\non what I know," she wrote to Blumenthal. "Any other info about it?"\n\n\n\nIn a third example, she thanked Blumenthal for sending her intelligence\nabout the Libyan National Transitional Council in August 2011 ahead of a\nmeeting with NTC leaders. "I\'m going to Paris tomorrow night and will meet\n[with National Transitional Council] leaders so this and additional info\nuseful," she told him.\n\n\n\nClinton has seen her trustworthiness ratings erode after the revelations in\nMarch about her unusual email habits while she was the nation\'s top\ndiplomat.\n\n\n\nShe used a single private email account for all her personal and work\ncorrespondence, connected to a computer server kept in her New York home,\nan arrangement that she said broke no rules.\n\n\n\nIn March, Clinton deflected accusations of undue secrecy by saying she had\n"absolute confidence" she had given any emails that could possibly be\nwork-related to the State Department, including all that mentioned Libya.\nShe later called for the entire cache to be made public.\n\n\n\nIt remains unclear why Clinton apparently did not include these 15 emails\nwhen she handed over her records in December, and whether there are other\nomissions yet to be made public.\n\n\n\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said on Friday the department did not\nknow if other emails were missing.\n\n\n\nThe undisclosed emails first came to light after a Republican-led committee\nof U.S. lawmakers investigating the 2012 attack on diplomatic staff in\nBenghazi, Libya, obtained Blumenthal\'s record of the emails through a\nsubpoena.\n\n\n\nClinton did include a number of emails between her and Blumenthal in her\ndisclosure last year. Some of those had already been made public, but none\nof those included examples of Clinton actively encouraging Blumenthal\'s\ncorrespondence.\n\n\n\nNick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, said Clinton had provided the State\nDepartment with all the work-related correspondence she had in her\npossession. He declined to say whether emails had been deleted from\nClinton\'s private server at an earlier date, prior to the department\'s\nrequest.\n\n\n\nBlumenthal could not be reached for comment.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton TBT: \xe2\x80\x98Marriage Is Between A Man And A Woman\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://www.inquisitr.com/2205202/hillary-clinton-tbt-marriage-is-between-a-man-and-a-woman/>\n// Inquisitr \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nA Hillary Clinton TBT message has been making the rounds on Friday via\nFacebook, and it\xe2\x80\x99s casting a shadow over her celebration of the same-sex\nmarriage Supreme Court victory.\n\n\n\nFirst, I\xe2\x80\x99ll start with Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the momentous decision of five\nSupreme Court Justices to legalize same-sex marriage in all 50 states.\n\n\n\nAs you can see, it was quite the celebration, but it was also something\nthat she did not support while her husband was in office.\n\n\n\nFirst, the Hillary Clinton TBT meme that has conservative America, in\nparticular, buzzing.\n\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal dug up the full quote from the frontrunner for the\n2016 Democratic nomination in a piece entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Long\nRoad to Supporting Gay Marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer evolution has largely tracked public opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d writes WSJ\xe2\x80\x99s Tim\nHanrahan. \xe2\x80\x9cAs the country has gotten more comfortable with same sex\nmarriage, Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s opposition has softened.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn 1996, he points out, her husband, President Bill Clinton, signed the\nDefense of Marriage Act (DOMA) defining marriage as a union between one man\nand one woman.\n\n\n\nSo there is no saying that Hillary held a different view from her husband,\nhe also includes this quote, which she gave while running for the U.S.\nSenate in 2000 for the state of New York.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarriage has got historic, religious and moral content that goes back to\nthe beginning of time, and I think a marriage is as a marriage has always\nbeen, between a man and a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd here\xe2\x80\x99s some video from 2004.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Clinton has been a pretty strong supporter of marriage\nequality during the campaign trail.\n\n\n\nBut what do you think, readers? Is the Hillary Clinton TBT attack fair? Is\nMrs. Clinton just saying what she thinks everyone wants to hear, or is it\npossible her support is legitimately held? Sound off in the comments\nsection.\n\n\n\n*Al Gore: \xe2\x80\x98Too early\xe2\x80\x99 to back Hillary Clinton\n<http://pagesix.com/2015/06/26/al-gore-wont-back-hillary-clinton/> // Page\nSix // Emily Smith \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nAl Gore declined to back Hillary Clinton for president when asked who he\nthinks would be next in the White House.\n\n\n\nWhen questioned by WPP founder Sir Martin Sorrell at the Cannes Lions\nfestival of creativity about whom he would back for 2016, Gore \xe2\x80\x94 Bill\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s vice president from 1993 to 2001 \xe2\x80\x94notably didn\xe2\x80\x99t take the chance\nto praise Hillary.\n\n\n\nIn a packed Cannes Lions session Friday, Sorrell asked Gore, \xe2\x80\x9cWould you\nrefuse to answer the question [who will be the next president of the United\nStates]?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGore responded, \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t refuse to answer that question, I would try to\ncleverly dodge the question \xe2\x80\xa6 I would say it\xe2\x80\x99s actually too early.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGore merely smiled, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t comment further, after Sorrell added, \xe2\x80\x9cI\nthink Hillary will win and it would be great to have a female president of\nthe most powerful nation on the planet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGore has reportedly had a complicated relationship with the Clintons since\n2000. Political insiders speculate Gore may be remaining neutral for now\nbut would eventually back the Democratic nominee.\n\n\n\nGore last October described Hillary in an interview with Bloomberg as an\n\xe2\x80\x9cextremely capable person,\xe2\x80\x9d adding she did an excellent job as secretary of\nstate and a New York senator. But he also said it was too early and \xe2\x80\x9cI am\nnot going to engage in horse race analysis before the horses even go to the\ngate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe former vice president used his speech at Cannes to call on the ad and\ncreative world to help him in his fight against climate change. When asked\nabout climate deniers, Gore said it was a campaign run by polluters and\ncompared their actions to the tobacco industry, which employed actors\nposing as doctors to reassure consumers that smoking was safe: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\ndeeply unethical, immoral, destructive, really evil, and that is exactly\nwhat the climate denial industry is doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGore believes global warming would be a big issue at the next election:\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe age of fossil fuels is beginning to end \xe2\x80\xa6 years ago a Saudi minister\nonce said, \xe2\x80\x98The stone age didn\xe2\x80\x99t end because of a shortage of stones.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut he blasted lobbyists and special interests for blocking reform:\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmerican democracy has been hacked \xe2\x80\xa6 the US became the world\xe2\x80\x99s leader by\nmaking better decisions than any other nation \xe2\x80\xa6 the role of money really\ndegraded the decision-making quality in the US.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBig sources of special interest money are able to prevent the passage of\nalmost any meaningful reform in the public interest, it really pains me to\nsay \xe2\x80\xa6 That has had a cascading impact on the ability of the US to continue\nproviding the thought leadership to the world as a whole.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is urgent not only for the interests of the US but for the future of\nhumankind \xe2\x80\xa6 that the US find ways to quickly restore its ability to make\ndecisions based on its best values and to limit the corrupting impact and\ndegrading impact of lobbying and campaign contributions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhen asked if he thought the Obama administration had \xe2\x80\x9clost traction,\xe2\x80\x9d Gore\ncontinued that presidents have been constrained by Congress, and \xe2\x80\x9cThe most\nserious dysfunction in American democracy is now in the legislative branch,\nin Congress, because they spend most of their time begging rich people and\nspecial interests for money.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nUrging the world\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful ad executives and creatives to join him in\nthe fight against climate change, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease help \xe2\x80\xa6 this is for\nreal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDuring the session, Gore also poked fun at Sorrell\xe2\x80\x99s headline-grabbing\nsalary. After Sorrell, who heads the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest ad agency and earned\n$66 million last year, stated, \xe2\x80\x9cI am an expert in renumeration,\xe2\x80\x9d Gore\njoked, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I read about that every year.\xe2\x80\x9d And when Sorrell kept\ninterrupting him with questions, he quipped, \xe2\x80\x9cYour mind is so active,\nMartin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThere were also laughs when Gore talked about his $14 billion venture\ncapital firm Generation Investment Management, founded in London with David\nBlood, and Sorrell asked, \xe2\x80\x9cYou weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to call it Blood and Gore,\nwere you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSorrell ended the interview by asking which was the more honest TV\nportrayal of life in the White House, \xe2\x80\x9cThe West Wing\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cVeep.\xe2\x80\x9d Gore shot\nback, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are leaving out \xe2\x80\x98House of Cards\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe former vice president added, \xe2\x80\x9cI think Julia Louis-Dreyfus is an\nabsolute comedic genius, I was honored that she came and asked for some\nadvice before their first season, then again second season. But one of my\nformer speechwriters was a writer on \xe2\x80\x98West Wing,\xe2\x80\x99 and I think both shows\nhave been fantastic.\xe2\x80\x9d But he added, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98House of Cards\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x94 for the most part\n\xe2\x80\x94 should not be taken literally.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Achilles Heel: Trust\n<http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/26/Hillary-Clinton-s-Achilles-Heel-Trust>\n// Fiscal Times // Eric Pianin \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton remains the odds-on favorite to capture the 2016\nDemocratic presidential nomination, the former secretary of state continues\nto be dogged by questions about her honesty and integrity.\n\n\n\nAfter a steady stream of negative reports about dubious fundraising by her\nfamily\xe2\x80\x99s global foundation, the tens of millions of dollars that she and\nformer President Bill Clinton raked in giving speeches to colleges and\nspecial interest groups, and the controversy over her use of her private\nemail account to conduct official business during her four years at the\nState Department, recent polls show that doubts about her credibility may\nbe her Achilles heel.\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post and other news organizations reported Thursday that\nClinton withheld from the State Department at least 15 emails related to\nthe 2012 terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya \xe2\x80\x93\nonce again calling into question her contention that she had handed over\nher complete public record.\n\n\n\nThe discrepancy came to light several days ago after a House special panel\ninvestigating the Benghazi tragedy that led to the death of four Americans\nsubpoenaed former Clinton White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s records.\nAfter Blumenthal turned the emails over to the panel, the State Department\nsaid on Thursday that it could not locate \xe2\x80\x9call or part\xe2\x80\x9d of the emails among\nthe 55,000 pages messages from a private server Clinton used while in\noffice.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis confirms doubts about the completeness of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s self-selected\npublic record, and raises serious questions about her decision to erase her\npersonal server -- especially before it could be analyzed by an\nindependent, neutral third-party arbiter,\xe2\x80\x9d Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), chairman\nof the Select Committee on Benghazi.\n\n\n\nA Washington Post-ABC News poll earlier this month shows that the number of\npeople who view Clinton as honest and trustworthy has dropped from 53\npercent a year ago to just 41 percent now. Slightly more than half now\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see her as honest and trustworthy.\n\n\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a self-described Democratic socialist, is\nsteadily gaining ground on Clinton in the early primary battleground states\nof Iowa and New Hampshire, with the latest CNN/WMUR Granite State Poll\nshowing Sanders trailing Clinton in New Hampshire by just eight percentage\npoints, 43 percent to 35 percent.\n\n\n\nA Bloomberg Politics/Saint Anselm Poll conducted June 19-22 shows Clinton\nleading Sanders in Iowa 50 percent to 24 percent and in New Hampshire by\n56 percent to 24 percent. That represents a six- to eight-point increase in\nhis support since those states were polled by Bloomberg in May.\n\n\n\nAs Bloomberg noted, with nearly identical support in Iowa and New\nHampshire, Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 rise in the polls suggests that his appeal goes well\nbeyond his populist, anti-Wall Street message, and that voters are giving\nhim higher marks than Clinton on \xe2\x80\x9cauthenticity\xe2\x80\x9d and integrity.\n\n\n\n*A tireless Clinton ran until the end\n<https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2015/06/25/tireless-clinton-ran-until-end/YCoshzifvxFNjYg31Pgo1I/story.html>\n// Boston Globe // John C. King \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nThe candidate was speaking in a hoarse, raspy voice. Late at night, behind\nschedule again.\n\n\n\nI was leaning on a table in the back of the room, straining to hear and\nscribbling notes.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man is a HOSS. A HOSS. Just a . . . HOSS!! You got to understand what\nwe are seeing here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorse,\xe2\x80\x9d is what James Carville was shouting at me in his Cajun cadence,\nsomehow giddy despite the late hour and, more importantly, the character\ncloud that had pushed his candidate from front-runner into free fall as New\nHampshire primary day approached.\n\n\n\nGennifer Flowers and allegations of marital infidelity. A newly released\n1969 letter in which Bill Clinton called the Vietnam draft \xe2\x80\x9cillegitimate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seals his fate,\xe2\x80\x9d then-US Senator and Clinton rival Tom Harkin told me\nwhen I asked him about the draft letter.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s poll numbers were tanking, and Democratic circles buzzed with\ntalk that the Arkansas governor was toast and perhaps Governor Mario Cuomo\nof New York or Senator Lloyd Bentsen would enter the race to save the party.\n\n\n\nMy bosses suggested returning to Washington as the best option to track all\nthe rumors and rumblings. I begged to stay: I wanted to see whether one\nman\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable personal tenacity was enough to defy political gravity.\n\n\n\nThe language and lessons of that tumultuous 1992 primary stand out most\namong seven cycles of cherished New Hampshire memories that I covered for\nthe Associated Press and later for CNN.\n\n\n\nThe campaign began with the Clintons confident. His \xe2\x80\x9cPutting People First\xe2\x80\x9d\neconomic plan promising jobs and a middle-class tax cut was welcomed in a\nstate that was struggling. The Democratic field was not considered all that\nstrong.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s Southern roots and lexicon brought a bit of head scratching. Like\nwhen the candidate compared critics to \xe2\x80\x9cpigs squealing under a gate\xe2\x80\x9d or\nquestioned the timing of political attacks by noting, \xe2\x80\x9cif you see a turtle\non a fence post, chances are it didn\xe2\x80\x99t get there by accident.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut those same Southern roots fit the Clinton narrative: This was not a\nNorthern liberal like Michael Dukakis or Walter Mondale; the pro-death\npenalty governor gave Democrats a chance to win the White House.\n\n\n\nIn the heady days, Hillary would introduce Bill, who would then brag New\nHampshire and the nation were about to get \xe2\x80\x9ctwo for the price of one.\xe2\x80\x9d But\nas 1991 gave way to 1992, and the first-in-the-nation primary was drawing\nnear, confidence gave way to crisis. Crises, to be more accurate.\n\n\n\nOn Super Bowl Sunday, the Clintons traveled from New Hampshire to Boston to\nsit side by side on a hotel suite couch for an interview with CBS\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9c60\nMinutes\xe2\x80\x9d to brush the Flowers allegations aside.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have acknowledged causing pain in my marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bill Clinton,\ndeclining to offer details.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sitting here like some little woman, standing by my man like Tammy\nWynette,\xe2\x80\x9d Hillary Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sitting here because I love him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAgain, I was next to Carville, the Clinton campaign strategist. This time\nhe was silent, hanging on every word of the interview, gasping at one point\nwhen a light stand began falling toward the Clintons.\n\n\n\nI was there because the Clintons had agreed to an Associated Press\ninterview after the CBS taping. We began in the elevator down to the lobby,\nthe Clintons holding hands, and continued in the car en route to Logan\nAirport.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey bought and paid her,\xe2\x80\x9d Hillary Clinton said of Flowers and the Star\ntabloid.\n\n\n\nBill Clinton was more sympathetic.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere have been a lot of victims in this process and maybe she [Flowers]\nis one of them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot any more,\xe2\x80\x9d his wife quickly retorted.\n\n\n\nOn the tarmac at Logan, they split \xe2\x80\x94 Bill Clinton headed back for events in\nNew Hampshire; Hillary Clinton flew home to Little Rock to be with then\n11-year-old Chelsea as her parents\xe2\x80\x99 marriage became the flashpoint of\nAmerican politics.\n\n\n\nIt was just one of many vivid memories of trailing Clinton in that New\nHampshire campaign\xe2\x80\x99s tumultuous final weeks. There were late nights with\nimpromptu stops, including one Friday, as midnight approached, opening the\ndoor of his second VFW post in an hour.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis place must be OK \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99ve got Roy Orbison playing,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said\nwith a smile . Once inside, he shook every hand and fed a quarter into the\njukebox, pausing at Mariah Carey and ultimately selecting Patsy Cline.\n\n\n\nAnother day it was what reporters dubbed a \xe2\x80\x9cdeath march\xe2\x80\x9d through a shopping\nmall. Even some of the governor\xe2\x80\x99s aides surrendered to exhaustion and sat\non the floor while Clinton looked for more hands to shake, more skeptics to\nconvert.\n\n\n\nRepeatedly, in speeches and one-on-one appeals, Clinton suggested the\nattacks on him were designed to steer the campaign away from voters and\ntheir economic anxiety.\n\n\n\nOne such appeal is now the stuff of New Hampshire primary legend, his\npromise \xe2\x80\x94 delivered in Dover \xe2\x80\x94 that if the voters gave him a second chance,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be there for you till the last dog dies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t win, but he declared his second-place finish evidence he was\n1992\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccomeback kid.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nCovering Clinton in those days was to experience \xe2\x80\x9cSurvivor\xe2\x80\x9d long before the\nage of reality television, and he always remained grateful to New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nOn Inauguration Day 2001, after handing the White House over to George W.\nBush, Clinton flew home to Little Rock, and invited a few reporters who had\nbeen there in the early days of the 1992 campaign along for the ride.\n\n\n\nThe conversation was full of memories of Dunkin\xe2\x80\x99 Donuts, the loyal band of\nClinton New Hampshire supporters, and the roller coaster final weeks.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was wild,\xe2\x80\x9d the now former president said on that nostalgic flight. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nlove that place.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*OTHER DEMOCRATS NATIONAL COVERAGE*\n\n*DECLARED*\n\n\n\n*O\xe2\x80\x99MALLEY*\n\n\n\n*O\xe2\x80\x99Malley lays out foreign policy vision\n<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/omalley-lays-out-foreign-policy-vision> //\nMSNBC // Alex-Seitz-Wald \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley laid out his foreign\npolicy vision in his most extensive remarks on international affairs to\ndate at the Truman Project, a progressive national security group in\nWashington, D.C., on Friday.\n\n\n\nAs a former governor of Maryland, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley has arguably less direct foreign\npolicy experience than his Democratic rivals. Front-runner Hillary Clinton\nserved as secretary of state, while the rest of the field served in the\nSenate, which has a constitutional role in making and approving foreign\npolicy.\n\n\n\nBut O\xe2\x80\x99Malley was the first declared Democratic presidential candidate to\ngive a traditional speech exclusively on foreign policy, and he used the\nremarks Friday to bolster his credentials and to subtly distinguish himself\nfrom Clinton.\n\n\n\nThe former governor called for a more holistic approach to national\nsecurity \xe2\x80\x94 which he argues should go beyond typical military threats to\ninclude dangers like climate change, infectious pandemics, droughts, and\ncybersecurity. And traditionally economic issues like immigration and\nenergy policy should also be viewed as key national security concerns, he\nadded.\n\n\n\nAfter years of war, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that many Americans would like to\ndisengage from the world around us. That\xe2\x80\x99s understandable, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not\nresponsible,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He detailed a range of threats to the U.S.,\nincluding the so-called Islamic State, which he called \xe2\x80\x9ca gang of murderous\nthugs who have perverted one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s great religions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe U.S. national security structure, which was created after World War II,\nwas organized in a way that did not account for these modern-day threats.\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley called for a \xe2\x80\x9cnew National Security Act,\xe2\x80\x9d the Truman-era law that\nmade sweeping reorganizations of the basic structure of the military in\n1947.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevelopment, defense, diplomacy; they all stand together as equal parts of\nour national security \xe2\x80\x93 or at least they should,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley drew on his experience as governor where possible, discussing his\nwork on combating various threats and calling for training National Guard\ntroops to take a lead on cybersecurity in the U.S. homeland. \xe2\x80\x9cCritical\ninfrastructure remains extremely vulnerable to hackers,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nBut he also acknowledged that he had more learning to do. \xe2\x80\x9cThis time is not\nexclusively for questions! If you have answers, we would really like to\nhear your answers,\xe2\x80\x9d he quipped at the start of a question-and-answer\nsession, which was open only to participants and not the press.\n\n\n\nWhile he never mentioned her name, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley drew some apparent contrasts\nbetween himself and Clinton.\n\n\n\nThe Iraq War, which Clinton voted to approve in the Senate, \xe2\x80\x9cwill be\nremembered as one of the most tragic, deceitful, and costly blunders in\nU.S. history,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The former governor added that the war would not\nhave been possible without the \xe2\x80\x9cappalling silence of the good,\xe2\x80\x9d quoting\nMartin Luther King Jr.\n\n\n\nHe even invoked the Benghazi terror attack, which occurred under Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nwatch, but retreated from the issue quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are real lessons to be\nlearned from the tragedy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s campaign denied that his comments were a veiled rebuke of the\nClinton. \xe2\x80\x9cThis was not a speech about Hillary Clinton and the State\nDepartment,\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s senior foreign policy adviser Doug Wilson told\nreporters afterwards.\n\n\n\nWilson is also the chairman of the board of advisers for the Truman Project.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis governor has traveled. He has met with foreign leaders. He has met\nwith [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu,\xe2\x80\x9d Wilson said, of\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy credentials. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I think he feels that he has\nqualifications in this area. He may not be a Bookings Institution policy\nwonk, but he is somebody who has a sense of the realities of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nProving foreign policy chops is a challenge familiar to every governor who\nruns for president.

His campaign\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t file its initial report until July 15, but filings by ActBlue, the\nonline fund-raising committee that serves as a conduit for Democratic\ncampaigns, show that Mr. Sanders has brought in more money in May and the\nfirst half of June than any other Democratic candidate using ActBlue.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s likely that Mr. Sanders will report more than $9 million raised as of\nJune 30, the deadline for midyear F.E.C. reports. That amount is larger\nthan any Republican not named Mitt Romney raised in the first half of 2011.\n\n\n\nHis total is greater than that of Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, the former Maryland\ngovernor who also uses ActBlue and has collected more than $331,000 in his\nfirst month of online fund-raising. But Mr. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s online success is\nlikely to be eclipsed in the first set of filings by Hillary Rodham\nClinton, who has a larger network of donors and more time to raise money.\n(ActBlue is not Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s primary online fund-raising vehicle; she has\nreceived at least $43,000 through ActBlue users between April 20 and June\n17).\n\n\n\nOn April 30, the day Mr. Sanders announced his candidacy, he generated more\nthan $1 million via ActBlue. He got $1.6 million on May 3. Not counting\nthose two largest days, on average ActBlue users sent $177,598 to Mr.\nSanders each day between May 4 and June 17.\n\n\n\nWithout the support of a \xe2\x80\x9csuper PAC,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s total may seem small\ncompared with some of the other 2016 candidates, but anywhere close to $10\nmillion would be a very respectable total for a candidate who raised a\ntotal of $6.2 million for his 2012 Senate race. One question is whether\nthis initial flood of donations represents the high-water mark or can be\nsustained.\n\n\n\nUnlike candidate filings, ActBlue\xe2\x80\x99s F.E.C. reports don\xe2\x80\x99t make for easy\nbrowsing, because they often include tens of thousands of rows on a\nspreadsheet detailing millions of dollars of contributions. And absent\nspecial congressional elections in Mississippi, New York and Illinois,\nActBlue would not have needed to file its own report until next month. But\nbecause of those races, we get a glimpse of donor support for Mr. Sanders.\n\n*This Is Bernie Sanders\' Plan to Beat Hillary Clinton\n<http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/06/bernie-sanders-plan-to-beat-hillary-clinton>\n// Mother Jones // David Corn \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nIt\'s fortunate for Hillary Clinton that Sen. Bernie Sanders, the\nindependent socialist from Vermont who is challenging her for the\nDemocratic presidential nomination, despises and eschews negative\nadvertising. That\'s because the political consulting firm that Sanders has\nretained to advise his campaign has a well-developed expertise in devising\nattack ads. Earlier this year, this outfit, Devine Mulvey Longabaugh, won a\nPollie award from the American Association of Political Consultants for\ncreating the best Democratic congressional ad of 2014. The spot slammed\nDave Trott, a Republican running for a congressional seat in Michigan, for\nmaking millions of dollars by foreclosing on residents of his state, and it\nfocused on the harrowing eviction of a 101-year-old Detroit woman. Trott\nsurvived this assault and handily won the seat in the Republican district,\nbut the Washington Post called the commercial "one of the most brutal\nattack ads you\'ll ever see."\n\n\n\nThe Sanders campaign has no plans to hurl these kinds of ads at Clinton. As\nTad Devine, the veteran political operative who leads this firm and a\nlongtime adviser to Sanders, notes, mudslinging is not part of the campaign\nstrategy that Sanders and his advisers have crafted. There won\'t even be\none speck of dust directly tossed at Clinton. But, Devine tells me,\nimplicit negative messages aimed at Clinton will certainly be "embedded" in\nSanders\' advertising and social media messaging.\n\n\n\nSanders does have an overall plan on how to beat Clinton. As Devine\nexplains, it goes something like this: Raise enough money to devote\nsignificant resources to building a full operation and maintaining a media\npresence in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, as well as Nevada\nand South Carolina. At the same time, develop a basic foundation for\ncampaign organizations in other states, so if Sanders fares well in the\ninitial contests, these preliminary outfits can quickly be built out.\nDevine and other Sanders advisers estimate they will need to raise $40-$50\nmillion by the Iowa caucuses to be in such a position, and they claim\nSanders is on track to hit that mark, mainly with thousands and thousands\nof low-dollar contributions. (Sanders has drawn crowds of thousands at\nrecent campaign events.) "I don\'t know if we can outright beat her in Iowa\nand New Hampshire," Devine says, "but we have a real shot at it in both\nplaces."\n\n\n\nAnd when\xe2\x80\x94or if\xe2\x80\x94that happens, Devine figures, Sanders will have about a\nmillion contributors already on his side, and this group will\nenthusiastically kick in more money to replenish Sanders\' coffers and fund\nthe continuation of Bernie-mentum. "I worked for Walter Mondale in 1984,"\nDevine recalls, "but I saw what Gary Hart did." Hart, a former senator who\nwent up against Mondale in a bid for the Democratic presidential\nnomination, placed a surprising second in Iowa and won New Hampshire.\n"Things then moved fast. Some polls moved 50 points in seven days," Devine\nsays. (Mondale, though, did end up squelching the Hart insurgency by\nexploiting the Democratic establishment in key states.)\n\n\n\nIf Sanders does score well in the early states, Devine insists, his\ncampaign will have a delegate-accumulation strategy reminiscent of the one\nBarack Obama\'s 2008 campaign employed to focus as much on snagging\ndelegates as winning caucuses and primaries. "Even if Clinton beats us in\nsome states by 20 points, we can split the delegates with smart focusing,"\nDevine says. And then Sanders will be in a position to make the case to the\nDemocratic establishment that he can assemble an electorate in the general\nelection that is favorable to Democrats (as Obama did in 2008). "We don\'t\nknow yet what it will look like," Devine remarks. "We haven\'t done the\nstrategic modeling yet. I\'ve been trying to persuade Bernie we should do\nthat." Instead, he says, Sanders at this point would rather concentrate on\npromoting his message: Inequality is killing the middle class, climate\nchange must be addressed, big-money politics must be reformed, and new\nprogressive policy ideas, such as free college tuition and expanded Social\nSecurity benefits, must be advanced. (Devine also gave Sanders a PowerPoint\npresentation on how the campaign can use Big Data methods: "He was\nimpressed, but we\'re not sure we can scale up to that. We won\'t have $1\nbillion.")\n\n\n\nAnd what about Clinton? How will Sanders take her on?\n\n\n\nSanders recently boasted that he has "never run a negative ad," noting that\nhe "hates and detests these 30-second negative ads." Devine says this is\npart of Sanders\' DNA. "You need to know Bernie\'s history with negative ads\nto get this," Devine says. In 1988, when Sanders was the mayor of\nBurlington, Vermont, he ran for an open congressional seat as an\nindependent and lost a close race to Republican Peter Smith. Two years\nlater, Sanders was back to challenge Smith. In that 1990 race, Smith aired\ntough ads assailing Sanders, and Sanders\' aides advised him to hit back.\nInstead, Sanders bought airtime for a five-minute spot in which he talked\nstraight to the camera and decried the attack ads. (It didn\'t hurt Sanders\nthat the National Rifle Association was slamming Smith for having voted for\na ban on semi-automatic weapons.) Sanders ended up winning that race by 16\npoints. "This was his formative experience," says Devine. "Negative ads\nhave to be denounced and jiu-jitsued."\n\n\n\nDuring his 1994 re-election race, Sanders had a close call. He won by only\nthree points. He responded by doing what he swore he would never do: He\nhired a Washington consultant, Devine. But he told Devine he would stick to\nhis no-negative-ads stance. In the next election, Sanders aired only\npositive spots and won by 22 points.\n\n\n\nTen years later, Sanders ran for the Senate, with Devine still advising\nhim. His Republican opponent was a millionaire businessman named Rich\nTarrant who dumped about $7 million into the race in a state where, Devine\nsays, no candidate had ever spent more than $2 million on a campaign. "It\nwas a vicious campaign against Bernie," Devine recalls. "He ran ads that\naccused Bernie of supporting child molesters and terrorists. Chuck Schumer\nand Harry Reid were telling Bernie, \'You must respond.\'" Sanders replied\nwith an ad Devine had cut, in which Sanders noted he was being unfairly\nattacked and asked voters to visit his website to get the truth. Subsequent\ncommercials by Sanders attempted to refute the stream of attack ads from\nTarrant. The Sanders campaign also pushed an ad in which country singer\nWillie Nelson endorsed Sanders and cited his work for family farmers.\nSanders beat Tarrant by more than a 2-1 margin.\n\n\n\nSo Sanders has survived and thrived in politics by neutralizing negative\nads and resisting the urge to attack. And part of his shtick is that he\ndoesn\'t do conventional politics. So, Devine notes, he will not directly\ncriticize or poke at Clinton. For sure, no personal attacks or cheap shots.\n"That won\'t help him," Devine says. "He rejects the status quo of\npolitics." Sanders won\'t even do a straight-up contrast ad\xe2\x80\x94as in, Bernie\nSanders believes X about subject Y, but Hillary Clinton believes Z. "If we\ndo that, we\'re done," Devine says. "If we do a classic comparative ad, it\'s\nover. We\'ll have to be smarter."\n\n\n\nAnd Team Sanders does have what it considers to be a smarter way: implying\na contrast. In previous campaigns, Devine says, "We have constantly\nembedded contrast in everything we do." One example: During the 2006 Senate\nrace, Tarrant\'s residence became a political issue because he had claimed a\nFlorida mansion as his home for tax purposes. Sanders ran a biographical ad\nin which he declared he worked in Washington and lived in Burlington\xe2\x80\x94an\nindirect jab at Tarrant. In the campaign against Clinton, Devine notes,\n"There will be a lot of implicit negative. But it won\'t look negative. It\nwon\'t feel negative."\n\n\n\nThat\'s how Sanders recently handled the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade\npact. He opposes the measure as a sop to corporate America and\nbillionaires. Asked about Clinton\'s view\xe2\x80\x94she has referred positively to\nthis trade deal in the past but more recently has avoided stating a firm\nposition\xe2\x80\x94Sanders didn\'t proclaim that she\'s in bed with the 1 percent; he\ncalled on her to take a clear stance. "It\'s not a question of watching\nthis," he said. "You\'re going to have determine which side are you on."\nDevine points out that "this is not negative, but contrasting. When you\noffer voters a contrast on the issues, they don\'t take that as a negative."\nHe adds that Sanders is "very good at this."\n\n\n\nContrast without attacking\xe2\x80\x94that\'s the mantra. "As someone making the ads,\nit will be a difficult challenge," Devine says. "We have to present the\ndifferences in the ads without him coming across as part of the political\nsystem." Devine fears that if Sanders crosses that line, the Clinton\ncampaign will fire back hard: "They have all the tonnage. We\'re dead."\n\n\n\n*Bernie Sanders Is Enjoying a Mini-Surge\n<http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-is-enjoying-a-mini-surge>\n// The New Yorker // John Cassidy \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, while the political world was focussed on the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s\nObamacare ruling, two polls came out showing Bernie Sanders making up\nground on Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire and Iowa. In a survey carried\nout by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center for CNN and the\nManchester-based WMUR TV, Clinton was leading Sanders by just eight\npercentage points: forty-three per cent to thirty-five per cent. Meanwhile,\na poll carried out in Iowa for Bloomberg found that Sanders now has the\nsupport of about a quarter of likely Democratic voters, by far his\nstrongest showing yet in the state that will be the first to vote in the\nDemocratic primary. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s tremendous progress that he is making with voters\nin the first two states,\xe2\x80\x9d Tad Devine, Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s chief political strategist,\ntold Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s John McCormick. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something we felt on the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAt this stage, it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to issue a few qualifiers.\n\n\n\nFirst, it\xe2\x80\x99s not July 4th yet, and there are still seven months until the\n2016 primaries begin. At this early stage, opinion polls bounce around\nquite a bit, and no single survey should be accorded very much weight.\nSecond, Clinton is trouncing Sanders in the national polls. Third, even in\nthe early primary states she still has a big advantage. In Iowa, Sanders\nhas yet to come within twenty-five points of her in any poll, and in New\nHampshire a separate Bloomberg survey found that she retains a much bigger\nlead than the CNN/WMUR survey suggested: twenty-six points. \xe2\x80\x9cClinton\nremains enormously well-known and well-liked in New Hampshire, a state she\nwon before,\xe2\x80\x9d Doug Usher, of Purple Strategies, the research firm that\ncarried out Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s New Hampshire poll, said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe benefits from a\ngender gap in a primary that will be disproportionately female, and even\nSanders\xe2\x80\x99s voters admit Clinton is likely the nominee.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSo there\xe2\x80\x99s no need for panic in the Clinton camp, which has adopted the\npublic position that it expected a competitive primary all along. But for\nSanders, and for Democrats who would like an alternative to Clinton, the\nsigns are encouraging. The seventy-three-year-old Vermont senator is\nclearly enjoying himself, hurtling around the country, drawing large\ncrowds, and promoting his progressive agenda. In the past few days, for\ninstance, he has welcomed Pope Francis\xe2\x80\x99s encyclical on climate change,\ncriticized Congress for granting President Obama fast-track authority to\ncomplete the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and reiterated his call to expand\nMedicare into a national health-care system for everyone.\n\n\n\nAs Sanders promised when he started out, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t criticizing Clinton\ndirectly. But he is seeking to draw a contrast between his clear positions\non such issues as trade with his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s nuanced statements. And he\xe2\x80\x99s\ninsisting he\xe2\x80\x99s in it to win. Speaking to David Corn, of Mother Jones,\nDevine explained that Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s strategy is based on raising enough\nmoney\xe2\x80\x94forty or fifty million dollars\xe2\x80\x94to advertise in the early primary\nstates of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, and he claimed\nthat, thanks to lots of small donations, this strategy is working so far.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we can outright beat her in Iowa and New Hampshire,\xe2\x80\x9d\nDevine said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we have a real shot at it in both places.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThat may be stretching things. Still, if Sanders keeps gaining, he will\ncertainly have the capacity to disrupt some of the Clinton campaign\xe2\x80\x99s\ncarefully laid plans. Should they go after Bernie? Should they ignore him?\nSomething in the middle? Up until now, the Clintonites have been running a\nprofessional and highly scripted operation that has achieved most of its\ninitial goals, but that sometimes resembles painting by numbers. Clinton\nhas the money, the infrastructure, and the support from other prominent\nDemocrats that Sanders lacks, but the Vermont senator has advantages, too:\nenthusiasm at the grassroots, the flexibility that comes with being a\none-man band, and the ability to position himself as a scrappy underdog and\noutsider.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can make the case that a certain amount of Bernie Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s support is\na protest vote, but there\xe2\x80\x99s more to it than that,\xe2\x80\x9d J. Ann Selzer, the\npresident of Selzer & Co, which carried out Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s poll in Iowa, said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople like him. They like what he stands for. They like showing up at his\nevents and hearing him say things they believe in.\xe2\x80\x9d In short, Sanders is\nrunning a classic insurgency campaign. And as many establishment candidates\nhave discovered in the past, running against such an opponent can be an\nuncomfortable experience.\n\n\n\n*Read Late 1970s Bernie Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 No-Holds-Barred Critique Of Mass Media\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/read-late-1970s-bernie-sanders-no-holds-barred-critique-of-m#.jyJOWO6ve>\n// Buzzfeed // Andrew Kaczynski \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nIn the late 1970s Bernie Sanders, then still known mostly as the perennial\nLiberty Union candidate and freelance writer, wrote a critique of mass\nmedia and television for the Vanguard Press, an alt-weekly that ran from\nthe mid 1970s into the early 1980s.\n\n\n\nIn the critique, Sanders holds contempt for the mainstream media, which he\nsaid abided by the \xe2\x80\x9cwell-tested Hitlerian principle that people should be\ntreated as morons and bombarded over and over again with the same simple\nphrases and ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSanders noted three major functions of the television industry.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, it is supposed to make as much money as possible for the owners of\nthe industry and for the companies who advertise,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cSecond, like\nheroin and alcohol, television serves the function of an escapist mechanism\nwhich allows people to \xe2\x80\x98space out\xe2\x80\x99 and avoid the pain and conflict of their\nlives \xe2\x80\x94 and the causes of those problems. Third, television is the major\nvehicle by which the owners of this society propagate their political\npoints of view (including lies and distortions) through the \xe2\x80\x98news.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nToday, the socialist Vermont senator who is seeking the Democratic\npresidential nomination still views mass communication as an important\nissue facing the country. He maintains a page on his website where he\nnotes, \xe2\x80\x9cmedia consolidation suppresses diversity and ignores the needs and\ninterests of local communities.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Vermont weekly Seven Days has dug deep in Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 history in the\nstate, as a perennial candidate, mayor, congressman, and senator. A \xe2\x80\x9cBernie\nBeat\xe2\x80\x9d archived details his record in the state coming back into the early\n1970s. This article is among those posted in their extensive archives.\n\n\n\nSanders noted a \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental contradiction\xe2\x80\x9d in television like many aspects\nof a capitalist society. He said owners of the mass media industry don\xe2\x80\x99t\nwant to educate people because \xe2\x80\x9cto do so would be to act against their own\nbest interests.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the owners of the TV industry want to do, and are doing, in my\nopinion, is use that medium to intentionally brainwash people into\nsubmission and helplessness,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Sanders.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith considerable forethought they are attempting to create a nation of\nmorons who will faithfully go out and buy this or that product, vote for\nthis or that candidate, and faithfully work for their employers for as low\na wage as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSanders said if \xe2\x80\x9cthe television industry encouraged intellectual growth,\nhonesty, and the pursuit of truth, it would put most major corporations out\nof business.\xe2\x80\x9d He noted \xe2\x80\x9cmost advertising consists of lies designed to sell\nproducts which are either identical to the competition, totally useless,\ngrossly overpriced, or dangerous to human health or the environment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last thing that the owners of the TV industry would want is for people\nto know the truth about the products sold on the air,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote.\n\n\n\nSanders concluded by noting control of television is a political issue that\nis necessary to address for those \xe2\x80\x9cwho are concerned about living in a\ndemocratic and healthy society.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Clinton backer has \'crush\' on Bernie Sanders\n<http://thehill.com/video/in-the-news/246297-clinton-supporter-has-crush-on-bernie-sanders>\n// The Hill // Judy Kurtz \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nMargaret Cho, a Hillary Clinton supporter, says she\xe2\x80\x99s got a "crush" on\nBernie Sanders.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s corner,\xe2\x80\x9d the comedienne told Larry King on his show,\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoliticKING,\xe2\x80\x9d on Thursday, \xe2\x80\x9calthough I have a little crush on Bernie\nSanders.

He\xe2\x80\x99s really talking about like, how this is all a race about\nmoney.

Now he\xe2\x80\x99s got another: John Roberts.\n\n\n\nWith conservatives up in arms over Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 role in preserving Obamacare,\nJeb Bush suddenly finds himself called to answer for the chief justice\nappointed by his brother, George W. Bush. And not just Roberts \xe2\x80\x94 Jeb is\nalso taking flak for David Souter, the liberal justice appointed by his\nfather, George H.W. Bush.\n\n\n\nIn a radio interview Friday afternoon, Jeb Bush was pressed by host Hugh\nHewitt to explain the Roberts and Souter nominations to disappointed\nconservatives.\n\n\n\nBush was reluctant to criticize the chief justice, preferring to talk more\nbroadly about the need to appoint battle-tested conservatives to the high\ncourt after back-to-back rulings on Obamacare and same-sex marriage that\ndelighted the left.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m disappointed in both decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d Bush told Hewitt. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important I\nthink to think about going forward what kind of judges we need in the\nhighest court in the land.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was governor, we tried to find people with a proven record of\njudicial restraint, and people that were committed to enforcing the\nconstitutional limits on government authority. In essence, what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying\nis I think we need to have people that have not just theoretically, but\nhave had a proven record of not legislating from the bench.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what conservatives thought they were getting in Roberts, who was\nappointed to his position by George W. Bush in 2005. After his majority\nopinion in King v.

Bush appointed Clarence Thomas in 1991; George W. Bush tapped\nSamuel Alito and Roberts for two vacancies in 2005.\n\n\n\nConservatives couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more pleased with Thomas and Alito. When it comes\nto the chief justice, however, it\xe2\x80\x99s a different story now that the Roberts\nCourt has twice ruled in favor of Obamacare.\n\n\n\nFollowing the court\xe2\x80\x99s 6-3 decision to uphold Obamacare subsidies on\nThursday, Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s campaign pointed the finger at the president, emailing\nhis supporters with a fundraising pitch that argued, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the direct\nresult of President Obama.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHewitt, however, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him get away with that line, noting that the\ndecision itself came from Roberts, who wrote the majority opinion.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he still a model for you going forward?\xe2\x80\x9d the host asked Bush.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI liked one of his rulings and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the other,\xe2\x80\x9d Bush replied,\nreferring to his agreement with Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 dissent in the same-sex marriage\ncase. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a person of unimpeachable integrity and great intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBush\xe2\x80\x99s velvet-glove criticism of Roberts wasn\xe2\x80\x99t nearly tough enough for a\nconservative base that loathes Obamacare.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe biggest political loser in this decision was Governor Jeb Bush who\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be trusted with Supreme Court nominations,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the conservative\npublication Human Events. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bush family has packed the court liberals in\nconservative clothing. America can\xe2\x80\x99t take the risk of another Bush making\nthe same mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHewitt reminded Bush about the justices appointed by his father and\nbrother, specifically Souter, who\xe2\x80\x99s no longer on the court. The now retired\njustice wound up siding mostly with the court\xe2\x80\x99s liberal wing during his\ntenure and became a huge disappointment to conservatives.\n\n\n\nRoberts, once beloved on the right and a jurist whom conservatives hoped\nwould preside over the court for decades to come, is now drawing\nunfavorable comparisons to Souter for having ruled to uphold the Affordable\nCare Act \xe2\x80\x94 first by saving the individual mandate in the summer of 2012 and\nnow by declaring the tax subsidies offered under the health law to be\nconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll justices disappoint their presidents some of the time but Souter was\nlike a 90 percent swing and miss,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewitt said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you avoid Souters?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou focus on people to be Supreme Court justices who have a proven record\nof judicial restraint,\xe2\x80\x9d Bush answered.\n\n\n\n*Jeb Bush is heading to Charleston for a private meeting with pastors\n<http://www.businessinsider.com/r-jeb-bush-to-visit-charleston-next-week-to-meet-with-pastors-2015-6#ixzz3eFTh00Zb>\n// Reuters \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Jeb Bush, a Republican contender for president, will\nsit down with pastors on a visit on Monday to Charleston, South Carolina,\nwhere nine African-Americans were shot to death at a historic black church,\nhis campaign said on Friday.\n\n\n\nBush, the former Florida governor who leads many polls of Republican voters\nin the race for the party\'s 2016 presidential nomination, had canceled a\nplanned campaign stop in Charleston a week ago when the shootings took\nplace.\n\n\n\nInstead of a campaign event, Bush will hold a private session with pastors\nfrom the Charleston community. In an attempt to keep the session low key,\nthe news media will not be allowed in.\n\n\n\nBush has vowed to campaign in places where Republicans have not always gone\nin recent years, such as black churches and impoverished neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama gave a speech in Charleston on Friday about racial\ndifferences in the United States at the funeral for the Rev. Clementa\nPinckney, who was among those shot to death.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton, who is the Democratic frontrunner for president, was among\nthose at the funeral on Friday.\n\n\n\nWhile Florida governor, Bush engineered a move for the state to stop\ndisplaying the Confederate battle flag. A source familiar with the\nsituation said Bush had consulted with South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley\nin the days before she announced an effort this week to remove the flag\nfrom the grounds of the state capitol in Columbia.\n\n\n\n*Jeb Bush Tries to Win Without Speaking to His Favorite Strategist\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-26/does-anyone-believe-jeb-bush-isn-t-talking-to-his-super-pac-chief->\n// Bloomberg // Michael C. Bender \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nThe singular failure of Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s political career was his 1994 loss in\nthe Florida governor\xe2\x80\x99s race by less than two percentage points. The defeat\ncast Bush, a rising Republican star, into the political wilderness just as\nhis older brother, George, won an upset victory over Ann Richards in Texas,\nputting him on the path to the presidency. When Jeb ran again in 1998, he\nbrought in Mike Murphy, an ad man credited with helping John Engler and\nChristine Todd Whitman win governorships in Michigan and New Jersey. Bush\nwon by more than 10 points. He had Murphy at his side as he cruised to\nreelection in 2002. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to win the presidency without his\nfavorite strategist whispering in his ear.\n\n\n\nMurphy is in charge of Right to Rise, a super PAC created to get Bush\nelected. Because of regulations requiring a separation between candidates\nand super PACs, they can\xe2\x80\x99t formally coordinate their efforts between now\nand the election. All the major candidates in the 2016 race will have super\nPACs working on their behalf, but Bush and Murphy are trying something\nunprecedented in U.S. presidential elections: building a separate, and\nbetter-funded, organization that will in some ways eclipse the official\ncampaign as a vehicle for promoting the candidate. Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s Los\nAngeles-based team will produce digital marketing, television ads, and\nopposition research on behalf of Bush, whose campaign headquarters are\nacross the country in Miami. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a good friend, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to miss\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9d Bush says. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope to see him on election night and give him an\nembrace. But from here on out, I won\xe2\x80\x99t be talking to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nUnlike the campaign, the super PAC can accept unlimited contributions. Bush\nspent the months before announcing his candidacy on June 15 taking in tens\nof millions of dollars for the group, which will report how much it\xe2\x80\x99s\nraised in mid-July. He has been the featured guest at least 39 times for\nRight to Rise fundraisers, according to invitations compiled by the\nSunlight Foundation. The list includes events where the suggested donation\nwas $100,000 a person in Chicago, Miami, and New York. Going forward, he\xe2\x80\x99ll\nbe allowed to appear at the group\xe2\x80\x99s events as a guest, but he can\xe2\x80\x99t discuss\nstrategy or coordinate with Murphy directly.\n\n\n\nFor Murphy, who declined to be interviewed, the setup offers some clear\nbenefits. For one thing, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be the autonomous ruler of the super PAC\nstaff, free of the office politics of the campaign. He plans to use his own\nVirginia-based consulting company, Revolution Agency, to produce TV ads and\na digital marketing effort to reach voters via social media and text\nmessaging. In a June 17 conference call with donors, Murphy said he was no\nlonger coordinating with the campaign but was \xe2\x80\x9cwell informed as of a week\nago\xe2\x80\x9d about Bush\xe2\x80\x99s strategy. He said Right to Rise would focus on\nfundraising this year, holding on to most of its cash until primaries begin\nin early 2016\xe2\x80\x94though Murphy said Right to Rise would \xe2\x80\x9cdo a few frugal,\nhighly targeted things to help boost the governor\xe2\x80\x99s narrative\xe2\x80\x9d this summer,\nas the candidate travels around the country meeting voters.\n\n\n\nThe call, which was reported by BuzzFeed, illustrates the limits of the\nno-coordination rules. In the midterms, candidates and super PACs devised\nnumerous tactics for telegraphing their strategies. One was tipping off\nmainstream news organizations to ad buys or strategic shifts. American\nCrossroads, a major Republican super PAC, and other groups used Twitter to\nshare polling data with party committees, posting tweets filled with\ncryptic strings of data\xe2\x80\x94in one case from an account named for a West Wing\ncharacter. Aides to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee tweeted a\nlink to ad scripts devised by New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen\xe2\x80\x99s\ncampaign that were used by Senate Majority PAC, the largest outside\nDemocratic group. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Bush\xe2\x80\x99s chief strategist is doing conference calls to\nlay out exactly what the plan is and how that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the campaign, then\nthere is no independence,\xe2\x80\x9d says Bill Burton, a co-founder of Priorities\nUSA, a Democratic super PAC created in 2012 to support President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\nreelection that\xe2\x80\x99s now working for Hillary Clinton. (Burton is no longer\ninvolved.) \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not to suggest Mike Murphy and the Bush campaign or\nanyone is breaking the laws. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that the law is really stupid.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBush says his campaign and Right to Rise are on parallel tracks. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\nthink we\xe2\x80\x99re exporting any responsibilities,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. The campaign already\nhas staff on the ground in Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.\nRight to Rise staffers have been trailing Bush and his events for months,\nstockpiling footage for ads. \xe2\x80\x9cThe super PAC? We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what they do,\xe2\x80\x9d Bush\nsays. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope it enhances the message that I hope to bring.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBush\xe2\x80\x99s top adviser on the campaign is Sally Bradshaw, who has been working\nwith him since his father\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign in 1992. Murphy, who also\nworked on the 1992 campaign, is a foil for Bush, who sometimes struggles to\ntell a joke but has a keen appreciation for the role humor can play in\nbuoying or tanking a campaign. In the 1998 governor\xe2\x80\x99s race, when Bush faced\noff against a Democrat named Buddy MacKay, Murphy came up with a simple tag\nline: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not your buddy.\xe2\x80\x9d The line, or a version of it, was used in\nevery possible ad. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a great example of Mike\xe2\x80\x99s creativity,\xe2\x80\x9d says Cory\nTilley, a Tallahassee political operative who handled communications for\nBush in his Florida races. \xe2\x80\x9cThat took the edge off some so it didn\xe2\x80\x99t look\nlike a down-in-the-gutter attack.\xe2\x80\x9d One TV spot accused MacKay and Florida\nDemocrats of being soft on crime because they\xe2\x80\x99d relaxed sentencing laws to\naddress prison overcrowding. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks, Buddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said a burglar in the\ncommercial.\n\n\n\nAlong with Bradshaw, Murphy has been able to tell Bush when he\xe2\x80\x99s strayed\noff course\xe2\x80\x94or help him regain focus after campaign setbacks. \xe2\x80\x9cMurphy is one\nof the few people that Jeb can hear that from and believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Brian\nCrowley, a Florida political analyst.\n\n\n\n*Nuclear 2.0? Jeb Bush is Open to Ending the Senate Filibuster to Repeal\nObamacare\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-26/nuclear-2-0-jeb-bush-is-open-to-ending-the-senate-filibuster-to-repeal-obamacare>\n// Bloomberg // Sahil Kapur \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said Friday he\'s open to\neliminating the Senate\'s 60-vote threshold if it helps Congress repeal\nObamacare and enact "free-market oriented" health care reforms.\n\n\n\nAppearing on Hugh Hewitt\'s radio show, the former Florida governor was\nasked if he\'d support invoking the "Reid rule"\xe2\x80\x94also known as the "nuclear\noption"\xe2\x80\x94to nix the legislative filibuster to replace the Affordable Care\nAct.\n\n\n\nAt first, Bush said his focus was coming up with a health care plan that\nRepublicans can unify behind.\n\n\n\n"I think we Republicans first need to unify behind the replacement," he\nsaid. "If there\'s unity there, we can act. Right now, though, for the last\nfew years we\'ve been organized against Obamacare... But there hasn\'t been\nany kind of unity about what the alternative is and that\'s what my focus\nis."\n\n\n\nHewitt pressed Bush, pointing out that Republicans are unlikely to get 60\nSenate to defeat a filibuster if Democrats stick together and block efforts\nto repeal Obamacare, as they have done for years. "At that point," Hewitt\nsaid, "would you at least be open to making the argument that on this\nissue, before it gets its tentacles too deep, that we break the filibuster\nand ram through a repeal and replacement?"\n\n\n\nBush responded that he was open to it.\n\n\n\n"I\'d have to see\xe2\x80\x94if the repeal is what I\'m going to advocate, then I might\nconsider that," he said, adding that if the replacement includes\nhigh-deductible, low-premium catastrophic coverage and helps the middle\nclass, "then I would certainly consider that."\n\n\n\nBush is unique among presidential candidates who have signaled any openness\nto ending the legislative filibuster. Democrats ended the 60-vote threshold\nfor nominations to the executive and judicial branches (except the Supreme\nCourt) in November 2013, drawing fierce conservative pushback. Since then,\nRepublicans have preserved the change but have not sought to further\ndismantle the filibuster.\n\n\n\nEven Senator Ted Cruz of Texas\xe2\x80\x94a rival Republican candidate who is no\nstranger to supporting scorched-earth legislative tactics\xe2\x80\x94wouldn\'t support\nthe idea of scrapping the filibuster in February 2015 as he was pushing\nlegislation to overturn President Barack Obama\'s immigration executive\nactions.\n\n\n\n*RUBIO*\n\n\n\n*Rubio pushes back against health care ruling, new gun control efforts, and\nnegotiating with terrorists\n<http://www.nh1.com/news/steinhauser-rubio-pushes-back-against-health-care-ruling-new-gun-control-efforts-and-negotiating-with-terrorists/>\n// NH1 // Paul Steinhauser \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nEXETER \xe2\x80\x93 Marco Rubio says \xe2\x80\x9cI believe Obamacare\xe2\x80\x99s bad for Americans.

Rubio was in\nExeter to headline an event hosted by the conservative organization\nConcerned Veterans for America.\n\n\n\nAsked by NH1 News about new gun control efforts in Congress in the wake of\nlast week\xe2\x80\x99s horrific shootings at an historic black church in Charleston,\nSouth Carolina that left nine people dead, Rubio said \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s\nineffective and it won\xe2\x80\x99t achieve what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to achieve, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\nkeeping guns out of the hands of criminals. Criminals don\xe2\x80\x99t care what the\nlaw is. That\xe2\x80\x99s why they\xe2\x80\x99re criminals.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRubio\xe2\x80\x99s visit came one day after President Obama announced a policy\noverhaul that will allow the United States government to communicate and\nnegotiate with hostage takers. Noting that his administration has too often\nfailed the families of Americans taken hostage by groups like ISIS, the\nPresident said that the new rule \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not prevent communications with\nhostage takers by our government, the families of hostages or third parties\nwho help these family.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut Obama said he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change a longstanding policy against paying\nransoms to terrorist groups.\n\n\n\nRubio said he disagrees with the President, adding that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have to\nunderstand that when you negotiate with terrorists, you are in essence\nincentivizing them to take more hostages in the future. You place other\nAmericans, including service men and women, in danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRubio\xe2\x80\x99s come under attack recently by Donald Trump, a rival for the GOP\nnomination. Asked by NH1 News about Trump\xe2\x80\x99s comments and whether the real\nestate mogul and reality TV should be taken seriously, Rubio said \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\ngoing to focus on my campaign and my message.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the reasons Barack Obama is president of the United States today is\nbecause Republicans in the last election spent an inordinate amount of time\nattacking each other and calling each other names. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have disagreements\non policy. I look forward to that debate. But my message is going to be\nabout the future of America. I\xe2\x80\x99m not running against any other Republican,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe added.\n\n\n\nEarlier, during the Concerned Veterans for America event, Rubio gave the\nPresident an F grade when it comes to the overhaul of the troubled Veterans\nAffairs department.\n\n\n\n"It\xe2\x80\x99s not just a funding issue, it\xe2\x80\x99s not even \xe2\x80\x98a want to\xe2\x80\x99 issue, it is the\nfact that the model itself may not work in the 21st century,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe key is, it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the veteran to choose,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio added. \xe2\x80\x9cPutting the\nveteran in charge. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t do that, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have failing grade no\nmatter who the president is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThis was Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s first trip to the first-in-the-nation primary state in two\nmonths.

And he can do\nit without the dynastic baggage that fellow 2016er Jeb Bush brings to the\npresidential contest.\n\n\n\nThe Republican Party hasn\'t seen compassionate conservatism in a while.\nDuring the heyday of the Tea Party movement, Republicans around the country\ndecried Obama as a food stamp president and demanded drug testing for\nwelfare recipients. Former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney came off\nas apathetic to the poor, and his "47 percent" comments cemented his\nreputation as a heartless plutocrat in the minds of many voters.\n\n\n\nBut Rubio grew up the son of a bartender and a maid, both immigrants. He\nhas a mortgage -- just one -- that he and his wife pay on the fifth of\nevery month. The Florida senator can speak with familiarity about being\npoor -- which couldn\'t be said of Romney, a gazillionaire memorably\ndescribed by Mike Huckabee as \xe2\x80\x9cthe guy who fires you\xe2\x80\x9d; John McCain, the son\nand grandson of admirals; and George W. Bush, the son of a president.\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of negative connotations in being compared to George W.\nBush. But with Bush\'s approval rating recovering with the passage of time,\nRubio brings a new face -- and new personal authority -- to an older\nperspective on conservatism.\n\n\n\n"We have to reinvigorate our economy, and that begins with recognizing the\nplight of millions of Americans who today live paycheck to paycheck," Rubio\ntold a small group of New Hampshire voters at the Derry-Salem Elks Lodge\nThursday. "Do you know why I\'m a conservative, why I love free enterprise?\nBecause it\'s the only economic model in the history of the world where\npeople like me even have a chance."\n\n\n\nAnd Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on increased defense spending and a renewed\nwillingness to use America\xe2\x80\x99s military might abroad is also reminiscent of\nGeorge W. Bush. Asked by an attendee what he would do in his first 100 days\nin the White House, Rubio\'s first three off-the cuff ideas were about\nnational security.\n\n\n\n"I would immediately ask Congress for a supplemental budget authority to\nincrease defense spending," Rubio said. It was a topic he hammered over and\nover again: "We need a strong America on the global stage, because nothing\nelse matters if we\'re not safe. And that starts with having the strongest\nmilitary in the world. Today we are eviscerating our military, we have had\nrapid reductions in defense spending... We can\'t solve all the world\'s\nproblems, but we can always be on the side of moral clarity."\n\n\n\nBut the capital-B, capital-I Big Idea that Rubio is campaigning on is that\nthe things that guaranteed middle class stability and opportunity for the\npoor in the 20th century no longer work today. Touching on subjects ranging\nfrom social security to whether a college education will guarantee a job to\nthe Veterans Administration, Rubio held three town halls in New Hampshire,\nall of which touched on how to improve the lot of the less well off.\n\n\n\n"One of the fundamental issues that I\'ve been campaigning on is the\nargument that the 21st century is dramatically different from the 20th,\nthat things that used to work in the past don\'t work as well now because\nthe world has changed," Rubio said at a Concerned Veterans for America\nevent, where he urged reforms to the VA system broadly, Tri-Care military\nhealth insurance, and the vets\' disability claims process.\n\n\n\nRubio also wants to reform the higher education system. He wants more\nstudents to pursue technical degrees, and college credit to be more easily\ngranted for students with prior work experience or military service. A\nmilitary service member who served two tours in Iraq shouldn\'t be made to\nsit through a course on modern Middle Eastern politics, he said.\n\n\n\n"In the 21st century it is not enough to just have a college degree," Rubio\nsaid. He wants college loans to be granted only after colleges tell each\nstudent the average annual wage for the major and degree that they\'ve\nchosen.\n\n\n\nMany of the other ideas are fundamentally the same as 2000s conservatism:\ntax cuts for small businesses, increasing the child tax credit for working\nfamilies, and reversing environmental regulations that hinder economic\ngrowth.\n\n\n\n"The more people you hire, the more you pay them, and the more you expand\n-- the less you will owe the IRS. We need a tax code that allows businesses\nto immediately [reinvest] back into their employees," Rubio said.\n\n\n\nHis style impressed some of the locals, many of whom consider it their\ncivic duty to put presidential candidates on the hot seat.\n\n\n\n"His off-the-cuff remarks: he\'s moving up on the electability scale. He\'s\nsliding up," said Jorg Dreusick, a veteran from Pelham, New Hampshire who\nplaced Rubio near the top of his list of top five presidential contenders.\nHe attended both the morning event in Exeter, N.H. and the early afternoon\nevent in Salem, N.H.\n\n\n\nOne thing Rubio simply didn\'t do while campaigning in New Hampshire: he\ndidn\'t toss the crowd the red meat they really wanted. He got the largest\napplause out of one crowd when he spoke about Benghazi ("incompetence") and\nabout President Obama ("who has chosen to divide us against each other, for\n[the] purpose of winning elections"). But those lines were responses to\nquestions raised by the crowd.\n\n\n\nUnlike some other presidential candidates, who thrive on the raucous\nresponse of the conservative primary audiences, Rubio didn\xe2\x80\x99t pander. Asked\nfor his priorities as president, he geeked out on the proper role of the\nNational Security Council, an issue unlikely to resonate with vast swaths\nof the electorate. Then he said he wanted centralized cybersecurity\nprocedures so that agencies use best practices to protect information.\n\n\n\nHe even went out of his way to take a little shot at someone the many\nPatriots fans in attendance surely consider a hero.\n\n\n\n"Tom Brady, when is he going to retire?" he asked the New Hampshire crowd.\n\n\n\n*Rubio among lawmakers vowing to repeal Obamacare following Supreme Court\nruling\n<http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2015/06/26/rubio-among-lawmakers-vowing-to-repeal-obamacare-following-supreme-court-ruling/>\n// Fox News Latino \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nThursday\'s Supreme Court ruling validating federal health insurance\nsubsidies for nearly 6.4 million Americans had consumers breathing a sigh\nof relief that they would be able to afford their policies, but the\nreaction was markedly different from governors and lawmakers in states that\nhave fought against the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nMany of them strengthened their calls to repeal the act, setting the tone\nfor what will likely be a common GOP refrain during next year\'s\npresidential campaign.\n\n\n\nFlorida would have been ground zero for the aftermath, with more than 1.3\nmillion people relying on the federal subsidies. Setting up a state\nexchange was a political non-starter. Republican Gov. Rick Scott and House\nRepublicans strongly opposed a Senate bill that would have created one as\nwell as expand Medicaid.\n\n\n\nScott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican presidential candidate,\nboth reaffirmed their commitment to repealing the law Thursday.\n\n\n\n"It\'s a bad law," Scott told reporters. "It\'s made promises after promises."\n\n\n\nTexas, like many of the 34 Republican-led states relying on the exchange,\nhad no backup plan if the court had struck down the subsidies. Texas Gov.\nGreg Abbott had no interest in setting up a state exchange for the 832,000\nTexans relying on the federal tax credits that lowered their monthly\npremiums.\n\n\n\n"The Supreme Court abandoned the Constitution to resuscitate a failing\nhealth care law," Abbott, a Republican, said in a statement. "Today\'s\naction underscores why it is now more important than ever to ensure we\nelect a President who will repeal Obamacare and enact real health care\nreforms."\n\n\n\nHe and other GOP governors said it would have been up to the president and\nCongress to fix it.\n\n\n\nAt issue in the case were the subsidies given by the federal government to\nconsumers in the 34 states that relied on the federal health insurance\nexchange. A handful of words in the Affordable Care Act suggested the\nsubsidies were to go only to consumers using exchanges operated by the\nstates. In its 6-3 ruling, the high court said those subsidies did not\ndepend on where people live.\n\n\n\nThe court\'s decision to allow the subsidies to continue was a relief to\nmany who had purchased health insurance policies through the federal\nexchange.\n\n\n\nAmong them is Jennifer Greene, a 58-year-old from Boca Raton, Florida, who\nfeared she would have to go without insurance if she lost her $547-a-month\ntax credit.\n\n\n\nShe had insurance through her job at a large grocery store chain but lost\nit because she missed too much work following surgery to remove part of her\ncolon, which required lengthy follow-up care.\n\n\n\nGreene signed up for a mid-level insurance plan in February, paying $25 a\nmonth after the tax credit. She was able to keep her primary care doctor\nand has relied heavily on the insurance to cover follow-up appointments\nwith specialists and a hernia surgery.\n\n\n\n"Those things are not affordable without insurance," she said Thursday.\n"Having the insurance makes the difference of staying healthy or ignoring\nyour health issues."\n\n\n\nWith the coverage expansion under the law, about 90 percent of Americans\nnow have health care. After the Supreme Court ruling, the focus will shift\nto those who remain uninsured. But closing the gap will mean convincing\nsome 20 states that have resisted the law\'s Medicaid expansion to drop\ntheir opposition.\n\n\n\nThe biggest payoff could come if Texas and Florida expand their programs,\nbut governors and legislators in those states have blocked all Medicaid\nexpansion efforts.\n\n\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a potential Republican presidential candidate,\ncalled on Congress to repeal and replace the law, saying Obama\'s signature\ndomestic policy achievement had failed the American people. Some 183,000\nWisconsin residents are getting health insurance through the exchange.\n\n\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, another potential GOP presidential\ncontender, said in a Twitter message that "leaders must turn our attention\nto making the case that ObamaCare must be replaced."\n\n\n\nGov. Phil Bryant was among several Mississippi Republican leaders who\ncriticized the Supreme Court\'s decision.\n\n\n\n"Today\'s decision does not change the fact that Obamacare is a socialist\ntakeover of health care forced down the throats of the American people\nwithout proper review, and it does not slow the massive and unprecedented\ntransfer of wealth that is at the heart of the subsidy system," Bryant said.\n\n\n\nPennsylvania was one of the few states that had applied to set up a state\nexchange, but Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf said he would withdraw those plans\ngiven Thursday\'s ruling.\n\n\n\nAs the law\'s opponents regroup, consumers say they are grateful the court\nallowed the federal premium subsidies to continue.\n\n\n\nShawn Turner of Cisco, Illinois, finished chemotherapy for uterine cancer\nlast summer and relies on the $830-a-month in tax credit she and her\nhusband receive for regular follow-up scans to make sure the cancer is\ngone. If the court had struck down the subsidies, she said they would have\nhad to dip into their savings or start selling their possessions to pay for\ntheir insurance.\n\n\n\n"I\'m just so relieved and happy, not just for me but for everyone who\'s\nbeing helped by this," said Turner, 55.\n\n\n\nCindy Williams, a 63-year-old breast cancer and liver cancer survivor from\nTexas, receives a federal premium subsidy of more than $500 a month. She\nsaid she would not be able to afford to go to the doctor or buy her\nmedications without it.\n\n\n\nWilliams, who lives in the Austin suburb of Pflugerville, said she was\nthrilled to hear about the court\'s ruling.\n\n\n\n"I am so happy because that means that I can keep my insurance, that I can\nstay healthy and move on with my life," she said.\n\n\n\n*PAUL*\n\n\n\n*Rand Paul: Clintons \xe2\x80\x98proud\xe2\x80\x99 to incarcerate a generation of black men\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/06/26/rand-paul-clintons-proud-to-incarcerate-a-generation-of-black-men/>\n// WaPo // Katie Zezima \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nSen.

A recent Quinnipiac\npoll, for example, showed Paul running even with Clinton in Ohio and ahead\nof her in Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n"Someone from the DNC is listening to our radio interview now and they\xe2\x80\x99re\nlooking for ways to attack me because they see me as a threat to Hillary\nClinton," Paul said.

If recent experience is any guide, it\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be an easy sell. Just ask Steve Forbes, Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry, or\nany of the other failed candidates who put flat taxes at the center of\ntheir campaigns.\n\n\n\nA long view of history, however, suggests that flat taxes may have some\nlegs. The United States has been using graduated rates for the federal\nincome tax since 1913, but there\xe2\x80\x99s precedent for flat rate levies, too.\n\n\n\nCongress has twice enacted single-rate taxes on income, the first in 1861\nand again in 1894. Both disappeared before they were collected. But the\ndebate surrounding their adoption \xe2\x80\x94 as well as the discussion in 1913 \xe2\x80\x94\nreveals ample support for proportional, rather than progressive, taxation.\n\n\n\nConfusing Polls\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to taxes, \xe2\x80\x9cflat\xe2\x80\x9d is one of those words that often elicits\nfavorable poll responses. Last yearReason.com reported that 62 percent of\nAmericans endorsed the idea of a flat rate tax on income.\nSimilarly,Rasmussen Reports found that 58 percent of respondents favored a\nflat income tax in 2011.\n\n\n\nOther polls have been less encouraging. In 2011 The Hill found that only 35\npercent of respondents supported a single-rate tax. Another 2011 survey\nfound similar results. \xe2\x80\x9cFlat tax proponents face an uphill battle,\xe2\x80\x9d\nobserved David Brady and Tammy Frisby in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmericans in general opposed the flat tax proposal 39% to 28%.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIf the polls are confusing, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably because the flat tax is\nconfusing, too. There is no single definition of a flat tax. Politicians\nhave used the term to describe a wide range of plans with little\nresemblance to each other. Some flat taxes are imposed on income, others on\nconsumption. Some are flat in the sense that they wipe out all deductions,\ncredits, exclusions, and similar tax preferences. Others \xe2\x80\x93 including Paul\xe2\x80\x99s\n\xe2\x80\x93 retain some popular (and costly) deductions, like those for mortgage\ninterest and charitable giving.\n\n\n\nA single rate would seem crucial for any tax claimed to be flat. But some\nflat taxes have featured graduated rates. Anyone remember the Fair Flat Tax\nAct of 2007? Don\xe2\x80\x99t let the name fool you; it was introduced not by Paul but\nby Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. Wyden, who now serves as ranking\nminority member of the Senate Finance Committee, made room in his outline\nfor a series of graduated rates as well as some popular deductions.\n\n\n\nHowever, almost every flat tax is rooted in arguments for less graduation\nin the rate structure. Even Wyden\xe2\x80\x99s plan would have slashed the number of\nbrackets from six to three.\n\n\n\nThe hostility to graduation can seem nonsensical. After all, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a\nprogressive rate structure for more than a century; it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously crucial\nto the tax system.\n\n\n\nOr maybe not.\n\n\n\nThe 1913 income tax was not flat. It featured graduated rates ranging as\nhigh as 7 percent. But progressive rates were peripheral in arguments for\nadopting the tax. Supporters wanted to use the income tax to counterbalance\nregressive consumption taxes, especially the tariff. In general, they\nbelieved that even a flat rate tax would do the job.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGraduated rates were not seen as essential to achieve the goals of an\nincome tax,\xe2\x80\x9d explained legal historian Steven Bank in a 1996 article on the\norigins of the flat tax. \xe2\x80\x9cThe progressive rates were a response to the\nperception that the tariff was burdening the poor, in the form of higher\nprices, with more than their fair share of taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d The thinking was that\nwhen levied with the tariff, the income tax would produce a relatively flat\noverall tax burden, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThus, consistent with the country\xe2\x80\x99s\ntradition, the income tax in the Act of 1913 was used to achieve the goal\nof a flat or proportionate rate tax system,\xe2\x80\x9d Bank wrote.\n\n\n\nOf course, rates increased rapidly after 1913. Just four years later,\nincome in the top bracket was taxed at 77 percent. But for the most part,\nthe income tax was viewed as a compensatory tax, designed to balance other,\nmore regressive levies. In 1913 the tariff needed a counterweight. Today,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s payroll taxes.\n\n\n\nOver the years, some left-leaning politicians have suggested using the\nincome tax as a way to redistribute wealth or income. Franklin Roosevelt\ncomes to mind. But more moderate (and numerous) politicians have defended\nthe income tax as a way to redistribute the tax burden, with the ultimate\ngoal being something close to proportionality.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us back to Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Fair Flat Tax. It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly radical and a\nsharp break with the recent past. As my colleague David Brunori has pointed\nout, it would reshape not just the tax system, but government as a whole,\nby starving the federal government of revenue.\n\n\n\nBut radical doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean implausible. Since proportionality lies at the\nheart of Paul\xe2\x80\x99s plan, history suggests it might have a shot.\n\n\n\n*Rand Paul Is Winning the Pot Reform Primary\n<http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/06/26/rand-paul-is-winning-the-pot-reform-primary>\n// U.S. News & World Report // Steven Nelson \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nSen.

Ted Cruz wound his way through the small towns and\nrolling hills of western Iowa last week, doing the gruntwork of retail\ncampaigning: shaking hands, posing for photos, giving stump speeches and,\nmost importantly: making entreaties for support in a state that could\ndetermine the trajectory of his presidential campaign.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether we win or lose, this race will be decided by the men and women\ngathered here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said last Friday to a group of mostly older people\nsitting on folding chairs in a conference room.\n\n\n\nIowa\xe2\x80\x99s first-in-the nation caucuses are often a high-stakes event for\npresidential campaigns \xe2\x80\x94 and this year the state is especially critical for\nCruz, a stalwart conservative in a crowded field. The Texas Republican\xe2\x80\x99s\nuncompromising stances seem designed to appeal to the conservative base\nthat dominates the state GOP, as well as the state\xe2\x80\x99s heavy concentration of\nevangelical Christians. On Friday in Sheldon, Iowa, Cruz forcefully\ndenounced Supreme Court rulings upholding a key part of the Affordable Care\nAct and affirming the rights of gays to marry nationwide.\n\n\n\nBut the early evidence suggests that victory in Iowa may be an uphill climb\nfor the Texas senator.\n\n\n\nCruz\xe2\x80\x99s poll numbers in the state are underwhelming so far: a Des Moines\nregister poll last month put him in eighth place among likely caucus-goers,\nwith 5 percent saying they would support Cruz. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\nwas in first place with 17 percent of the vote. State Republicans have\nexpressed surprise that Cruz, who has only one paid staffer in Iowa, had\nvisited the state as an officially declared candidate just twice before\nlast week\xe2\x80\x99s trip.\n\n\n\nNow Cruz is doubling down on the Hawkeye State. Cruz is again making a\nswing through the state Friday. His last stop: a speech Saturday at Drake\nUniversity in Des Moines, titled \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve Again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to spend a lot of time in the great state of Iowa,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz\npromised more than a week ago at a restaurant in Denison, where a print of\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Gothic\xe2\x80\x9d hung on the wall behind him and a man rang a cowbell each\ntime the senator made an applause line.\n\n\n\nHe has visited the state twice before as a candidate, with several more\nvisits in the works over the coming weeks. He is vowing to visit all of\nIowa\xe2\x80\x99s 99 counties, launching a fresh push to recruit key grass-roots\nvolunteers and opening a campaign office soon.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Ted Cruz is your guy, I want to talk to you,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryan English, Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s\nIowa campaign chair, said to about 75 people who came to hear the candidate\nspeak in Red Oak. They included the father of Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who\nsaid he plans to support Cruz.\n\n\n\nBut Ernst herself \xe2\x80\x94 who took a very public motorcycle ride with Wisconsin\nGov. Scott Walker (R) earlier this month \xe2\x80\x94 remains uncommitted. Other key\nstate leaders have already signed on to other campaigns. And some here\nwonder why it took so long for Cruz to push this hard in Iowa.\n\n\n\nCruz went to Iowa a week after his announcement in March, and returned in\nApril to attend a homeschooler conference in Des Moines. A third planned\ntrip was canceled because of weather. He did not attend the Ernst event\nthree weeks ago that featured many other GOP presidential hopefuls \xe2\x80\x94\nincluding Walker \xe2\x80\x94 instead speaking at the North Carolina Republican\nconvention. Cruz has also had to spend a large chunk of time in Washington,\nwhere the Senate has been in session.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Craig Robinson, a former Iowa Republican party\npolitical director. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one of those things where if he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be\ncompetitive here, and he has some stiff competition for the space he wants\nto occupy, he has to have a more constant presence in the state. You can\xe2\x80\x99t\nbe gone for two months.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAn Iowa Republican who did not want to be identified in order to speak\nfreely was more blunt: \xe2\x80\x9cTed Cruz can absolutely win the Iowa caucuses, but\nthus far he\xe2\x80\x99s not running the campaign that can do it for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn an interview Saturday, Cruz defended his strategy, saying much of the\ncampaign\xe2\x80\x99s time and energy for the first few months had been focused on\nfundraising, on recruiting statewide leadership teams and on peeling away\ncaucus-goers who once backed current presidential candidates, including\nMike Huckabee, who won the state in 2008, and 2012 caucus winner Rick\nSantorum. Members of Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s Iowa team include former Iowa secretary of\nstate Matt Schultz, who supported Santorum, and Joel Kurtinitis and state\nSen. Jason Schultz, who both endorsed former Texas congressman Ron Paul\nduring the last cycle.\n\n\n\nCruz said he is \xe2\x80\x9cplaying hard\xe2\x80\x9d here \xe2\x80\x93 as well as New Hampshire, where he\nwants to appeal to Catholics, and South Carolina, where there are many\nevangelical Christians.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you look at our leadership teams you see conservatives, you see\nevangelicals, you see libertarians \xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any other candidate\nthat enjoys that breadth of support from the many groups that comprise the\nRepublican majority,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz said before an event at an indoor gun range in\nJohnston, Iowa.\n\n\n\nCruz advisers say that the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s strategy is to coalesce his\nconservative base while pulling in support from evangelicals and\nconservative libertarians and casting aside what the candidate calls \xe2\x80\x9cthe\nmushy middle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe campaign describes the electorate in a bracket-style system:\nconservatives, libertarians, evangelicals, and moderates. It believes\nCruz\xe2\x80\x99s path to victory involves winning the conservative bracket and\ngetting large numbers of people in the evangelical bracket, as well as\nlibertarians, to back his campaign.\n\n\n\nBut the biggest focus has been on fundraising. Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s campaign raised $4\nmillion in its first week and a collection of super PACs supporting the\ncandidate have raised $37 million, according to CNN. The campaign itself\nsaid it is on pace to have raised $8 million to $10 million by June 30.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the early parts of a campaign, you cannot succeed without having the\nresources to communicate your message,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz said.\xe2\x80\x9cThere are seasons and\nphases in a presidential race.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are other candidates in the field who are not seeing significant\nfundraising success, who can spend every day doing nothing but grass-roots\nevents because they\xe2\x80\x99re not having success raising money,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nCruz\xe2\x80\x99s campaign downplayed its minimal staffing in the state saying that\nits strategy all along has been to focus on recruiting the key,\nlesser-known grass-roots activists who can make inroads with his base, and\nto reach to conservatives who may not have voted in 2012.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe era when a candidate could come move to an early state for a year,\ncatch fire and then build a national campaign based on the momentum of that\none state is no longer likely to occur because the time frame is\ncompressed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cruz. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so we are also very deliberately running a\nnational campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nCruz advisers said the candidate needs to win one of the first three\nprimary states \xe2\x80\x94 or be in the top three in Iowa. Additionally, the campaign\nis pouring resources into states that will vote March 1 and March 15, a\nstrategy they believe will position Cruz well after the crowded early\nprimaries and caucuses shake out. Regardless of outcome, the campaign wants\nto be positioned to immediately dive into the delegate-rich second round of\nstates, which includes Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s home state of Texas.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur intent is to be standing\xe2\x80\x9d on March 15, an adviser said. Cruz will\nspend August stumping in states including Arkansas, Wyoming and Alabama.\nCruz\xe2\x80\x99s team also wants to try to solidify conservatives in more liberal\nstates such as Massachusetts and Minnesota.\n\n\n\nBut Iowa Republicans believe the state is ripe for a candidate like Cruz.\nWhile Cruz advisers say they have solid teams in New Hampshire, where he\nhas drawn large, rowdy crowds, and South Carolina, they are traditionally\nless friendly to a candidate, such as Cruz.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think Iowa is crucial for his candidacy,\xe2\x80\x9d Robinson said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m surprised\nby his campaign strategy of saying we\xe2\x80\x99re going to compete later on in the\nrace and not go all in in Iowa. Iowa is a state where he can make his mark.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn this evangelical-dominated state, Cruz has the advantage of being able\nto deploy an evangelical pastor as a campaign surrogate: his father,\nRafael. The elder Cruz has often drawn headlines for the wrong reasons \xe2\x80\x94\nfor instance, comparing President Obama to Fidel Castro. But he\xe2\x80\x99s been\nwarmly received by many of the evangelical voters who made up 57 percent of\nRepublican caucus-goers in 2012, according to entrance polls. He\xe2\x80\x99s been a\nsteady presence here in Iowa, showing up at more than a dozen events across\nthe state over a three-day period this month.\n\n\n\nCruz assailed against what he said are efforts to strip away religious\nfreedom. He reaffirmed his promises to protect the Second Amendment, repeal\nObamacare and abolish the IRS. He vowed to destroy the Islamic State, and\nensure Iran doesn\xe2\x80\x99t acquire a nuclear weapon. And he described himself as\nthe only candidate who is willing to take on anyone \xe2\x80\x94 Republican, Democrat\nor otherwise \xe2\x80\x94 to fight for his beliefs.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you look at the other candidates and ask on those issues on your list,\nwhere have they stood and led. What have they meaningfully done to lead on\nthose issues?\xe2\x80\x9d he said in Denison.\n\n\n\nCruz paces around when delivering speeches and speaks with the cadence and\nzeal of a sermon. Here in Red Oak, he asked the enthusiastic crowd to\nimagine a president that won\xe2\x80\x99t allow Iran to have nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cScripture tells us there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing new under the sun,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe could if we could get you in there,\xe2\x80\x9d a woman in the crowd said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Amen, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cruz. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re working to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*PERRY*\n\n\n\n*Rick Perry Calls Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s Gay Marriage Ruling a Shame\n<http://kfyo.com/rick-perry-reaction-supreme-court-gay-marriage-ruling/> //\nKYFO // Justin Massoud \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nFormer Texas Governor and 2016 Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry\nhas accused the U.S. Supreme Court of ignoring the 10th amendment with its\ndecision to overturn all gay marriage bans in the country.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRegardless of what any court says, true marriage will always be between\none man and one woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry via press release. \xe2\x80\x9cThis truth is\nbiblical and a super majority of Texans have affirmed this through the\ndemocratic election process. It is a shame that once again the Supreme\nCourt has decided to ignore the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and\ndecided to legislate from the bench and impose their will on the states.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in favor (5-4) of legalizing same-sex marriage\nFriday (June 26). Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Steven Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor,\nElena Kagan and Anthony Kennedy were the majority opinion in the decision.\nAntonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, John Roberts and Samuel Alito dissented.\n\n\n\n*SANTORUM*\n\n\n\n*Santorum Compares Same-Sex Marriage Ruling to Dred Scott Case\n<http://www.politicspa.com/santorum-compares-same-sex-marriage-ruling-to-dred-scott-case/67294/>\n// Politics PA // Nick Field \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that state bans on same-sex marriage are\nunconstitutional and Rick Santorum is not happy.\n\n\n\nThe former Pennsylvania Senator and presidential candidate has long been an\nopponent of same-sex marriage and his response today was no different.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cToday, five unelected justices decided to redefine the foundational unit\nthat binds together our society without public debate or input,\xe2\x80\x9d Santorum\nstated. \xe2\x80\x9cNow is the people\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity respond because the future of the\ninstitution of marriage is too important to not have a public debate. The\nCourt is one of three co-equal branches of government and, just as they\nhave in cases from Dred Scott to Plessy, the Court has an imperfect track\nrecord. The stakes are too high and the issue too important to simply cede\nthe will of the people to five unaccountable justices.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe cases Santorum cited, Dred Scott and Plessy, are generally considered\nthe most infamous in the history of the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nIn Dred Scott v. Sanford, the Court ruled that Scott, a slave at the time\nin Missouri, could not sue for his freedom. Additionally, Chief Justice\nRoger Taney\xe2\x80\x99s majority opinion asserted that African-Americans, whether\nthen enslaved or free, were not American citizens and therefore had no\nlegal standing.\n\n\n\nThe Dred Scott case is considered by historians as one of the major causes\nof the Civil War. It is unlikely today\xe2\x80\x99s decision will lead to similar\ncircumstances.\n\n\n\nThe Plessy v. Ferguson decision declared racial segregation as\nconstitutional and created the \xe2\x80\x9cseparate but equal\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine.\n\n\n\nSantorum went on to state that he will lead the fight against the Court\xe2\x80\x99s\nruling that LGBT Americans have, as the Justice Kennedy put it, \xe2\x80\x9cequal\ndignity in the eyes of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs President, I will be committed to using the bully pulpit of the White\nHouse to lead a national discussion on the importance to our economy and\nour culture of mothers and fathers entering into healthy marriages so that\nevery child is given their birthright- to be raised by their mother and\nfather in a stable, loving home,\xe2\x80\x9d Santorum concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cI will stand for the\npreservation of religious liberty and conscience, to believe what you are\ncalled to believe free from persecution.  And I will ensure that the people\nwill have a voice in decisions that impact the rock upon which our\ncivilization is built.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nJustice Kennedy did address religious liberty, however, in his majority\nopinion.\n\nThe following is the last paragraph of section IV of Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s opinion:\n\n\n\nFinally, it must be emphasized that religions, and those who adhere to\nreligious doctrines, may continue to advocate with utmost, sincere\nconviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be\ncondoned. The First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and\npersons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles\nthat are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths, and to\ntheir own deep aspirations to continue the family structure they have long\nrevered. The same is true of those who oppose same-sex marriage for other\nreasons. In turn, those who believe allowing same-sex marriage is proper or\nindeed essential, whether as a matter of religious conviction or secular\nbelief, may engage those who disagree with their view in an open and\nsearching debate. The Constitution, however, does not permit the State to\nbar same-sex couples from marriage on the same terms as accorded to couples\nof the opposite sex.\n\n\n\nOf course, Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s statement was released just a half hour after the\nruling was announced so it is possible he had not yet read the decision.\n\n\n\n*HUCKABEE*\n\n\n\n*Mike Huckabee rages at Supreme Court\'s marriage ruling: It\'s like\nrepealing \'the law of gravity\'\n<http://www.businessinsider.com/mike-huckabee-blasts-supreme-court-marriage-ruling-2015-6#ixzz3eF6RCp00>\n// Business Insider // Colin Campbell \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nPresidential candidate and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) fumed at\nthe Supreme Court on Friday after it legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.\n\n\n\n"I will not acquiesce to an imperial court any more than our Founders\nacquiesced to an imperial British monarch. We must resist and reject\njudicial tyranny, not retreat," he said in a statement.\n\n\n\nHuckabee, a former pastor and one of the most outspoken social\nconservatives in the 2016 race, urged elected officials not to "surrender"\nin the face of the ruling.\n\n\n\n"This ruling is not about marriage equality, it\'s about marriage\nredefinition. This irrational, unconstitutional rejection of the expressed\nwill of the people in over 30 states will prove to be one of the court\'s\nmost disastrous decisions, and they have had many," he said. "The only\noutcome worse than this flawed, failed decision would be for the President\nand Congress, two co-equal branches of government, to surrender in the face\nof this out-of-control act of unconstitutional, judicial tyranny."\n\n\n\nHuckabee also compared the ruling to repealing the law of gravity.\n\n\n\n"The Supreme Court can no more repeal the laws of nature and nature\'s God\non marriage than it can the law of gravity. Under our Constitution, the\ncourt cannot write a law, even though some cowardly politicians will wave\nthe white flag and accept it without realizing that they are failing their\nsworn duty to reject abuses from the court," he continued.\n\n\n\nThe former governor also raged at the Supreme Court on Thursday after it\nupheld a critical component of the Affordable Care Act, also known as\nObamacare.\n\n\n\n*FIORINA*\n\n\n\n*Carson, Forrester endorse Fiorina\xe2\x80\x99s campaign\n<http://www.concordmonitor.com/news/politics/17485822-95/carson-forrester-endorse-fiorinas-campaign>\n// Concord Monitor \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nTwo Republican state senators have voiced support for Carly Fiorina, the\nformer CEO of Hewlett-Packard and one of the many GOP candidates for\npresident.\n\n\n\nState Sens. Sharon Carson of Londonderry and Jeanie Forrester of Meredith\nannounced their endorsement in a press release from Fiorina\xe2\x80\x99s campaign\nThursday.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarly\xe2\x80\x99s positive vision for unlocking the potential of our nation is\nappealing to me and so many others who have met her here on the campaign\ntrail,\xe2\x80\x9d Carson said in the release. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is talking about what we can do as\na nation, not dwelling on what we can\xe2\x80\x99t. It is time for an uplifting,\nreal-world leader with the executive experience to tackle our challenges.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s Carly Fiorina.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nForrester called the candidate \xe2\x80\x9ca Washington outsider.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer life experiences come from the private sector, not government,\xe2\x80\x9d\nForrester said in the press release. \xe2\x80\x9cLike me, Carly has a business,\ncharitable and nonprofit background and it is this background that has\nprepared her to lead our nation. She has accomplished much, knows what it\nis like to be held accountable and understands how to work with others to\ninspire change. I am pleased to be supporting her for president.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nCarson echoed that support.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarly will bring a fresh perspective to Washington to roll back crushing\nregulations, simplify our onerous tax code and finally shrink the size and\nprice tag of our federal government,\xe2\x80\x9d Carson said in the release. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she\nhas specific ideas on how to do it: use zero-based budgeting to legitimize\nevery federal tax dollar spent and cut waste; and leave vacant those\nfederal jobs left by retiring baby boomers. She\xe2\x80\x99s serious about changing\nWashington for the better and I know she will be successful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nKerry Marsh, the New Hampshire state director of Carly for America, said\nthe campaign is very excited to have the senators\xe2\x80\x99 support.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSenators Carson and Forrester understand, like Carly, that our nation is\nat a pivotal point,\xe2\x80\x9d Marsh said. \xe2\x80\x9cRepublicans must win the White House in\n2016 to stop Washington from crushing our small businesses and holding back\nthe potential of our citizens. Carly\xe2\x80\x99s personal story, her vision and her\nability to connect with voters will give Republicans a real shot at winning\nin 2016 and our nation real hope for positive change.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina woos, wows Colorado Republicans\n<http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/06/26/presidential-hopeful-carly-fiorina-woos-wows-colorado-republicans/121521/>\nDenver Post // Lynn Bartels \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nCarly Fiorina told Colorado Republicans Friday morning she supports civil\nunions but not gay marriage, health care policy should be left up to the\nstates and to let \xe2\x80\x9cThe Donald go do what The Donald\xe2\x80\x99s going to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard and the only woman running for\npresident in a crowded Republicans field, got her first round of applause\nwhen she talked about energy, which drives Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s economy.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe should be, we could be, we must be, we will be, if I am president of\nthe United states, a global energy powerhouse in the 21st century,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiorina spoke at the Brown Palace in Denver at an event sponsored by\nRealClearPolitics. She also will address the Western Conservative Summit,\nwhich kicks off its three-day gathering in Denver on Friday. She received a\nwarm reception \xe2\x80\x94 state Rep. Perry Buck, R-Windsor, cheered as Fiorina took\nthe stage after being introduced by Carl Cannon, the Washington bureau\nchief for RealClearPolitics.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like her because she\xe2\x80\x99s not a politician,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buck, who was one of a\nnumber of Republican state lawmakers who attended the event. \xe2\x80\x9cI like her\nbusiness smarts and the economy is the most important thing. I do think she\nhas some great international experience that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think some of the\nother candidates have.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFiorina has taken on the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 frontrunner, former Secretary of State\nHillary Clinton, in various speeches since announcing in May she was\nseeking the GOP nomination for president.\n\n\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s some of what Fiorina had to say:\n\n\n\nGAY MARRIAGE\n\n\n\nI support civil unions and I have for a very long time because I do not\nbelieve government can discriminate in any way. Everyone should be\nprotected equally under the law. It\xe2\x80\x99s why I provided benefits to same-sex\ncouples way back in 1999 when I came to Hewlett Packard.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, marriage means something very specific. I do not think\nit is the purview of five people on the Supreme court, unelected and\nunaccountable, to think in their hubris that they have the power to change\nthat. I hope that after this decision we will focus on preserving and\nprotecting religious liberty because there are millions of people who\ndisagree with this decision. I\xe2\x80\x99m one of those people who believes marriage\nis between a man and a woman.\n\n\n\nOBAMACARE\n\n\n\nWhatever you thought of the Supreme Court ruling, set that aside. Here are\nthe facts about Obamacare. The law itself was longer than a Harry Potter\nnovel and not nearly as interesting. It was accompanied by tens of\nthousands pages of regulations. No one understands it. We need to repeal it\nbecause it\xe2\x80\x99s too complicated. My own view is we let states manage high-risk\npools.\n\n\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a cancer survivor \xe2\x80\x94 I understand you can\xe2\x80\x99t bankrupt the families with\npre-existing conditions. If people truly need help we need to give them\nthat. (But the decision needs to be made) in the states, as close as\npossible to the people impacted by the decisions.\n\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP\n\n\n\nLet the Donald go do what the Donald\xe2\x80\x99s going to do. I\xe2\x80\x99m going train my fire\non Hillary Clinton, on the policies she is trying to lay out for this\nnation, and talk about why our values and our principles work better to\nunlock the potential of every American in this country.\n\n\n\nTHIS AND THAT\n\n\n\n* I truly know from having lived and worked all over the world that only in\nthis nation can a young woman start out typing and filing and answering the\nphones, go on to become the chief executive officer of the largest\ntechnology company of the world and run for the presidency of the United\nStates.\n\n\n\n* I\xe2\x80\x99m not a professional politician but I\xe2\x80\x99m not a political neophyte. I\nplayed a very active role in two presidential campaigns, I ran my own\nSenate campaign in the state of California. I spent last year helping other\npeople win, including here in Colorado with Cory Gardner.\n\n\n\n* Of course my business record is fair game. I led Hewlett-Packard for six\nyears. It was a very difficult time. We had the dot.com bust, 9/11, the\nworst technology recession in 25 years.\n\n\n\nCEO PAY, AN ISSUE RAISED BY CLINTON\n\n\n\nYou have to let shareholders vote on it and you have to be utterly\ntransparent. Those were the rules that applied when I was the chief\nexecutive. I changed the rule so shareholders would vote on my pay.\n\n\n\nBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t hear Hillary ever saying a baseball player makes too much, a\nHollywood mogul makes too much, my husband made too much when he got\n$500,000 for a speech, gee, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t right that we accepted tens of\nmillions of dollars from foreign governments while I was secretary of state.\n\n\n\nCYBER ATTACK\n\n\n\nHow is is that the Office of Personnel Management couldn\xe2\x80\x99t manage to push\nback against a Chinese cyber attack. I\xe2\x80\x99ve advised two secretaries of\ndefense, a secretary of state, a secretary of homeland security. We have\nknown without a doubt for at least 12 years that the Chinese were trying to\nhack into our federal government databases. Now we have 18 million people\xe2\x80\x99s\nmost personal records in the hands of the Chinese. That, ladies and\ngentleman, is ineptitude.\n\n\n\nAfterward, Fiorina received rave reviews.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pro Carly, very much so,\xe2\x80\x9d said state Rep.

Marco Rubio of Florida would be a good selection for a\npresidential ticket \xe2\x80\x94 but maybe not in the slot Mr. Rubio has in mind at\nthis point.\n\n\n\nDuring a Thursday evening appearance on Fox News\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cHannity\xe2\x80\x9d program, Ms.\nFiorina said it\xe2\x80\x99s far more productive for her to be training her fire on\nformer Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic frontrunner Hillary Rodham\nClinton than on other Republican candidates.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome candidates are training all their fire on each other, and I think\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate, actually,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nBut asked during a different part of the show for quick answers on some of\nthe other 2016 GOP contenders, these were her responses:\n\n\n\nOn Mr. Rubio: \xe2\x80\x9cI think he is a politician with a great future. I think he\nwould make a great veep.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky: \xe2\x80\x9cI think he is outside the mainstream of\nthis party, and I think that we are a nation that must always [face]\noutward into the world. When we are not leading, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean rushing\noff to war, the world is a far more dangerous and tragic place.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush: \xe2\x80\x9cJeb Bush is a very good man. I think that\nit\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for people to think about a Bush 3.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (who has said he\xe2\x80\x99s been approached about a\nWalker-Rubio ticket, or vice versa): \xe2\x80\x9cGuy with a lot of grit \xe2\x80\x94 a lot of\ngrit and a lot of heart. He has a very different experience than I do,\nwhich is a lifetime in Wisconsin politics.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas: \xe2\x80\x9cSmart man \xe2\x80\x94 a very smart man. And I think that\nbeing president requires unifying the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn former Texas Gov. Rick Perry: \xe2\x80\x9cRick Perry\xe2\x80\x99s a good friend of mine. Rick\nPerry got me to outsource a lot of manufacturing from California to Texas,\nas a matter of fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMs. Fiorina and Mr. Rubio were actually tied for fifth at 6 percent in a\nCNN/WMUR poll released Thursday on the GOP field in the early state of New\nHampshire.\n\n\n\nMr. Bush was in first at 16 percent, followed by businessman Donald Trump\nat 11 percent, Mr. Paul at 9 percent and Mr. Walker at 8 percent.\n\n\n\n*TRUMP*\n\n\n\n*Creative Advice for Donald Trump, a \xe2\x80\x98Proudly Egotistical Showman\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/26/creative-advice-for-donald-trump-a-proudly-egotistical-showman/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog%20Main&contentCollection=Politics&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body>\n// NYT // Alexander Burns \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nIn Fred Davis\xe2\x80\x99s imagination, a whole new Donald J. Trump would have\nannounced for president last week: a softer, humbler version of \xe2\x80\x9cthe\nDonald,\xe2\x80\x9d with a common touch and a demeanor far removed from (in Mr.\nDavis\xe2\x80\x99s words) the \xe2\x80\x9cproudly egotistical showman\xe2\x80\x9d of reality television fame.\n\n\n\nMr. Davis, a top adviser and creative director to Senator John McCain\xe2\x80\x99s\n2008 presidential campaign and known for his arresting television\ncommercials, laid out his vision for overhauling Mr. Trump in a three-page\nmemo last month to the real estate mogul\xe2\x80\x99s campaign manager.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo braggadocio, no 757s or helicopters (as much as I love them), a\ndifferent Mr. Trump would be portrayed,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Davis wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember this\nmorning when you said he was really \xe2\x80\x98down to earth\xe2\x80\x99? Right now that is\nsimply unbelievable, it would be my job to make it believable and\nauthentic.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThat pitch was as far as things went: Mr. Davis now advises Gov. John\nKasich of Ohio, another likely Republican presidential candidate.\n\n\n\nIn Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign kickoff last week, he eschewed humility entirely,\nannouncing that he was \xe2\x80\x9creally rich\xe2\x80\x9d and estimating his net worth at nearly\n$9 billion, and offending Hispanics by saying that Mexican immigration\nmeans more crime, drugs and rapists in the United States.\n\n\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Davis confirmed that he had met with Trump advisers \xe2\x80\x93\nas well as a \xe2\x80\x9csuper PAC\xe2\x80\x9d supporting Senator Ted Cruz of Texas \xe2\x80\x93 after his\nlongtime client, Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, announced he would not run\nfor president. But Mr. Davis\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for a toned-down Mr. Trump never\ngained traction.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never met or talked to Trump, but somebody over there didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to\nagree,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Davis said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy guess is that it was the Donald, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAt least superficially, Mr. Davis and Mr. Trump might have seemed an\nintriguing match: Mr. Davis is known for producing quirky and creative ads,\nwhich often garner intense attention online and in the political press.\n\n\n\nCorey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign manager, described Mr. Davis as\n\xe2\x80\x9cone of the best in the business,\xe2\x80\x9d but said the campaign planned to take\nits own distinctive approach to advertising.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to a number of firms, but Mr. Trump, because of his success\nin business \xe2\x80\x93 he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, he\xe2\x80\x99s doing O.K.\n\xe2\x80\x93 he wants to do things a little differently,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Lewandowski said.\n\n\n\nIn his memo, Mr. Davis proposed an extensive \xe2\x80\x93 and presumably costly \xe2\x80\x93\nmedia campaign, including immediate advertising in Iowa and New Hampshire,\nand on national cable.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI envision something beautiful and elegant, not like any political ad\never, with minimal visuals of Mr. T. Instead it would feature a lot of\npeople across the country talking about finally needing this place to\nwork,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Davis wrote, adding of Mr. Trump, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is present in the film in\nan understated way, causing people to think, \xe2\x80\x98maybe I was wrong about that\nman.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFlashing enthusiasm, Mr. Davis added: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very exciting project.\nAlmost life-defining, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll pardon a touch of hubris.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*How Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s man in Iowa plans to mess with the GOP \xe2\x80\x94 and win\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-donald-trumps-man-in-iowa-plans-to-mess-with-the-gop-and-win/2015/06/26/5abe8592-19d8-11e5-93b7-5eddc056ad8a_story.html>\n// WaPo // Colby Itkowitz \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nDES MOINES \xe2\x80\x94 After years of flamboyant flirtations with presidential\npolitics, Donald Trump is devising a genuine game plan to try to prove that\nan unfiltered showman can become a vote-getting presidential candidate.\n\n\n\nIt begins, appropriately for the star of TV\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Apprentice,\xe2\x80\x9d with a key\nhire \xe2\x80\x94 a longtime Republican operative who is causing a stir in GOP circles\nhere as Trump\xe2\x80\x99s man on the ground and the architect of a strategy designed\nto upend the traditions of the all-important, first-in-the-nation caucuses.\n\n\n\nChuck Laudner is best known for engineering Rick Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s upset caucus\nwin here in 2012 by driving around the former senator from Pennsylvania in\nhis pickup truck. He is now traversing the state, laying the groundwork to\nconvert celebrity gawkers who flock to events featuring Trump, a famed real\nestate magnate, into first-time caucusgoers.\n\n\n\nTo Laudner, that means running what he calls a \xe2\x80\x9cparallel campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d While\nthe 15 or so other Republican candidates fight over the 120,000 regular GOP\ncaucusgoers who turn out every four years to spend hours in school\ngymnasiums or church basements for the grueling voting process, Laudner is\nseeking out \xe2\x80\x9cpeople who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be caught dead at a Republican event.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to do something different,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich means everything has\nto be different.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFew in the party establishment take Trump seriously as a contender. He is\nconsidered more of a sideshow, a carnival attraction in an otherwise strong\nfield of respected senators and governors. Many dismiss Laudner\xe2\x80\x99s efforts\nas the work of someone enjoying the perks, such as private flights, that\ncome with working for a mogul. John Brabender, a top Santorum adviser, said\nhe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t blame him, pointing to \xe2\x80\x9cthe novelty of it, of being in Trump\nland.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut several new polls that place Trump near the top nationally and in New\nHampshire are forcing people to take notice. Although those results could\nbe a sign simply of name recognition, Trump is signaling, through the\nLaudner hire and other moves, that he intends to wage a serious campaign.\nHe has hired 40 paid campaign staff members around the country, including\neight in Iowa.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody wanted Chuck,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said in an interview this week, boasting of\nhis ability to lure a top-tier consultant.\n\n\n\nTrump bristled at the speculation, rampant among rival consultants, that\nLaudner is being paid far more than the typical rate. Trump and Laudner\ndeclined to disclose the salary.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pay him the same as everyone else,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very important,\nvery important. I\xe2\x80\x99m a business person. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be anybody\xe2\x80\x99s sucker.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSome Iowa party leaders say Trump has earned a second look merely by\nbringing a well-respected consultant on board.\n\n\n\nLaudner, 49, has been in Iowa politics for 30 years. He ran Rep. Steve\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s first campaign, was King\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff and led the state party\nduring the 2008 cycle.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think about the people who, especially inside-the-Beltway people, they\nwill tend to make offhanded comments that Trump isn\xe2\x80\x99t serious, he\xe2\x80\x99s just\nplaying with it,\xe2\x80\x9d said King (R). \xe2\x80\x9cAll along the way, I said, \xe2\x80\x98Trump\xe2\x80\x99s in, I\nknow he\xe2\x80\x99s in.\xe2\x80\x99 The reason I know that is Chuck wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be there if it was\na game.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nLaudner has brought Trump to Iowa nine times this year, including the night\nhe made his official campaign announcement. On Saturday, Trump is returning\nto headline a sold-out fundraiser for the Madison County GOP at the John\nWayne museum. Later, he\xe2\x80\x99ll attend a barbecue for the county party. Co-chair\nHeather Stancil said the group has sold more tickets for the event than\never before.\n\n\n\nTrump and his team first identified Laudner in late 2014. During a January\n2015 trip to Iowa to speak at a land investment expo, Trump invited Laudner\nand his wife on his jet for a chat. Trump asked them questions about caucus\nrules and ad buys. The couple hung back during the speech. As Laudner\nrecalls, after an informal survey of attendees who said things such as,\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what this country needs,\xe2\x80\x9d they accepted Trump\xe2\x80\x99s offer.\n\n\n\nLaudner said he immediately viewed Trump as a disruptive force for the\ncaucuses. Although typical candidates maneuver to recruit local opinion\nleaders and activists and fill their living rooms for meet-and-greets, with\na few dozen prospective voters at a time, Trump could operate at a higher\nlevel, Laudner said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I was working for any of these other campaigns, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, you gotta be at\nPizza Ranch,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, you gotta meet Suzy because Suzy is the most important\nperson here,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Laudner said, mockingly, during an interview recently at a\nTasty Taco here. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you go to this town, and Jack, if you get Jack, you\nget the whole town.\xe2\x80\x9d But, he added, pointing at the sparse lunchtime crowd,\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get as many people who are in this restaurant right now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s appeal is not based on policy alone, Laudner said. No matter that\nhe has favored abortion rights or once supported a ban on assault weapons,\npositions that would be deal-breakers for most candidates vying to win the\nconservative-dominated Iowa caucuses. He can be presented as someone who\nchallenges the Washington political elite with a brazen fearlessness that\ncan come only from having nothing to lose \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cthe biggest bull to send into\nthe china shop,\xe2\x80\x9d Laudner said.\n\n\n\nThis approach could be a risk in friendly Iowa. Just this week, Trump got\ninto a fight with Spanish-language broadcaster Univision after he said\nMexican migrants are \xe2\x80\x9cbringing drugs, they\xe2\x80\x99re bringing crime, they\xe2\x80\x99re\nrapists, and some, I assume, are good people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nLaudner considers the bombast as a plus, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cOnce he stops being\nDonald Trump, people are going to think he\xe2\x80\x99s a politician.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nTo underscore the point, Laudner wants to make a scene at the Iowa State\nFair in August by walking Trump through the crowd, unannounced, to create\n\xe2\x80\x9cchaos and mayhem.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn a recent Saturday, wearing a thin-striped gray collared shirt tucked\ninto C.E. Schmidt jeans over scuffed brown cowboy boots, Laudner was\ndeploying one of his well-worn strategies: Be everywhere.\n\n\n\nHe slipped his TRUMP business card to attendees at a somber veterans\nsuicide awareness event, crashed a campaign appearance by Sen. Ted Cruz\n(R-Tex.) at a shooting range, and later met local craft brewers at an\noutdoor beer festival downtown.\n\n\n\nHe wore an oversize navy blue TRUMP button pinned over his left breast, a\nwalking advertisement and a surveying tool.\n\n\n\nAt the veterans event, a man in a burgundy Elks jacket tapped the button\nwith his index finger. \xe2\x80\x9cI like that pin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, Roger McQueen,\npresident of the Iowa Elks Club.\n\n\n\nMcQueen said he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think Trump has a chance, but added that Trump\n\xe2\x80\x9cmakes us think about things differently.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nLater, as Cruz spoke to about 25 people at the shooting range, Laudner\nasked a tea-party friend to keep his ear to the ground, and suggested that\nhe could arrange a meeting with Trump.\n\n\n\nAt the brew fest, a man wearing an olive green \xe2\x80\x9cLife Is Good\xe2\x80\x9d baseball cap\nspotted Laudner\xe2\x80\x99s button. The man said he was leaning in favor of Wisconsin\nGov. Scott Walker, but he added of Trump: \xe2\x80\x9cI like his no bull---- approach.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAsked in an interview about Laudner\xe2\x80\x99s plan to leverage celebrity into\nvotes, Trump sounded unsure.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Maybe it won\xe2\x80\x99t translate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. But, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cI get\nthe biggest crowds, I get standing ovations. . . . I\xe2\x80\x99m a person who wins.\nWhen I do things, I win. The goal isn\xe2\x80\x99t to do well.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Trump bump terrifies GOP\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/trump-bump-terrifies-gop-119449.html>\n// Politico // Jonathan Topaz and Daniel Strauss \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nAll jokes aside, the Republican Party is officially afraid of Donald Trump.\n\nHe has virtually zero chance of winning the presidential nomination. But\ninsiders worry that the loud-mouthed mogul is more than just a minor\ncomedic nuisance on cable news; they fret that he\xe2\x80\x99s a loose cannon whose\nrants about Mexicans and scorched-earth attacks on his rivals will damage\nthe eventual nominee and hurt a party struggling to connect with women and\nminorities and desperate to win.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonald Trump is like watching a road-side accident,\xe2\x80\x9d said former George W.\nBush press secretary Ari Fleischer. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody pulls over to see the mess.\nAnd Trump thinks that\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment. But running for president is\nserious. And the risk for the party is he tarnishes everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThose risks were amplified this week after a trio of polls showed him\nlikely to earn a coveted invitation to the party\xe2\x80\x99s debates, which\nironically were restructured with the very goal of avoiding the circus-like\natmosphere of 2012. Having Trump introduce the 2016 field to a national\naudience was not exactly the Big Tent the party\xe2\x80\x99s bigwigs had in mind.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not excited about somebody as divisive as Trump or somebody as\nobnoxious as Trump being on the debate stage,\xe2\x80\x9d one RNC member confessed.\n\n\n\nTrump currently sits in eighth place among Republicans, according to the\nReal Clear Politics average of national polls \xe2\x80\x94 ahead of New Jersey Gov.\nChris Christie and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. And this week, he came in\nsecond in two New Hampshire polls and in a Fox News national poll,\nfinishing behind only former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in all three.\n\n\n\nUnder the rules instituted by Fox News, the top 10 candidates by national\npolling average will be included in the first debate, to be held in August.\nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s star could easily fade by then. But as of now, he would be in \xe2\x80\x94\nover 2012 Republican runner-up Rick Santorum, who won 11 states and around\n4 million votes last cycle; over Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the popular\ngovernor of a key swing state; over South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a\nleading foreign policy voice in the field; and over Louisiana Gov. Bobby\nJindal, known as a policy wonk.\n\n\n\nHe\xe2\x80\x99d also make it in over Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO who the\nparty establishment desperately wants on the debate stage. Fiorina has\nearned strong reviews from early-state activists, and party insiders say\nher inclusion in the debate is critical \xe2\x80\x94 both to demonstrate the GOP\xe2\x80\x99s\ndiversity and to help male candidates find the right tone in connecting\nwith female voters, whom Republicans have struggled to win over in recent\nyears.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Donald Trump elbows out Carly Fiorina, for example, that would be a\nreal tragedy for our side,\xe2\x80\x9d said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean.\n\n\n\nBeyond that, there are concerns about what he\xe2\x80\x99ll do once he\xe2\x80\x99s on the stage\n\xe2\x80\x94 namely, go hard after the other Republican hopefuls and say incendiary\nthings that will hurt the party.\n\n\n\nIn recent months, he\xe2\x80\x99s said that Fiorina got \xe2\x80\x9cfired viciously\xe2\x80\x9d from HP and\n\xe2\x80\x9cgot clobbered\xe2\x80\x9d in her 2010 California Senate loss to Barbara Boxer (she\nlost by 10 points.) He\xe2\x80\x99s rippped Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as \xe2\x80\x9cvery weak\xe2\x80\x9d on\nimmigration. He\xe2\x80\x99s called Jeb Bush \xe2\x80\x9can unhappy person\xe2\x80\x9d and said he \xe2\x80\x9ccouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nnegotiate his way out of a paper bag.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAsked whether Trump will keep up the attacks, campaign manager Corey\nLewandowski said he would. \xe2\x80\x9cThey should be worried about Donald Trump,\xe2\x80\x9d\nLewandowski said of the party establishment, before criticizing Rubio and\nBush on several issues.\n\n\n\nAnd worried they are.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a real concern, particularly on the debate stage, that Trump\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t play by the rules and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to throw some below-the-belt\npunches,\xe2\x80\x9d said Republican strategist Ford O\xe2\x80\x99Connell.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRepublicans in a primary don\xe2\x80\x99t like to see the candidates attacking each\nother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter Feaman, an RNC National Committeeman from Florida.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99d like to see the focus stay where it should be, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the\nleadership of the Democratic Party for the last eight years.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe challenge with somebody like him is that when you\xe2\x80\x99re running in these\nraces, there\xe2\x80\x99s sort of an assumption that you\xe2\x80\x99re racing with\nprofessionals,\xe2\x80\x9d said Katie Packer Gage, a former deputy campaign manager\nfor Mitt Romney. \xe2\x80\x9cHe makes up facts. It\xe2\x80\x99s a challenge because he\xe2\x80\x99s very\nunpredictable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd above all the RNC \xe2\x80\x94 whose self-assessment of the party\xe2\x80\x99s failure in\n2012 urged the importance of appealing to non-white voters, especially\nHispanics, 71 percent of whom voted for President Barack Obama \xe2\x80\x94 is nervous\nabout Trump\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric. He accused Mexican immigrants of being rapists and\nsmuggling drugs in his announcement speech, and said at a January\nRepublican cattle call in Iowa that half the undocumented immigrants in the\nU.S. are criminals. In 2011, he led the racially loaded calls for Obama to\nrelease his long-form birth certificate and, in April, blamed the president\nfor the riots in Baltimore following the death of Freddie Gray.\n\n\n\nFleischer, one of the five co-authors of the RNC autopsy report, said Trump\nlargely embodied all of the party\xe2\x80\x99s problems with non-white voters. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\nhe says something irresponsible like getting Mexicans to pay for a wall, he\nwill alienate Hispanics \xe2\x80\xa6 he\xe2\x80\x99s irresponsible, he\xe2\x80\x99s divisive, he\xe2\x80\x99s hurtful,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe said.\n\n\n\nAsked about those concerns, Lewandowski responded: \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s saying this, old\nwhite guys? You\xe2\x80\x99re saying you\xe2\x80\x99ve got old white guys saying they\xe2\x80\x99re\nconcerned about Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s messaging about illegal immigrants coming\nacross our southern border. Wow, that speaks for itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSeveral Iowa Republicans expressed dismay at Trump\xe2\x80\x99s momentum, labeling him\nas someone whose brash personality and celebrity status make him a bad fit\nfor the rural first nominating state.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost of the rank-and-file Republicans think, \xe2\x80\x98What have we done to let a\nguy like Donald Trump on the debate stage?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said one Iowa Republican\nactivist with ties to the party. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I saw the New Hampshire poll, I was\nlike, \xe2\x80\x98Oh my god.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s just not Iowa nice,\xe2\x80\x9d the person added \xe2\x80\x94 relaying several stories\nabout Trump\xe2\x80\x99s recent trips to the Hawkeye State. At two events, the person\nsaid, Trump insisted on speaking earlier than scheduled so that he could\nget back to his home in New York City: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was kind of embarrassing. He\nleft before our donors showed up.\xe2\x80\x9d (Lewandowski said he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen that at\nany events in Iowa and touted Trump\xe2\x80\x99s large crowds in the state.)\n\n\n\nParty insiders acknowledge that there\xe2\x80\x99s a sliver of voters \xe2\x80\x94 those fed up\naltogether with the political system \xe2\x80\x94 who are drawn to Trump. \xe2\x80\x9cI love\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanne Sangenario, who was on Romney\xe2\x80\x99s New Hampshire women\xe2\x80\x99s\nleadership team in 2008 and now serves as Seacoast Republican Women\ndirector. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I know he would take no baloney from anybody from any\nworld leader and he would get things done and the economy would come back\nbig time, he would get it done. No two ways about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOther Republicans say voters will drown him out \xe2\x80\x94 particularly in a more\nformal debate setting where viewers expect a serious discussion.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do remember growing up in Kermit [Texas], every time the carnival came\nto town it always drew a big crowd,\xe2\x80\x9d said Republican consultant John\nWeaver, who worked on Arizona Sen. John McCain\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 presidential campaign\nand has signed up to work with Kasich. \xe2\x80\x9cBut nobody wanted the carnival\nbarker to be mayor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Donald Trump bans Univision staff from his Miami golf resort\n<http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/06/donald-trump-bans-univision-staff-from-his-miami-golf-209570.html?hp=l2_4>\n// Politico // Dylan Byers \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nDonald Trump sent a letter to Univision CEO and president Randy Falco on\nFriday informing him that "no Univision officer or representative" is\nallowed to use his Trump National Doral, the resort and golf club\nimmediately adjacent to Univision offices in Miami, the On Media blog has\nlearned.\n\n\n\nThe move is the latest in a public dispute that started Thursday when\nUnivision announced it would end its business relationship with the Miss\nUniverse Organization, which is co-owned by Trump and NBCUniversal, based\non what it described as Trump\'s "insulting remarks about Mexican\nimmigrants" during the launch of his presidential campaign. Trump later\nannounced that he would sue Univision for breach of contract and\ndefamation, and accused Univision of defaulting on an "iron-clad" $13.5\nmillion contract, which he said it had no right to terminate.\n\n\n\nIn the letter, Trump writes to Falco, "Please be advised that under no\ncircumstances is any officer or representative of Univision allowed to use\nTrump National Doral, Miami\xe2\x80\x94its golf courses or any of its facilities.\nAlso, please immediately stop work and close the gate which is being\nconstructed between our respective properties. If this is not done within\none week, we will close it."\n\n\n\nIn a post-script, Trump added: "Please congratulate your Mexican Government\nofficials for having made such outstanding trade deals with the United\nStates. However, inform them that should I become President, those days are\nover. We are bringing jobs back to the U.S. Also, a meaningful border will\nbe immediately created, not the laughingstock that currently exists."\n\n\n\nShortly after publication of this item, a Univision spokesperson told the\nOn Media blog that the following directive had been sent to all employees:\n"As part of this decision, [Univision Communications Inc.] employees should\nnot stay at Trump properties while on company business or hold\nevents/activities there."\n\n\n\nTrump, who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, said in a\nspeech earlier this month that he would build a wall to stop Mexico from\ndumping "rapists" and criminals on U.S. soil, though he later issued a\nstatement accusing the media of trying "to distort my comments regarding\nMexico and its great people." Univision said Thursday that it would severe\nits business relations with Trump based on those remarks, including its\nfive-year contract with the Miss Universe Organization, which gives\nUnivision broadcasting rights to the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with the On Media blog on Thursday, Trump accused Univision\nof capitulating to pressure "put on them by various sources in Mexico."\n\n\n\n"The Mexican government is putting pressure on Univision to get me to stop\nexposing the weaknesses the U.S. has at the southern border," he said\nduring the interview, citing his claims that U.S. leaders were\n"incompetent" on trade with Mexico, allowing the country to take advantage\nof the U.S., and that the southern border "is a sieve" that "illegals are\npouring through."\n\n\n\n"The government of Mexico and the lobbyists and the special interests have\nput tremendous pressure on Univision, a company that is very subservient to\nMexico, to get Trump to stop exposing the terrible situation at the border\nand the terrible trade deals that are being made by the United States to\nthe benefit of Mexico," he said. "I will not be party to that, because my\nlove of the country is too great to allow this to happen."\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Trump also published a photograph of a hand-written letter from\nUnivision\'s Jorge Ramos that included the anchor\'s personal cell phone\nnumber, a move that was likely to inflame tensions between the two parties.\n\n\n\n*Donald Trump\'s war with Univision gets nasty\n<http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/26/media/donald-trump-univision-doral-golf-courses/>\n// CNN // Tom Kludt and Mark Mooney \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nDonald Trump\'s fight with Univision is heating up. On Friday he published\nan anchor\'s personal phone number, called for the resignation of a top\nexecutive and banned all of the channel\'s executives from using Trump\'s\ngolf course in Miami.\n\n\n\n"Under no circumstances is any officer or representative of Univision\nallowed to use Trump National Doral, Miami," the letter read.\n\n\n\nTrump added a P.S.: "Please congratulate your Mexican Government officials\nfor having made such outstanding trade deals with the United States.\nHowever, inform them that should I become President, those days are over."\n\n\n\nTrump also posted a personal hand-written note that Univision correspondent\nJorge Ramos had sent him requesting an interview. The note included Ramos\'\ncell phone number.\n\n\n\nUnivision fired back on Friday, sending out a memo to its employees that\nthey "should not stay at Trump properties while on company business or hold\nevents/activities there."\n\n\n\nThe war began after Trump made offensive statements about Mexicans,\nincluding calling them "rapists," while announcing he was running for\npresident.\n\n\n\nIn response, Univision, the largest Spanish language network in the\ncountry, broke off its deal to air the Miss USA Pageant, which is partially\nowned by Trump.\n\n\n\nTrump also lashed out at Univision President Alberto Ciurana who apologized\nto Trump after he posted a photo comparing Trump to the Charleston gunman\nwho killed nine people.\n\n\n\n"Apology not accepted," Trump wrote. "I call for his resignation as\npresident of Univision and Univision should not be allowed to host the\nPresidential debate. It is a total conflict of interest." Univision plans\nto hold a presidential forum.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with CNN\'s Erin Burnett Thursday, Trump called the photo\nthat Ciurana posted "disgraceful."\n\n\n\n"When he put that up, he then took it down... he\'s got tremendous\nliability," Trump said.\n\n*UNDECLARED*\n\n\n\n*WALKER*\n\n\n\n*Scott Walker calls for Constitutional amendment to let states define\nmarriage\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/scott-walker-ban-gay-marriage-constitutional-amendment-119470.html#ixzz3eF8K8EoE>\n// Politico // Daniel Strauss \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, seizing the moment after the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s\nlandmark ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, called Friday for a\nConstitutional amendment that would allow the states to decide whether gay\nmarriage should be legal.\n\n\n\nWalker\xe2\x80\x99s call came shortly after the high court ruled 5-4 that same-sex\ncouples could marry across the country, overturning a number of state\nsame-sex marriage bans.\n\n\n\nThe ruling was \xe2\x80\x9ca grave mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d the Republican governor said, touting his\nsupport for amending his state\xe2\x80\x99s constitution \xe2\x80\x9cto protect the institution\nof marriage from exactly this type of judicial activism.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a result of this decision, the only alternative left for the American\npeople is to support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to reaffirm the\nability of the states to continue to define marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d Walker said in the\nstatement.\n\n\n\nWalker\xe2\x80\x99s statement put him directly at odds with one potential 2016 rival,\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t support pursuing a\nconstitutional amendment.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[G]iven the quickly changing tide of public opinion on this issue, I do\nnot believe that any attempt to amend the U.S. Constitution could possibly\ngain the support of three-fourths of the states or a supermajority in the\nU.S. Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d Graham said in his statement. \xe2\x80\x9cRather than pursuing a\ndivisive effort that would be doomed to fail, I am committing myself to\nensuring the protection of religious liberties of all Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSuch an amendment would face steep odds on Capitol Hill.\n\n\n\n*JINDAL*\n\n\n\n*Bobby Jindal: Supreme Court Decision Is Not the End of the Obamacare\nDebate\n<http://time.com/3937809/bobby-jindal-supreme-court-decision-is-not-the-end-of-the-obamacare-debate/>\n// TIME // Bobby Jindal \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nThursday, the Supreme Court had its say on Obamacare; soon, the American\npeople will have theirs.\n\n\n\nAs a matter of law, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision upholding subsidies for states\nparticipating in the federally run insurance exchange, healthcare.gov,\nviolates the plain text of Obamacare. The statute expressly restricted\ninsurance subsidies to those individuals purchasing coverage through an\n\xe2\x80\x9cExchange established by the state.\xe2\x80\x9d But just as Chief Justice Roberts\nthree years ago decreed that the individual mandate functioned as a tax,\neven though both Congress and President Barack Obama stated that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t,\nthe Court decided that \xe2\x80\x9cExchange established by the state\xe2\x80\x9d meant any type\nof Exchange, whether established by states or by Washington.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a sad outcome for the rule of law \xe2\x80\x94 and the English language. But when\nit comes to the political debate surrounding Obamacare, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling\nultimately decides little. Of course, Obama, who took an entirely\npredictable victory lap yesterday, would have you believe otherwise. But\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve seen his triumphalism before \xe2\x80\x94 and have seen it come crashing back to\nreality.\n\n\n\nThree years ago, Obama stated he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9crefight old battles,\xe2\x80\x9d mere hours\nafter seven Supreme Court justices \xe2\x80\x94 including his own former solicitor\ngeneral \xe2\x80\x94 struck down the law\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory Medicaid expansion as\nunconstitutional \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic dragooning\xe2\x80\x9d of the states. On election night\n2012, the president promised to \xe2\x80\x9cmove forward\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 months before at least 4.7\nmillion Americans received insurance cancellation notices thanks to\nObamacare. And this April, the president arrogantly declared that \xe2\x80\x9cthe\nrepeal debate is and should be over\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 mere weeks before his native state\nof Hawaii shut its failed insurance exchange, an effort the federal\ngovernment spent more than $200 million funding.\n\n\n\nSo, much as the President would like the debate on Obamacare to be over, it\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t. The debate persists in large part because the law has singularly\nfailed in its prime objective: Containing health care costs. Consider why\nthis Supreme Court case mattered so much to the administration in the first\nplace. The law spends over $1.7 trillion on subsidized coverage to make\ninsurance more \xe2\x80\x9caffordable,\xe2\x80\x9d largely to offset the new mandates and\nregulations that have raised the price of insurance.\n\n\n\nAnd with myriad insurers proposing double-digit premium increases for next\nyear \xe2\x80\x94 some as high as 50% \xe2\x80\x94 candidate Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 promise to lower\ninsurance premiums by $2,500 per family is further away then ever. No\nwonder the law remains singularly unpopular. When it comes to winning the\ndebate on Obamacare, there is still all to play for.\n\n\n\nBut in order to win, we conservatives first have to play. That means\noutlining our alternative vision for health care: How we would restore\nfreedom and choice to a health care sector currently lacking for both \xe2\x80\x94 and\nmost importantly, how we would slow, and hopefully reverse, the trend of\nskyrocketing health care costs.\n\n\n\nAs I write this, I stand as the sole major declared presidential candidate\n(with the possible exception of Bernie Sanders) to put forward my vision on\nhealth care, and an alternative to Obamacare. As proud as I am of my plan,\nthat is a boast I wish I were not able to make. Because Republicans, from\nthe top down, must outline a clear and coherent vision for health care to\nwin the trust of the American people to repeal this President\xe2\x80\x99s health law.\n\n\n\nWhile we should be shouting our vision from the rooftops, many of my fellow\ncandidates have managed barely a whisper about how exactly they would\nrepeal Obamacare, or what they would do to tackle the main issue plaguing\nour health care system: rising costs. Sen. Mike Lee recently stated that\nlack of an Obamacare replacement plan should be a disqualifier for any\nconservative presidential candidate. He\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely right. We owe it to\nthe American people to release our plans well before November 2016, and to\nhave a robust debate within our party about what should come after\nObamacare.\n\n\n\nBecause, contrary to this President\xe2\x80\x99s self-proclaimed edicts, yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s\nSupreme Court decision is not the end of the debate on Obamacare.\n\n\n\nNow that the Supreme Court has ruled, the debate shifts back to the elected\nbranches of government \xe2\x80\x94 the ones that caused our health care mess in the\nfirst place. It is there that conservatives can complete our work to repeal\nObamacare.\n\n\n\n*Jindal: Obama & \xe2\x80\x98apprentice-in-chief\xe2\x80\x99 Hillary Clinton taking U.S. down\n\xe2\x80\x98wrong path\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://www.radioiowa.com/2015/06/26/jindal-obama-apprentice-in-chief-hillary-clinton-taking-us-down-wrong-path-audio/>\n// Radio Iowa // O.

John\nKasich\xe2\x80\x99s desk as the calls rolled in for him to exercise his line-item veto\npen.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are going to be some vetoes, and there will probably be some\ndisagreements on vetoes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said Friday. He offered no clues as to what\nthey might be.\n\n\n\nThe House voted 61-34 to send the spending plan to the governor, with a\nsingle Democrat joining Republicans in support and three Republicans\nbreaking with the majority to oppose it.\n\n\n\nAmong other things, the governor has been urged to strike language imposing\nmore restrictions on abortion clinics, penalizing Toledo and other cities\nthat won court orders to continue operating traffic cameras, restricting\nthe collective bargaining power of some workers, and eliminating\njournalists\xe2\x80\x99 ability to review gun concealed carry permit records.\n\n\n\nThe governor will sign the budget Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe plan contains an estimated $1.97 billion in income tax breaks for\nbusinesses and individuals over two years, pumps $955 million more into\nbasic K-12 school aid, and orders a freeze in college and university\ntuition over the next two years.\n\n\n\nThe plan banks hundreds of millions in surpluses, bringing reserves to\nnearly $2 billion. Perhaps days from announcing a GOP bid for the White\nHouse, he contrasted that with the federal fiscal picture.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNormally in good times, it\xe2\x80\x99s party time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody wants to\nspend. The [Ohio legislative] leaders feel the pressure over this. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\nbeen part of this process. I left Washington with a $5 billion surplus. The\nnext thing I knew we were $18 trillion in the hole down there with more\ndebt and more spending.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nState Reps. Teresa Fedor and Michael Ashford of Toledo and Mike Sheehy of\nOregon, all Democrats, opposed the budget.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe could have balanced more of our budget to have more opportunity for the\nmiddle class,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Fedor said. \xe2\x80\x9cMore charter school reform hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened\nyet. The issues for Toledo need to be addressed. The traffic camera issue\nshould lay low until we find out from the courts what is happening, and\nthere was definitely an attack on women and their right to control their\nreproductive systems and health care.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe budget won support from all northwest Ohio Republicans \xe2\x80\x94 Reps. Barbara\nSears (Monclova Township), Tim Brown (Bowling Green), Robert Sprague\n(Findlay), Steven Kraus (Sandusky), Robert McColley (Napoleon), Bill\nReineke (Tiffin), Bob Cupp (Lima), Tony Burkley (Payne), and Jeff McClain\n(Upper Sandusky).\n\n\n\nWith the exception of increasing the cigarette tax by 35 cents to $1.60 a\npack, lawmakers did not embrace Mr. Kasich\xe2\x80\x99s proposals to move further from\nincome taxes toward consumption taxes. The governor had proposed higher\ntaxes on sales, oil and natural gas drilling, other tobacco products, and\nlarger businesses.\n\n\n\nMr. McColley said transitioning to a consumption tax-based economy is\nprobably a good idea over the long run.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we need to do that slowly and deliberately,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is something\nwe need to do with a great deal of planning, which is one reason I\xe2\x80\x99m happy\nto see the 2020 tax (study) council being introduced in the budget and\nbeing implemented in the near future.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe budget would reduce income taxes by 6.3 percent across all brackets.

GOP Candidates React to Gay-Marriage Ruling\n<http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/06/26/move-on-or-keep-fighting-gop-candidates-react-to-gay-marriage-ruling/>\n// WSJ \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court decision guaranteeing marriage equality to gay couples\ndrew criticism on Friday from Republicans running for president in 2016,\nbut the contenders took different tones and promised different degrees of\npushback\xe2\x80\x93signaling just what a tricky political issue this is for the party.\n\n\n\nSome candidates expressed disappointment but signaled it was time to move\non, while others blasted the court and vowed to keep fighting.\n\n\n\nFormer Sen. Rick Santorum said: \xe2\x80\x9cToday, five unelected justices decided to\nredefine the foundational unit that binds together our society without\npublic debate or input \xe2\x80\xa6 The stakes are too high and the issue too\nimportant to simply cede the will of the people to five unaccountable\njustices.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBen Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, struck a significantly less\nconfrontational note:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile I strongly disagree with the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, their ruling\nis now the law of the land.  I call on Congress to make sure deeply held\nreligious views are respected and protected.  The government must never\nforce Christians to violate their religious beliefs. I support same-sex\ncivil unions but to me, and millions like me, marriage is a religious\nservice not a government form.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush restated his support for traditional marriage\nbut struck a more conciliatory tone about accepting gays.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuided by my faith, I believe in traditional marriage. I believe the\nSupreme Court should have allowed the states to make this decision,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nwrote. \xe2\x80\x9cI also believe that we should love our neighbor and respect others,\nincluding those making lifetime commitments. In a country as diverse as\nours, good people who have opposing views should be able to live side by\nside. It is now crucial that as a country we protect religious freedom and\nthe right of conscience and also not discriminate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio said the right to redefine marriage should rest\nwith the states but that he accepts the court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling as the law.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs we look ahead, it must be a priority of the next president to nominate\njudges and justices committed to applying the Constitution as written and\noriginally understood,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a statement. The next president must\nalso \xe2\x80\x9cstrive to protect the First Amendment rights of religious\ninstitutions and millions of Americans whose faith holds a traditional view\nof marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nCarly Fiorina, former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard Co., called the\ncourt\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9conly the latest example of an activist court ignoring its\nconstitutional duty to say what the law is and not what the law should be.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMs. Fiorina said in the statement that the ability to \xe2\x80\x9credefine marriage\xe2\x80\x9d\nshould have stayed among the states.\n\n\n\nEchoing the concerns of others in the GOP field, she also expressed concern\nabout \xe2\x80\x9cprotecting the religious liberties and freedom of conscience for\nthose Americans that profoundly disagree with today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee blasted the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision upholding\ngay marriage: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Supreme Court has spoken with a very divided voice on\nsomething only the Supreme Being can do \xe2\x80\x94 redefine marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\nHuckabee, a candidate who is a favorite among evangelical conservatives. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nwill not acquiesce to an imperial court any more than our Founders\nacquiesced to an imperial British monarch.  We must resist and reject\njudicial tyranny, not retreat.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDonald Trump tweeted his reaction to the ruling, taking a jab at Mr. Bush\nin the process. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce again the Bush appointed Supreme Court Justice John\nRoberts has let us down. Jeb pushed him hard! Remember!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nChief Justice Roberts was one of the four dissenting justices in Obergefell\nv. Hodges, which struck down restrictions on same-sex marriage in Kentucky,\nMichigan, Ohio and Tennessee that a Cincinnati-based federal appeals court\nupheld last year and validated a series of lower court opinions that\nexpanded the institution across most of the nation since 2012.\n\n\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a GOP presidential candidate who is trying to\nappeal to evangelical voters, accused the court of bowing to public opinion\nand threatening the religious freedom of people who are committed to\ntraditional marriage.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe government should not force those who have sincerely held religious\nbeliefs about marriage to participate in these ceremonies. That would be a\nclear violation of America\xe2\x80\x99s long held commitment to religious liberty as\nprotected in the First Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFormer Texas Gov. Rick Perry joined those who said they were disappointed,\nand responded to promising to appoint more conservative justices to the\nbench if he was president.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fundamentally disagree with the court rewriting the law and assaulting\nthe 10th Amendment. Our founding fathers did not intend for the judicial\nbranch to legislate from the bench, and as president, I would appoint\nstrict Constitutional conservatives who will apply the law as written.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who is expected to announce his candidacy for\nthe GOP nomination, is the only member of the 2016 field to call for a\nconstitutional amendment to reverse the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling. In a\nstatement, he called the ruling a \xe2\x80\x9cgrave mistake\xe2\x80\x9d and said that the power\nto redefine marriage should rest with the states.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call on the president and all governors to join me in reassuring\nmillions of Americans that the government will not force them to\nparticipate in activities that violate their deeply held religious\nbeliefs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nMr. Walker\xe2\x80\x99s call for a constitutional amendment illustrates he has shifted\nhis views to more aggressively back gay-marriage bans since the court in\n2014 declined to consider requests from Wisconsin and four other states to\nreinstate such bans. Mr. Walker had backed his state\xe2\x80\x99s ban on gay marriage\nbut said his fight was \xe2\x80\x9cover in Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x9d after the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision,\naccording to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, he told ABC News that if the court ruled in favor of\ngay marriage, a constitutional amendment was \xe2\x80\x9cthe only next approach.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRobert Nichols, a spokesman for another  potential candidate, Ohio\nRepublican Gov. John Kasich, said Mr. Kasich would respect the court\xe2\x80\x99s\nruling. \xe2\x80\x9cThe governor has always believed in the sanctity of marriage\nbetween a man and a woman, but our nation\xe2\x80\x99s highest court has spoken and we\nmust respect its decision.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is is expected to announce he\xe2\x80\x99s running\nfor president next Tuesday, said that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s\nopinion and sided with Chief Justice Roberts in arguing that voters, not\nthe courts, should have decided on the issue.\n\n\n\nStill, Mr. Christie, who believes marriage should be reserved to\nheterosexual couples,  said that the U.S. should now abide by the law. Mr.\nChristie dropped his opposition to gay marriage in New Jersey after the\nstate\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court ruled in favor of it in 2013.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur job is going to be to support the law of the land and that\xe2\x80\x99s the law\nof the land,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Christie said while taking questions after signing the\nNew Jersey budget on Friday.\n\n\n\nReaction from the Democratic candidates was celebratory:\n\n\n\nDemocratic front-runner Hillary Clinton was the first White House contender\nto tweet her reaction to the ruling:\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton, who came out in support of gay marriage in 2013, also issued\na statement praising the Supreme Court ruling:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis ruling is an affirmation of the commitment of couples across the\ncountry who love one another,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt reflects the will of\nthe vast and growing multitude of Americans who believe that LGBT couples\ndeserve to be recognized under the law and treated equally in the eyes of\nsociety.  And it represents our country at its best: inclusive, open, and\nstriving towards true equality.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe added that the next goal must be a broader effort to end\ndiscrimination. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile we celebrate today, our work won\xe2\x80\x99t be finished until\nevery American can not only marry, but live, work, pray, learn and raise a\nfamily free from discrimination and prejudice,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot settle\nfor anything less.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont also hailed the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision. \xe2\x80\x9cToday the\nSupreme Court fulfilled the words engraved upon its building: \xe2\x80\x98Equal\njustice under law.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis decision is a victory for same-sex couples across our country as well\nas all those seeking to live in a nation where every citizen is afforded\nequal rights. For far too long our justice system has marginalized the gay\ncommunity and I am very glad the Court has finally caught up to the\nAmerican people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMartin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley recalled passing gay marriage in Maryland as governor and\ntweeted, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no greater human right than love.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Affordable Care Act alternative now key for GOP hopefuls\n<http://www.bostonherald.com/news_opinion/us_politics/2015/06/affordable_care_act_alternative_now_key_for_gop_hopefuls>\n// Boston Herald // Lindsay Kalter \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court decision upholding Obamacare will give GOP presidential\ncandidates a new angle to woo voters, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to hone their\nrhetoric and swap out the old \xe2\x80\x9crepeal\xe2\x80\x9d mantra for well-defined plans to\nimprove it, political operatives say.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a huge opportunity for Republicans if they handle it right,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nFergus Cullen, a former chairman of New Hampshire Republican Party. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\nnot enough for Republican candidates to say, \xe2\x80\x98We need to repeal every word\nof Obamacare.\xe2\x80\x99 The Republican position on health care cannot be, \xe2\x80\x98Do not\nget sick, do not get hurt, do not get old.\xe2\x80\x99 They have to come up with an\nalternative.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe 6-to-3 ruling backs the Obama administration, agreeing that all low-\nand moderate-income residents should have access to subsidies, regardless\nof whether they live in states with their own health insurance exchanges,\nas the law\xe2\x80\x99s wording required, or used the federal exchange instead.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCongress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance\nmarkets, not to destroy them,\xe2\x80\x9d Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote.\n\n\n\nThe ruling ups the pressure for Republicans to breathe new life into\nObamacare pushback in early-voting states such as New Hampshire, where\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll need to entice anti-ACA voters with plans that include age-based\nrefundable tax credits and scrapping the employer mandate, said Sally\nPipes, head of California-based think tank Pacific Research Institute.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Republican candidates will really have to articulate what their vision\nof health care will be,\xe2\x80\x9d Pipes said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think people in a state like New\nHampshire would appreciate what\xe2\x80\x99s good for job growth, which includes\ngetting rid of employer mandate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGOP national pundit Ford O\xe2\x80\x99Connell said Republican candidates \xe2\x80\x9cwill need to\nprovide more than just red meat,\xe2\x80\x9d and should focus on three primary changes\nto the system: allowing consumers to buy insurance across state lines,\nde-linking it from employment and strengthening patient power over their\ninsurance accounts.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVoters will want insurance that can travel with you, not the car you\xe2\x80\x99re\ndriving,\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Connell said.\n\n\n\nAlthough cries for a repeal will likely still sound from the Republican\nvoting pool, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s victory may pave the way for Congress to\nmake tweaks and improvements to the law rather than fully replace it, said\nWendy Parmet, director of the Northeastern Program on Health Policy and Law.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the things that has happened over the last several years has been\nthat Republicans have tried to wage existential challenges to the\nAffordable Care Act,\xe2\x80\x9d Pamet said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to be clear that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\ngoing away. It\xe2\x80\x99s becoming part of the fabric of society.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe added, \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe we can get to politicians cleaning up a little and making\nit work better.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*The Subtle, But Hugely Significant Shift In The Republican Response To The\nMarriage Ruling\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/the-subtle-but-hugely-significant-shift-in-the-republican-re#.mePLqL1WE>\n// Buzzfeed // Rosie Gray \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nTwo of the leading Republican contenders responded nearly in lockstep on\nFriday to the Supreme Court ruling that has legalized same-sex marriage\nnationwide: by waving a white flag in the fight over marriage \xe2\x80\x94 and\npromising to take up arms in a new culture war battle over religious\nfreedom.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile I disagree with this decision, we live in a republic and must abide\nby the law,\xe2\x80\x9d Marco Rubio said in a statement, then called for officials to\n\xe2\x80\x9cprotect the First Amendment rights of religious institutions and millions\nof Americans whose faiths hold a traditional view of marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my hope that each side will respect the dignity of the other,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio\nsaid.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush cited his Catholic faith to explain his personal belief in\n\xe2\x80\x9ctraditional marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d but added, \xe2\x80\x9cI also believe we should love our\nneighbor and respect others, including those making lifetime commitments.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe then pivoted to the need to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect religious freedom and the right of\nconscience and also not discriminate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNo one said they agreed with the court, but a number of the candidates\nsignaled the desire to cut their political losses on the losing issue of\nmarriage \xe2\x80\x94 and instead reframe their party\xe2\x80\x99s social agenda in terms of\nprotecting the viewpoints of the dissenting. The distinction may seem like\nmere semantics, but it represents a profound shift in the culture wars, in\nwhich Republicans are deliberately moving from offense to defense.\n\n\n\nFor decades, Republicans rallied the religious right by championing \xe2\x80\x9cfamily\nvalues,\xe2\x80\x9d and pressing for policies meant to infuse American society with\nJudeo-Christian morals \xe2\x80\x94 from anti-sodomy laws to crackdowns on pornography\nand keeping condoms out of schools. Social conservatives presented\nthemselves as the country\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmoral majority\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the banner under which Jerry\nFalwell mobilized millions of Christian voters in the \xe2\x80\x9870s and \xe2\x80\x9880s \xe2\x80\x94 and\ntheir mission was to defeat the disproportionately powerful secular elites\nin media and government.\n\n\n\nThe populist disavowal of Washington elite has remained, but as the GOP\xe2\x80\x99s\nagenda on gay issues has fallen out of favor in recent years, party leaders\nare no longer claiming to be in the majority. Instead, they are making\nappeals to pluralism \xe2\x80\x94 which are much more popular \xe2\x80\x94 arguing that while\nsociety has changed where LGBT issues are concerned, religious\nconservatives should be able to object when they believe their principles\nhave been infringed.\n\n\n\nNot all of the 2016 candidates on Friday followed the example of Bush,\nRubio, and also dark-horse candidate Lindsey Graham, who said in a\nstatement that he opposes a marriage amendment to the Constitution: \xe2\x80\x9cRather\nthan pursuing a divisive effort that would be doomed to fail, I am\ncommitting myself to ensuring the protection of religious liberties of all\nAmericans.\xe2\x80\x9d Conservative culture warriors like Rick Santorum, Mike\nHuckabee, and Bobby Jindal all quickly released statements harshly\ncondemning the court, signaling that they still have an appetite to fight\nthe marriage movement on the merits.\n\n\n\nAnd, more importantly, Scott Walker \xe2\x80\x94 considered a top-tier candidate \xe2\x80\x94\ntook a sharper tone on Friday\xe2\x80\x99s ruling. Walker argued in favor of a\nmarriage amendment to the Constitution and called the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision a\n\xe2\x80\x9cgrave mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d Walker is expected to make a serious bid to win the Iowa\ncaucuses next year; his response seems aimed at the conservative Iowa\nvoters who can help him do that.\n\n\n\nBut those candidates signaling surrender in the marriage fight are no doubt\nhoping that an emphasis on religious freedom will be enough to placate the\nstill-influential conservative Christian primary voters in states like Iowa\nand South Carolina. It remains to be seen whether those voters are ready to\nembrace the same political pragmatism that their prospective\nstandard-bearers are exhibiting.\n\n\n\n*OTHER 2016 NEWS*\n\n\n\n*Same-sex marriage ruling shakes up 2016 presidential race\n<http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2015/06/26/same-sex-marriage-ruling-shakes-up-2016-presidential-race/>\n// AJC // Daniel Malloy \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 Friday\xe2\x80\x99s U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex\nmarriage across the country gave Democrats running for president a rallying\ncry, while Republicans disagreed with resignation, vitriol or somewhere in\nbetween.\n\n\n\nFormer Florida Gov.

In Louisiana, it\xe2\x80\x99s in our\nstate constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nJindal said this ruling will \xe2\x80\x9cpave the way for an all-out assault on\nreligious liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is happening today is you see that Christian business owners,\nflorists, caterers and musicians \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re being forced to participate in\nwedding ceremonies that violate their beliefs, their conscience,\xe2\x80\x9d Jindal\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRepublican candidate Rick Santorum, campaigning in western Iowa this\nmorning, called the ruling a \xe2\x80\x9cbad decision\xe2\x80\x9d that will \xe2\x80\x9charm the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSantorum favors an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would ban\nsame-sex marriage.\n\n\n\nDuring a campaign stop in Pella Thursday, Republican presidential candidate\nMike Huckabee said he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t accept the \xe2\x80\x9cidea\xe2\x80\x9d of same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it is a Biblical norm. I have friends who are homosexual.\nI love them. They\xe2\x80\x99re my friends. I don\xe2\x80\x99t quit loving them because of what\nthey do or who they are,\xe2\x80\x9d Huckabee said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t accept the idea of a\nsame-sex marriage not because I don\xe2\x80\x99t like people, but because I believe\nthe institution of marriage is something very sacred, unique, that is not\njust a human institution. It\xe2\x80\x99s a divine institution that reflects the very\nrelationship of Christ and his church. For me, that\xe2\x80\x99s something I can\xe2\x80\x99t\nyield.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHuckabee, Santorum and Jindal are among the nine GOP candidates who will\nspeak in mid-July at the Family Leadership Summit in Ames. The event\xe2\x80\x99s\nhosted by Bob Vander Plaats of The Family Leader and Vander Plaats told\nRadio Iowa this morning this ruling will bring \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense\xe2\x80\x9d Americans who\noppose same-sex marriage \xe2\x80\x9cout of the woodwork.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to start seeing what the candidates are saying,\xe2\x80\x9d Vander Plaats\npredicted.\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and\nMartin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley are praising the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on same-sex marriage.\nState Senator Matt McCoy, a Democrat from Des Moines who is the only openly\ngay member of the legislature, said it\xe2\x80\x99s not a big issue for Democrats and\nhe predicts it won\xe2\x80\x99t be for Republicans either.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think this is an issue that\xe2\x80\x99s going to get a lot of oxygen for the next\nseveral months, then it is absolutely going to become one of the least\nimportant issues of the campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d McCoy told Radio Iowa.\n\n\n\nHowever, McCoy said Democrats do need to realize this decision may not have\ngone the way it did if a Republican president had been in office since 2009.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we need to remind Democratic voters just why we have the decision\nwe have today,\xe2\x80\x9d McCoy said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s primary due to the good\nappointments that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had on the court.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nJennifer Harvey of West Des Moines and her partner legally married in 2009,\nshortly after Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court ruled the state\xe2\x80\x99s ban on same-sex\nmarriage was unconstitutional. Harvey suggests opposition to same-sex\nmarriage is a perilous position for a politician.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think for politicians who decide to take a stand on that, it might not\nbe right now, but in the very near future that\xe2\x80\x99ll be a form of political\nsuicide,\xe2\x80\x9d Harvey said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you watch how political sentiment has changed,\npeople very quickly come ot realize that It just sort of makes sense. I\nthink this is settled. I think this will be a non-starter in the next\nthree, four or five years.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHarvey was a bit surprised by her emotional reaction to today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKind of just a big sign of relief, like we can finally stop talking about\nthis,\xe2\x80\x9d Harvey said, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cIt feels like it\xe2\x80\x99s been small victory, small\nvictory, small victory and I was surprised to find myself feel this ping of\nreal joy and kind of a, \xe2\x80\x98Wow! It\xe2\x80\x99s finally done.\'\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHarvey and her partner, Chris, are the parents of two children and she says\nin the past six years that same-sex marriage has been legal in Iowa,\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s been a \xe2\x80\x9cclimate change\xe2\x80\x9d in how her family is treated and perceived\nby others.\n\n\n\n*TOP NEWS*\n\n\n\n*DOMESTIC*\n\n\n\n*President Obama Eulogizes Charleston Pastor as One Who Understood Grace\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/thousands-gather-for-funeral-of-clementa-pinckney-in-charleston.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news>\n// NYT // Kevin Sack and Gardiner Harris \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nCHARLESTON, S.C. \xe2\x80\x94 In one of his presidency\xe2\x80\x99s most impassioned reflections\non race, President Obama eulogized the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney on Friday\nby calling on the nation to emulate the grace that he displayed in his work\nand that the people of South Carolina demonstrated after the massacre of\nnine worshipers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\n\n\nBefore nearly 6,000 mourners and a worldwide television audience, Mr.\nObama, who met Mr. Pinckney during his first presidential campaign, placed\nthe shootings in the context of America\xe2\x80\x99s long history of violence against\nAfrican-Americans. He also reiterated his plea to restrict the availability\nof firearms and called for the removal of the Confederate battle flag from\nthe grounds of the State House in Columbia.\n\n\n\nMr. Obama thrilled the mostly African-American audience by preaching with\nrevivalist cadences, and by closing his 40-minute address by singing, in\nsolo, the opening refrain of \xe2\x80\x9cAmazing Grace.\xe2\x80\x9d The crowd came to its feet\nand joined in, leading the Rev. Norvel Goff, a presiding elder in the\nA.M.E. church, to later \xe2\x80\x9cthank the Reverend President.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe we now realize the way racial bias can infect us even when we don\xe2\x80\x99t\nrealize it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama said as Mr. Pinckney\xe2\x80\x99s coffin, draped in a blanket\nof red roses, sat before him. \xe2\x80\x9cSo that we\xe2\x80\x99re guarding against not just\nracial slurs, but we\xe2\x80\x99re also guarding against the subtle impulse to call\nJohnny back for a job interview, but not Jamal. So that we search our\nhearts when we consider laws to make it harder for some of our fellow\ncitizens to vote.\xe2\x80\x9d By treating every child as important regardless of skin\ncolor and by opening up opportunities for all Americans, Mr. Obama said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe express God\xe2\x80\x99s grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAs the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first African-American president, Mr. Obama has often\nstruggled to find the proper balance of timing, words and place to speak\nabout America\xe2\x80\x99s racial divisions. Intent on being seen as a president for\nall and confronted with what he saw as the more urgent economic crisis, he\napproached racially charged disputes cautiously in his first term.\n\n\n\nBut politically unfettered after his re-election in 2012, and angered by\nthe racially motivated killings in Charleston and the deaths of black men\nat the hands of white police officers, the president on Friday dispensed\nwith his usual reticence, rediscovered the soaring rhetoric that inspired\nhis supporters in 2008, and spoke with unusual \xe2\x80\x94 and occasionally acerbic \xe2\x80\x94\ndirectness. \xe2\x80\x9cFor too long,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve been blind to the way\npast injustices continue to shape the present. Perhaps we see that now.\nPerhaps this tragedy causes us to ask some tough questions about how we can\npermit so many of our children to languish in poverty, or attend\ndilapidated schools, or grow up without prospects for a job or for a\ncareer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAs he spoke, Mr. Obama was backed by a stage filled with African Methodist\nEpiscopal preachers, cloaked in the purple vestments of their church, and a\nblack-robed gospel choir.\n\n\n\nMr. Obama joined with others paying tribute in stressing that the\n21-year-old white man charged in the killings had failed to achieve his\nstated goal of inciting racial conflagration. Rather, he said, the killings\nhad the opposite effect, generating an unprecedented show of racial unity\nand inspiring a nationwide revolt against Confederate symbols.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was an act that drew on a long history of bombs and arson and shots\nfired at churches,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama said, \xe2\x80\x9cnot random, but as a means of control,\na way to terrorize and oppress, an act that he imagined would incite fear\nand recrimination, violence and suspicion, an act that he presumed would\ndeepen divisions that trace back to our nation\xe2\x80\x99s original sin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe paused for effect. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, but God works in mysterious ways,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cGod has different ideas. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he was being used by God.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe crowd erupted in applause as women waved their hands toward the ceiling.\n\n\n\nMr. Obama commended South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Republican governor, Nikki R. Haley,\nfor her call this week to bring down the Confederate flag in Columbia,\nsaying it would be \xe2\x80\x9ca meaningful balm for so many unhealed wounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemoving the flag from this state\xe2\x80\x99s Capitol would not be an act of\npolitical correctness,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would not be an insult to the\nvalor of Confederate soldiers. It would simply be an acknowledgment that\nthe cause for which they fought \xe2\x80\x94 the cause of slavery \xe2\x80\x94 was wrong. The\nimposition of Jim Crow after the Civil War, the resistance to civil rights\nfor all people, was wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe service lasted more than four hours as speaker after speaker, first\nlegislators, then church leaders, then cousins and friends, and finally the\npresident, took the podium to pay homage to Mr. Pinckney, who was both a\nrespected state senator and a pastor in the most prestigious A.M.E. pulpit\nin South Carolina.\n\n\n\nTD Arena in Charleston, just steps from the historic whitewashed church\nwhere the killings took place on June 17 during a Wednesday night Bible\nstudy, was packed with pastors in their black robes and collars, women in\nflowered hats and parents eager to expose their children to a moment of\nhistory. An estimated 5,000 people were turned away because of a lack of\nspace. Members of Emanuel, where Mr. Pinckney had been pastor for five\nyears, were given prime seating on the arena floor.\n\n\n\nThe dignitaries in attendance included the first lady, Michelle Obama; Vice\nPresident Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden; House Speaker\nJohn A. Boehner, who traveled on Air Force One for the first time during\nthe Obama presidency; Ms. Haley; Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former\nsecretary of state and current Democratic presidential candidate; Senator\nTim Scott of South Carolina; Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. of Charleston;\ndozens of members of Congress and the South Carolina Legislature; and civil\nrights leaders like the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, the Rev. Al Sharpton, and\nMartin Luther King III.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSister Jennifer and the girls,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Goff said, addressing Mr. Pinckney\xe2\x80\x99s\nwife and two daughters, \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to know that the world has come to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAfter the service, the Obamas and the Bidens met with the families of those\nkilled as well as the survivors of the massacre.\n\n\n\nMr. Obama, who acknowledged that he did not know Mr. Pinckney well, said\nthat friends of the pastor\xe2\x80\x99s had remarked \xe2\x80\x9cthat when Clementa Pinckney\nentered a room, it was like the future arrived; that even from a young age,\nfolks knew he was special, anointed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhile the service centered on paeans to Mr. Pinckney, some speakers took\nthe opportunity to address the nature of his death and its remarkable\npolitical aftermath. \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone should have told the young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nRight Rev. John Richard Bryant, senior bishop of the A.M.E. church,\nreferring to the suspect in the killings, Dylann Roof. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wanted to start\na race war but he came to the wrong place.\xe2\x80\x9d The audience rose in a\nthunderous ovation, punctuated by an organist\xe2\x80\x99s wailing exclamations.\n\n\n\nA sign on an easel to the left of the stage declared: \xe2\x80\x9cWrong church! Wrong\npeople! Wrong day!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nState Senator Gerald Malloy, one of Mr. Pinckney\xe2\x80\x99s closest friends, spoke\nof Mr. Pinckney\xe2\x80\x99s support for often unsuccessful legislative efforts to\nexpand Medicaid coverage, regulate discriminatory lending practices and\nblock voter identification requirements. \xe2\x80\x9cHe answered life\xe2\x80\x99s most pervasive\nquestion, and that is what are you doing for others,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Malloy said.\n\n\n\nThe pastor\xe2\x80\x99s funeral was the third in a series of nine that is scheduled to\nconclude on Tuesday. Three others are planned for Saturday, one each on\nSunday, Monday and Tuesday.\n\n\n\nMr. Pinckney\xe2\x80\x99s burial in Marion, S.C., home to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s family,\nconcluded a three-day tour that took his coffin first to Columbia, where he\nlay in state beneath the State House rotunda, then to his simple childhood\nchurch in Ridgeland, S.C., and, on Thursday night, to Emanuel itself.\nThousands of dark-suited mourners waited in line for hours to walk through\nthe church, peer into Mr. Pinckney\xe2\x80\x99s open coffin and pay respects to his\ndevastated family.\n\n\n\nUshers handed out a glossy program filled with photographs of Mr. Pinckney,\nfrom childhood through his pastorate. In one, he was dressed in blue\nhospital scrubs holding one of his newborn daughters. Others showed him as\na boy, dressed in his uniform of a vested suit and necktie.\n\n\n\nThe program included letters to Mr. Pinckney from his family, their first\npublic comments since the shootings.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou promised me you would never leave me!\xe2\x80\x9d Jennifer Benjamin Pinckney\nwrote to her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cYou promised me we would be together for years to\ncome! You promised me we would watch our children grow, get married and\nhave children of their own. You promised me that we would grow old together\nand spend our latter years without the demands of the Church or the State.\nI feel robbed, cheated, and cut short.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Pinckney\xe2\x80\x99s eldest daughter, Eliana, 11, observed that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen someone\nloves you, they care even if they are not there.\xe2\x80\x9d Her sister, Malana, 6,\nwrote: \xe2\x80\x9cDear Daddy: I know you were shot at the Church and you went to\nHeaven. I love you so much! I know you love me and I know that you know\nthat I love you too.\xe2\x80\x9d She signed it, \xe2\x80\x9cYour baby girl and grasshopper.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Supreme Court rules gay couples nationwide have a right to marry\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gay-marriage-and-other-major-rulings-at-the-supreme-court/2015/06/25/ef75a120-1b6d-11e5-bd7f-4611a60dd8e5_story.html?tid=pm_politics_pop_b>\n// WaPo // Robert Barnes \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nA deeply divided Supreme Court on Friday delivered a historic victory for\ngay rights, ruling 5 to 4 that the Constitution requires that same-sex\ncouples be allowed to marry no matter where they live.\n\n\n\nThe court\xe2\x80\x99s action rewarded years of legal work by same-sex marriage\nadvocates and marked the culmination of an unprecedented upheaval in public\nopinion and the nation\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence.\n\n\n\nMarriages began Friday in states that had previously thwarted the efforts\nof same-sex couples to wed, while some states continued to resist what they\nsaid was a judicial order that changed the traditional definition of\nmarriage and sent the country into uncharted territory. As of the court\xe2\x80\x99s\ndecision Friday morning, there were 14 states where same-sex couples were\nnot allowed to marry.\n\n\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy, who has written all of the court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions\nrecognizing and expanding gay rights, said the decision was based on the\nfundamental right to marry and the equality that must be afforded gay\nAmericans.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the Constitution, same-sex couples seek in marriage the same legal\ntreatment as opposite-sex couples, and it would disparage their choices and\ndiminish their personhood to deny them this right,\xe2\x80\x9d Kennedy wrote. He was\njoined in the ruling by the court\xe2\x80\x99s liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg,\nStephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\n\n\n\nAll four of the court\xe2\x80\x99s most conservative members \xe2\x80\x94 Chief Justice John G.\nRoberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A.\nAlito Jr. \xe2\x80\x94 dissented, and each wrote a separate opinion.\n\n\n\nThe common theme in their dissents was that judicial activism on the part\nof five members of the court had usurped a power that belongs to the people.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are among the many Americans \xe2\x80\x94 of whatever sexual orientation \xe2\x80\x94 who\nfavor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today\xe2\x80\x99s\ndecision,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Roberts, who for the first time in his tenure marked his\ndisagreement with a decision by reading part of his dissent from the bench.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCelebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for\na new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of\nnew benefits. But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do\nwith it,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote.\n\n\n\nScalia called the decision a \xe2\x80\x9cthreat to American democracy,\xe2\x80\x9d saying it robs\ncitizens of \xe2\x80\x9cthe freedom to govern themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn a statement in the White House Rose Garden, President Obama hailed the\ndecision: \xe2\x80\x9cThis ruling is a victory for America. This decision affirms what\nmillions of Americans already believe in their hearts. When all Americans\nare truly treated as equal, we are more free.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until 2012 that Obama declared that same-sex couples should be\nable to marry, and it was only last year that he said he thought the\nConstitution provided such a right. But by Friday evening, the rainbow\ncolors that gay rights activists have adopted were projected onto the north\nface of the White House. With the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, Obama said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cToday we can say in no uncertain terms that we have made our union a\nlittle more perfect.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThere were wild scenes of celebrations on the sidewalk outside the Supreme\nCourt. Same-sex marriage supporters had arrived early, armed with signs and\nrainbow flags. They cheered at the announcement of a constitutional right\nfor gay marriage, which did not legally exist anywhere in the world until\nthe turn of this century. The first legally recognized same-sex marriages\nin the United States took place just 11 years ago, the result of a\nMassachusetts state supreme court decision.\n\n\n\nJim Obergefell, who became the face of the case, Obergefell v. Hodges, when\nhe sought to put his name on his husband\xe2\x80\x99s Ohio death certificate as the\nsurviving spouse, said, \xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x99s ruling from the Supreme Court affirms what\nmillions across the country already know to be true in our hearts: that our\nlove is equal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my hope that the term gay marriage will soon be a thing of the past,\nthat from this day forward it will be, simply, marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nBut Austin R. Nimocks, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a\ngroup that supports traditional marriage, said: \xe2\x80\x9cToday, five lawyers took\naway the voices of more than 300 million Americans to continue to debate\nthe most important social institution in the history of the world. . . .\nNobody has the right to say that a mom or a woman or a dad or a man is\nirrelevant. There are differences that should be celebrated.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court used cases from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee,\nwhere restrictions against same-sex marriage were upheld by an appeals\ncourt last year, to find that the Constitution does not allow such\nprohibitions.\n\n\n\nKennedy over the past 20 years has written the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s most\nimportant gay rights cases: overturning criminal laws on homosexual\nconduct, protecting gays from discrimination and declaring that the federal\ngovernment could not refuse to recognize same-sex marriages performed where\nthey were legal.\n\n\n\nHe often employs a lofty, \xc2\xadwriting-for-history tone, and Friday\xe2\x80\x99s decision\nwas no different.\n\n\n\nReferring to the couples who brought the cases before the court, Kennedy\nwrote: \xe2\x80\x9cIt would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect\nthe idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so\ndeeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is\nnot to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of\ncivilization\xe2\x80\x99s oldest institutions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nKennedy did not respond directly to the court\xe2\x80\x99s dissenters, but he\naddressed the argument that the court was creating a constitutional right.\nThe right to marriage is fundamental, he said. The difference is society\xe2\x80\x99s\nevolving view of gay people and their rights, he said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples may long have seemed\nnatural and just, but its inconsistency with the central meaning of the\nfundamental right to marry is now manifest,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cWith that knowledge\nmust come the recognition that laws excluding same-sex couples from the\nmarriage right impose stigma and injury of the kind prohibited by our basic\ncharter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAs in previous decisions, Kennedy did not spell out how courts should\nscrutinize laws that treated gays differently. But Mary Bonauto, who argued\nthe case for gay plaintiffs at the Supreme Court, said that message from\nKennedy\xe2\x80\x99s combined opinions \xe2\x80\x9cis one of inclusion: Stop making rules for gay\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nScalia was a sharp critic of Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s style, saying it was \xe2\x80\x9cas pretentious\nas its content is egotistic.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined\nlegal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms\nof the fortune cookie,\xe2\x80\x9d Scalia wrote.\n\n\n\nRoberts wrote a lengthy dissent that was a point-by-point takedown of the\nmajority opinion. Gay activists had wondered whether the 60-year-old\njustice might take note of the increasing public support for same-sex\nmarriage and find a way to join the majority on what they called the \xe2\x80\x9cright\nside of history.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut he and the other dissenters said the question was not whether same-sex\nmarriage was a good idea, but who should decide.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe court invalidates the marriage laws of more than half the states and\norders the transformation of a social institution that has formed the basis\nof human society for millennia, for the Kalahari Bushmen and the Han\nChinese, the Carthaginians and the Aztecs,\xe2\x80\x9d Roberts wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cJust who do we\nthink we are?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRoberts rejected a comparison to Loving v. Virginia, in which the court\nstruck down bans on interracial marriage. That did not change the age-old\ndefinition of marriage as between a man and a woman, he said. He raised\nconcerns that the decision could lead to polygamous marriages \xe2\x80\x94 he\nmentioned a married threesome of lesbians called a \xe2\x80\x9cthrouple.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe noted that voters and legislators in only 11 states had authorized\nsame-sex marriages, and said it was better for gay marriage to be adopted\nthrough the democratic process than by judicial order. He said religious\nleaders could take little comfort from the majority opinion that their\nbeliefs would be respected.\n\n\n\nThat theme was picked up by Alito in his dissent. He said there could be\n\xe2\x80\x9cbitter and lasting wounds\xe2\x80\x9d from the decision and warned that the decision\nwill be \xe2\x80\x9cexploited by those who are determined to stamp out every vestige\nof dissent.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe questions raised in the cases decided Friday were left unanswered in\n2013, when the justices last confronted the issue of same-sex marriage. A\nslim majority of the court said at the time that a key portion of the\nDefense of Marriage Act \xe2\x80\x94 withholding the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s recognition\nof same-sex marriages \xe2\x80\x94 was unconstitutional. In a separate case that year,\nthe court said procedural issues kept it from answering the constitutional\nquestion in a case from California but allowed same-sex marriages to resume\nin that state.\n\n\n\nSince then, courts across the nation \xe2\x80\x94 with the notable exception of the\nCincinnati-based federal appeals court that left intact the restrictions in\nthe four states at issue \xe2\x80\x94 have struck down a string of state prohibitions\non same-sex marriage, many of them passed by voters in referendums.\n\n\n\n*Gay marriage ruling was 50 years in the making \xe2\x80\x94 with important Texas ties\n<http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20150626-gay-marriage-ruling-was-50-years-in-the-making--with-important-texas-ties.ece>\n// Dallas News // Michael A. Lindenberger \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 In explaining his decision to require every state in America\nto allow gay couples to marry, Justice Anthony Kennedy said some things are\nsimply too important to be left to the hands of voters.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, the Constitution contemplates that democracy is the appropriate\nprocess for change, so long as that process does not abridge fundamental\nrights,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in his groundbreaking and deeply divisive majority\nopinion.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, Friday\xe2\x80\x99s history-making ruling was one the country largely got\nready for in less than half a century, thanks to a sometimes painful\nstruggle by gay and lesbian Americans.\n\n\n\nIn the summer of 1969, a small crowd of angry onlookers \xe2\x80\x94 drag queens and\npeople living on the streets among them \xe2\x80\x94 clashed with New York police as\nthey hauled people out of the Stonewall Inn and into waiting paddy wagons\nfor, essentially, the crime of being gay in a bar. What followed were\nseveral days of riots, hundreds of arrests, and the birth of the modern gay\nrights movement.\n\n\n\n>From Stonewall to the Supreme Court, there is a straight line showcasing\nthe rise of gay rights and the fading potency of the traditional,\nconservative moral authority that has warned, and still warns, that gay\nmarriage could mean society\xe2\x80\x99s undoing.\n\n\n\nThe line crosses through Texas in an important way. Justices, Kennedy said,\nhad often been cautious when dealing with advances in human rights to its\ncitizens, and those delays harmed the people affected in ways that weren\xe2\x80\x99t\nundone years later when other decisions changed the law. \xe2\x80\x9cDignitary wounds\ncannot always be healed with the stroke of a pen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe was in part referring to his own role 12 years ago, when he authored the\nLawrence vs. Texas ruling in which a six-person majority upended precedent\nand ruled that laws making gay sex illegal could not stand.\n\n\n\nGay marriage, of course, was illegal everywhere in America, and not a\nsingle national politician of either party had ever suggested there was\nanything wrong with that. Many gay rights advocates felt marriage, if it\nwere to ever come, was decades away.\n\n\n\nBut the Texas case was a fundamental turning point.\n\n\n\nAbout two hours past sunset on Sept. 17, 1998, the first night of the\nyear\xe2\x80\x99s longest heat wave, John Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s legal troubles began. An\nacquaintance was angry because he thought Lawrence was having an affair\nwith his lover, a younger man named Tyron Garner.\n\n\n\nShortly after 10:30 p.m., the acquaintance walked out of Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s\napartment and called the police to make a false report. In the flush of\njealousy, he told them an angry black man was waving a gun and shouting at\nthe neighbors.\n\n\n\nOfficers barged in minutes later, finding an undressed Lawrence in his bed,\nGarner sitting on a couch nearby and another man inside \xe2\x80\x94 but no gun.\n\n\n\nThey were arrested for violating Texas\xe2\x80\x99 law against having gay sex, taken\nto jail and released early the next morning. They\xe2\x80\x99d eventually be convicted\nand fined $200. (The man who made called about the gun was charged with\nmaking a false report.)\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn and Tyron were just regular guys who wound up being arrested and\ncharged with homosexual conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d said lawyer Suzanne Goldberg, a Columbia\nlaw professor who in 1998 was a lawyer for Lambda Legal Defense Fund who\nhelped represent the pair.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would mean coming out publicly to the people they worked with and to\ntheir families,\xe2\x80\x9d Goldberg said. \xe2\x80\x9cNeither had planned on taking the case to\nthe U.S. Supreme Court. But they both understood the important potential of\ntheir case, and they were courageous in deciding to pursue it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that they expected, that any of us expected, then that their\npictures would end being splashed around the globe.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhat made the case worth fighting for gay legal activists was the\ntremendous power the relatively minor \xe2\x80\x94 and often unenforced \xe2\x80\x94 statutes\nagainst gay sex carried in other areas of gay life.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn states like Texas that had these sodomy laws on the books, there was a\nvery strong barrier to being out,\xe2\x80\x9d recalled Washington lawyer Paul Smith,\nwho would argue successfully Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s case before the Supreme Court in\n2003. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you were an out person you could lose your jobs, custody of your\nkids, and people could refuse to rent to same-sex couples \xe2\x80\x94 all on the\nbasis that admitting you were gay was basically admitting that you were a\ncriminal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nString of cases\n\n\n\nBut as for gay marriage, in 1998 it was still illegal everywhere.\n\n\n\nA string of cases brought by couples who were denied licenses had entered\nthe courts in the years immediately after the Stonewall Inn riots, as new\norganizations such as the Gay Liberation Front began to slowly move gay\nadvocacy out of the shadows. Cases were filed \xe2\x80\x94 and lost \xe2\x80\x94 in Kentucky,\nMinnesota and elsewhere.\n\n\n\nIn Texas, a couple was granted a marriage license only to face an immediate\nbacklash \xe2\x80\x94 including threats of prosecution \xe2\x80\x94 once officials learned that\nthe blushing bride had been a gay man in drag. The license wasn\xe2\x80\x99t honored.\n\n\n\nOnly one of the cases, involving a Minneapolis couple, reached the Supreme\nCourt, in 1972. The justices heard no arguments and dispensed with it in a\nsingle sentence.\n\n\n\nBut five years before Lawrence and Garner were arrested, Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s top court\nopened the door to gay marriage by a crack. In 1993, the Hawaii Supreme\nCourt sent a case brought by a gay couple back to the trial court with new\ninstructions: For the first time, the state would have to prove that its\ndenial of a marriage license to a gay couple could be justified.\n\n\n\nState and federal officials had rushed to slam shut that possibility.\n\n\n\nIn 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the widely popular Defense of\nMarriage Act, making it illegal for the federal government to treat gay\ncouples as married, whether or not Hawaii or another state issued them a\nlicense. The law also meant that no state would have to recognize a gay\nmarriage performed in another state.\n\n\n\nTwo years later, Hawaiians voted to bar gay marriage, rendering moot the\nongoing trial from 1993. Voters in Alaska followed suit the same year.\n\n\n\nBut the people who were thinking most about the issue were the same ones\nwho were fighting hardest to keep laws like the Texas anti-sodomy statute\non the books.\n\n\n\nThat connection had been on the minds of the lawyers and the justices the\nfirst time the Supreme Court confronted the question of gay sex laws, in a\n1986 Georgia case.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis court will quite soon be confronted with questions concerning the\nlegitimacy of statutes which prohibit polygamy, homosexual same-sex\nmarriage, consensual incest, prostitution, fornication, adultery\xe2\x80\x9d and other\nhorrors if it decriminalizes gay sex, warned the lawyer for Georgia.\n\n\n\nThe justices were persuaded.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRespondent would have us announce \xe2\x80\xa6 a fundamental right to engage in\nhomosexual sodomy. This we are quite unwilling to do,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Byron White\nwrote in his 5-4 majority opinion.\n\n\n\nScalia\xe2\x80\x99s dissent\n\n\n\nSeventeen years later, the court changed its mind, and ruled in favor of\nLawrence and Garner. That sent Justice Antonin Scalia fuming. He read his\nscathing dissent word for word from the bench.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is clear from this that the court has taken sides in the culture war,\ndeparting from its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the\ndemocratic rules of engagement are observed,\xe2\x80\x9d Scalia said. \xe2\x80\x9cMany Americans\ndo not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in\ntheir business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s schools, or as boarders in their home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nEchoing lawyer Hobbs from 17 year before, he said the arrival at the court\nof arguments for gay marriage would only be a matter of time.\n\n\n\nHe was no less disgusted on Friday, when he wrote that the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision\namounted to tyranny. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not of special importance to me what the law\nsays about marriage. It is of overwhelming importance, however, who it is\nthat rules me. Today\xe2\x80\x99s decree says that my Ruler, and the Ruler of 320\nmillion Americans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the\nSupreme Court.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhatever one thinks of Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s rhetorical bursts, it\xe2\x80\x99s only fair to note\nthis about his 2003 predictions: He was absolutely right.\n\n\n\nThe first federal court decision making gay marriage legal came just months\nlater, in Massachusetts. The first page of the opinion cited the ruling in\nLawrence vs. Texas.\n\n\n\nSmaller changes\n\n\n\nBut what counted most, many scholars and some of the strongest opponents of\ngay marriage say, were the smaller, incremental changes in the way\nAmericans looked at homosexuality and other moral issues.\n\n\n\nDid the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 ruling in favor of gay marriage\npave the way for Californians to marry? It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say. Within months,\nvoters in the overwhelmingly Democratic state went to the polls to change\nthe state\xe2\x80\x99s constitution and bar same-sex marriages.\n\n\n\nBut the backlash triggered a response of its own. Hollywood icon Rob Reiner\nopened his check book, and his Rolodex, and bankrolled what would become\nFreedom to Marry, a national movement founded by activist Evan Wolfson.\nSlowly but surely the idea of gay marriage was being discussed everywhere.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was both the reality and perception of dramatic moral change on part\nof the American people,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rev. Albert Mohler, president of the\nSouthern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could see it\neven as the Fortune 500 companies saw that it was in their interests to\njoin that moral revolution in their advertising.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBy 2013, when the Supreme Court struck down part of the Defense of Marriage\nAct, conservatives were resigning themselves to defeat.\n\n\n\nHarvard professor Michael Klarman, who has studied the link between\njudicial decisions and broad social change, said even the biggest court\nrulings are rarely the most important elements of that change.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThinking that those discrete landmark-seeming events are really driving\nanything long-term is, I think, a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Smaller, step-by-step\nchanges in the way people see each other, the way individuals feel about\ngays in general, had much greater impact over time.\n\n\n\nGay people finally feeling free to come out, he said, is what made the\nbiggest difference.\n\n\n\nTheodore Olson doesn\xe2\x80\x99t disagree. The former top U.S. appellate lawyer under\nPresident George W. Bush, he joined with Demcoratic super-lawyer David\nBoies to sue California to force its hand on gay marriage.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was discrimination everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, it is not all\ngone. But the atmosphere has totally changed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nProof of that came just hours after the court announced its decision.\nStanding in the Rose Garden, President Barack Obama said the decision\narrived with the force of a thunderbolt, but grew out of decades of\nstruggle.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a consequence of the countless small acts of courage of millions of\npeople across decades who stood up, who came out, talked to parents,\nparents who loved their children no matter what, folks who were willing to\nendure bullying and taunts, and stayed strong, and came to believe in\nthemselves and who they were.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd slowly made an entire country realize that love is love.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n*INTERNATIONAL*\n\n\n\n*Terrorist Attacks in France, Tunisia and Kuwait Kill Dozens\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/world/middleeast/terror-attacks-france-tunisia-kuwait.html?ref=world>\n// NYT // Ben Hubbard \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nBEIRUT, Lebanon \xe2\x80\x94 In a matter of hours and on three different continents,\nmilitants carried out attacks on Friday that killed scores of civilians,\nhorrified populations and raised thorny questions about the evolving nature\nof international terrorism and what can be done to fight it.\n\n\n\nOn the surface, the attacks appeared to be linked only by timing.\n\n\n\nIn France, a man stormed an American-owned chemical plant, decapitated one\nperson and apparently tried to blow up the facility. In Tunisia, a gunman\ndrew an assault rifle from a beach umbrella and killed at least 38 people\nat a seaside resort. And in Kuwait, a suicide bomber blew himself up inside\na mosque during communal prayers, killing at least 25 Shiite worshipers.\n\n\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attacks in Tunisia\nand Kuwait, according to statements on Twitter. But it almost did not\nmatter for terrorism\xe2\x80\x99s global implications whether the three attacks were\ncoordinated. Each in a different way underlined the difficulties of\nanticipating threats and protecting civilians from small-scale terrorist\nactions, whether in a mosque, at work or at the beach.\n\n\n\nThe attacks occurred at a time of fast evolution for the world\xe2\x80\x99s most\ndangerous terrorist organizations, which continue to find ways to strike\nand spread their ideology despite more than a decade of costly efforts by\nthe United States and others to kill their leaders and deny them sanctuary.\n\n\n\nThe United States has killed leaders of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, Yemen and\nelsewhere, but the group has maintained a string of branches and melded\nitself into local insurgencies. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or\nISIL, has worked on two levels, seeking to build its self-declared\ncaliphate on captured territory in Iraq and Syria while inciting attacks\nabroad.\n\n\n\nFueling that expansion are civil wars and the collapse of state structures\nin Arab countries from Libya to Yemen that have opened up ungoverned spaces\nwhere jihadists thrive, while social media has given extremists a global\nmegaphone to spread their message.\n\n\n\nWhile officials in the three countries investigated the attacks, many noted\nthat leaders of the Islamic State have repeatedly called for sympathizers\nto kill and sow mayhem at home.\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, the spokesman for the Islamic State, Abu Mohammed\nal-Adnani, greeted the group\xe2\x80\x99s followers for Ramadan, telling them that\nacts during the Muslim holy month earned greater rewards in heaven.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuslims, embark and hasten toward jihad,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Adnani said in an audio\nmessage. \xe2\x80\x9cO mujahedeen everywhere, rush and go to make Ramadan a month of\ndisasters for the infidels.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe attacks targeted each country in a particularly sensitive spot.\n\n\n\nTunisia, widely hailed as the sole success of the Arab Spring uprisings\nthat began more than four years ago, suffered a sharp blow to its tourism\nsector, a pillar of the local economy.\n\n\n\nThe bombing in Kuwait followed the pattern of similar attacks on Shiite\nmosques in Saudi Arabia and was aimed at sowing sectarian divisions in a\ncountry where Sunnis and Shiites serve together in top government bodies\nand open friction between the sects is uncommon.\n\n\n\nThe motivation behind the attack in France was less clear, although the\nbeheading suggested that the perpetrator had at least been inspired by the\nIslamic State, which frequently propagandizes similar killings in the\nterritories it occupies.\n\n\n\nAnd because the day\xe2\x80\x99s events appeared to bear some of the infamous\nhallmarks of the Islamic State and its supporters, some analysts speculated\nthat the attacks had been timed to mark the first anniversary of its\ndeclaration of a caliphate. Even if that is not the case, the SITE\nintelligence Group, which tracks extremist propaganda, said the attacks\ninspired \xe2\x80\x9ccelebration from Twitter accounts of Jihadi fighters and\nsupporters of the Islamic State.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nLina Khatib, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, said\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have entered a new jihadist era,\xe2\x80\x9d adding that the Islamic State had\nused its international brand to establish sleeper cells abroad, whose\nactions were meant to advance its efforts to build a state.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything in the end serves the purpose of strengthening the project of\nthe Islamic State,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nUnited States intelligence and counterterrorism officials were scrambling\nFriday to assess the connections, if any, between the attacks in France,\nKuwait and Tunisia. Officials said that if the assessment found that the\nattacks were linked, officials would seek to determine whether the Islamic\nState had actively directed, coordinated or inspired them.\n\n\n\nCol. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, condemned the attacks, which he\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cheinous.\xe2\x80\x9d But there was no word yet on whether they were\ncoordinated, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe just don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn claiming the Kuwait attack, the Islamic State called the suicide bomber\n\xe2\x80\x9cone of the knights of the Sunni people\xe2\x80\x9d and lauded him for killing\nShiites, who are considered apostates in the group\xe2\x80\x99s hard interpretation of\nIslam.\n\n\n\nThe assault resembled others launched by the Islamic State recently on\nShiite mosques in neighboring Saudi Arabia, prompting many to believe that\nthe militant group is seeking to set off a sectarian war between Sunnis and\nShiites.\n\n\n\nSome Kuwaitis said that with sectarian tensions rising across the region,\nit was only a matter of time before they reached Kuwait.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver since I heard about Qatif and the Shiite mosques there, I just had\nthis feeling that we were next,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bodour Behbehani, a Shiite graduate\nstudent in Kuwait City, recalling a mosque bombing last month near Qatif, a\ncity in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\nThe American war on terrorism has taken many forms over the years. But the\nspread of such small-scale attacks highlighted what even American officials\nhave called a failure to win the ideological \xe2\x80\x94 or information \xe2\x80\x94 war that\nfeeds militancy and inspires recruits.\n\n\n\nThe challenge, analysts and government officials say, is to reorient a\nstrategy centered on combat to one that challenges extremist groups on all\nfronts simultaneously: political, social, ideological and religious. A\nprimary aim, they say, should be to win the information war and undermine\nthe appeal of radical Islamist ideologies.\n\n\n\nSuch terrorist attacks have shattered the assumption that the Islamic State\ncan be confined to territories it controls in the Middle East, said Bruce\nHoffman, director of the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown\nUniversity. Although Western governments can work to monitor those who\nmight be plotting attacks, this will not solve their root cause.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cChasing individuals is probably a fool\xe2\x80\x99s errand given the geographically\ndisparate nature of the threat,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Hoffman said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere comes a point\nwhere you have to tackle the organization behind it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd monitoring has limits. The authorities in Tunisia said the gunman there\nwas a young Tunisian with no prior police record. The authorities in France\nsaid that the attacker arrested there had connections to radical Islamists\nbut that surveillance of him stopped in 2008.\n\n\n\nThe Kuwaiti authorities did not identify the attacker in their country.\n\n\n\nTo fight the Islamic State, the United States has formed an international\ncoalition that is bombing its fighters and their bases in Iraq and Syria, a\nprocess that President Obama has said seeks to degrade and destroy the\ngroup. But while the group has lost many fighters and some territory,\nFriday\xe2\x80\x99s attacks demonstrated the continued power of the jihadist movement\nto inspire attacks abroad by local actors.\n\n\n\nIt is an extraordinary coincidence that \xe2\x80\x9call three attacks happened at the\nsame day and time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brian Fishman, a counterterrorism research fellow\nat New America, a research organization in Washington. He said the attacks\nsuggested that the focus on taking territory from the Islamic State could\nmake the United States miss other ways it poses dangers.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t get attached to a single metric for understanding this\norganization,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\n*ISIS claims to be behind deadly Tunisia attack\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/> // WaPo // Liz Sly \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nBEIRUT \xe2\x80\x94 Assailants beheaded, bombed and gunned down victims on three\ncontinents Friday, killing more than 60 people and raising fears that a\nglobal surge of terror strikes could be imminent.\n\n\n\nThere was initially no reason to believe the disparate attacks \xe2\x80\x94 at a\nfactory in France, a beach resort in Tunisia and a mosque in Kuwait \xe2\x80\x94 were\nconnected.\n\n\n\nBut then the Islamic State asserted responsibility for two of them, first\nthe bombing in Kuwait in which 25 died and later, in a separate statement,\nthe assault on the beach in Tunisia, which killed 39.\n\n\n\nThe second statement contained a warning that more attacks soon will\nfollow: \xe2\x80\x9cLet them wait for the glad tidings of what will harm them in the\ncoming days, Allah permitting,\xe2\x80\x9d it said, referring to the \xe2\x80\x9capostates\xe2\x80\x9d who\nhad been the target of the assault.\n\n\n\nThe three incidents followed an appeal Tuesday from the Islamic State\xe2\x80\x99s\nspokesman, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, for Muslims to mark the holy month of\nRamadan by carrying out acts of \xe2\x80\x9cjihad,\xe2\x80\x9d or holy war.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake Ramadan a month of disasters for the kuffar,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning infidels, he\nsaid in the audiotaped address. He promised followers \xe2\x80\x9ctenfold\xe2\x80\x9d rewards in\nheaven if they died in such acts during the holy period, associated by most\nMuslims with fasting, prayer and peaceful reflection.\n\n\n\nThe attacks suggested that some may have heeded his words.\n\n\n\nAbout 9:30 a.m. in the quaint town of Saint-Quentin-Fallavier in southern\nFrance, a deliveryman crashed a vehicle into a shed containing gas\ncylinders at an American-owned factory, causing an explosion. After the\ndriver was caught by firefighters, police found a severed head on the\nfactory fence flanked by two flags bearing Arabic inscriptions.\n\n\n\nMinutes later and 3,000 miles away, a man wearing a suicide belt walked\ninto a Shiite mosque in Kuwait City and detonated his explosives among\nworshipers gathered for Friday prayers, killing 25.\n\n\n\nTwo hours passed before at least one gunman burst into a Mediterranean\nbeach resort in the Tunisian town of Sousse and randomly opened fire on\nbathers lounging under beach umbrellas, killing 39.\n\n\n\nThe Islamic State asserted responsibility for the attack in Kuwait, saying\nin a statement circulated on social media accounts that one of its members,\nAbu Suleiman al-Mowahid, targeted the mosque because it had been used to\ntry to convert Sunni Muslims to the Shiite branch of Islam.\n\n\n\nIt was too early to say whether the Islamic State was connected to the\nFrench attack or whether the strike was conducted on behalf of the Islamic\nState or was inspired by its propaganda. A Pentagon spokesman, Col. Steve\nWarren, said U.S. officials are investigating possible links.\n\n\n\nBut the timing and geographical scope of the violent acts appeared likely\nto play into the Islamic State\xe2\x80\x99s narrative that it is posing an\never-greater threat to global security, analysts said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor ISIS, terror is a strategy, a way to keep conveying a sense of\nexpansion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emile Hokayem, an analyst with the London-based\nInternational Institute for Strategic Studies, using an acronym for the\nextremist group. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not a movement that\xe2\x80\x99s on its last legs. It\xe2\x80\x99s\nstill there, seeking to impose and shape the agenda and be at the center of\nthe conversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn France, the gruesome killing caused jitters in a country still reeling\nfrom the Charlie Hebdo slayings in January, in which two gunmen mowed down\nstaffers at a satirical newspaper in Paris.\n\n\n\nFrench prosecutor Fran\xc3\xa7ois Molins said at a news conference that the man\ndetained in Friday\xe2\x80\x99s attack, identified as Yassin Salhi, 35, had\nperiodically drawn the attention of French intelligence services between\n2011 and 2014 because of his links with ultraconservative Muslims, known as\nSalafists, in Lyon. Security services had filed reports between 2006 and\n2008 on the man\xe2\x80\x99s radicalization, he said.\n\n\n\nThe victim found beheaded at the factory was the 54-year-old manager of the\ntransportation firm that employed Salhi, the prosecutor said. In addition\nto the beheading, there were also two injuries in the explosion at the\nfactory operated by Air Products, a global gas and chemical company based\nin Allentown, Pa.\n\n\n\nFrench President Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande called it \xe2\x80\x9ca pure terrorist attack,\nespecially inasmuch as a corpse has been found, decapitated with a message.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe summoned security chiefs and placed security agencies in southeastern\nFrance on a state of high alert.\n\n\n\nTunisia also was still reeling from a recent terrorist attack \xe2\x80\x94 the assault\nby gunmen in March at the Bardo museum in the capital, Tunis, in which 22\npeople died. The bloodshed on the beach in Sousse is expected to further\ndent the North African country\xe2\x80\x99s vital tourism industry.\n\n\n\nWitnesses described scenes of chaos as a gunman opened fire with an\nautomatic rifle, sending sunbathers scrambling for cover amid beach\numbrellas and sun beds. Tunisian authorities said the assailant was killed,\nand it was unclear whether more than one attacker was involved.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA state of panic,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tunisian journalist Moez Ben Gharbiya, describing\nthe scene from the seaside town, a popular spot for European tourists about\n90 miles south of Tunis.\n\n\n\nThe bombing in Kuwait fit a recent pattern in which the Islamic State has\nbeen targeting Shiite mosques in Saudi Arabia and Yemen.\n\n\n\nThe tactic echoes the way in which an earlier iteration of the group\nprovoked sectarian strife in Iraq by relentlessly bombing Shiite mosques,\nand this appears to be the goal now, Hokayem said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy going after Shiites in Saudi and Kuwait, ISIS is playing a\nsophisticated game where it thrives off of existing sectarianism in the\nSunni world,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nKuwaitis, however, rallied behind the Shiites, a small but widely accepted\nminority in the tiny nation. The country\xe2\x80\x99s emir immediately visited the\nmosque, and Kuwaitis lined up to donate blood to the injured, who numbered\nmore than 200, according to media reports in Kuwait.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis criminal act on one of the houses of God is a desperate and wicked\nattempt to divide the unity of the Kuwaiti people, and it comes amid\nthreats faced by the entire region,\xe2\x80\x9d said Crown Prince Nawaf al-Ahmad\nal-Jaber al-Sabah in a statement on Kuwaiti state television.\n\n\n\nWorld leaders elsewhere denounced the attacks.\n\n\n\nThe United States \xe2\x80\x9ccondemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks\xe2\x80\x9d\nin the three countries, a White House statement said.\n\n\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted that he was \xe2\x80\x9csickened by the\nattacks in Tunisia, France and Kuwait,\xe2\x80\x9d and he summoned an emergency\nmeeting of his security chiefs to assess the heightened threat.\n\n\n\n*OPINIONS/EDITORIALS/BLOGS*\n\n\n\n*Clinton acts on racial justice\n<http://qctimes.com/news/opinion/mailbag/clinton-acts-on-racial-justice/article_b5255867-34a7-5d8c-bcc0-019a992f5323.html>\n// Quad-City Times // Rep. Phyllis Thede \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t a soul in America who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t shocked by the massacre that\noccurred last week in Charleston.\n\n\n\nYet again, a young man looking to do harm was able to acquire a gun and we\nmust face how as a nation we continue to tolerate these mass shootings\nwithout acting. But last week\xe2\x80\x99s massacre also highlighted a topic that is\ntoo often overlooked and swept under the rug \xe2\x80\x93 the deep racist sentiments\nthat persist in pockets of our society.\n\n\n\nOver this past week, Hillary Clinton has consistently and persistently\nbrought to the forefront a much-needed dialog about race.\n\n\n\nIt is all too easy for us to dismiss the murderer in South Carolina as\ncrazy or fringe. As Clinton said this week, \xe2\x80\x9cour problem is not all kooks\nand Klansman. It\'s also in the cruel joke that goes unchallenged. It\'s in\nthe off-hand comments about not wanting \xe2\x80\x98those people\xe2\x80\x99 in the neighborhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn Iowa, we know that racial disparities still exist. Iowa has the second\nhighest percentage of incarceration of African Americans in the country\nwith African American males making up 26 percent of the prison population\ndespite only comprising about 3 percent of the state\xe2\x80\x99s population. In 2010\nit was reported that three in four white Iowans own a home, which can only\nbe said for three in every 10 black families. In education, 16 percent of\nblack Iowans graduated college compared to 25 percent of white Iowans in\n2010.\n\n\n\nScripture tells us that there is a time to keep silent and a time to speak\nout, a time break down and a time to build up. Now is the time to speak out\nand to build up. I applaud Hillary Clinton for bringing these issues to the\nforefront, and wholeheartedly believe she will help build a safer, more\ntolerant, and inclusive country.\n\n\n\n*MISCELLANEOUS ADDED BY STAFF*\n\n\n\n*12 Winning Brand Tweets After the Supreme Court\'s Ruling on Same-Sex\nMarriage\n<http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/12-winning-brand-tweets-after-supreme-courts-ruling-same-sex-marriage-165600>\n// Adweek // Lauren Johnon \xe2\x80\x93 June 26, 2015*\n\n\n\nWhen the Supreme Court ruled this morning to legalize same-sex marriage in\nall states, many marketers expectedly took to Twitter to celebrate.\n\n\n\nBrands like Mastercard, Target and Ben & Jerry\'s were prepared for today\'s\nnews with videos and photos that were ready to tweet, while others like\nYouTube seemed to whip up tweets on the fly.
