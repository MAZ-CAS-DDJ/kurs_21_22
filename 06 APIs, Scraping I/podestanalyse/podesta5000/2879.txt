I know that Americans are anxious and\n>>>>>>>> fearful, and we have reason to be.  The threat is real.  The need for\n>>>>>>>> action is urgent.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> Our intelligence and law enforcement agencies will continue\n>>>>>>>> learning about what led to the massacre in San Bernardino just as French\n>>>>>>>> and Belgian authorities are doing so in Paris and Brussels.  But this much\n>>>>>>>> we do know: The threat from radical jihadism has metastasized and become\n>>>>>>>> more complex and challenging.  We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the results of radicalization\n>>>>>>>> not just in far-off lands but right here at home fueled by the internet.\n>>>>>>>> It\xe2\x80\x99s the nexus of terrorism and technology, and we have a lot of work to do\n>>>>>>>> to end it.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> As hard as this is, Americans now have to move from fear to\n>>>>>>>> resolve.  America has beaten bigger threats before, and we will defeat this\n>>>>>>>> one as well.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> Resolve means depriving jihadists of virtual territory just as we\n>>>>>>>> work to deprive them of actual territory.  They are using websites, social\n>>>>>>>> media, chat rooms, and other platforms to celebrate beheadings, recruit\n>>>>>>>> future terrorists, and call for attacks.  We should work with host\n>>>>>>>> companies to shut them down. It\xe2\x80\x99s time for an urgent dialogue between the\n>>>>>>>> government, and not just our government \xe2\x80\x93 government and the high-tech\n>>>>>>>> community to confront this problem together.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> Resolve means supporting also our first responders, like the\n>>>>>>>> officer in San Bernardino who said he would take a bullet for the civilians\n>>>>>>>> he was rescuing.  We owe them our support and gratitude and whatever help\n>>>>>>>> they need.  Local law enforcement should get the support, training, and\n>>>>>>>> coordination they need in their communities from counterterrorism experts\n>>>>>>>> in Washington.  It also means taking a close look at safeguards in visa\n>>>>>>>> programs and working more effectively with our European allies on\n>>>>>>>> intelligence and information sharing.  And yes, Congress must act to ensure\n>>>>>>>> that no one who is a suspected terrorist can buy guns anywhere in America.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> Resolve means going after the threat at its source in Iraq and\n>>>>>>>> Syria and beyond.  Our goal must not be to deter or contain ISIS; our goal\n>>>>>>>> must be to defeat ISIS.  And I have put forth a three-prong plan to do that.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> First, deny ISIS territory in Iraq and Syria by leading an\n>>>>>>>> intensified air campaign and working with local and regional forces on the\n>>>>>>>> ground.  Second, dismantle the global infrastructure of terror, the\n>>>>>>>> networks that supply radical jihadists with money, weapons, and fighters,\n>>>>>>>> and stop them from recruiting and inspiring.  And third, toughen our\n>>>>>>>> defenses at home and those of our partners against external and homegrown\n>>>>>>>> threats.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> An effective fight on the ground against ISIS is essential, but\n>>>>>>>> that does not mean deploying tens of thousands of American combat troops.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> It does mean stepping up efforts to get more Arabs and Kurdish\n>>>>>>>> fighters into the fight against ISIS on both sides of the Iraq-Syrian\n>>>>>>>> border, supporting the Iraqi Security Forces while pressuring Baghdad to\n>>>>>>>> pursue a more inclusive and effective approach, and immediately deploying\n>>>>>>>> the Special Operations Forces that President Obama has already authorized\n>>>>>>>> with more to follow as more Syrians get into the fight.  We also have to\n>>>>>>>> demand that our Arab and Turkish partners carry their share of the burden\n>>>>>>>> with military, financial, and diplomatic contributions.  We will do our\n>>>>>>>> part, but it\xe2\x80\x99s their fight too, and they need to act like it is.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> Dealing with the conflict in Syria with respect to Assad is central\n>>>>>>>> to this whole effort.  We need to continue Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to\n>>>>>>>> move toward a diplomatic solution to the civil war in Syria that paves the\n>>>>>>>> way for new leadership and enables Syrians from every community to take on\n>>>>>>>> ISIS. Investing the Russians in this outcome and getting them to step up\n>>>>>>>> and do their part will be difficult but essential.  And we have to pursue a\n>>>>>>>> transition away from Assad and an intensified fight against ISIS\n>>>>>>>> simultaneously.  We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get Syrian opposition forces to fight\n>>>>>>>> ISIS in earnest without the credible prospect of a transition, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\n>>>>>>>> going to take more pressure and leverage.  It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons why I\n>>>>>>>> have proposed creating a no-fly zone as well as safe havens and more robust\n>>>>>>>> support for opposition forces.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> And finally, it\xe2\x80\x99s crucial that we embed our mission to defeat ISIS\n>>>>>>>> within a broader struggle against radical jihadism.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> Extremist groups like ISIS feed off instability and conflict, and\n>>>>>>>> there is no shortage of that in the Middle East today.  Decades of\n>>>>>>>> repression, poverty, corruption, a lack of pluralism and tolerance turn the\n>>>>>>>> region into a powder keg.  That\xe2\x80\x99s why we have to keep working with our\n>>>>>>>> friends and partners to support economic and political modernization; train\n>>>>>>>> effective and accountable local intelligence, law enforcement, and\n>>>>>>>> counterterrorism services.  And once and for all, the Saudis, the Qataris,\n>>>>>>>> the Kuwaitis, and others must stop their citizens from funding extremist\n>>>>>>>> organizations and stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the\n>>>>>>>> world that have set too many young people on a path toward extremism.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> So across the board, we must act with courage and clarity.  And\n>>>>>>>> it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remind ourselves that Islam itself is not our adversary.\n>>>>>>>> This is not and we should not let it become a clash of civilizations.  It\n>>>>>>>> is a clash between hate and hope -- and the vast majority of Muslims are on\n>>>>>>>> our side of the battle unless we drive them away.  We can\xe2\x80\x99t buy into the\n>>>>>>>> very narrative that radical jihadists use to recruit new followers or\n>>>>>>>> alienate partners we want and need at home and abroad with reckless\n>>>>>>>> rhetoric.  Declaring war on Islam or demonizing the Muslim American\n>>>>>>>> community is not only counter to our values; it plays right into the hands\n>>>>>>>> of terrorists.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> Muslim Americans are our neighbors, our co-workers, loved ones,\n>>>>>>>> friends.  Many are working every day all over our country to prevent\n>>>>>>>> radicalization.  We should be supporting them, not scapegoating them.  But,\n>>>>>>>> at the same time, none of us can close our eyes to the fact that we do face\n>>>>>>>> enemies who use Islam to justify slaughtering innocent people.  We have to\n>>>>>>>> stop them and we will.  Radical jihadists, like so many adversaries in our\n>>>>>>>> history, underestimate the strength of our national character.  Americans\n>>>>>>>> will not cower or cave, and we will not turn on each other or turn on our\n>>>>>>>> principles.  We will defeat those who threaten us.  We will keep our\n>>>>>>>> country safe and strong, free and tolerant.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> ###\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>\n>>>>>\n>>>>\n>>>\n>>\n>\n'
