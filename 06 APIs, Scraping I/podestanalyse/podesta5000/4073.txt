Kathleen Sebelius endorsed Monday the candidacy of\nprevious U.S. Secretary of State and U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton for the\nDemocratic Party\'s nomination for president.\n\nSebelius, a Democrat who served with Clinton in the administration of\nPresident Barack Obama, said Clinton possessed knowledge and qualities\nrequired of the federal government\'s chief executive. Clinton\'s primary\nopponent is U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont.\n\n"I just feel that she\'s the only person, frankly, in the field of\ncandidates who has the experience and background that prepares her\nnationally and internationally to be the leader of the country," she said\nin an interview with the Topeka Capital-Journal.\n\n"As a mother, a grandmother and a former public servant, who had the\nprivilege of serving with Hillary in the president\'s Cabinet, I can think\nof nothing more important than ensuring our next president is someone who\nwill protect and build upon the progress made by President Obama over the\npast eight years," Sebelius said.\n\nOn March 5, Kansas Republicans and Democrats will caucus separately at\ndozens of sites across the state to determine the state\'s presidential\npreferences.\n\nSebelius said Clinton stood apart from others in the field for her\ndedication to fighting on behalf of women, families and children.\n\n"Hillary believes women\xe2\x80\x99s issues are family issues, economic issues, and\ncrucial to our future competitiveness, and she has demonstrated time and\nagain in this campaign that she is the one candidate with the plans and\nexperience to deliver real results for Kansans and Americans as president,"\nSebelius said.\n\nSebelius was secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\nfrom 2009 to 2014. She was Kansas governor from 2003 to 2009, the state\'s\ninsurance commissioner from 1995 to 2003 and a Topeka representative in the\nKansas House from 1987 to 1995.\n\nLast week, Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, a Republican, endorsed the nomination\nof U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, of Florida, from among candidates in a crowded\nGOP field.\n\n-- \n---\nGavin Young\n785-633-0560\nKansas Press Secretary\nHillary For America\n'
