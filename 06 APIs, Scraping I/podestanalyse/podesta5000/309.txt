One of the most valuable biotech\nstocks in the Standard & Poor\'s 500, Biotech (BIIB) is down 4.3% to\n$301.03. And trouble in biotechs - one of the hottest corners of Wall\nStreet - is bleeding over to the rest of the market. The Nasdaq Composite\nIndex, which contains many biotech stocks, is down 0.1%.\n\nWhat did Clinton say that has investors so worried? "Price gouging like\nthis in the specialty drug market is outrageous. Tomorrow I\'ll lay out oa\nplan to take it on," Clinton wrote on Twitter\n<https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton>. Her comments are in response to a\nweekend story on from the New York Times talking about the 5,456% increase\nof a 62-year-old drug called Daraprim, after its parent company, Turing\nPharmaceuticals, was bought by a former hedge-fund manager. The article\npoints out that these rapid price hikes are common with many "specialty\ndrugs."\n\nPromises of price controls put the fear into investors - who dread\ngovernment moves to regulate the industry. And that\'s why just a few words\nfrom a presidential candidate can spell trouble.\n\nHARDEST HIT BIOTECH STOCKS IN S&P 500 MONDAY\n\nCompany, Symbol, % Ch.
