john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi John!  So happy to see the endorsements from Iowa, NH, Boston Globe.  \n\n \n\nRodney Slater used to always say, "The best is yet to come" when he\nencouraged people to get involved and engaged in an initiative.\n\n \n\nI think it is a positive message and a simple one that could work for\nHillary and it\'s a message from which many other messages can flow.\n\n \n\nOur best days are ahead, if we work together.\n\n \n\nOur best days are ahead if we harness the power of recent technology\ndevelopments to be put to the greater good. \n\n \n\nThe world has been transformed by the explosion in technology development\nand information set free over the internet in the last 20 - 25 years.  \n\n \n\nThis transformation has brought about great advances for deploying clean\nenergy, communicating with friends and relatives around the world, leap\nfrogging economic development and access to education to rural and\nunderdeveloped places around the world, improving our understanding of\nhealth issues (who doesn\'t go to a doctor having done their own research on\nthe internet about what might be ailing them), etc. \n\n \n\nBut this information revolution has also had some very scary with some\nunforeseen negative consequences and as a result -  those who care about the\ncountry, world, general public safety and quality of life are always trying\nto stay one step ahead of the bad guys, the hackers, those that use the new\ntools and platforms to spread messages of hate and fear, those who want to\nsometimes destroy that which we value as Americans and peaceful global\ncitizens. \n\n \n\nThe potential for a better tomorrow is real.  We just have to work together.\nWe need the brilliant millennials who\'ve grown up with an instinct about the\ninternet that the babyboomers never had to help make this country what they\nwant it to be and this world.  \n\n \n\nWe can\'t turn back the clock.  We need to make Obamacare better, it\'s not\nperfect.  We need more clean energy and ways to deliver it.  We can save\nthis planet if we work together.  \n\n \n\nThe best days are ahead - can be ahead - if everyone will join in and work\ntogether.  Hillary has a record of working together with those that don\'t\nagree with all her positions and philosophy - in the senate and around the\nworld.   \n\n \n\nI think she needs to tell people - especially the young people who are\nfearing doom and gloom and don\'t want to take it or accept it anymore\n(Bernie\'s appeal)- that there is a better future on the horizon - they just\nneed to join in and help us get there.   That college might not be free for\neveryone but it will be affordable.  That the climate issue is real but\ntogether we can mitigate it and hopefully reverse it.  That wealth and\nopportunity to advance --is not only for just those in the club already.  \n\n \n\nAnd the people in their 40s and 50s and even early 60s who feel they\'ve lost\nground - can feel secure that Hillary has their, back, concerns and needs in\nmind as much as she does the children and grandchildren.\n\n \n\nWe can build better bridges, use cleaner energy sources, apply medical help\nfasters, feed larger populations, provide access to education more fairly,\ntake care of the elderly and the children, better defend our country and\nexplore the oceans and universe  - we can do it all if we work together.  I\nthink that should be Hillary\'s message.  The best is yet to come for America\n- join me in setting the country onto that course.  America is already\ngreater than most places in the world, but our young country\'s best days are\nstill ahead of us - not behind us.  We are building on the success of past\ngenerations - not tearing it down.\n\n \n\nPositive and encouraging.  We can do this!  We know how.  Hillary knows how\nbut needs everyone to join in and work together.   Hillary Will.  Our best\ndays are ahead of us, not behind us.  I know it\'s not new - but it taps into\nthe American can-do spirit and well, it\'s simple.  I love when President\nClinton says to his New Hampshire crowds, "We can do this!"   Hillary can do\nthis! Hillary will.  Our best days are yet to come, if we work together. \n\n'
