Just got off a call with  \nAnna Ekindjian from America Votes and Amy Dacey talking through a  \ncoordinated approach to fundraising.  If you have some time, I'd like  \nto get a sense from you of what meetings you have planned or want to  \nset up, etc.  Plus, I could use some background on Mary Pat Bonner's  \nrole in all this.\n\nThe top priority it seems to me is to sit down with Steve Bing and see  \njust what he wants to do.  If you and I could do that meeting  \ntogether, that would be ideal.\n\nI've got a 3 day DA retreat starting today, but i could do calls early  \nmorning each of the next two days.\n\nThanks,\nSteve\n\nHere's the HuffPo piece and Ben Smith picking up on it:\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-phillips/seizing-the-time-the-role_b_107490.html\n\nhttp://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0608/ProObama_527_defying_Obama_staying_in_business.html\n"
