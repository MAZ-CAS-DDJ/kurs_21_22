Based on his distinguished career, philanthropy, and work on behalf of progressive causes, I believe he would be an excellent addition to our Board.\n\n\n\nJonathan is a longtime donor to CAP, but is interested in becoming a substantial investor.  He has also supported Media Matters and other progressive organizations.\n\n\n\nJonathan is the Managing Partner, Chief Investment Officer, and a Managing Director at Sankaty Advisors, which he founded in 1997.  He is chair of the Firm\'s Credit Committee  and Risk & Oversight Committee, with overall responsibility for the Firm\'s investment strategy, management and risk. Before the formation of Sankaty, Jonathan worked in Bain Capital\'s private equity business, as a consultant at McKinsey & Company, and at Drexel Burnham Lambert.  Jonathan graduated Columbia College, Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude, and holds an M.B.A. with Distinction from Harvard Business School.\n\n\n\nJonathan, together with his wife Jeannie, participate in and support a wide array of philanthropic endeavors as well.  In 2007, they founded the Crimson Lion Foundation, which provides financial support to several organizations that include Boston Children\'s Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Cradles to Crayons, Be The Change, Best Buddies, uAspire, LIFT Communities, Horizons for Homeless Children, and Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Boston.  They also helped establish the Lavine Family Humanitarian Studies Initiative in 2011, which supports training and education of humanitarian aid workers.  Jonathan serves on the Boards of City Year, Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism at Brandeis University, Children\'s Hospital Trust, Horizons for Homeless Children, and Opportunity Nation.  You can read more about Jonathan here<https://www.sankaty.com/team/jonathan-lavine>.\n\n\n\nI am confident that Jonathan\'s perspective and commitment would be an important part of advancing our work, and I therefore recommend that we appoint him to the Board.  Resolutions to this effect are below and also attached.  If you agree to these resolutions, please respond affirmatively to this email, or email our Corporate Secretary, Alex DeMots, at ademots@americanprogress.org<mailto:ademots@americanprogress.org>.
