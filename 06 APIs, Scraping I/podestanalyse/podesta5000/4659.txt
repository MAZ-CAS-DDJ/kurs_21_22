At times David has\nconducted himself perfectly professionally at our events.  At times he has\nbeen disruptive \xe2\x80\x93 shouting over and disrupting other reporters to the point\nthat other journalists have complained to the campaign.  We expect that\nkind of exchange during the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign.\nBut we find the motorcade incidents disturbing and wanted to bring them to\nyour attention.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nJennifer Palmieri\n\nCommunications Director, Hillary for America\n'
