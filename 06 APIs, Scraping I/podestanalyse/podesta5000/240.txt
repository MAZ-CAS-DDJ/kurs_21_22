john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear Roger, Anne, Bob, Bob, Larry and Laura,\n\n \n\nBill Daley and I look forward to seeing you on Friday.  In advance of\nthat meeting, we wanted to provide you with some additional information:\n\n \n\n1.\tBackground on the transition Economic Team\'s Work:\n\n\ta.\tThe transition economic team is focused on identifying\nthe key economic issues confronting a new administration during the\ntransition and once in office, and providing options on these issues\nthat we hope will accelerate the new administration\'s decision making\nprocess.  \n\tb.\tWe are explicitly NOT making recommendations on matters\nsuch as how to prioritize between deficit reduction and investment (the\nrole that the NEC and OMB will play in a new administration).  We\nbelieve that the new President, Vice President and their team will make\nthese choices.\n\n2.\tObjectives for Friday\'s Meeting:\n\n\ta.\tGiven the nature of our work, we will therefore seek\nyour advice on the following broad questions:\n\n\t\t1.\tAre there issues of importance that we have\nfailed to identify?\n\t\t2.\tHave we provided useful background information\non the issues identified to date and then identified the appropriate\noptions for addressing them?\n\t\t3.\tHave we characterized these options in an\ninsightful, yet balanced manner?\n\n\tb.\tTo help facilitate the discussion, you will see that\neach topic discussed will be proceeded by a slide that outlines what we\nbelieve are the key questions where we would seek your guidance.  For\nexample, on the budget, "What should be the timing of rolling back the\n2001/2003 tax cuts?"\n\tc.\tTo be clear, we do not expect to come out of the meeting\nwith recommendations for the next administration, but rather greater\ninsight into how we can prepare useful briefing materials.  So, on the\nquestion identified above about the timing of tax rollbacks, we are not\nlooking for consensus around a certain date, but rather a discussion of\nthe options and their relative merits.\n\td.\tFinally, while we will present materials that by\nnecessity contain a significant amount of technical background on\ncertain matters, we hope to avoid having the discussion center around\nthese technical questions (e.g., how Congress should score the TARP for\nbudget purposes).\n\n3.\tAgenda:\n\n\ta.\tAt the meeting, we will cover the following topics:\n\n\t\t1.\tStimulus\n\t\t2.\tBudget\n\t\t3.\tFinancial Markets\n\t\t4.\tInternational Economics\n\t\t5.\tDraft Post-Election Q&A\n\n\tb.\tIn addition to these topics that will be addressed at\nthe meeting, the group is also working on the following topics:\n\n\t\t1.\tLabor issues\n\t\t2.\tCredit cards\n\t\t3.\tLegal framework for financial markets actions\n\n4.\tConfidentiality:\n\n\ta.\tWith my apologies in advance for stating what I am sure\nis obvious, the content of this meeting and the fact that it is\noccurring are both strictly confidential and should not be discussed\nwith members of the press or anyone else who is not participating in the\nmeeting.\n\tb.\tThe work that will be presented represents the opinion\nof the team presenting.  This effort is independent of the Obama\ncampaign and the materials presented should not in any be construed as\nreflecting the campaign\'s positions.\n\n5.\tMaterials:\n\n\ta.\tThe presentations will be on a projected screen.  Given\nthe confidential nature of the materials and the fact that they are\nevolving rapidly in light of recent market and government developments,\nwe do not plan to distribute hard copies of the presentations in advance\nof or at the meeting.  \n\n6.\tBiographies:\n\n\ta.\tRather than go through introductions at the meeting, I\nhave attached biographies on each of the people presenting (for the sake\nof clarity, I would note that Jack Lew is both presenting and a member\nof the advisory board).\n\tb.\tYou will see from the "cc\'s" above that we will be\njoined at the meeting by a few senior members of the overall transition\neffort.\n\n7.\tLogistics Reminder:\n\n\ta.\tFriday, October 17th in NYC.\n\tb.\tThe meeting will take place in the offices of Simpson,\nThatcher and Bartlett.\n\tc.\tAddress:  425 Lexington Avenue, between 43rd & 44th\nstreet, 30th floor, Conference room 30J\n\td.\tPlease make sure to have proper ID to enter the\nbuilding.\n\te.\tThe meeting will run from 9:00 am thru 3:00 pm\n\tf.\tBreakfast and Lunch will be served.\n\n \n\nPlease let Bill or me know if you have any questions or suggestions.  We\nthank you in advance for your help.\n\n \n\nBest,\n\n \n\nJosh\n\n \n\n_____________________________________\nJoshua L.
