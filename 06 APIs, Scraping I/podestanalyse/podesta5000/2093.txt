We will be reading Notes From the History of An Infantile Neurosis, on the "Wolfman," which is the third essay in Sigmund Freud, Three Case Histories (Touchstone Edition, Intro by Philip Rieff).  If you would like to join us please do!  Roger Bourcicot, the administrative assistant on the sixth floor of Hotung, has some copies of the book, and more are on the way.   It can also be readily ordered from Amazon, and is downloadable on Kindle.\n\nRobin West\n'
