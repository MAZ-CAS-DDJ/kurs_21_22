Yet the Vermont senator has benefited from at least $1.5 million in backing from super PACs and from political groups that don\'t have to fully disclose their donors, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. As a member of Congress, he regularly attended retreats with Wall Street lobbyists and other donors, and as a candidate for the Senate, he benefited from money that indirectly came from them. Last year, he directly accepted about $55,000 in Wall Street contributions for his Democratic presidential campaign, FEC filings show.
