I will deal with her FR question.\n\nFYI, feedback locally related to events of past few days is, very much anecdotally, not great.  Will send you more specific email on that in next couple of days after I am with more members of the local chattering class and some Dem activists.\n\nThanks.\n\nSteve\n\nFrom: Maggie Fox [mailto:maggielfox@gmail.com]\nSent: Friday, July 24, 2015 6:23 PM\nTo: Steve C. Bachar\nSubject: Re: follow up to our call\n\nHi Steve.I thought HRC's speed went really well. Any news yet on swapping lists? We do need to get some resolution on that front fairly soon.\n\nMark is traveling on August 4 when Hilary is here, but I am interested in going to at least 1 of the 2 events and leaning to the Ergens. What is your recommendation?\n\n\n[cid:part1.03070403.09070704@gmail.com]\n\n\n303-292-7957    [http://www.moyewhite.com/email/signature/image02.jpg]\n[http://www.moyewhite.com/email/signature/MW_Logo_email.jpg]\nMoye White LLP Attorneys at Law\n16 Market Square 6th Floor 1400 16th Street Denver CO 80202-1486\ntel 303 292 2900 fax 303 292 4510 www.moyewhite.com<http://www.moyewhite.com>\n > Profile <http://www.moyewhite.com/ourattorneys/>      > Download vCard <http://www.moyewhite.com/vcard.aspx?ID=>\n        [http://www.moyewhite.com/email/signature/alliancelogo_o.jpg] <http://www.moyewhite.com/alliance.aspx>\n\n"
