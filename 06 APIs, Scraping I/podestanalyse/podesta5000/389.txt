While I know not everyone will have the chance to help a military family move, we can all take a moment to lend a hand to those who have sacrificed to give us our freedom.\n\nWill you give $11 to the #HomesForHeroes campaign to make sure that these servicemen and servicewomen, who have given so much to each of us and the entire nation, will have a home for the holidays? <http://mayorsfundla.org/homesforheroes/donate/>\n\nAll donations go directly toward moving veterans into homes.\xc2\xa0 We will share our success, and more moving stories of L.A.'s courageous vets, as we move closer and closer to our goal of housing every homeless veteran in our city.\n\nYour Mayor\nEric Garcetti\n\n\n\n-=-=-\nOffice of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti - 200 N Spring St, 300, Los Angeles, CA 90012, United States \nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.
