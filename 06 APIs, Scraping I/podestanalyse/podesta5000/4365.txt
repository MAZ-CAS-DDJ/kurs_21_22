john.podesta@gmail.comb'How\'s this look:\n\n\nMike-\n\nThanks for this, but reading the below, I have to tell you that I am more, not less confused, and not unreasonably so.\n\nYou reached out on a story with the premise that she was using personal email to \x91operate completely outside the system.\x92  It was clear you were working with a wholly incomplete information, and we in turn asked you to clarify some things because based on the information we have, the facts didn\x92t match up.\nYou sent back as new evidence to that request two emails that had nothing to do with your premise, as they were official emails sent from a State.gov<http://state.gov/> account.  They were clearly provided without context, just as the below has been.\n\nSo I don\x92t think you have helped us get any closer to the very basic questions we were asking in an effort to answer yours, and now we don\x92t know what you\x92re writing about. You have still not clarified anything from the original email, and it now seems like your sources are trying to further mislead you.\n\nSo again, to suggest that the use of personal email off of the State system was happening as any sort of pattern of any kind is not only wrong, but not supported by anything you\'ve given us after repeated requests.\n\nIf you are now writing about something else, which appears to be the content of some of the emails that the select committee has, then please clarify that, and we can try and address it.  But given how this has transpired to date and what I\x92m reading below, I think we can all agree that you have sources not been forthright and have a clear agenda.\n\nLet us know how you would like to proceed.\n\nNick\n\n\n\nOn Mar 19, 2015, at 7:31 PM, Cheryl Mills <cheryl.mills@gmail.com<mailto:cheryl.mills@gmail.com>> wrote:\n\nyep\n\nDOS does not anticipate releasing any materials before the end of next week at the earliest.\n\ncdm\n\nOn Thu, Mar 19, 2015 at 7:28 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com<mailto:nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>> wrote:\nThe NYT is now telling us noon tomorrow is now the deadline.

The State Department\x92s under secretary for management, Patrick Kennedy, testified that the extended deployment would have altered the outcome. "Did we survive the day?"

Below that are the questions we have.\n\nWe would like a response from you by 10 amThursday morning.\n\nThank you.\n\n//\nHRC received an email from Jake Sullivan shortly after Susan Rice went on the Sunday talk shows after the attacks. In the email was a transcript from one of the shows and a note from Sullivan saying that Rice had made the administration\x92s view clear that the attacks started spontaneously and then evolved. Two weeks later, Sullivan sent HRC an email outlining what she had said publicly about the matter, assuring her that she had never described the attacks as spontaneous and she had never characterized the attackers\x92 motives.\nHRC did not send many long emails. Many of them were to Sullivan and included news stories and the message: \x93Please print.\x94 The emails show that four of HRC\x92s closest advisers at the State Department used private email accounts for some of their correspondences with her when she was Secretary of State. The documents show messages between HRC\x92s personal account and the private ones of her chief of staff, Cheryl Mills; senior adviser, Philippe Reines; personal aide Huma Abedin; and Mr. Sullivan.\n\n\n\nThe questions I have for you are the same ones I sent before:\n\n\nWhy did the advisers use private email accounts \x96 instead of government ones \x96 to correspond with Mrs. Clinton?\n\nWas this the normal practice?\n\nWhy did Mrs. Clinton suggest that her emails were being captured in the State Department system when she was corresponding at times with her aides on their personal accounts?\n\nWere Mrs. Clinton\x92s advisers given legal advice about whether it was appropriate for them to correspond with her using their personal accounts?\n\nWhy did Mrs. Clinton rely on the advice of Sidney Blumenthal?\n\n---------\n\nHi Michael,\n\nGiven the nature of the below involving facts that are under review by both the State Department and the select committee, I\x92m asking that this all be considered off the record.  I say this because I want to share some of these details in an effort to better convey why we still find ourselves not clear on the core elements of this story, making it difficult to respond to your questions.\n\nHere\x92s what I know.  I know that you have emails or information about emails that were sent between Secretary Clinton and a personal account of one of her staff.  You described that the majority of them came from the 300 turned over to the select committee by the State Department, but that based on your reporting you weren\'t certain.  I would note that by definition if the emails involved personal addresses and were not forwarded to the State system, they had to come from the 300 grouping, because otherwise State would not have had them until they received the latest batch (the 300 earlier this year).  So either they are part of a group that came from a batch that the State Department already had in their possession, which would seem to contradict your premise, or they came from the 300.\n\nBased on this, assuming they came from the 300, we\x92re familiar with the 300.  One of the things we know is that there is a handful of emails as part of that 300 that did not eventually go to the state.gov<http://state.gov/>system, as I told you last night.  This was more often than not because they were personal in nature but handed over in an abundance of caution, came from outsiders but had some of the keywords (like Libya) in them, or because they were news articles simply sent to or from a personal account.  The thing we are having trouble figuring out is that based on what you have told us, and the names provided below, the two don\x92t match up.\n\nAnd I\x92d remind you that there is no prohibition on the use of personal email accounts, as you noted on the phone last night, as long as they are preserved, and of course, by virtue of you having these emails, they were not only preserved but disclosed.\n\nSo while we want to address your questions, without any sense of the frequency, volume and any characterization of the interactions that were had, nor any verifiable sense of whether these emails did or did not get forwarded to the state.gov<http://state.gov/> system, it\x92s difficult to do so, particularly since you are asking questions below that seem to characterize these interactions as frequent, but it\x92s unclear whether that\x92s substantiated.\n\nSo, in short, can we ask you to provide more information about what you intend to write and the facts that will support it so we can more accurately address your questions.\n\nThanks very much.\n\nNick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
