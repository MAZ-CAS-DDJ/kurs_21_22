john.podesta@gmail.comb'Thank you for the outpouring of support since announcing my candidacy\nfor Oakland City Council!  This has truly been a humbling experience\nas I continue to talk with parents, business owners, and community\nleaders in District 2.\tI would also like to thank you for attending\nand contributing to our fundraising kick off.  It is because of your\nsupport we are getting closer to our fundraising goal.\n\nIt is clear, we as a city, face many challenges with a budget on the\nbrink of crisis and the safety of our streets in jeopardy, but we all\nremain hopeful of what is to come in our future.  As we fight to\nregain economic security and bring hope to our communities, we have a\nunique opportunity to invest in Oakland by using this election to be\nvocal, reshape our vision, and aggressively pursue the fundamental\nchanges we deserve.  Together, we much invest in the future of\nOakland.\n\nWe all know we can do better and I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to help lead the way. \nInvest in our campaign today and help us get our message out to the\ncommunity.  We are less than one week away from the first reporting\ndeadline on June 30th which will determine our campaign\xe2\x80\x99s viability. \nWith your support, we will cross the finish line successfully.\tDonate\nonline at\nhttp://cts.vresp.com/c/?JenniferPaeforOaklan/a9f1dc1333/08a29c1973/634f9bd4b6\ntoday!\n\nTogether we can,\n\nJennifer S.
