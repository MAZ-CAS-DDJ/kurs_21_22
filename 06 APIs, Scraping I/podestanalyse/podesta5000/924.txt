I took the opportunity to\nwait until the rope line was empty to privately ask him a question--was he\naware of the campaign\'s closing argument?  He wasn\'t and asked if I was.\nObviously, I\'m not but that\'s understandable.  However,  I have some\nthoughts and through you want to get my two-cents in.\n\nMy sense is we are two weeks ahead of where we were before the \'92\ncampaign.  At this point in \'92 the campaign\'s goal was still making the\ncase that Bill was qualified to be president.  To Hillary and the\ncampaign\'s credit, Hillary has passed that test and seen as\n"presidential".  Contributing to that image has been to eschew (love that\nword) getting into mundane political squabbles that bore the voters and are\nsingularly unhelpful in convincing undecided voters.  The campaign\'s\ndiscipline has been praise worthy.\nThat brings us to the point of the closing theme/message/argument.\n\nWhile my first thoughts centered around a specific use of the word\n"leadership" (and that remains in my mind a continuing possibility) what\ncomes\nto mind is who are we trying to win over at that point--post Iowa thru\nPrimary Day--a combination of those who are \'undecided\' and motivate our\nown supporters.  The theme/message/argument should be directly about them\nrather than us!  While the airwaves are back-to-back negative, we should be\npositive.\n\nAn example of the same would be "A Better Tomorrow".  We don\'t have to\nshout.  She will have already established the needed creditability.  She\nwill have already explained what she believes and stands for.  We are not\ngoing to get the haters but we can comfortably associate ourselves with\nthose who--while frustrated and disappointed--very much want to believe\ntheir future can and will be improved when she is President.  I\'m a\nbeliever and so are you!\n\n\nJoe\n\nJ. Joseph Grandmaison\n1627 Ocean Blvd.\nRye, NH 03870\n603-431-1288\nEmail: jjgrandmaison@gmail.com\n'
