Last night he sat\none table away from new grandmother Hillary Clinton. On the joys of\ngrandparenting, they can agree.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou almost only get the good times,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schwarzman, the chairman and\nchief executive of Blackstone Group LP, who supported Mitt Romney for\npresident in 2012.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe really is remarkable,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton, a probable Democratic presidential\ncandidate in 2016, said of eight-week-old Charlotte.\n\n\n\nThe occasion was the fifth anniversary gala of the New York-based Child\nMind Institute, which treats children with mental illness and researches\nthe developing brain.\n\n\n\nClinton was honored and sat with Brooke Garber Neidich, a friend and\nco-founder of the Child Mind Institute, who\xe2\x80\x99s eager to become a grandmother\nherself.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m dying for it,\xe2\x80\x9d Neidich said.\n\n\n\nUntil then, Neidich gets to live vicariously through Clinton.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is so psyched, you have no idea,\xe2\x80\x9d Neidich said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can tell, there\nis nothing that matters more, period. World peace, OK, grandmother, let\xe2\x80\x99s\ngo for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nJon Corzine noticed a change in Clinton last night. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is beaming way\nmore than anything that I normally see out of her,\xe2\x80\x9d the former governor of\nNew Jersey and former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said. \xe2\x80\x9cSince\nI have five grandchildren and it\xe2\x80\x99s the happiest part of my life, I know it\nresonates with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Prospects*\n\n\n\nBeing a grandmother \xe2\x80\x9cshould help\xe2\x80\x9d her candidacy, Corzine said. Asked about\nWall Street getting behind her, Corzine said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sort of removed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGoldman partner Ram Sundaram, David Shapiro of KPS Capital Partners,\nCarlyle Group\xe2\x80\x99s Olivier Sarkozy and Thomas H. Lee of Lee Equity Partners\nwere among the Wall Streeters at the event, which was held at Cipriani 42nd\nStreet and raised $6.6 million.\n\n\n\nClinton was also honored on Nov. 21, by the New-York Historical Society\nMuseum & Library, an event that raised $2.5 million and drew its share of\nfinance types, including Robert Diamond, chief executive of Atlas Merchant\nCapital and former CEO of Barclays Plc; Richard Gilder, co-creator of\nGilder, Gagnon, Howe & Co.; hedge-fund manager Joseph DiMenna and Paul\nVolcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n\n\n\n*Isaacson Interview*\n\n\n\nFor this crowd at the Mandarin Oriental, Aspen Institute head and author\nWalter Isaacson interviewed Clinton, getting her talking a lot about the\nRoosevelts and a little about her granddaughter.\n\n\n\nSix days after Charlotte was born, Clinton said, she had lunch with Bernard\nSchwartz at the Four Seasons. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize I spent almost the whole\ntime talking about her,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nLater her brush broadened to consider Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s future.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m excited about whatever she\xe2\x80\x99ll wind up doing -- of course she\xe2\x80\x99s\nbrilliant, advanced, wonderful and all of that -- but I think talent is\nuniversal but opportunity is not,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think there were babies\nborn in this country on the same day that Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky was\nborn who are just as smart and will never have the opportunities to go just\nas far, and that bothers me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton left Charlotte out of her remarks at the Child Mind Institute\nbenefit, instead focusing on children\xe2\x80\x99s mental health needs as \xe2\x80\x9cevery bit\nas important as their physical health.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Prison Care*\n\n\n\nShe expressed disappointment that this notion \xe2\x80\x9cis not yet firmly enough\nembedded in our national understanding,\xe2\x80\x9d giving as an extreme example that\nprisons have become primary providers of mental-health care.\n\n\n\nAnd she traced her interest in child development to her days at Yale Law\nSchool, when she said she took a year to study at the Yale Child Study\nCenter, observing clinical sessions. More recently, Clinton Foundation\nresearch alerted her to the number of connections in a newborn\xe2\x80\x99s brain.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese early years are a period of great opportunity and vulnerability,\xe2\x80\x9d\nClinton said.\n\n\n\nNo wonder grandparents are good to have around at this stage, or as the\nother honoree, Thomas Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental\nHealth, put it:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor millennia, we grew up as tribes where multiple generations were\ntogether,\xe2\x80\x9d Insel said from his dinner seat. \xe2\x80\x9cThe idea that you\xe2\x80\x99d have three\ngenerations that would be separated in time and space, that was not the way\nwe evolved as a species.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNext to him, novelist Erica Jong set the record straight: \xe2\x80\x9cGrandmothers\nshould be ruling the world,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\n*\xe2\x80\x98Busy Lady\xe2\x80\x99*\n\n\n\nHarold Koplewicz, founding president of the Child Mind Institute, said\nraising a healthy child is \xe2\x80\x9call time and attention. That means sometimes\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not about quality, it\xe2\x80\x99s about quantity. Hillary is a busy lady, but\nCharlotte needs to be one of the priorities. With someone as organized as\nHillary, Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s going to get that. I know Hillary and I assure you,\nthere will be a playpen in the Oval Office because Hillary knows what\xe2\x80\x99s\nimportant.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd if Clinton doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run for president? \xe2\x80\x9cCharlotte\xe2\x80\x99s got the genes,\xe2\x80\x9d\nKoplewicz said.\n\n\n\nAs for Steve Schwarzman: the latest addition to his family arrived at 6:30\na.m. and her name is Mary, daughter of his son Teddy, he said. And she\xe2\x80\x99s\njust the start of the family\xe2\x80\x99s excitement these days, as Mary\xe2\x80\x99s smiling\ngrandmother, Ellen Katz, Schwarzman\xe2\x80\x99s ex-wife, noted from her table across\nthe room. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Imitation Game\xe2\x80\x9d starring Benedict Cumberbatch, which Teddy\nproduced, comes out on Nov. 28 in the U.S. \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a\nblockbuster,\xe2\x80\x9d Katz said. Teddy\xe2\x80\x99s sister Zibby is due to have a baby next\nmonth.\n\n\n\nWhat might be the perfect baby gift? The Child Mind Institute had an\nanswer: an $18, special-edition Bloomingdale\xe2\x80\x99s teddy bear, a bigger example\nof which shared the red carpet with guests. Two dollars of every sale will\ngo the Institute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*CNN: \xe2\x80\x9cSchumer on 2016: \'Democrats must embrace government\'\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/25/politics/schumer-democrats-press-club-plan/>*\n\n\n\nBy Dan Merica\n\nNovember 25, 2014, 12:50 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that in order for his party to\nwin in 2016, his party will have to run on big government, "not run away\nfrom it."\n\n\n\nDuring a long, scripted speech at the National Press Club in Washington,\nthe boisterous New Yorker heralded government -- and its programs to aid\nthe middle class -- as what "unites" the party.\n\n\n\n"Together, Democrats must embrace government," Schumer said. "In order to\nwin in 2016, Democrats must embrace government, not run away from it."\n\n\n\nSchumer\'s argument was that Democrats must regain the mantle as the party\nfor the middle class by focusing laser-like on populist legislation the\nbenefits a large number of voters and sticks to a coherent, simple message.\n\n\n\nThis "strategy must become our blueprint. Indeed it should unite Democrats\nfrom Elizabeth Warren to Hillary Clinton to Joe Manchin," Schumer argued,\nnoting politicians across the Democratic spectrum.\n\n\n\nDuring a speech that was as much a history lesson as it was guiding vision,\nSchumer faulted Democrats for, in his opinion, fumbling the mandate they\nwon in 2008 by focusing on the Affordable Care Act -- also known as\nObamacare -- at the outset of the Obama administration.\n\n\n\n"After passing the stimulus, Democrats should have continued to propose\nmiddle class-oriented programs and built on the partial success of the\nstimulus, but unfortunately Democrats blew the opportunity the American\npeople gave them," Schumer said. "We took their mandate and put all our\nfocus on the wrong problem - health care reform."\n\n\n\nHe added, "The focus on Obamacare gave anti-government forces and the\nRepublican Party new vigor and new life, at least temporarily" and led to\ntheir wins in 2010.\n\n\n\nSchumer told the assembled reporters that the Affordable Care Act was "a\ngood bill" that "should have come later." Instead, Schumer said the reason\nhe opposed pushing health care early in 2009 was that he law did not affect\nenough of the electorate to be worth the political capital it cost.\n\n\n\n"To aim a huge change in mandate at such a small percentage of the\nelectorate made no political sense," Schumer said. "So when Democrats\nfocused on health care, the average middle class person thought, \'the\nDemocrats are not paying enough attention to me.\'"\n\n\n\nSchumer\'s remarks come at a turbulent time for Democrats. The 2014 election\nsaw massive Republican wins across the country. Democrats fell deeper into\nthe minority in the House and Republicans took back the Senate.\n\n\n\nRepublicans, who have argued the nation wants smaller, less involved\ngovernment -- and point to their 2014 election win -- seized on the\nsenator\'s speech.\n\n\n\n"Schumer\'s message has an old car stank to it," said Brad Dayspring,\nstrategist with the National Republican Senatorial Committee. "Embracing a\ndysfunctional government that is 17 trillion in debt is a thumb in the eye\nto middle class voters and young Americans, but reflects how out of touch\nDemocrats are heading into 2016."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*ABC News: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Note: Ferguson Under Fire\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/11/the-note-ferguson-under-fire/>*\n\n\n\nBy Shushannah Walshe\n\nNovember 25, 2014, 8:53 a.m. EST\n\n\n\n*NOTABLES*\n\n   - *FERGUSON LATEST:  *Live Updates as Ferguson reacts to grand jury\xe2\x80\x99s\n   decision not to indict officer Darren Wilson: http://abcn.ws/11rIqK6 And\n   more from the unrest overnight, which St. Louis County Police Chief Jon\n   Belmar said was \xe2\x80\x9cworse than the worst night we ever had in August\xe2\x80\x9d\n   http://abcn.ws/11sl5rv And details from the evidence the grand jury\n   heard: http://abcn.ws/1piuZqQ\n\n\n   - *OBAMA URGES CALM:* *President Obama*\n   <http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/whitehouse/barack-obama.htm> last\n   night urged the public to accept the *grand jury\xe2\x80\x99s decision*\n   <http://abcnews.go.com/US/ferguson-grand-jury-indict-officer-darren-wilson-death/story?id=27146400>\nnot\n   to indict the Ferguson, Missouri, police officer who fatally shot an\n   unarmed teenager this past summer, saying that \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s an outcome that,\n   either way, was going to be subject to intense disagreement,\xe2\x80\x9d *ABC\xe2\x80\x99S\n   DEVIN DWYER* and *MEGHAN KENEALLY *report. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are a nation built on the\n   rule of law, so we need to accept that this decision was the grand jury\xe2\x80\x99s\n   to make,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9dHurting others or destroying property is not the\n   answer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.

As I said, the vast majority of the community\n   has been working very hard to try to make sure that this becomes an\n   opportunity for us to seize the moment and turn this into a positive\n   situation,\xe2\x80\x9d the president answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think that we have to make sure\n   that we focus at least as much attention on all those positive activities\n   that are taking place as we do on a handful of folks who end up using this\n   as an excuse to misbehave or to break the law or to engage in violence.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n   - *DOJ INVESTIGATION CONTINUES:* Attorney General Eric Holder released a\n   statement, according to *ABC\xe2\x80\x99s MIKE LEVINE* saying in part: \xe2\x80\x9dWhile the\n   grand jury proceeding in St. Louis County has concluded, the Justice\n   Department\xe2\x80\x99s investigation into the shooting of Michael Brown remains\n   ongoing\xe2\x80\xa6the federal inquiry has been independent of the local one from the\n   start, and remains so now.

But after several\nlackluster, low-energy sessions, Obama was so unimpressed by the\nperformance of his laconic, self-effacing defense secretary that he decided\nHagel \xe2\x80\x9cjust wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the man for the job,\xe2\x80\x9d according to a senior\nadministration official.

A recent Bloomberg\nPolitics poll found that 62 percent of likely Democratic voters in New\nHampshire said they\'d support Clinton for president in 2016.\n\n\n\nIn many ways, Clinton is a very well-known quantity\xe2\x80\x94after all, she\'s been a\npublic figure for more than 30 years. But on many specific policies,\nClinton has remained coy, often opting to speak out about women\'s equality\nin the workplace rather than tackling the political debates of the day.\nShould she run for president a second time, she\'s given little indication\nas to what that her campaign would look like, or what policy platform would\nform its framework.\n\n\n\nEven Democratic loyalists seem to be confused about what Clinton\'s\nphilosophy going into 2016 would look like. As Ryan Lizza recently wrote,\n"everyone in the party seems to be supporting her, and yet nobody can\narticulate exactly why."\n\n\n\nWe got perhaps the first real policy position from Clinton on Thursday,\nwhen she voiced her support for President Obama\'s executive action on\nimmigration. So, when can progressive policy wonks (and reporters) expect\nmore fleshed-out policies from Clinton?\n\n\n\nDon\'t hold your breath.\n\n\n\nAn educated guess would be shortly after she announces her candidacy\xe2\x80\x94if she\ndoes, in fact, decide to run\xe2\x80\x94in "early 2015." Joe Trippi, a veteran\nDemocratic operative, said that Clinton would be ill-advised to start\nlaying out her platform until she and other serious Democratic opponents\nhave announced their candidacy.\n\n\n\n"There\'s no imminent reason for her to have to start doing that," Trippi\nsaid. "The clock\'s not ticking on any of that for her, because of all the\nadvantages she already has."\n\n\n\nThat may be a fine strategy for the many solid-blue Democrats who have\nalready mentally cast their vote for Clinton in 2016, but some progressive\nactivists are wary about her record. The progressive wing of the party\nright now is particularly focused on two areas\xe2\x80\x94blocking the Keystone\nPipeline and reforming the National Security Agency\'s mass-surveillance\nprograms. Clinton\'s near silence on both isn\'t going over well.\n\n\n\n*NSA reform*\n\n\n\nIt\'s been more than a year since NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked a\ntrove of top-secret documents exposing the U.S. government\'s mass\nsurveillance apparatus. Last week, Senate Republicans blocked legislation\nthat would rein in the NSA\'s spy programs. Clinton could have easily penned\nan op-ed about the stalled bill in the Times or the Post, or even issue a\nstatement as she did after Obama\'s immigration announcement. Instead, she\nchose to say nothing.\n\n\n\nNeema Singh Guliani, a legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties\nUnion, said Clinton will need to break her silence on NSA reform soon.\n\n\n\n"You\'ve seen prominent political figures stake out a position and express\ntheir concern. You see, for example, Jim Sensenbrenner\xe2\x80\x94who was one of the\ndrafters of the PATRIOT Act\xe2\x80\x94say, \'Look, this isn\'t what I intended,\'"\nGuliani told National Journal. "If she is a presidential candidate, I don\'t\nthink this is an issue that she\'s going to be able to avoid, and I don\'t\nthink it\'s an issue that really any candidate is going to be able to avoid."\n\n\n\nOn privacy, Clinton\'s legislative record is somewhat of a mixed bag. After\n9/11, she voted for the PATRIOT Act\xe2\x80\x94along with 96 of her fellow senators.\nIn 2008, she voted against an amended version of the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act, which paved the way for the surveillance systems, along\nwith the wide berth given to the government to monitor American civilians.\n\n\n\nSince her time in the Senate, Clinton has largely stuck to platitudes about\nbalancing privacy with national security interests. On the campaign trail\nshe praised Sen. Mark Udall for calling for NSA reform. But back in April,\nshe told a crowd of college students that the Snowden leaks "gave all kinds\nof information, not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist\ngroups and the like."\n\n\n\nPrivacy activists are perplexed by Clinton\'s apparent cognitive dissonance.\n\n\n\n"I think it\'s really hard to tell what her position is," Guliani said.\n"When we look at her prior voting history, that was before the disclosures,\nand I think before the public and before members of Congress frankly knew\nwhat was happening. And so whether that changes things, I think it really\nremains to be seen."\n\n\n\n*Keystone Pipeline*\n\n\n\nAside from immigration, government funding and the ongoing battle against\nthe Islamic State group, the Keystone Pipeline may be the biggest\nlegislative topic facing Congress. Yet, despite campaigning for\npipeline-advocate Sen. Mary Landrieu, Clinton has maintained radio silence\non the crude oil pipeline, which would stretch from Alberta, Canada, to the\nGulf of Mexico.\n\n\n\nEnvironmental activists have found her response to the fossil fuel debate\nin general, and Keystone specifically, to be lacking, to say the least.\nBill Snape, a senior counsel for the Center for Biological Diversity, told\nNational Journal that while Keystone may seem like a niche concern, it\nrepresents a far larger ideological rift.\n\n\n\n"The fundamental issue with Keystone for Hillary is that it\'s a microcosm\nof her position on fossil fuels in general," Snape said. "She\'s trying to\nstraddle a number of worlds right now...at some point, you\'re going to have\nto make a decision."\n\n\n\nJerry Austin, an Ohio Democratic strategist and Jesse Jackson\'s former\ncampaign manager, pointed out that if Clinton were still secretary of\nstate, the Keystone Pipeline would be "under her aegis." As it stands,\nClinton is still a quasi-private citizen, and she\'s said next to nothing on\nthe topic.\n\n\n\n"Because she is a presumptive candidate, everybody wants to know where she\nstands on these issues," Austin said. "I don\'t think she can get away with\nwaiting a long period of time to answer them."\n\n\n\nBut while it may irk activists, some Democratic strategists say silence can\nbe a virtue.\n\n\n\n"It\'s better to really formulate the policies that she wants to implement\nand govern with, and only when she\'s ready to articulate those would I\nadvise her to go out and talk about them," Trippi said. "Understanding\nwhere you want to take the country before you enter the race is a much\nbetter formula, a much better way to get to the presidency than\nfocus-grouping, polling or reacting to interest groups in either party."\n\n\n\n*It\'s The Economy, Etc.*\n\n\n\nAl From, another veteran Democratic strategist who served as Bill Clinton\'s\ndomestic policy advisor in 1992, told National Journal that the general\nstate of the economy will weigh more heavily in voters\' minds than Keystone\nor NSA reform.\n\n\n\n"The most challenging issue for any candidate for president is on questions\nof economic growth and economic equality. It looks like she\'s feeling some\npressure to take a more populist line on these issues than she has in the\npast. But she\'s also been very careful not to get nailed down on\nspecifics," From said.\n\n\n\nWhile the Clintons have often praised From\'s work, progressives are not as\nbig fans of his governing philosophy. Jesse Jackson once said From\'s\norganization, the Democratic Leadership Council (or DLC), stood for\n"Democrats for the leisure class."\n\n\n\n>From says the top-of-mind progressive issues of 2014 matter just as much\xe2\x80\x94or\nlittle\xe2\x80\x94as they did back then.\n\n\n\n"It\'s more than likely that Keystone will have long since been decided by\nthe time the 2016 Iowa Caucuses happen. But this longer-term economic\ndebate, and how she approaches it, is a challenge that\'s not going away,"\n>From said.\n\n\n\n*Keeping It Under Wraps*\n\n\n\nClinton\'s silence may frustrate special interest groups on the left\xe2\x80\x94and the\ndonors who are trying to figure out who to support\xe2\x80\x94but it\'s a\ntried-and-true political strategy. Why show your cards when you haven\'t\neven been dealt in yet?\n\n\n\n"Anybody who\'s been through this\xe2\x80\x94and she has\xe2\x80\x94knows you take your time, you\nthink things through, you develop your policies, and then you decide to go\nor not," Trippi said. "There are a lot of people who haven\'t done this\nbefore who think you just announce an exploratory committee and go. Those\ncandidates tend to end up on the side of the road."\n\n\n\nDaniel Schnur, who served as Sen. John McCain\'s spokesman during McCain\'s\n2000 presidential campaign and is now director of the Jesse M. Unruh\nInstitute of Politics at the University of Southern California, seems\nbigger questions ahead. Schnur said that, while wearing the badge of\nInevitability can have its perks, Clinton will eventually need to lay out\nan argument for her candidacy, beyond the fact that she\'s the most\nwell-known candidate.\n\n\n\n"Because she\'s the frontrunner, she can afford to wait as she wants to,"\nSchnur said. "But the longer she waits, the more likely it is that\npotential supporters start asking what\'s motivating her to run, and even\nsimply, \'Do you want to be president?\'"\n'
