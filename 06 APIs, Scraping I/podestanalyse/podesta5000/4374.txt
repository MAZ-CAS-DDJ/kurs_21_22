Mr. Benamor never found it necessary to buy\ninsurance before having a mild heart attack last year and now, 13 years shy\nof Medicare<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicare/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier>,\nhas little hope of doing so.\n\nThe heart attack left Mr. Benamor with a $17,000 hospital bill, $400 in\nmonthly prescription costs and a desperate need for insurance. After being\nrejected by a number of commercial carriers, he turned to the Maryland\nHealth Insurance Plan, one of 35 state programs for high-risk applicants\nwhom no private company is willing to insure.\n\nHe decided that the annual premium \x97 $4,572 for a plan with heavy\ndeductibles \x97 was more than he could handle on an income of about $35,000.\nYet his earnings were too high for him to qualify for state subsidies.\n\n"I\'d like to get it, but what do you pay first?" Mr. Benamor asked at his\ndining room table. "Do you pay the mortgage? Do you pay your child support?\nDo you pay your car insurance? Do you pay for your medicine?"\n\nIn late April, Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, announced that if elected\npresident he would seek to insure people like Mr. Benamor by vastly\nexpanding federal support for state high-risk pools like Maryland\'s, or by\ncreating a structure modeled after them. But as Mr. Benamor\'s case\ndemonstrates, even well-regarded pools have served more as a stopgap than a\nsolution.\n\nThough high-risk pools have existed for three decades, they cover only\n207,000 people in a country with 47 million uninsured, according to the\nNational Association of State Comprehensive Health Insurance Plans. Premiums\ntypically are high, as much as twice the standard rate in some states, but\nare still not nearly enough to pay claims. That has left states to cover\nabout 40 percent of the cost, usually through assessments on insurance\npremiums that are often passed on to consumers.\n\nHealth economists say it could take untold billions to transform the\npatchwork of programs into a viable federal safety net. The McCain campaign\nhas made only a rough calculation of how many billions would be needed and\nhas not identified a source for the fi-nancing beyond savings from existing\nprograms. Finding the money will only get more difficult now that Mr. McCain\nhas pledged to balance the federal\nbudget<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/federal_budget_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier>by\n2013, which already requires a significant reduction in the growth of\nspending.\n\nMr. McCain\'s proposal stands in sharp relief to that of his Democratic\nrival, Senator Barack\nObama<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per>of\nIllinois, who wants to require insurers to accept all applicants,\nregardless of their health. That is now the law in five states, including\nNew York and New Jersey.\n\nFor those who can afford the premiums, or who qualify for subsidies in the\n13 states that provide them, the high-risk programs can be a godsend.\n\nRichard and Susan Logan, both of whom have battled cancer this decade, said\nthey were grateful to have coverage for themselves and their daughter\nthrough the Maryland plan, even though it will cost $22,232 this year. They\nhad been rejected by 25 commercial insurers, said Mrs. Logan, 57, a\npart-time billing clerk for a physician.\n\nThe Logans, who live in Gambrills, near Annapolis, estimate that without the\nhigh-risk pool, they would pay $40,000 a year for medication alone.\n\n"The plan\'s worth its weight in gold for that," said Mr. Logan, 62, an\naviation accident investigator. "Otherwise, we\'d be paying for the\nmedications out of our retirement."\n\nA fifth of the 14,000 participants in the Maryland plan receive subsidies\nthat drop their premiums below the market rates charged to healthy people,\nsaid Richard A. Popper, the plan\'s director. But many in the middle find the\npolicies both unaffordable and intolerably restrictive, and Mr. Popper\nestimates that two-thirds of those eligible have not enrolled.\n\nAlmost all of the state pools impose waiting periods of up to a year before\ncovering the health conditions that initially made it impossible to obtain\ninsurance. In some states, fiscal pressures have forced heavy restrictions\nin coverage and enrollment. Florida, which has 3.8 million uninsured people,\nclosed its pool to new applicants in 1991, and the membership has dwindled\nto 313.\n\nAn informal survey by the American Cancer\nSociety<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/american_cancer_society/index.html?inline=nyt-org>recently\nfound that only 2 percent of nearly 2,700 callers to its insurance\nhot line enrolled in high-risk pools within two months of being referred to\nthem. "In most cases, we know they probably didn\'t apply because they\ndiscovered high premiums or pre-existing condition clauses and just didn\'t\nbother," said Stephen Finan, associate director of policy for the group\'s\nCancer Action Network.\n\nThere is no census of the medically uninsurable. But in 2006, insurers\nturned down 11 percent of all individual applicants for medical reasons,\nincluding 22 percent of those 50 or older, according to America\'s Health\nInsurance Plans, an industry trade group.\n\nFinding a way to cover the sickest of the uninsured is critically important\nbecause 15 percent of the population is responsible for three-fourths of\nhealth care spending. Many wind up in emergency rooms, which cannot legally\nreject them, leaving hospitals with more than $30 billion in unpaid bills\neach year.\n\nMr. McCain\'s proposal, which he calls the Guaranteed Access Plan, would be\npart of a market-based restructuring that is in many ways more fundamental\nthan the universal coverage proposed by Mr. Obama.\n\nWith the goal of making the insurance marketplace more equitable and\ncompetitive, Mr. McCain would end the longstanding exclusion from income\ntaxes of health benefits paid by employers. The 17 million nonelderly people\ncovered by directly purchased insurance do not enjoy that advantage.\n\nMr. McCain would replace the exclusion with refundable health care tax\ncredits of $2,500 per person and $5,000 per family in the hope of driving\nconsumers into the individual insurance market. To help push down premiums,\nhe would allow the purchase of policies across state lines.\n\nCurrently, those who buy insurance individually often face higher costs\nbecause their risks are not spread across broad groups of workers. Though\ninsurers cannot discriminate against participants in group plans, they\nevaluate consumers seeking individual coverage case by case to determine if\nthey are worth the risk of coverage, and at what price. Insurers contend\nthat if they had to charge the same rates to all comers, many would wait\nuntil they were sick to buy policies.\n\nThe McCain campaign recognizes that in an invigorated individual market,\neven larger numbers of chronically ill people would go without the\nprotection afforded by group coverage. High-risk pools would theoretically\nserve to fill the gaps.\n\nCritics argue that, to date, insurers have benefited from the state pools as\nmuch as the uninsured. As long as premiums remain above market rates, the\npools insulate commercial insurers from the greatest risks while giving\ncustomers little incentive to abandon their private policies.\n\n"They are run in ways that protect the profitability of commercial\ninsurers," said Karen Pollitz, a professor at Georgetown\nUniversity<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/g/georgetown_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org>who\nhas studied high-risk pools and who has served on the board of the\nMaryland plan. "They leave the illusion that there\'s a safety net without\nthere really being much of one."\n\nMr. Obama\'s plan differs from Mr. McCain\'s in several ways. In addition to\nrequiring insurers to accept all applicants, he would require that parents\nobtain insurance for their children. To make premiums affordable, he would\ncreate a Medicare-like government plan that would be open to all and pump up\nto $65 billion a year into subsidies. The money would come from repealing\nPresident Bush\'s income tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000 a\nyear.\n\nWhen Mr. McCain unveiled his high-risk pool proposal, his chief domestic\npolicy adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the former director of the Congressional\nBudget Office<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/congressional_budget_office/index.html?inline=nyt-org>,\nestimated the federal cost at $7 billion to $10 billion. Mr. Holtz-Eakin\nsaid five million to seven million uninsured people would be singled out for\ncoverage.\n\nBut in a recent interview, Mr. Holtz-Eakin emphasized that the projections\n"could change dramatically" depending on how the program was structured.\n\nMr. Holtz-Eakin and other McCain health advisers, including Thomas P.\nMiller, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise\nInstitute<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/american_enterprise_institute_for_public_policy_research/index.html?inline=nyt-org>,\nand Stephen T. Parente, a health economist at the University of\nMinnesota<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/university_of_minnesota/index.html?inline=nyt-org>,\nsaid premiums would probably be capped at twice the standard rates. They\nsaid subsidies might be available to those making up to four times the\nfederal poverty level, or $41,600 for a single person.\n\nFinancial incentives would probably be provided to those who effectively\nmanage their diseases. No decision has been made about waiting periods for\npre-existing conditions, the advisers said.\n\nMr. McCain\'s proposal would represent a huge increase over the $50 million a\nyear that Congress now appropriates in grants to the state pools, in a\nprogram that began in 2002. But several analysts questioned whether even $10\nbillion would be nearly enough, given that the states now spend about $2\nbillion to insure 207,000 people.\n\n"I do not for a minute think it will cost 7 to 10 billion dollars a year,"\nMs. Pollitz said. "It may cost 7 to 10 billion dollars a week."\n\nIn an admonition for Mr. McCain, Maryland\'s five-year-old plan, like others\nbefore it, has quickly become a victim of its growth. As enrollment expanded\nby 30 percent in each of the last two years, actuaries forecast insolvency\nas soon as 2010 and compelled the plan\'s board to apply the brakes.\n\nOver the last two years, it has raised premiums, deductibles and\nco-payments, increased out-of-pocket maximums, lowered the lifetime cap on\npayments and added a waiting period for pre-existing conditions, which rose\nto six months from two months on July 1. It also increased the amount\napplicants must pay to buy their way out of the waiting period.\n\nAt the same time, the plan is making more people eligible for subsidies. To\nkeep it afloat, the state is raising the assessment on hospital bills that\nprovides two-thirds of its financing.\n\n"It\'s not easy when you see there is strong demand for something and you\nneed to temper that demand," Mr. Popper, the plan\'s director, said. "But you\neither find a way to slow enrollment through economic forces or you close\nthe plan and no one gets in, which is a solution that no one wants."\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/us/politics/09health.html?_r=1&hp=&oref=slogin&pagewanted=print\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
