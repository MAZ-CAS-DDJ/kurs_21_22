It\'s time to stop playing politics\nand start finding solutions.  If John McCain and George W. Bush were\nserious about addressing this crisis, they would work to create\nalternatives to driving and make cars and trucks more efficient-not push\na land grab for the oil companies."\n\n \n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Agency says opening these waters for\ndrilling won\'t impact prices at all for two decades, and even then the\neffects will be negligible:\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-romm/mccains-cruel-offshore-dr_b_11\n1945.html \n\n \n\n###\n\n \n\nFriends of the Earth Action (www.foeaction.org\n<http://www.foeaction.org/> ) provides extra muscle to our sister\norganization, Friends of the Earth, in legislative battles affecting our\nenvironment.
