(AP Photo/Rahmat Gul)\nTHE BIG IDEA:\n&#8212;\xc2\xa0Because of ISIS and the threat of attacks on the homeland, Syria has been on the front burner and Afghanistan has been on the back burner during the presidential campaign. That\xe2\x80\x99s about to change.\nIn the last few hours, a Taliban suicide bomber killed at least one person and injured 13 more near the airport in Kabul. The incident, just two weeks after a major assault on the city and a week after six U.S. soldiers were killed in another bombing near Bagram air base, underscores the extent to which the situation continues to deteriorate.\n&#8212; \xe2\x80\x9cIn private, top Afghan and American officials have begun to voice increasingly grim assessments of the resurgent Taliban threat,\xe2\x80\x9d The Post\xe2\x80\x99s Sudarsan Raghavan reports from Marja. &#8220;With control of \xe2\x80\x94 or a significant presence in \xe2\x80\x94 roughly 30 percent of districts across the nation, according to Western and Afghan officials, the Taliban now holds more territory than in any year since 2001. \xe2\x80\xa6 Deserters and injured Afghan soldiers say they are fighting a more sophisticated and well-armed insurgency than they have seen in years.&#8221;\n&#8212; The Post\xc2\xa0obtained an eye-opening transcript of a late-October meeting of the Afghan National Security Council that raises serious questions about whether the local government is up for the challenge.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe have not met the people\xe2\x80\x99s expectations. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t delivered,\xe2\x80\x9d Abdullah Abdullah, the country\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, told the high-level gathering. \xe2\x80\x9cOur forces lack discipline. They lack rotation opportunities. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t taken care of our own policemen and soldiers. They continue to absorb enormous casualties.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0At the\xc2\xa0meeting, Gen. John F. Campbell, the commander of U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan, told his Afghan counterparts that he was as guilty as they were of \xe2\x80\x9cjust putting our finger in the dike in Helmand.\xe2\x80\x9d\n&#8212; &#8220;For now, the top American and Afghan priority is preventing Helmand, largely secured by U.S. Marines and British forces in 2012, from again falling to the insurgency,&#8221; Raghavan reports. &#8220;As of last month, about 7,000 members of the Afghan security forces had been killed this year, with 12,000 injured, a 26 percent increase over the total number of dead and wounded in all of 2014. &#8230;U.S. Special Operations troops are increasingly being deployed into harm\xe2\x80\x99s way to assist their Afghan counterparts. Since Nov.\xc2\xa04, four members of the U.S.-led coalition have been wounded in Helmand.&#8221; Read the full story.\n\n&nbsp;\n&#8212;\xc2\xa0Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x99s decline has serious implications for U.S. national security. One of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s first major decisions was to expand the troop presence in the country. This is a major legacy issue for him. How far are the 2016 candidates in both parties willing to go to stop the Taliban? The electorate remains reluctant about open-ended deployments of U.S. boots on the ground. How much more sacrifice Americans are willing to accept, even in this time of rising anxiety about terrorism, is very much an open question.\n&#8212; The Taliban is a barbaric foe&#8230;\xc2\xa0Pamela Constable\xc2\xa0reports from Kabul today\xc2\xa0on\xc2\xa0the beheading of a third-grade girl.\n&#8212; &#8230;but can there be a negotiated peace? From the Associated Press: &#8220;Afghanistan and Pakistan agreed on Sunday to meet with U.S. and Chinese officials in the first weeks of the new year to discuss &#8216;peace-related issues,&#8217; a move that could re-invigorate a stalled peace process with the Taliban, the Afghan president\xe2\x80\x99s office said.\xc2\xa0The development came as Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s powerful army chief Gen.

Beijing has long been working to secure a share of the region\xe2\x80\x99s rich natural resources to fuel China\xe2\x80\x99s industrial economy; it is building a network of security cooperation in Central Asia as a bulwark against Islamist extremism that could leak into China\xe2\x80\x99s restive western province of Xinjiang, and it wants to create alternative trading routes to Europe that bypass Asia\xe2\x80\x99s narrow, congested shipping lanes. Under the Silk Road plan, China also is promising to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build new infrastructure here, and it hopes to reap benefits of its own: to create new markets for Chinese goods, especially for heavy industries such as steel and cement that have suffered as the Chinese economy has slowed.\xe2\x80\x9d\nVladimir Putin has preciously said Russia will add more than 40 new intercontinental ballistic missiles to its nuclear arsenal this year.

The Kremlin later said the video &#8230; should not have been broadcast, and the video was deleted &#8230;\xc2\xa0Russia appears to be creating a tactical nuclear weapon that could be slipped into a harbor, unleashing a tidal wave as well as the devastating effects of a nuclear explosion. It might be used to attack a military target, such as a submarine or naval base, but cities and industry could also be hit. &#8230;\xc2\xa0There are no arms control treaties in place to stop this; smaller tactical nuclear weapons have never been limited by treaty.&#8221;\xc2\xa0Wonder if Trump will weigh in&#8230;\n&#8212; \xe2\x80\x9cThe flawed system that allows companies to make millions off the injured,\xe2\x80\x9d by Terrence McCoy: \xe2\x80\x9cIn all, according to Terrence Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s bank records and court documents, the burn survivor sold $11 million of his structured settlement \xe2\x80\x94 which had a present value of about $8.5 million \xe2\x80\x94 for roughly $1.4 million, or 16 cents on the present dollar. He has sued the companies, focusing on a South Florida firm named Structured Asset Funding, which did six deals with him. That Taylor, who had received diagnoses of learning and emotional disabilities, could so quickly hemorrhage 30 years\xe2\x80\x99 worth of income in deals approved in a courthouse he never visited is the result of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s failure to properly regulate and monitor an industry that makes tens of millions off some of the state\xe2\x80\x99s most vulnerable residents, a Washington Post investigation has found. Unlike traditional settlements, which are paid out in one sum, structured settlements dispense the payout in portions over a lifetime to protect vulnerable people from immediately spending it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n&#8212; \xe2\x80\x9cThe A.I. anxiety,\xe2\x80\x9d by Joel Achenbach: \xe2\x80\x9cNick Bostrom\xe2\x80\x99s underlying concerns about machine intelligence, unintended consequences and potentially malevolent computers have gone mainstream. You can\xe2\x80\x99t attend a technology conference these days without someone bringing up the A.I. anxiety. It hovers over the tech conversation with the high-pitched whine of a 1950s-era Hollywood flying saucer. People will tell you that even Stephen Hawking is worried about it. And Bill Gates. And that Elon Musk gave $10 million for research on how to keep machine intelligence under control. All that is true. \xe2\x80\xa6 This is a topic rife with speculation and perhaps a whiff of hysteria. But the discussion reflects a broader truth: We live in an age in which machine intelligence has become a part of daily life. Computers fly planes and soon will drive cars. Computer algorithms anticipate our needs and decide which advertisements to show us. Machines create news stories without human intervention. Machines can recognize your face in a crowd. &#8230; We don\xe2\x80\x99t know how this will play out.

Mrs. Edelman had sent her to Alabama to help prove that the Nixon administration was not enforcing the legal ban on granting tax-exempt status to so-called segregation academies, the estimated 200 private academies that sprang up in the South to cater to white families after a 1969 Supreme Court decision forced public schools to integrate.\xc2\xa0Her mission was simple: Establish whether the Dothan school was discriminating based on race. &#8230; \xc2\xa0A look at Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s efforts that summer, through archives and interviews with more than 50 local officials, civil rights activists and people who knew her, reveals a summer job that was both out of character for the bookish law student and a moment of awakening.&#8221;\nDonald Trump at Taj Mahal in Atlantic City (Photo by Tom Briglia/FilmMagic)\n&#8212; Los Angeles Times, &#8220;Trump left his mark on Atlantic City \xe2\x80\x94 for better and for worse,&#8221; by Joseph Tanfani:\xc2\xa0&#8220;With his showman&#8217;s knack for positive spin, he depicts his history in Atlantic City, bankruptcies and all, as more proof of his genius for timing. &#8230;\xc2\xa0The real story of Trump&#8217;s rise and fall in Atlantic City is more complicated.

From Think Progress: &#8220;As a result of mounting student pressure to divest, UC removed its $25 million shares from the Geo Group Inc and Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) \xe2\x80\x94 controversial companies linked to human rights abuses across the country.&#8221;\nHOT ON THE RIGHT\nTrump, in response to Trey Gowdy&#8217;s endorsement of Rubio, called the Benghazi hearings a &#8220;disaster.&#8221; From the Washington Examiner: &#8220;He\xc2\xa0did not win with those hearings,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;It was not good for Republicans and for the country. I hope he does a lot better for Marco than he did with the Benghazi hearings.&#8221;\nDAYBOOK:\n&#8211;What&#8217;s happening today on the campaign trail: Donald Trump is holding a rally at 7 p.m. in Nashua, New Hampshire.\xc2\xa0Marco Rubio holds a town hall in Burlington, Iowa. Chris Christie is campaigning in Dubuque in the afternoon before holding a town hall in Davenport in the evening. Martin O&#8217;Malley will attend a leadership forum in Iowa Falls before campaigning in Waterloo and Tama later in the day. John Kasich stops in Manchester and Derry, N.H.\n&#8212; On the Hill: Recess\n&#8211;At the White House:\xc2\xa0President Obama is vacationing in Hawaii.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY:\nThis summer Bernie Sanders got angry when\xc2\xa0interviewers suggested he and Trump were both outsiders tapping into discontent with the status quo. Now, a month out from Iowa, he\xe2\x80\x99s changing his tune. \xe2\x80\x9cMany of Trump&#8217;s supporters are working class people and they&#8217;re angry,\xe2\x80\x9d the democratic socialist said on CBS Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they&#8217;re angry because they&#8217;re working longer hours for lower wages. They&#8217;re angry because their jobs have left this country and gone to China or other low wage countries. They&#8217;re angry because they can&#8217;t afford to send their kids to college or they can&#8217;t retire with dignity. And I think what Trump has done successfully, I would say, is take that anger, take that anxiety about terrorism and say to a lot of people in this country, \xe2\x80\x98Look, the reason for our problems is because of Mexicans.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 For his working class and middle class supporters, I think we can make the case that if we really want to address the issues that people are concerned about &#8230; we need policies that bring us together, that take on the greed of Wall Street, the greed of corporate America and create a middle class that works for all of us, rather than an economy that works just for a few.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.:\n&#8212;\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s noticeably colder with overcast skies for much of the day,\xe2\x80\x9d the Capital Weather Gang forecasts. \xe2\x80\x9cTemperatures trickle down through the 40s. During the afternoon, some patchy light rain and/or drizzle may develop from the southwest. Winds are from the east around 10 mph.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDeSean Jackson and Trent Williams celebrate winning the NFC East division in Philadelphia Saturday.

(Mark Maske)\n&#8212; Are we less safe?\xc2\xa0The District now has\xc2\xa0fewer\xc2\xa0than 3,800 police officers, the smallest force\xc2\xa0in a decade and a number that city officials have previously suggested\xc2\xa0would be dangerous. &#8220;District officials blame the staffing shortfall almost entirely on retirements,&#8221;\xc2\xa0Peter Hermann reports.\xc2\xa0&#8220;But the union representing the rank and file says that the exodus also includes officers and street-level supervisors who are leaving with fewer than 10 years on the force. The union argues that this is evidence officers are fleeing a department and a chief they do not like, as well as a crime plan they say will not make the District safer.&#8221;\n&#8212; \xe2\x80\x9cA state advisory panel is calling for major changes to \xe2\x80\x98Maryland, My Maryland,\xe2\x80\x99 a Civil War-era song that urges Maryland to join the Confederacy, bashes \xe2\x80\x98Northern scum\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 and has survived as the state anthem despite six previous efforts to eliminate it,&#8221;\xc2\xa0Ovetta Wiggins reports.
