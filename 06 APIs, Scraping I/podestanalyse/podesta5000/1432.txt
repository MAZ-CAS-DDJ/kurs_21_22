But the person who will introduce her will tell a story about gun violence in her life, and there will be people in the audience from gun violence orgs.\n\n\nSince she won\'t have a podium, rather than write TPs that cover her broader message, I just did guns.  \n\n\nSee what you think.  Attached and pasted below.\n\n\n\nHILLARY RODHAM CLINTON\nTALKING POINTS ON GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION\nMANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE\nMONDAY, OCTOBER 5, 2015 \n\xc2\xb7     Too many families have stories like Erin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 or worse. \n\xc2\xb7     We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen yet another mass murder \xe2\x80\x93 this time, in a community college in Oregon that\xe2\x80\x99s probably a lot like this one.  That same day, a five-month-old baby girl strapped into her car seat was killed by a stray bullet in Cleveland.  She was the third child killed by a gun in Cleveland in the last month alone. \n\xc2\xb7     We can\xe2\x80\x99t just pray for the victims and their families, and pretend like that\xe2\x80\x99s enough.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not nearly enough.  We need toact. We need to build a movement.\n\xc2\xb7     You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be afraid to go college, or the movies, or a Bible study class, or to drive around your hometown with your kids in the backseat.  What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with us that we can\xe2\x80\x99t we stand up to the NRA and gun manufacturers?\n\xc2\xb7     I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of politicians reacting to gun deaths with what amounts to a shrug.  Here\xe2\x80\x99s what Jeb Bush actually said about the massacre in Oregon: \xe2\x80\x9cLook,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cStuff happens. There\xe2\x80\x99s always a crisis.  And the impulse is always to do something.  And it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily the right thing." \n\xc2\xb7     Governor: you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more wrong.  This kind of violence doesn\xe2\x80\x99t justhappen.  We let it happen.  We let it happen when we don\xe2\x80\x99t take sensible steps to keep guns out of the wrong hands.  We let it happen when we don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to gun dealers who break the rules.  We let it happen when children die and we don\xe2\x80\x99t do a thing about it.\n\xc2\xb7     People who claim they want to lead America shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just accept the mass murder of Americans.  You deserve so much better than that. \n\xc2\xb7     As President, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take on the gun lobby. I\xe2\x80\x99ll fight to stop domestic abusers and people with mental illness from getting guns\xe2\x80\xa6 to revoke the licenses of gun dealers who break the rules\xe2\x80\xa6 to get military-style weapons off our streets\xe2\x80\xa6 and to end the special immunity that protects gun-makers from accountability. \n \xc2\xb7     If Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t act to prevent gun violence, as President, I will.  That\xe2\x80\x99s a promise.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
