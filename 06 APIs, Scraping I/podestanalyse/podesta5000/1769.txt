The FMLA Leave Policy needs to be revised to bring it into compliance with new Federal and DC legal requirements concerning military families.  In addition, the separate statements currently in Section V "Benefits" of the Faculty Handbook and in the Human Resources Policy Manual will be replaced by a single document that will appear in Faculty Handbook section IV "Other Policies Governing Employment at Georgetown University."  The revised policy can be viewed on the Senate website:\n\nhttp://facultysenate.georgetown.edu/pending-business<http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/ctt?kn=2&ms=MjIxMDU2ODIS1&r=NzE1OTM1MTYyNTMS1&b=0&j=NTAwOTgxMzIyS0&mt=1&rt=0>\n\n2. In addition to the FMLA Leave Policy, which applies to staff as well as faculty, Section V of the Faculty Handbook contains the Family Care Leave Policy, which applies to all faculty but not staff.  This will be moved to Faculty Handbook section III.C.10 "Absence and Leave."  No substantive change will be made to this policy.  The rest of Section V of the Faculty Handbook will be replaced by a link to the Office of Faculty and Staff Benefits website, which is the current and authoritative source of information about health care, tuition, retirement and other benefits available to faculty and staff.  For more information about this reorganization, see "Overview of Proposed Changes to the Faculty Handbook Benefits and Leave Sections" at the Senate website above\n\nThe "New Parent Leave Option for Tenure-Line Faculty," which applies to Main Campus faculty only, is not affected by these changes.  It can be found on the Provost\'s website: https://georgetown.app.box.com/s/6qbejgwsnmrqtdlpusmy<http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/ctt?kn=1&ms=MjIxMDU2ODIS1&r=NzE1OTM1MTYyNTMS1&b=0&j=NTAwOTgxMzIyS0&mt=1&rt=0>.\n\nFinally, at its November 13, 2014 meeting, the Senate approved the proposed policy on the confidentiality and transparency of the rank and tenure process, which can be found at the Senate website above.  All three of these revisions will go to the Board of Directors for final approval in February.\n\n'
