It isn\xe2\x80\x99t clear whether that particular question has come up in the meetings she has been having with various policy experts. \n>>> She has been using the meetings to prepare herself for a possible campaign, ground herself in the issues and tease out fresh approaches to stubborn domestic and foreign policy problems, people familiar with the matter said.\n>>> As the former secretary of state keeps a low public profile ahead of announcing her near-certain candidacy, the meetings offer clues to which issues she believes merit attention and whose advice she values. Many, but not all, participants served in Bill Clinton \xe2\x80\x99s administration; others are distinguished primarily by expertise in subjects that are certain to be front-and-center in the 2016 presidential race.\n>>> Some of the meetings had the feeling of a high-octane faculty symposium and lasted for hours, say people familiar with the sessions. Pen and pad in hand, Mrs. Clinton typically has gone around the room to ask for ideas, offering comments now and then and inviting participants to make suggestions down the road.\n>>> In December, Mrs. Clinton presided over a meeting at a midtown Manhattan hotel that focused on middle-class Americans feeling pinched by slow wage growth. \n>>> Among those attending: Mr. Volcker, the architect of the \xe2\x80\x9cVolcker Rule,\xe2\x80\x9d a regulatory measure barring banks from making risky bets with their own money; Jonathan Cowan,            co-founder of the centrist think tank Third Way, which has been critical of some of the populist rhetoric coming from the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 liberal wing; and Alan Blinder , a Princeton professor and former Fed vice chairman and economics adviser to Mr. Clinton.\n>>> Also at the meeting, according to people familiar with it, were Robert Hormats, who worked in the State Department during Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s tenure and was a former vice chairman of Goldman Sachs; Richard Ravitch , a former Democratic lieutenant governor in New York, who helped New York City avert bankruptcy during a fiscal crisis in the 1970s; and Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and proponent of ideas to shore up Americans\xe2\x80\x99 retirement savings. The Clinton team has asked her to help evaluate various policy ideas.\n>>> The participants examined a range of ideas to boost economic security, such as tax cuts for the middle class, expanded access to prekindergarten education and new ways to pay for improvements to roads and tunnels, said people familiar with the session.\n>>> \xe2\x80\x9cOne major focus of the meeting was the miserable recent performance of wages in general and middle-class wages in particular, and what if anything the government can do about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Blinder.\n>>> Bernard Schwartz, a longtime Democratic donor and contributor to the Clinton Foundation, was among those who helped arrange the meeting, said people familiar with the session. Mr. Schwartz is a former chairman of Loral Space & Communications Ltd. Mrs. Clinton also has consulted with Mr. Stiglitz, a former economic adviser to Bill Clinton and author of a book about the perils of economic inequality.\n>>> The policy interests of some participants point to the issues Mrs. Clinton is likely to prioritize, notably the financial pressures faced by middle-class families. Prospective Republican presidential candidates also are talking about shoring up the middle class and, in some cases, narrowing the wage gap in America\xe2\x80\x94a sign that those topics will be flashpoints in the general election.\n>>> Mrs. Clinton is the overwhelming front-runner for the Democratic nomination, but some liberals would like to see her challenged by U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), a populist firebrand who has described the American economic system as \xe2\x80\x9crigged\xe2\x80\x9d in favor of the wealthy. Ms. Warren has said she won\xe2\x80\x99t run. In targeting income inequality, Mrs. Clinton would address a substantive issue facing the country while also making inroads with Ms. Warren\xe2\x80\x99s liberal followers.\n>>> Mrs. Clinton also has held foreign policy meetings in New York and Washington. A New York meeting in the summer was a \xe2\x80\x9ctour\xe2\x80\x9d of global hot spots, among them the war in Syria and Russia\xe2\x80\x99s incursions into Ukraine, according to people familiar with what took place.\n>>> Mrs. Clinton asked for a diagnosis of the problem and a \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic\xe2\x80\x9d view of how the U.S. should act, one person familiar with the meeting said.\n>>> Those who attended included Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who worked under both Republican presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush; David Rothkopf, author of a new book on foreign policy-making in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations; and Dennis Ross, a diplomat with many years of experience in the Middle East peace negotiations.\n>>> More informally, Mrs. Clinton has also spoken to trusted Democratic confidants about appointments to high-level positions in her campaign, should she decide to run.\n>>> A campaign apparatus is already taking shape.
