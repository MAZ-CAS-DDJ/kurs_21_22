Helderman\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/rosalind-s-helderman> October 12 at\n2:22 PM\n\n\n\nFor the four years that Hillary Rodham Clinton was secretary of state, her\nlongtime friend and adviser Cheryl D. Mills served next to her as chief of\nstaff. Clinton has said Mills helped her run the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s\nsprawling bureaucracy, oversaw key priorities such as food safety, global\nhealth policy and LGBT rights, and acted as \xe2\x80\x9cmy principal liaison to the\nWhite House on sensitive matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDuring her first four months at State, Mills also held another high-profile\njob: She worked part time at New York University, negotiating with\nofficials in Abu Dhabi to build a campus in that Persian Gulf city.\n\nAt State, she was unpaid, officially designated as a temporary\nexpert-consultant \xe2\x80\x94 a status that allowed her to continue to collect\noutside income while serving as chief of staff. She reported that NYU paid\nher $198,000 in 2009, when her university work overlapped with her time at\nthe State Department, and that she collected an additional $330,000 in\nvacation and severance payments when she left the school\xe2\x80\x99s payroll in May\n2009.\n\nThe arrangement, which Mills discussed for the first time publicly in an\ninterview with The Washington Post, is another example of how Clinton as\nsecretary allowed close aides to conduct their public work even as they\nperformed jobs benefiting private interests. Another key Clinton aide, Huma\nAbedin, spent her last six months as Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s deputy chief of staff in\n2012 simultaneously employed by the Clinton Foundation, the family\xe2\x80\x99s global\ncharity, and a consulting company with close Clinton connections.\nSimilarly, Mills remained on the Clinton Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s unpaid board for a\nshort time after joining State.\n\nMills\xe2\x80\x99s situation raises questions about how one of the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s\ntop employees set boundaries between her public role and a private job that\ninvolved work on a project funded by a foreign government. The arrangement\nappears to fall within federal ethics rules, but Republican lawmakers have\naccused Clinton of allowing potential conflicts of interest at the State\nDepartment.\n\nIn the interview, Mills rejected the suggestion of a conflict. She said her\nemployment status was approved by career professionals at the State\nDepartment and was arranged because she initially intended to serve as\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff only briefly before returning full time to her job\nas general counsel at NYU. Her goal, she said, was to help Clinton\ntransition to her new role and then hire her own replacement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s what I do. I try to understand the rules and follow them,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I try to make sure that I\xe2\x80\x99m disclosing my obligations. . . . Our\ngovernment anticipates that there will be occasions where people are\nworking outside, so they are earning outside income and doing other things.\nWhat they do is have a framework for how you actually need to follow those\nrules. That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something I try to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe added: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99m ever perfect. But I was obviously trying\nvery hard to make sure I was following those rules and guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMills reported her NYU income on public federal disclosure forms. She did\nnot reference the United Arab Emirates element of her role on the forms,\nwhich ask only that employees identify the sources and amount of their\noutside income.\n\nWhen asked whether a State Department ethics officer had reviewed the\nspecifics of her work on the UAE project, she did not directly answer.\nInstead, she said that generally the ethics office \xe2\x80\x9cgives everybody advice\nand guidance on their things, because anybody who is an employee who is\ncoming in might have any number of things that require guidance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA State Department spokesman indicated that Mills was not required to file\na financial disclosure form for the period. In any case, the disclosure she\nfiled for 2009 reflected the outside income and was signed by an agency\nethics officer after she had joined the department full time.\n\nUnder ethics laws, employees are prohibited from participating in matters\nthat would have a direct and predictable effect on themselves or an outside\nemployer.\n\nMills said she didn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9crecall any issues\xe2\x80\x9d at State that would have required\nher to consider recusing herself, but said she would have consulted with\nthe ethics office if one had come up.\n\nNick Merrill, a spokesman for Clinton, declined to comment.\n\nMills\xe2\x80\x99s service on the board of NYU\xe2\x80\x99s campus in the Middle East was first\nreported in June by the Washington Free Beacon, an online conservative Web\nsite. But the extent of her work on the project during those months has not\nbeen previously reported.\n\nMills, 50, has been a trusted adviser to both Clintons since she went to\nwork for Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s White House as a young lawyer educated at Stanford\nLaw School and later helped defend him during impeachment proceedings. She\nhas largely kept a low profile, providing legal counsel and other advice to\nthe couple, including working for Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 presidential\ncampaign. She rarely grants interviews.\n\nIn recent months, Mills has emerged as a central player in various\ncontroversies that have dogged Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 presidential bid.\n\nShe was one of few staff members who knew from the beginning about Hillary\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s decision to use only a personal e-mail account as secretary of\nstate. She oversaw last year\xe2\x80\x99s process that determined which e-mails from\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s account were considered work-related and should be turned over to\nthe State Department for public release, and which were personal and could\nbe deleted. And, last month, she testified for nine hours behind closed\ndoors before the Republican-led House committee investigating the 2012\nattacks on U.S. diplomatic sites in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nCommittee Democrats have indicated that they will release a transcript of\nMills\xe2\x80\x99s testimony this week.\n\nMills\xe2\x80\x99s decision to join Clinton at State in 2009 \xe2\x80\x94 as recalled by both\nwomen \xe2\x80\x94 was a difficult one.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe told me she would help with my transition to State but did not want to\nleave NYU for a permanent role in the government,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton wrote of Mills\nin her book, \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThankfully, she changed her mind about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nClinton also described how she had come to rely on Mills\xe2\x80\x99s counsel over two\ndecades. \xe2\x80\x9cShe talked fast and thought even faster; her intellect was like a\nsharp blade, slicing and dicing every problem she encountered,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton\nwrote. \xe2\x80\x9cShe also had a huge heart, boundless loyalty, rock-solid integrity,\nand a deep commitment to social justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMills, in the interview, said she could not, at first, envision doing the\njob while also devoting herself to her twin children, who were 3 at the\ntime.\n\nBut, she said, Clinton is \xe2\x80\x9ca very persuasive woman,\xe2\x80\x9d and she found a way to\nbalance the job with her home life.\n\nAlthough a chief of staff typically would be part of the \xe2\x80\x9csenior executive\nservice,\xe2\x80\x9d Mills was for her first four months assigned a lower federal rank\nof \xe2\x80\x9cGS-15,\xe2\x80\x9d a designation more commonly assigned to career employees. She\nwas given the higher executive rank when she became a paid employee in May\n2009, earning $177,000 a year.\n\nThe distinction was important: Federal regulations limited outside income\nallowed for senior executive officials, while there was no limit on GS-15\nemployees. In 2009, the cap for senior executive service employees would\nhave been about $26,000.\n\nIn addition to her payments from NYU, Mills\xe2\x80\x99s disclosures and Federal\nElection Commission records show she collected $60,000 from Clinton-related\npolitical action committees in her first weeks at the State Department. She\nindicated that the compensation reflected work completed before she began\nas chief of staff.\n\nMills said she was not aware at the time what designation the State\nDepartment had given her. \xe2\x80\x9cI had to sit down and say, \xe2\x80\x98Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not\nintending to stay. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be working part time and I\xe2\x80\x99m ultimately\ngoing to transition out. And I want to make sure that whatever is the right\nway to do that, I do it that right way,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nIn recent years, more than 100 State Department employees annually have\ntypically been granted a designation that allows them to hold outside\nemployment, including scientists, foreign affairs officers and Abedin, a\nsenior adviser. However, experts said that a dual employment arrangement is\nrare at the chief-of-staff level, and that the nature of Mills\xe2\x80\x99s\nnon-governmental work made her situation even more atypical.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is exceedingly unusual, perhaps exceptional in the history of modern\nfederal bureaucratic leadership. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen it before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul C.\nLight, an NYU professor who has studied government employment in depth for\ndecades and is a former head of the Center for Public Service at the\nBrookings Institution.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m amazed that anyone would take on such a wide-ranging agenda and live\nto tell about it, especially given the competing demands on her time and\nthe sharp boundaries between the worlds she had to navigate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nRichard W. Painter, who served as a White House ethics lawyer under\nPresident George W. Bush, said Mills\xe2\x80\x99s work probably complied with the law\nprovided she did no work at State that would financially affect NYU and its\noverseas campus.\n\nStill, he called the appearance of the arrangement \xe2\x80\x9cproblematic\xe2\x80\x9d and said\nhe thinks it would have been best handled if State Department lawyers were\n\xe2\x80\x9cclosely monitoring\xe2\x80\x9d both Mills\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities for NYU and the\nuniversity\xe2\x80\x99s interests around the world.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this level, that you would make someone a GS-15 and yet have them\ncontinue to be a lawyer for a large academic institution or a large law\nfirm \xe2\x80\x94 that I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Painter, who is a professor at the\nUniversity of Minnesota Law School.\n\nBeth Wilkinson, a lawyer for Mills, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Ms. Mills began her public\nservice at the State Department, she followed the ethics rules. No one\ndisputes that she disclosed her work with NYU to the department, and that\nthe Ethics Office reviewed and certified her disclosure form finding she\nhad no conflict of interest.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor Mills, part of the quandary, she said, was that she loved her work for\nNYU, which she began in 2002.\n\nAt the time, her focus was on opening NYU\xe2\x80\x99s campus in the United Arab\nEmirates, a project administered by the private university but, according\nto NYU, funded by the Abu Dhabi government. Mills had worked on the project\nsince it was announced in 2007 and it remained in the planning phase as she\nentered the State Department in 2009.\n\nMills said her responsibilities included negotiating free-speech provisions\nfor students and faculty, navigating how same-sex and unmarried couples\ncould work at the university given the country\xe2\x80\x99s conservative laws, and\nworking to ensure labor protections for workers constructing campus\nbuildings.\n\nThe talks took place, she said, with \xe2\x80\x9cquasi-governmental if not\ngovernmental\xe2\x80\x9d officials designated by the Abu Dhabi-owned investment\ncompany that was developing the campus.\n\nThe issues were difficult, she said, because \xe2\x80\x9cUAE\xe2\x80\x99s culture is very\ndifferent than ours. So when you are taking a university like NYU and\nplacing it in an environment that has different laws and different customs\nand different rules, there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole set of different challenges.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe UAE has in recent years become one of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 most important\nallies in the Middle East. However, the relationship is complex, in part\nbecause of human rights concerns in the Gulf nation. Abu Dhabi is the UAE\xe2\x80\x99s\ncapital city.\n\nMills said she decided to take no pay from the U.S. government during her\nfirst four months as Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff because she considered the\njob \xe2\x80\x9ca matter of service.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n*[Clinton e-mails reinvigorate inquiry into allies who got special job\nstatus\n<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clinton-e-mails-prompt-another-inquiry-on-capitol-hill/2015/03/09/db3cd3b4-c374-11e4-9ec2-b418f57a4a99_story.html>]*\n\nBoth during and after the four-month period of Mills\xe2\x80\x99s dual employment,\nthere were occasions when she seemed to function as a conduit between NYU\nand her State Department boss.\n\nAfter Clinton spoke at an NYU graduation ceremony in New York in May 2009,\na top university official e-mailed Mills to thank her for her \xe2\x80\x9chelp and\nguidance\xe2\x80\x9d in getting Clinton to the event, according to correspondence\nrecently released by the State Department.\n\nIn 2011, Mills forwarded to Clinton an e-mail she had received from a\nuniversity official describing a new NYU campus planned for Shanghai.\n\nNYU\xe2\x80\x99s Abu Dhabi campus accepted its first students in 2010 in temporary\nquarters before moving to a newly constructed campus. Last year, the New\nYork Times reported that construction workers at the site had been\nmistreated, in violation of a 2009 statement of values adopted by NYU that\nwas to govern construction. NYU apologized and promised to investigate.\n\nIn May 2014, the school held its first graduation in Abu Dhabi, and Bill\nClinton delivered the commencement address.\n\nJohn Beckman, a spokesman for NYU, called Mills a \xe2\x80\x9chighly valued, respected\nand hard-working member of the senior leadership team at NYU\xe2\x80\x9d who worked on\n\xe2\x80\x9cimportant projects\xe2\x80\x9d during her seven years with the university.\n\nThe arrangement has drawn the attention of Republican lawmakers such as\nSen. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa), who has criticized Clinton for allowing\nher top aides to work for private entities.\n\nGrassley said Mills\xe2\x80\x99s work on a foreign project adds pressure to the State\nDepartment to release more details of her roles, including any ethics\nagreements that governed the arrangement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe public should have the information to know whether the State\nDepartment properly manages conflicts of interest,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a statement.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rules are meant to ensure that the public comes first and that no one\nis taking unfair advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMills declined an offer to join Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 bid and now runs her own\ncompany building businesses in Africa, offering advice to the campaign, she\nsaid, only informally.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile I appreciate she is someone who has an outsized public persona,\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s also a very real human being, and someone who is very near and dear\nto my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I do my best to be a good friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\n*Ian Sams* | Rapid Response\n\nHillary for America\n\n(423) 915-6592 | @IanSams <https://twitter.com/iansams>\n\nGchat: icsams\n"
