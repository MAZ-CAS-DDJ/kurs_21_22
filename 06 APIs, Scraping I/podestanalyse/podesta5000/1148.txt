Its implementation will increase US access to growing markets across the region while eliminating thousands of import tariffs and other barriers to free international trade. The deal also strengthens relationships between the US and vital partners including Japan, Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Mexico.\n\nDespite its strong economic and security benefits, TPP faces significant scrutiny in a politically divided congress. While fast-track trade authority removes threats of amendments and filibusters, its successful passage is far from certain.\n\nThis event will include a panel discussion featuring key leaders well versed in the economic and security impact of free trade from several TPP nations. The event will conclude with a keynote address from Representative Don Beyer (D, VA-8), former Ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein.\n\nThe event will be live tweeted, using the hashtag #ASPTrade and will include an Event Review to be published on ASP\xe2\x80\x99s website. Full video and audio recordings will also be made available via the website.\nLunch refreshments will be served from 12:00pm - 12:30pm.\n\n\n** Please arrive by 12:00pm for registration.\n\nThe event will be begin promptly at 12:30pm.\n------------------------------------------------------------\n12:30 pm - 1:30 pm: Panel Discussion\n* Mr. Kanji Yamanouchi, Minister for Economic Affairs, Embassy of Japan\n* Dr. Robert J.
