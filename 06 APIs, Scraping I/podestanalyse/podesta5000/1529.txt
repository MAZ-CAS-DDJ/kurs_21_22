john.podesta@gmail.comb'Highlights from this morning\'s Wall Street Journal/NBC poll reaffirm Obama\'s\ngains among women, Hillary voters, and strong showing with Latinos and\nIndependents. McCain\'s image has suffered as Obama\'s has become even more\npositive.\n\n\n   - Sen. Obama leads Sen. McCain by 47% to 41%, a spread that is twice the\n   edge he had in the previous\npoll<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120959262155757509.html?mod=Politics-and-Policy>,\n   in late April.\n\n\n   - Among all women, Sen. Obama has a big advantage: 52 to 33.\n      - White suburban women (10 percent of the electorate) prefer a\n         Democrat to be president by 11 points, 47 to 36. Yet Sen.\nObama loses to\n         Sen. McCain by six points, 44 to 38, among the same group.\n      - Among all men, Sen. McCain\'s lead is 49 to 41.\n      - Independent voters support Obama 41 to 36.\n      - Clinton primary voters said by a 3-to-1 ratio, 61% to 19%, that they\n      plan to vote for Sen. Obama over Sen. McCain in November.\n      - By 62% to 28%, Hispanic voters support Sen. Obama. "That does not\n      bode well for Republicans" in the Southwest, the Republican\npollster added,\n      in swing states such as Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado, where Hispanic\n      voters are numerous enough to tip the result. Sen. McCain, who\ncomes from a\n      state with a large Hispanic population and has favored\nliberalizing policies\n      toward illegal immigrants, has hopes of matching Mr. Bush\'s record of\n      winning more than 40% of Hispanic voters.\n   -\n\n   *Obama Support More Enthusiastic.* While half of pro-Obama voters say\n   they are motivated mainly by support for him, rather than opposition to Sen.\n   McCain and Republicans, fewer than 40 percent of McCain voters are motivated\n   by support for him personally.\n   - *McCain Image Suffers, Obama Improves*. McCain\'s negatives are up\n   slightly while Obama\'s favorability increased. For McCain, 39 percent hold\n   positive views and 34 percent negative\n      - In the April poll, voters by a 10-point spread, 40 percent to 30\n      percent, rated Sen. McCain favorably\n\n\n   - *Change Election. *But by a majority of 54% to 42%, voters say they\'d\n   prefer a president "who will bring greater changes" over one who is "more\n   experienced and tested."\n\n\n Obama Leads McCain, But Race Is Looking Tight Edge of Six Points\nSeems Small Given\nGOP\'s Unpopularity\nBy *JACKIE CALMES*\nJune 12, 2008; Page A8\n\nWASHINGTON -- Barack Obama begins his presidential race against John McCain\nwith a lead in the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News\npoll<http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/WSJ_NBC_SURVEY_June2008.pdf>,\nbut not so great an edge as might be expected, given the gale-force\npolitical headwinds against Sen. McCain\'s Republican Party.\n\nSen. Obama leads Sen. McCain by 47% to 41%, a spread that is twice the edge\nhe had in the previous\npoll<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120959262155757509.html?mod=Politics-and-Policy>,\nin late April. Still, that lead is significantly smaller than the Democratic\nParty\'s 16-point advantage, 51% to 35%, when voters are asked, without\ncandidates\' names, which party they want to win the White House.\n\nThe record unpopularity of President Bush and the Republican Party, combined\nwith economic worries among voters and a broad desire for change, would\nnormally make this "the single best year for an Obama-type candidacy, and\nthe single worst year for a McCain-type candidacy," says Democratic pollster\nPeter Hart, who conducts the Journal/NBC poll with Republican Neil Newhouse.\n\nBut Sen. Obama continues to do poorly among white male voters, according to\nthe poll. More ominous is his weakness among white suburban women, who\ngenerally are open to Democratic candidates and whose votes could be\ndecisive. While Sen. Obama has a slight lead among white women generally, a\nplurality of suburbanites prefer Sen. McCain.\n\nSome good news for the likely Democratic nominee: Despite suggestions during\nthe nomination contest that many Hispanics and Hillary Clinton supporters\nwouldn\'t support him, the poll shows both groups overwhelmingly do.\n\nThe poll of 1,000 registered voters was conducted Friday through Monday, a\n"propitious time" for Sen. Obama, Mr. Hart noted, as Sen. Clinton conceded\nand endorsed her rival Saturday. Despite that timing and an "exceptionally\nstrong" year for Democrats generally, Sens. Obama and McCain are in "a very\ncompetitive race for president," he says. The poll\'s margin of error is 3.1\npercentage points.\n\nWhite men make up 40% of the electorate, and the Arizona senator has a\n20-point lead over Sen. Obama among them, 55% to 35%. The pollsters say race\ndoes not explain the gap; recent Democratic nominees, all white men, lost\nbig among white men.\n[image: [Tight Race]]\n\nThe pollsters note that pluralities of white male voters say they don\'t like\nSen. Obama and don\'t relate to his background and perceived values. In\ncontrast, by a 2-to-1 ratio, they express positive views of Sen. McCain and\nidentify with his background and values. The difference is less stark for\nvoters overall. By 50% to 42%, they identify with Sen. Obama, and by 55% to\n37% with Sen. McCain.\n\nThe pollsters say Sen. Obama\'s lower ratings reflect the wounds from his\nlong contest against Sen. Clinton. In particular, he suffered from\ncontroversies over the racially charged sermons of his longtime Chicago\npastor and the perceived elitism of his own remark at a San Francisco\nfund-raiser that working-class voters are "bitter" about inattention to\ntheir economic struggles and "cling" to social issues of religion and guns.\n\nWhite suburban women, who make up 10% of the electorate, prefer a Democrat\nto be president by 11 points, 47% to 36%, the poll shows. And if Sen.\nClinton were the nominee and the election were held now, she would beat Sen.\nMcCain among this group by 14 points, 51% to 37%. Yet Sen. Obama loses to\nSen. McCain by six points, 44% to 38%, among the same group.\n\nThe poll offers some evidence that Sen. Obama could be helped slightly by\npicking Sen. Clinton as his running mate. Offered a choice between an\nObama-Clinton ticket and a Republican ticket of Sen. McCain and former\nMassachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, 39% of previously undecided voters said they\nwould choose the Democrats, with 26% favoring the Republicans. Among white\nsuburban women, with Sen. Clinton on his ticket, Sen. Obama would go from\nsix points down against Sen. McCain to a two-point edge.\n\nObama advisers privately have indicated Sen. Clinton is not a likely choice.\nPolls and politics aside, a big consideration is the potential conflict\ninherent in having a vice president whose spouse is a former president and\nactive internationally. Still, Mr. Newhouse says of Sen. Obama\'s search,\n"You\'ve got to look at anybody who moves your numbers." Mr. Hart agrees:\n"She should be on the list, period."\n\nAmong all women, Sen. Obama has a big advantage: 52% to 33% over Sen.\nMcCain. Among all men, Sen. McCain\'s lead is 49% to 41%, less than half his\nedge among white men only. Sen. Obama leads among independent voters, 41% to\n36%.\n\nTo Sen. Obama\'s advantage, the Journal/NBC poll results seem to debunk two\nwidely held conclusions from the Democrats\' nomination contest. Exit polls\nof Democratic voters suggested many of Sen. Clinton\'s supporters wouldn\'t\nvote for Sen. Obama in November if he is the Democratic nominee. In\nparticular, pro-Clinton Hispanics were generally thought to be cold to Sen.\nObama.\n\nIn the poll, however, voters who chose Sen. Clinton in the primaries said by\na 3-to-1 ratio, 61% to 19%, that they plan to vote for Sen. Obama over Sen.\nMcCain in November. "Hillary\'s embrace of Obama really made a difference,"\nMr. Newhouse says.\n\nBy 62% to 28%, Hispanic voters support Sen. Obama. "That does not bode well\nfor Republicans" in the Southwest, the Republican pollster added, in swing\nstates such as Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado, where Hispanic voters are\nnumerous enough to tip the result. Sen. McCain, who comes from a state with\na large Hispanic population and has favored liberalizing policies toward\nillegal immigrants, has hopes of matching Mr. Bush\'s record of winning more\nthan 40% of Hispanic voters.\n\nAnother Obama advantage: his supporters\' satisfaction and excitement with\nhis candidacy. While half of pro-Obama voters say they are motivated mainly\nby support for him, rather than opposition to Sen. McCain and Republicans,\nfewer than 40% of McCain voters are motivated by support for him personally.\nThat is a measure of voter energy that could translate into greater turnout\nfor Sen. Obama in November.\n\nIf that energy gap persists, Mr. Hart says, "it is going to be a huge\nproblem for Republicans this fall." Mr. Newhouse agreed: "It is not that\nthese voters aren\'t for McCain," he says. What\'s lacking is "the enthusiasm,\nthe passion, the energy" of the other side.\n\n"I think the real story is the shadow that George Bush is casting over this\nelection," Mr. Newhouse adds. What\'s hurting Sen. McCain is voters\' sense\nthat "he will pattern his policies after George W."\n\nMr. Hart called the president "a 200-pound ball and chain" around McCain\'s\nankle, a linkage Sen. Obama and the Democratic National Committee are trying\nto reinforce daily in voters\' minds. "Unless he finds some way to cut it\nloose," Mr. Hart adds, "he\'s going to be dragging it right through the\nelection."\n\nThe anti-Bush evidence is overwhelming. The latest poll findings add to the\nstretch of more than three years in which majorities have expressed\ndisapproval of Mr. Bush\'s job performance. And increasingly, voters don\'t\nlike him personally. By 60% to 30%, they have negative views of him, his\nworst showing ever.\n\nMr. Newhouse says it is a measure of Mr. Bush\'s dismal standing that his\nbest job-approval score is for handling the unpopular war in Iraq: Only 33%\napprove, yet that is 12 points higher than his rating for handling the\neconomy and five points higher than his overall-job score.\n\nThe Republican Party remains unpopular, with 47% of voters holding negative\nviews and 28% expressing positive ones. In contrast, the Democratic Party is\nviewed more positively, with 43% holding a favorable view to 32% negative.\n\nSen. McCain\'s own negatives are up slightly among all voters, while Sen.\nObama is viewed more positively. For the Republican, 39% hold positive views\nand 34% negative; in the April poll, voters by a 10-point spread, 40% to\n30%, rated Sen. McCain favorably.\n\nBy 15 points, voters view Sen. Obama more favorably than negatively, 48% to\n33%, up from a nine-point net positive rating in late April. Separate\nfindings show he also is seen as more likeable, easy-going, inspirational\nand compassionate than Sen. McCain. The 71-year-old Arizona senator scores\nhigher than his 46-year-old rival for experience, leadership qualities and\nreadiness to be commander in chief.\n\nBut by a majority of 54% to 42%, voters say they\'d prefer a president "who\nwill bring greater changes" over one who is "more experienced and tested."\n\nAs in recent Journal/NBC polls, 70% of voters believe the country is "on the\nwrong track." The same percentage agreed "America is in a state of decline"\nand that is the highest figure recorded since the question was first asked\nin 1991. Mr. Newhouse says that perception of decline suggests voters fear\nthe nation\'s problems may not be temporary or easily overcome, and it\nexplains their overwhelming desire for change.\n\nConcerns about the Iraq war and the economy dwarf all other issues,\nincluding terrorism, illegal immigration, the mortgage mess, the environment\nand global warming. Congress\'s 79% to 13% disapproval rating is the worst in\nthe Journal/NBC poll\'s 18-year history. Yet voters prefer that Congress, not\nMr. Bush, take the lead on the issue of energy and gasoline prices. Their\nsense that Congress has not done so -- that it is "a bystander," in Mr.\nNewhouse\'s words -- may explain its low score, he says.\n\n*Write to *Jackie Calmes at jackie.calmes@wsj.com\n\n\n-- \nRebecca Buckwalter-Poza\nProgressive Media USA\nrbuckwalterpoza@progressivemediausa.org\n202-609-7674 (o)\n919-423-4783 (m)\n\n-- \nRebecca Buckwalter-Poza\nProgressive Media USA\nrbuckwalterpoza@progressivemediausa.org\n202-609-7674 (o)\n919-423-4783 (m)\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
