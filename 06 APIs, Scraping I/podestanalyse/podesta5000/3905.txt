His dad was less enthused about its $400 price tag. He told Jack he should start a lemonade stand and even loaned him money to get his business off the ground. \n\nA year later, Jack's Lemonade Stands is a successful franchise, and its CEO is one of the youngest and brightest entrepreneurs I've ever met. \n\nI ran for Congress because I've been fortunate enough to experience the American Dream. Whether that dream is a home with a white picket fence -- or in Jack's case, a Lego Death Star -- I want to make sure everybody has the same shot at success. \n\nAccess to a quality education is key to that, and it's why I spend so much time in Congress working on the issue. But more and more, a good education is not enough. We need meaningful reforms and big ideas to create an economy that rewards hard work and innovation. \n\nPlease send your thoughts and ideas on what we can do to build an economy that works for everyone, encourages innovation, and rewards hard work.\n\nShare your ideas: http://salsa3.salsalabs.com/o/50376/p/salsa/web/common/public/signup?signup_page_KEY=10192\n\nHere in Colorado, I've been meeting with employers and employees to get their ideas and feedback on what more can be done to level the playing field for all Americans. But I need to hear from you too. \n\nHard work and innovation are bedrock principals that have made our country great. That's why I am proud to stand with President Obama and support his plan to change overtime rules ensuring people get paid for the hours they work - plain and simple.  It's good for the middle class and good for our entire economy. \n\nBut that's just a start. Please send me your ideas for ways we can create a stronger economy.\n\nShare your ideas: http://salsa3.salsalabs.com/o/50376/p/salsa/web/common/public/signup?signup_page_KEY=10192\n\nThank you, \n\nJared Polis \n\nContribute [ https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/polisseptembereom?refcode=em_09092015legodeathstar ]\nPaid for by Friends of Jared Polis\nContributions or gifts to Friends of Jared Polis are not tax deductible.\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, visit http://salsa3.salsalabs.com/o/50376/p/salsa/supporter/unsubscribe/public/?Email=john.podesta@gmail.com&email_blast_KEY=1329455"
