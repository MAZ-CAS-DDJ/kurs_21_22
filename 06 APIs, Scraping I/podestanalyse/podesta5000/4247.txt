I don't know if he will, but think he has the right mix of expertise and standing. Caldera will join the team. I know you are juggling countless more important issues but I would like your ok to move forward.\r\n \r\nMany thanks. -sarah \r\n\r\n\t-------------- Original message -------------- \r\n\tFrom: Juliana Gendelman <jgendelman@americanprogress.org> \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tJust a reminder that the call is starting now.
