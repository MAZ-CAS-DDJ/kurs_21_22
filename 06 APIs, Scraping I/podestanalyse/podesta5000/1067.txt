One was to save the earth through helping to build a better, more sustainable think tank office culture.\n\nThe other was to dive Scrooge McDuck style into a pool of electronic waste.\n\nNeedless to say, I was a strange kid. But, this Thursday, June 11, 2015 you at CAP have the chance to make both of my dreams come true.\n\nOur building will be hosting eAsset Solutions, a certified local Computer & Electronics Recycling Company, to haul away and recycling all E-Waste at CAP. They will arrive between 10:00am - 11:00am and will be professionally collecting and removing any recyclables you wish to get rid of directly from your office.  Please also feel free to bring any items from home.\n\nIf you want to participate please click the link below to enroll:\n\n<Tenant e-Waste Pickup Request>\nThursday, June 11, 2015\n1333 H Street, NW\nWashington DC 20005<http://www.eassetsolutions.com/events/forms/6a1d38790ca9598b0cd5261c776c811b/form.html>\n\nYou can also visit their website<http://eassetsolutions.com/> for more information. All of this is free, with the one exception being CRT Monitors/TVs, which are billed at $1 per inch of screen size.\n\nExamples of Accepted Materials include, but are not limited to:\n\nDesktop PCs\n\nLaptops\n\nServers\n\nLCD Monitors/TVs\n\nPhones\n\nCables/Wires\n\nKeyboards/Mice\n\nServer Racks\n\nPower Supplies\n\nUPS Batteries\n\nPrinters/Copiers\n\nToner/Ink\n\nRouters/Switches\n\nSpeakers\n\nAnd More!<http://www.eassetsolutions.com/eAsset%20Solutions%20Acceptable%20Materials.pdf>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch of this equipment contains poisonous materials, such as lead and mercury, which is why it doesn't belong in landfills, and why it's a terrible idea for me to dive in. Also to note is that all of your confidential and sensitive data is removed and destroyed during the process. A Certificate of Recycling & Data Destruction is always provided to Property Management and is available to all tenants.\n\nPlease call eAsset Solutions directly at 703-534-5865<tel:703-534-5865> or email at info@eassetsolutions.com<mailto:info@eassetsolutions.com> with any questions.\n\nThanks,\nAlex Ault\n\n[http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--n6U3P_Hc--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_358,q_80,w_636/17kdjxvdqvygyjpg.jpg]<http://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CAcQjRw&url=http://gizmodo.com/5904097/how-much-money-do-you-need-to-do-scrooge-mcducks-money-swim&ei=QLZ1VfzcMqPksATz94DQCw&bvm=bv.95039771,d.cWc&psig=AFQjCNF4XK4h7JhS62dpSXgZV-XcpAjnEQ&ust=1433864120229323>\n\n\n\n"
