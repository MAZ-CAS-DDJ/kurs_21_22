The librarian, Carol Kreck, was merely carrying a sign that said: McCain = Bush.\n\nAs our state moves to the national spotlight later this summer, you can bet there will be more occurrences like this.  And you can bet we'll be there to document and publicize it (you can watch the video by clicking on the picture or the links below.)\n\nAfter you've seen it for yourself, I hope you'll pitch in and help us help Coloradans like Carol Kreck.  Please make a donation today at the following link: \n\nhttp://progressnowaction.org/KreckDefenseFund\n\nHere's the thing: while other people in line were sporting pro-McCain messages only the 60 year-old librarian was cited - for trespassing and ordered to appear in court July 23rd.  That's just wrong. And illegal.  \n\nWe believe her First Amendment Rights were violated and we're going to help her fight back.   We can't allow this instance to set the precedent for how Colorado treats its citizens who choose to make good on their freedom of speech during a critical election year.  \n\nPlease help us help Kreck by making a donation clicking the following link: \n\nhttp://progressnowaction.org/KreckDefenseFund\n\nThank you,\n\nMichael Huttner\n\nProgressNowAction \n\n\n_________\n\n\xa9 2008 ProgressNowAction.org.
