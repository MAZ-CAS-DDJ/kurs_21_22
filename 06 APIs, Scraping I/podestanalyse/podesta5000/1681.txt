john.podesta@gmail.comb'Here\'s the statement we put out earlier today from UA (The Plumbers\nunion) on last night\'s debate.\n\nFor Immediate Release\t\t\tContact: Alison Omens\n202-637-5018\n\nStatement by United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the\nPlumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry (UA) Assistant General President\nSteve Kelly\non McCain\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cJoe the Plumber\xe2\x80\x9d\nOctober 16, 2008\n\nLast night John McCain made Joe the Plumber a household name. His\nmanufactured outrage on behalf of Joe would be a lot more believable if\nhis economic plan had anything to do with helping working people deal\nwith the economic crisis. Instead, it washes the middle class down the\ndrain. McCain\xe2\x80\x99s plan gives massive tax giveaways to CEOs and\nmega-corporations while leaving working families out in the cold. At a\ntime when our economy is bleeding jobs, McCain also opposes investment\nin infrastructure spending, which would create good jobs and help put\nour economy back on solid footing.\n\nAs the first union to endorse Barack Obama for the presidency, the UA\nlooked long and hard at which candidates would put the needs of all the\nJoes in America first. Barack Obama has a plan to cut taxes for working\npeople while investing in good jobs and lifting wages. Unlike\nMcCain\xe2\x80\x99s, Obama\xe2\x80\x99s outrage for the middle class is real. He will\nturn us in a new direction, not keep us on the same, tired old path of\nthe Bush years. \n\n###\n\nPaid for by the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Education (COPE)\nPolitical Contributions Committee, www.aflcio.org (\nhttp://www.aflcio.org/ ), and not authorized by any candidate or\ncandidate\xe2\x80\x99s committee.\n\n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
