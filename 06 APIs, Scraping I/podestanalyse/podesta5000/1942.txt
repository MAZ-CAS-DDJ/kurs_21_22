Mitt Romney is going to raise tens of millions of dollars off of the Paul Ryan VP announcement.\n\nWe have to get President Obama's back right now:\n\nJohn, will you donate $3 or whatever you can to support President Obama's agenda? http://www.dccc.org/prsj-4a\n\nRyan's fundraising tour starts immediately. This week alone, he's heading to 5 different big-money fundraisers in the vital swing states of Ohio, Virginia, and Florida.\n\nDon't let them use this moment to beat us. Help us keep pace:\n\nhttp://www.dccc.org/prsj-4a\n\nThanks,\n\nKelly\n\nKelly Ward\nDCCC Political Director\n\n\n\n\nThis message was emailed to: john.podesta@gmail.com\n\nTo unsubscribe from this email list, please paste this URL into your browser: \nhttp://dccc.org/optout\n\nPaid for by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \n430 South Capitol Street, S.E.
