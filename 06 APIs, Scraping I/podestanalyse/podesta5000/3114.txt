john.podesta@gmail.comb'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nThursday, June 26, 2008\n\nCONTACT            \nDavid Miller, Communications Manager\n(202) 448-6154\n\nFortune 200 Corporations\xb9 Execs And PACs Donate $5.6 Million To McCain,\nSpend Nearly $100 Million On McCain\xb9s Lobbyists\n\nWashington, D.C. \xad A report released by Campaign Money Watch, a campaign\nfinance watchdog group, found that the top 200 corporations in America are\nwell represented among Sen. John McCain\xb9s (R-AZ) campaign contributors and\nthe lobbyists working to get him elected. The report\xb9s release comes as the\nCenter for American Progress Action Fund unveils its analysis that McCain\xb9s\ntax plan would save the same 200 corporations $45 billion.\n\n\xb3Apparently, one of the best investments corporate America could make right\nnow is to make a campaign contribution to John McCain, or to hire one of the\nmany lobbyists working for his campaign,\xb2 commented David Donnelly, director\nof Campaign Money Watch. \xb3But regular Americans can\xb9t afford to hire a\nlobbyist like Charlie Black or Rick Davis, or to make a $2,300 contribution.\nPerhaps that\xb9s why McCain\xb9s tax plan is so skewed to help corporate\nAmerica.\xb2\n\nCampaign Money Watch\xb9s analysis of data obtained from the nonpartisan Center\nfor Responsive Politics (http://www.opensecrets.org) found that:\n\n* McCain has received $5,590,003 from the employees and Political Action\nCommittees (PACs) of the Fortune 200 since 1989. These same 200 companies\nhave paid $98,693,835 to lobbyists connected to the McCain campaign since\n1998.\n\n* McCain has raised $1,076,579 from the top ten companies on the Fortune 200\nsince 1989. Those same ten companies have paid $17,961,900 to lobbying firms\nrepresented on McCain\xb9s staff and fundraiser roster since 1998.\n\n* McCain has already received three times as much in campaign contributions\nin this election from the Fortune 200 than he did in his 2000 race for the\nWhite House. In 2000 he raised $1,113,526 and so far in 2008 he has raised\n$3,026,122.\n\nA full spreadsheet with figures for total donations from every corporation\xb9s\nexecutives and PAC, and the corporation\xb9s lobbyists and lobbying\nexpenditures, is available online at\nhttp://www.campaignmoney.org/pressroom/2008/06/26/mccain-fortune200.\n\nCampaign Money Watch also released a comprehensive report on John McCain\'s\nconnections to lobbyists early this month, finding that lobbyists helping\nhis campaign made nearly half a billion dollars in lobbying fees over the\npast ten years. The report, entitled "Embedded or In Bed?" can be read\nonline at http://www.campaignmoney.org/files/Embedded.pdf.\n\nCampaign Money Watch is a project of the nonpartisan Public Campaign Action\nFund. The organization works to hold politicians who are against reform\naccountable for where they get their political donations.\n\n-- \nDavid Miller\nCommunications/Web Manager\nPublic Campaign Action Fund/Campaign Money Watch\n1828 L St. NW #250\nWashington, DC 20036\n(202) 448-6154\n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
