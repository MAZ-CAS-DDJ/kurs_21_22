With so many\nclose races across the state, your vote is really needed. You should\nnot encounter long lines at all. It's easy, quick, and critically\nimportant. Please go vote now.\n\nIf you're not in Colorado, you still have an election\nso go vote now if the polls are still open in your time\nzone!\n\nIf you have your mail ballot in your posession, take it to your\npolling place and turn it in by 7:00 PM. DO NOT MAIL IT. It must be\nreceived by 7:00 PM tonight to be counted.\n\nRemember to vote NO on the numbers. Now go vote. Seriously!\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=YF6mnBOfpFYcJNrNKyIhFA..\n\nBest regards,\nAlan Franklin\nProgressNow Colorado\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from all future email, paste the following URL into your browser:\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/CO?i=3nw_QMoLgZA33xhCNmBvABUP0uXJIWx6&cid=1144 \n"
