Tim Ryan\n\nJanuary 8, 2015, 5:00 a.m. EST\n\n\n\nThe progressive values and policies that Hillary Rodham Clinton represents\nhave Democrats and Americans across the country more excited than ever. But\nlately, pundits and some in the media have attempted to drive a narrative\nthat the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is not unified behind\nHillary. As a progressive myself, and one who proudly hails from the\nultimate battleground state of Ohio, this could not be further from the\ntruth. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s record speaks for itself.\n\n\n\nProgressives support Clinton because of her experience and leadership on\nmany of the issues that matter most. In Arkansas, she expanded childhood\neducation throughout the state. As first lady, she worked to increase\naccess to health care for every American. As a senator, she repeatedly\nfought to increase the minimum wage and extend unemployment benefits. While\nsecretary of State, she worked to empower women and expand LGBT rights and\nmore recently, through the Clinton Foundation, she has developed\ninitiatives to help children and low-income families.\n\n\n\nSimply put, Clinton understands the importance of investing in the\nfundamental building blocks that make America the envy of the world.\n\n\n\nAs an economic populist, protecting and growing our economy while putting\nOhioans back to work is a consistent priority of mine. Being progressive is\nabout assuring the safety of our citizens and our economy with a strong\nmanufacturing base, both old-line manufacturing and the newer fields of\nadvanced and additive manufacturing. I believe we can achieve this by\nre-establishing the United States of America as the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading\ninnovator in advanced manufacturing \xe2\x80\x94 with my district\xe2\x80\x99s national additive\nmanufacturing and 3-D printing facility and through the No. 1 ranked\nuniversity incubator in the world \xe2\x80\x94 both right here in Youngstown, Ohio.\nThese types of ideas and innovation are happening in places such as\nYoungstown largely thanks to a long-term vision for our nation and\npublic-private partnerships, something Clinton has spent a lifetime forging\nas a first lady, senator and secretary of State.\n\n\n\nI know that Hillary Rodham Clinton shares these same progressive and\nAmerican values. Throughout her career, she has consistently worked to\nadvance middle-class families, ensuring that Ohioans and all Americans can\nmake more money and have the means to support their families.\n\n\n\nDemocrats have unified behind Clinton in an unprecedented way, in part,\nbecause of her advocacy on these core progressive policies that ensure\neveryone has a fair shot at success. From the people who know her best and\nfor those like me who have fought alongside her to ensure that everyone has\naccess to the American Dream, there is no question that Clinton has the\nmessage and vision \xe2\x80\x94 and will have the agenda \xe2\x80\x94 to be the Democratic\nParty\xe2\x80\x99s standard bearer to lead America on the world stage.\n\n\n\nI am ready for Hillary. Should she run for president, she would be the best\nperson to lead our country forward. I believe her progressive and American\nvalues can lift up all Americans and I know the people of Ohio stand ready\nto assist her should she decide to run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Associated Press: \xe2\x80\x9cWarren aims to shape Democrats\' debate as 2016 race\nbegins\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://bigstory.ap.org/article/87273b2f35dd420e804232c72a75aa62/warren-aims-shape-democrats-debate-2016-race-begins>*\n\n\n\nBy Ken Thomas\n\nJanuary 7, 2015, 4:15 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday hammered\nWashington\'s leaders \xe2\x80\x94 Republicans and Democrats alike \xe2\x80\x94 for failing to\nhelp middle-class workers since the 1980s. Left unsaid: That time period\nincludes President Bill Clinton\'s administration.\n\n\n\nAs Warren continues to insist she won\'t run for president, and all of\npolitics is waiting for Hillary Rodham Clinton to announce her candidacy,\nit was a notable omission during Warren\'s speech at a conference sponsored\nby the AFL-CIO.\n\n\n\nBill Clinton famously declared "the era of big government is over" in 1996,\nand Warren\'s indictment of three decades of economic policy referenced\ncomplaints among liberals that the policies of Democrats contributed to\nWall Street excess in the past decade.\n\n\n\n"Pretty much the whole Republican Party \xe2\x80\x94 and if we\'re going to be honest,\ntoo many Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 have talked about the evils of \'big government\' and\ncalled for deregulation," Warren said, arguing the policies turned loose\n"big banks and giant international corporations" and "juiced short-term\nprofits even if it came at the expense of working families."\n\n\n\nThat sort of rhetoric has some liberals pining for Warren to enter the\nDemocratic presidential contest, a move that would likely pit her against\nHillary Rodham Clinton, the party\'s leading contender should she enter the\ncampaign as is widely expected.\n\n\n\nIt wasn\'t just Warren who didn\'t mention a Clinton by name. One panelist,\nJennifer Epps-Addison of Wisconsin Jobs Now, won applause from the audience\nwhen she suggested the party was hurting itself by appearing ready to\nsimply anoint the apparent favorite as its next presidential nominee.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t want to get in trouble, but I\'ll say it anyway," Epps-Addison\nsaid. "It starts with this idea that we have a presumed front-runner for\nthe Democratic nomination for president, because if we don\'t accept that\n... if we say that we demand somebody to actually meet our needs before\nwe\'re going to give them a candidate for the presidency, then that can make\na difference."\n\n\n\nClinton, the former secretary of state, New York senator and first lady,\nhas dominated early polls, but is being pushed by many Democrats to take a\nmore populist stance on economic issues. Warren has resisted calls to enter\nthe campaign, but her appearance before labor leaders served notice that\nshe intends to influence the agenda this year.\n\n\n\n"For more than 30 years, Washington has far too often advanced policies\nthat hammer America\'s middle class even harder," she said.\n\n\n\nAFL-CIO President Richard Trumka called Warren "an inspiration" and said\nthe labor organization would hold similar summits this year in the first\nfour presidential primary states \xe2\x80\x94 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South\nCarolina \xe2\x80\x94 to advocate for policies aimed at boosting wages.\n\n\n\nDuring last year\'s midterm elections, Clinton touted the 1990s economic\ngrowth during her husband\'s administration, noting that it helped bring\nprosperity to many middle-class families. She voiced support for raising\nthe federal minimum wage and promoting paid family leave policies to help\nworking families, particularly mothers.\n\n\n\nBolstering wages and household income remains at the top of the agenda for\nmany Democrats, who acknowledge that while the labor market has begun to\nrecover from the deep recession that began in 2008, wages have barely kept\nup with inflation. President Barack Obama unsuccessfully sought to increase\nthe federal minimum wage last year but several states and big cities have\ntaken steps to boost their minimum wages.\n\n\n\nWarren said the economy had made strides \xe2\x80\x94 a soaring stock market, rising\ncorporate profits and economic growth \xe2\x80\x94 but that progress had failed to\ntranslate into higher wages for workers. She said Washington leaders too\noften had chosen to shackle the "financial cops," bail out Wall Street\nbanks, sign trade deals that hurt workers and cut taxes for the wealthy.\n\n\n\nNeera Tanden, a former Hillary Clinton policy adviser who leads the Center\nfor American Progress, said Warren was "absolutely right," adding the\ncountry shouldn\'t be "fatalistic" about its ability to overcome economic\nchallenges.\n\n\n\n"So many people in Washington and in the country are pessimistic about our\ncountry\'s chances and believe this kind of story out there that stagnating\nwages in the United States are just the way it is. That is false," Tanden\nsaid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Daily Beast: \xe2\x80\x9cSen. Warren\xe2\x80\x99s Main Street Crusade to Pressure Clinton\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/08/sen-warren-s-main-street-crusade-to-pressure-clinton.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Eleanor Clift\n\nJanuary 8, 2015\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] She isn\xe2\x80\x99t running for president unless lightning strikes, but\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s something she\xe2\x80\x99s already won\xe2\x80\x94influence over financial appointments.\n\n\n\nShould lightning strike and Hillary Clinton forgoes a presidential run,\nDemocrats have a nominee in waiting. Elizabeth Warren\xe2\x80\x99s shadow campaign is\ntaking shape on Capitol Hill as Clinton moves closer to a decision that\nwill highlight the divide in their party between Main Street and Wall\nStreet.\n\n\n\nWarren may never formally enter the race. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a spoiler,\nand Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s commanding lead in surveys of Democrats (66 percent) suggests\na better way to influence the debate and move Clinton as the nominee to a\nmore populist left, is for Warren to use her power within the party as a\nfreshman senator to inflame or blow up issues to advance her agenda.\n\n\n\nWarren never shrinks from a fight where she believes she\xe2\x80\x99s on the side of\nthe little guy. She\xe2\x80\x99s been known to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI love throwing rocks,\xe2\x80\x9d sometimes\neven when she\xe2\x80\x99s cautioned against repercussions. Her stand against the\nnomination of investment banker Antonio Weiss to a top position at the\nTreasury Department stalled the appointment and created bad blood with the\nWhite House, forcing President Obama to re-nominate him in the new Congress.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey believe in Weiss, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be pushed around on this,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsays Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, a centrist Democratic group.\nWeiss is likely to get confirmed even as Warren and a handful of other\nprogressive Democrats vote no. But Warren\xe2\x80\x99s very public fight against the\ninfluence of Wall Street within the administration bloodied the White\nHouse, and key aides are less likely to cut her out of the loop again on\nkey appointments, having just experienced how much grief she can cause for\nObama with his Democratic base.\n\n\n\nThe fight over Weiss teed up a nomination more to Warren\xe2\x80\x99s liking when\nObama announced on Tuesday that Allan Landon, the former CEO of Bank of\nHawaii, would fill one of two vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors. Landon led a bank with under $10 billion assets, a far cry from\nthe too-big-to-fail investment behemoths that populate Wall Street. Camden\nFine, president and CEO of the Independent Community Banks of America,\nlauded the choice of Landon, noting that because of the backlash on Weiss,\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe White House is worried enough on the Federal Reserve they\xe2\x80\x99ve called me\nthree times in the last few days vetting the nomination.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFine says his opposition to Weiss is nothing personal; it\xe2\x80\x99s just that\n\xe2\x80\x9ccommunity banks are pretty much fed up with every single senior post at\nthe Treasury Department going to people right out of Wall Street.\xe2\x80\x9d Out of\n16 assistant secretaries, 15 are former partners or senior executives of\ninvestment firms.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s cultural, he says, a pattern that goes back to the Clinton era of\nRobert Rubin and Larry Summers, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been the accepted practice since,\nwith few voices challenging Wall Street orthodoxy. There are a lot more\ncommunity banks, 6,500 in all. Their assets are small compared to the top\n20 Wall Street firms, but they are everywhere, they are Main Street, and\nthey didn\xe2\x80\x99t leverage the debt that caused the global meltdown. The Big Five\nbanks dubbed too big to fail, are 35 percent bigger than they were when the\nmeltdown was triggered.\n\n\n\nAn aide to Warren ticks off her objections to Weiss, whose appointment she\nmade her cause c\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8bre, and that otherwise would have passed unnoticed.\nFirst, his credentials: He did international mergers and acquisitions at\nLazard, a financial and asset management firm. It has nothing to do with\nthe regulatory job he is nominated for. Weiss supporters note that he\nco-authored the tax reform plan for the liberal Center for American\nProgress, and point out that he\xe2\x80\x99s the publisher of The Paris Review, \xe2\x80\x9ca non\nsequitur,\xe2\x80\x9d scoffs Warren\xe2\x80\x99s aide.\n\n\n\nSecond, Weiss played a key role in shaping Burger King\xe2\x80\x99s attempt at\ninversion, which Illinois Senator Dick Durbin cited as his reason for\nopposing Weiss, the only Obama nomination he has ever opposed. Republican\nSenator Charles Grassley put out a press release calling the administration\n\xe2\x80\x9chypocrites\xe2\x80\x9d for publicly lambasting the practice of inversions, a loophole\nto avoid U.S. taxes, while nominating one of its practitioners.\n\n\n\nThird, the $20 million parachute Lazard is giving Weiss stuck in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s\ncraw. It\xe2\x80\x99s to compensate him for the money he would otherwise receive if he\nremained at Lazard. The sum is not something ordinary Americans can fathom,\nand Warren sees her role as giving voice to the people who don\xe2\x80\x99t have\nexpensive lawyers and lobbyists, and don\xe2\x80\x99t get rewarded with golden\nparachutes.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a proxy war about something bigger, which is Wall Street\ninfluence,\xe2\x80\x9d says Warren\xe2\x80\x99s aide. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has voted for a lot of people from\nWall Street (including Treasury Secretary Jack Lew). It\xe2\x80\x99s not a litmus\ntest; it\xe2\x80\x99s more like a balance issue. You put it all together and it\xe2\x80\x99s just\ntoo much.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhile Clinton and Warren share similar views on social justice and building\nthe middle class, Clinton has a strong association with Wall Street. As a\nsenator, she represented the money capital of the world, and as a partner\nin the Clinton Global Initiative, she\xe2\x80\x99s accustomed to hobnobbing with the\nfinancial services elite and feeling their pain. Clinton hasn\xe2\x80\x99t taken a\nposition on the Weiss nomination, and the fight will be over and the issue\nin the rear view mirror by the time she announces, probably in the spring.\n\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it should shock the conscience that someone who is familiar\nwith Wall Street is good for that job. He\xe2\x80\x99s not someone you go to the\nmattresses over, he\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong target,\xe2\x80\x9d says Third Way\xe2\x80\x99s Bennett. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s\nenormous hunger in the party to hang on to the White House, particularly\nafter losing Congress, and that tends to make people get pretty practical.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFor Warren, she\xe2\x80\x99s playing a long game. If there is another Democratic\npresident, and it\xe2\x80\x99s Clinton, she wants some say over who is the next\nTreasury Secretary, and who gets all those big policy-making jobs. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\nmovement for change that she\xe2\x80\x99s leading, not necessarily a presidential\ncampaign \xe2\x80\x94 unless lightning strikes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Washington Post: \xe2\x80\x9cPresident Obama, Elizabeth Warren have different message\non the middle class\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/president-obama-elizabeth-warren-share-different-message-on-the-middle-class/2015/01/07/8c0eb516-9681-11e4-8005-1924ede3e54a_story.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Steven Mufson, Karen Tumulty, and Anne Gearan\n\nJanuary 7, 2015, 2:08 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nAt a moment when President Obama is seeking to convince Americans that the\neconomy is finally back on track, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) delivered\na major address Wednesday in which she argued that average Americans are\nbeing left behind because Washington has failed them.\n\n\n\nIn a speech to an AFL-CIO conference in Washington, Warren ticked off a\nlist of upbeat indicators: Corporate profits and economic growth are up,\nthe unemployment rate is down, inflation remains low and the stock market\nis booming.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the overall picture doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell us much about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening at\nground level to tens of millions of Americans,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDespite these\ncheery numbers, America\xe2\x80\x99s middle class is in deep trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWarren\xe2\x80\x99s speech before the union\xe2\x80\x99s National Summit on Raising Wages,\nscheduled more than a month ago, fell on the day that Obama was set to\nvisit Detroit to highlight the recovery of the auto industry. And the\ncontrast between the two highlighted a dilemma facing Democrats as they set\nabout framing their message about an improving economy: Should they claim\ncredit for the rebound or tell people still struggling that the party\xe2\x80\x99s\nleaders feel people\xe2\x80\x99s pain?\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a delicate line that has to be walked here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mark S. Mellman,\nchief executive of the Mellman Group, a polling and political consulting\nfirm for Democratic candidates. \xe2\x80\x9cNo question people are feeling better, but\nnot everybody is feeling a lot better.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe said that \xe2\x80\x9ctalking up the economy\xe2\x80\x9d would help people feel better, \xe2\x80\x9cand\nthe better they feel, the better they feel about the president and\nDemocrats.\xe2\x80\x9d But he warned that the danger is that people who don\xe2\x80\x99t feel\nbetter about the economy would conclude that party leaders are simply \xe2\x80\x9cout\nof touch with their circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWarren\xe2\x80\x99s speech comes as the Democratic Party is already looking to 2016,\nwith former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton likely to declare her\ncandidacy and many party activists looking to Warren as an alternative.\nEven if Warren doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run, her popularity and message could influence the\nrhetoric of the ultimate party standard bearer.\n\n\n\nObama, without having to worry about another election, is using the\nmegaphone of his office to claim credit for the recovery, which gained\nspeed at the end of 2014 after puttering along at a modest and inconsistent\npace earlier. His visit to Detroit today is part of a warm-up lap around\nthe country before his Jan. 20 State of the Union address. The president\nalso will stop in Phoenix on Thursday to draw attention to the resurgence\nof the housing market, and will discuss education and jobs during a visit\nto Tennessee on Friday.\n\n\n\nThe president has trumpeted a record 57-month streak of consecutive job\ncreation, the strongest year of job creation since the 1990s and signs that\njob growth in high-paying industries would mean that wages were \xe2\x80\x9con the\nrise again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAsked whether it was \xe2\x80\x9cmorning in America\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the campaign theme Ronald\nReagan used campaigning for reelection in 1984 \xe2\x80\x94 Jason Furman, chairman of\nObama\xe2\x80\x99s Council of Economic Advisers demurred.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s morning in America. I think we\xe2\x80\x99re digging our way out\nof a really deep hole, and we\xe2\x80\x99re still not all the way out of that hole,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe said in a December press briefing. \xe2\x80\x9cWages are certainly not all the way\nto where they want to be, but absolutely moving in the right direction.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWarren has a different take on recent advances.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of broad national economic statistics say our economy is getting\nbetter, and it is true that the economy overall is recovering from the\nterrible crash of 2008,\xe2\x80\x9d Warren said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there have been deep structural\nchanges in this economy, changes that have gone on for more than 30 years,\nchanges that have cut out hard-working, middle-class families from sharing\nin this overall growth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWarren faulted Washington \xe2\x80\x94 including leaders of her own party \xe2\x80\x94 for buying\ninto \xe2\x80\x9ctrickle-down policies,\xe2\x80\x9d such as deregulation and tax cuts for the\nwealthy, that she said benefited corporations and the wealthy in hopes that\nthey \xe2\x80\x9ccould be counted on to create an economy that would work for everyone\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNothing in Warren\xe2\x80\x99s critique was new.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaking the economy work for everybody. This is the core of why people have\nvoted for Democrats since the Great Depression,\xe2\x80\x9d Mellman said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe exact\nformulation of message can change, but the core idea is the same one\nDemocrats have been about since the Depression and there\xe2\x80\x99s no sense in\nchanging it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMoreover, Austan Goolsbee, professor of economics at the University of\nChicago business school and former chairman of the Council of Economic\nAdvisers during Obama\xe2\x80\x99s first term, warns that the recovery might not last\nuntil 2016.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you take the risk of the slowdown in China and the continued risk of a\nfinancial crisis in Europe, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s fairly sobering even if the\nUnited States is gradually standing up a little stronger.\xe2\x80\x9d He said \xe2\x80\x9cthe\nchances of extended 5 percent GDP growth seem not that high.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWarren\xe2\x80\x99s broadside comes as many liberals are hoping that she will\nreconsider her previous declarations that she will not challenge likely\ncandidate Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n\n\nThe organization MoveOn.org last month announced the start of what it says\nwill be a $1 million campaign by its members to draft Warren.\n\n\n\nWarren \xe2\x80\x94 an outspoken critic of Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s coziness with Washington \xe2\x80\x94 is\nadmired by many in the party\xe2\x80\x99s base for her ability to frame an argument\nthat the system is rigged against the interests of ordinary workers. That\nkind of message, some say, is what was missing during the 2014 midterm\nelections, which turned out to be a disaster for Democrats.\n\n\n\nSuch is Warren\xe2\x80\x99s appeal \xe2\x80\x94 and her fundraising abilities \xe2\x80\x94 that Senate\nDemocrats created a new position in their leadership for the first-term\nsenator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nBut that effort to bring her inside the tent has not made her any less\nwilling to engage in battles, even against more senior figures in her party.\n\n\n\nIn the waning days of the lame-duck session, she fought a spending bill\nthat included a provision to weaken part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that\ntightened oversight of Wall Street. She also is a leading opponent of the\nWhite House\xe2\x80\x99s bid to nominate investment banker Antonio Weiss for a top\nposition at the Treasury Department.\n\n\n\nWarren\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric, and the need to boost turnout among the Democratic base,\nmay have already pushed Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s economic rhetoric to the left. During the\n2014 midterm elections, Clinton combined personal anecdotes about the\ndifficulties faced by working women with a lament that too many working\npeople lack economic security. Her speeches became more partisan as the\nelection neared, and the probability of heavy Democratic losses became\nclearer.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have spent years now clawing our way back, out of the hole that was dug\nin 2008, but we have a lot more to do if we want to release our full\npotential and make sure that American families finally feel the rewards of\nrecovery,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said while stumping for Democratic gubernatorial\ncandidate Tom Wolf in Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\nShe appeared alongside Warren once during the midterm stump season, and\nsaid she admires Warren\xe2\x80\x99s zeal. She also appeared to borrow a page from\nWarren\xe2\x80\x99s anti-Wall Street message, a tricky issue for Clinton as a former\nNew York senator with deep and lucrative ties to the corporate and\nfinancial elite. Moreover, some of Warren\xe2\x80\x99s targets \xe2\x80\x94 bank deregulation and\nfree-trade agreements \xe2\x80\x94 were ones put in place by Bill Clinton when he was\npresident.\n\n\n\nIn the same Pennsylvania speech Clinton said that \xe2\x80\x9ccorporations seem to\nhave all the rights and none of the responsibilities,\xe2\x80\x9d of ordinary\nAmericans, while \xe2\x80\x9cworking people haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a raise in over a decade, and\nit becomes harder and harder.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWolf was among the few Democrats who appeared with Clinton and went on to\nwin last year.\n\n\n\nSince then, Clinton has quietly sought advice from a range of business,\ncivic and philanthropic leaders about the main challenges they see in their\nrespective spheres, people familiar with some of the meetings said. The\nprivate discussions are one way Clinton is honing an updated economic\nmessage that will attempt to combine optimism about the improving economy\nwith an appeal to working- and middle-class voters who feel left out of the\nrecovery.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis story is at the center of where the presidential race is going to\nbe,\xe2\x80\x9d said former Obama political strategist Bill Burton. \xe2\x80\x9cThe economy is\nundoubtedly doing better as a whole, but if the middle class doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel\nit then that is the opening through which the winner of the next\npresidential election will walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Reuters: \xe2\x80\x9cPodesta: Clinton to draw differences with Obama if she runs\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/07/us-usa-politics-podesta-idUSKBN0KG21520150107>*\n\n\n\nBy Jeff Mason\n\nJanuary 7, 2015, 2:25 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton will draw differences with President Barack Obama if she\nruns for the White House and Obama expects that, according to John Podesta,\nan adviser to the president and a potential campaign chairman for the\nformer secretary of state.\n\n\n\nPodesta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton who is now\ncounselor to Obama, said he would depart the White House next month.\n\n\n\n"I\'m probably going to leave in early February," he told Reuters in an\ninterview. "Then I\'ve got to figure out what I\'m doing in life."\n\n\n\nFiguring that out will depend largely on whether Clinton, a former senator\nand first lady, decides to run for president again, as she is expected to\ndo. Podesta has been mentioned frequently as a likely chairman of her\ncampaign.\n\n\n\n"If she decides to run, I told her I\'d do anything I can to help her," he\nsaid, adding it was "up to her" whether he served as chair.\n\n\n\n"I started going door to door in Iowa in 1967. Maybe I\'ll come back and do\nthat again," he joked.\n\n\n\nIowa is the first U.S. state to hold a nominating contest in the\npresidential primary race. Clinton came in third there in the Democratic\ncontest in 2008, behind Obama and former Senator John Edwards, a defeat\nthat marked the beginning of the end of her campaign.\n\n\n\nThough Obama and Clinton fought bitterly for the 2008 Democratic\nnomination, they formed a bond when she served as his secretary of state.\nPodesta said they agreed on a lot, but she would highlight divergent\nopinions as well, if she runs.\n\n\n\n"I\'m sure she\'ll have some different views from the president. The\npresident understands that, I think, expects that," Podesta said.\n\n\n\n"I\'m sure there will be differences, but for the most part I think that she\nrespects greatly what the president\'s been able to accomplish with respect\nto the economy, national security and healthcare in particular," he added.\n"They both have a progressive view of what it\'s going to take to try to\nensure that the economy\'s working for the middle class."\n\n\n\nAs for his own legacy at the White House, Podesta hates the term and had it\nbanned from Bill Clinton\'s White House, he said. But he noted he was proud\nof his contributions to Obama\'s plan to fight climate change and believed\nglobal warming would be an issue in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*MSNBC: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 timeline finally comes into focus\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-2016-timeline-finally-comes-focus>*\n\n\n\nBy Alex Seitz-Wald\n\nJanuary 7, 2015 5:05 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s delayed 2016 timeline is finally coming into focus.\n\n\n\nJohn Podesta, who is expected to serve as Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign chairman or in\nanother senior role, said Wednesday that he plans to leave the Obama White\nHouse next month, ahead of a Clinton announcement expected in the late\nSpring.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m probably going to leave in early February,\xe2\x80\x9d Podesta told Reuters. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\nshe decides to run, I told her I\xe2\x80\x99d do anything I can to help her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhile some in Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s orbit pushed for her to get into the race early,\nshe has opted for a slower time frame, scheduling non-political paid\nspeeches as late as March 19.\n\n\n\nDemocratic insiders increasingly point to early April as the most likely\nlaunch window, which would allow her to avoid filing a campaign finance\nreport to the Federal Election Commission for the first quarter of the\nyear. Easter falls on April 5 this year, so the week after appears likely.\n\n\n\nNothing is confirmed, Clinton insiders stress, and she could still decide\nnot to run, though that appears increasingly unlikely.\n\n\n\nPodesta\xe2\x80\x99s departure has been broadly telegraphed, but it comes at a time of\nincreasing action under the surface among potential Clinton aides. On\nFriday, Marlon Marshall, who worked on Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 presidential campaign\nand would likely work on another, announced that he, too, was leaving the\nWhite House.\n\n\n\nMarshall is a longtime friend and compatriot of Robby Mook, who managed\nClinton friend Terry MCauliffe\xe2\x80\x99s 2013 Virginia gubernatorial campaign and\nis said to be among Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s first choices to be campaign manager. Guy\nCecil, the outgoing executive director of the Democratic Senatorial\nCampaign Committee, recently pulled himself out of contention for the top\njob on the campaign.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Politico confirmed that Mook would play a senior role on a\nClinton campaign, which will also include Obama pollster Joel Benenson.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a potentially major change from her controversial 2008 pollster,\nMark Penn.\n\n\n\nThe quiet personnel moves come even at a time when Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s public\nschedule remains conspicuously empty. She has only two public appearances\ncoming up this month, both in Canada. February and March are equally quiet\nfor the former secretary of state thus far.\n\n\n\nA Clinton spokesperson did not return msnbc\xe2\x80\x99s request for comment.\n\n\n\nPodesta served as Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s last White House Chief of Staff and joined\nthe Obama administration as counselor in late 2013. Podesta also founded\nthe Center for American Progress and has been credited with helping Obama\nmake the most out of his second term, especially advocating for the\naggressive use of executive actions to advance the president\xe2\x80\x99s agenda in\nthe face of a recalcitrant Congress.\n\n\n\nThe White House would like to keep Podesta around even longer, sources say,\nbut he long ago agreed to stay with Obama only through the upcoming State\nof the Union Address.\n\n\n\nPodesta also told Reuters that while he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csure\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton will differ from\nObama on certain issues, Obama won\xe2\x80\x99t mind. \xe2\x80\x9cThe president understands that,\nI think, expects that,\xe2\x80\x9d Podesta said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*CT News: \xe2\x80\x9cJeb Bush takes swipe at Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://blog.ctnews.com/politics/2015/01/07/jeb-bush-takes-swipe-at-hillary/>*\n\n\n\nBy Neil Vigdor\n\nJanuary 7, 2015\n\n\n\nGREENWICH \xe2\x80\x94 A physically-fit and newly \xe2\x80\x9cunemployed\xe2\x80\x9d Jeb Bush took a veiled\nshot at Hillary Clinton Wednesday night when the former Florida GOP\ngovernor was asked to handicap the 2016 presidential field by a well-heeled\nnetwork of contributors in his father\xe2\x80\x99s hometown.\n\n\n\nBush, 61, did not mention Clinton by name but told supporters at a\nGreenwich fundraiser for his recently-launched leadership PAC that the\nformer secretary of state would have a lot to answer for concerning the\nforeign policy miscues of the Obama administration, according to multiple\npeople who heard Bush\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.\n\n\n\nSeriously exploring a bid for the White House, Bush poo-pooed the mystique\nof the Clintons during the kickoff reception for his Right to Rise\npolitical action committee.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said, \xe2\x80\x98If someone wants to run a campaign about 90s nostalgia, it\xe2\x80\x99s not\ngoing to be very successful,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d an insider told Hearst Connecticut Media.\n\n\n\nThe person asked not to be identified because the event, held at the $7.2\nmillion Belle Haven estate of former Goldman Sachs investment banking boss\nCharles Davis, was closed to the media.\n\n\n\nBush spoke for about a half-hour to some 175 prospective supporters and\ntook questions for another 30 minutes on a wide range of topics from his\nstance on immigration reform to so-called \xe2\x80\x9cBush fatigue.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBush, who recently resigned from all corporate and nonprofit boards that he\nsat on, emphasized to the crowd that he is his own man.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said, \xe2\x80\x98Do you have a father?

Bush is scheduled to be in Greenwich, Conn. on Wednesday,\nhome to some of the wealthiest financial elite, for a fundraiser for his\nnewly created PAC. Greenwich was home to Bush family patriarch and former\nSenator Prescott Bush.\n\n\n\nNo final plans for the release of Bush\xe2\x80\x99s returns or other financial\ninformation have been made. But people close to the matter note that as\ngovernor of Florida and as a candidate for the office, Bush released over\n20 years worth of tax returns. These people say he is prepared to make a\nsimilar move in any presidential campaign.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople forget that he spent eight years as governor in a state with the\nmost pro-transparency laws in the country,\xe2\x80\x9d a person close to Bush said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is used to living in the sunshine. Most of the other likely candidates\naren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nCandidates for president are not required to release tax returns. But many\nhave done so \xe2\x80\x93 to greater and lesser degrees \xe2\x80\x93 for decades.\n\n\n\nBush associates and other senior Republicans say that in addition to\ndispelling comparisons to Romney, the effort to be transparent about his\nfinances is also meant to contrast with Hillary Clinton, the favorite for\nthe Democratic nomination. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill\nClinton, amassed tens of millions of dollars over the last 14 years.\nRepublicans are expected to press for disclosure of extensive tax return\ninformation as well as more detailed accounting of the finances of the\nnon-profit Clinton Foundation.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s smart and the main advantage is that Jeb gets to be in control of the\nrelease of this information rather than having that control dictated by his\nopponents and the media,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kevin Madden, a strategist at Hamilton Place\nStrategies who served as a top adviser and spokesman for Romney in 2012.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou also have more certainty around it by putting it other there and\ntelling the story and then it is not new information coming out later.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMadden added that the Obama campaign in 2012 successfully turned the tax\nreturn question into a \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter issue\xe2\x80\x9d that hurt Romney. \xe2\x80\x9cIn that sense\nit would become a character attribute for Jeb Bush to get ahead of it and\nproactively put this financial information out there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBush\xe2\x80\x99s possible plans to release detailed financial information come as the\nformer governor winds down the lucrative corporate board assignments,\ninvestment ventures and well-paid public speaking he has done since leaving\nthe Florida governor\xe2\x80\x99s mansion.\n\n\n\nBush, who worked as a real estate developer before becoming governor, left\noffice in 2007 with a net worth of just over $1 million and set out to\naggressively build wealth for himself and his family. He set up Jeb Bush\nand Associates, a consulting firm, in 2007. He followed that in 2008 with\nBritton Hill Partners, the umbrella organization for his investment funds.\n(Britton Hill is the tallest point in Florida.)\n\n\n\nAmong Bush\xe2\x80\x99s investment ventures are UK-based BH Global Aviation, which\nraised $61 million \xe2\x80\x93 much of it from foreign investors \xe2\x80\x94 to invest in Hong\nKong-based aviation firm Hawker Pacific and BH Logistics, which is involved\nin the shale oil industry.\n\n\n\nBush served as an adviser to Lehman Brothers before its collapse and later\nadvised Barclays, the British bank that bought Lehman out bankruptcy. Bush\nended his relationship with Barclays at the end of 2014. He has also\nstepped down from the boards of real estate investment trust Rayonier and\nTenet Health Care. Bush also ended his role as a paid adviser to for-profit\neducation company Academic Partnerships. He is also no longer accepting the\nkind of speaking engagements that earned him him tens of thousands of\ndollars each over the last several years.\n\n\n\nTax returns would likely show how much wealth Bush managed to build from\nthese endeavors over the last seven years. However, Bush is still in the\nprocess of exiting the private investment funds, people close to the matter\nsay, so gains or losses might not show up in prior years\xe2\x80\x99 returns. They\ncould, however, appear on financial disclosure forms Bush would have to\nfill out under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act should he formally\nannounce his candidacy for president.\n\n\n\nIn August of 2011, Romney\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure showed a range of between $85\nmillion and $264 million in assets. The campaign later said the figure was\nbetween $190 million and $250 million. Bush is not likely to show assets\nanywhere near that range.\n\n\n\nDemocrats relentlessly attacked Romney for the limited nature of his\nfinancial disclosure as well for how he earned the money, much of it\nthrough private equity investments at Bain Capital. Some of those\ninvestments included restructuring companies in ways that eliminated jobs.\nRomney never found a strong rebuttal to these critiques though he argued\nthat most of his private equity work actually saved companies that might\notherwise have failed.\n\n\n\nBush is planning a much earlier and more robust defense of his private\nsector career.\n\n\n\nBush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell declined to comment on any plans for\nfinancial disclosure, saying nothing was finalized as Bush continues to\nexplore a possible run. But she cited the release of 250,000 private emails\nfrom Bush\xe2\x80\x99s tenure as governor in arguing that he will set a high standard\nof transparency. And she said Bush will hide nothing about his private\ninvestment or corporate work and that extensive scrutiny of that work will\nturn up nothing that would damage Bush\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is absolutely nothing about Governor Bush\xe2\x80\x99s business interests that\nwould hinder a run for president in any way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nDemocrats, of course, disagree. Outside groups are poring over Bush\xe2\x80\x99s\nbusiness records and plan to make an issue of how he earned his money after\nleaving office. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt that Jeb\xe2\x80\x99s business career will be\nheavily scrutinized in the coming months, as it should be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jesse\nLehrich of the left-leaning research and tracking organization American\nBridge 21st Century.\n\n\n\nThe Bush campaign is banking on American Bridge \xe2\x80\x93 and others \xe2\x80\x93 coming up\nempty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Daily Caller: \xe2\x80\x9cNewt On \xe2\x80\x98Boring\xe2\x80\x99 Hillary: She\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98A Celebrity Like Kim\nKardashian\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://dailycaller.com/2015/01/07/newt-on-boring-hillary-shes-a-celebrity-like-kim-kardashian/>*\n\n\n\nBy Al Weaver\n\nJanuary 7, 2015, 3:44 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nNote to all: Newt Gingrich really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think much of a 2016 Hillary\nClinton presidential run.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt Tuesday night, the\nformer Speaker slammed the former First Lady, telling the host that Hillary\nis \xe2\x80\x9cboring\xe2\x80\x9d and compared her to Kim Kardashian.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s greatest weakness, Mr. Speaker?\xe2\x80\x9d Hewitt asked Gingrich.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoring. She\xe2\x80\x99s just, you know, she\xe2\x80\x99s a celebrity like Kim Kardashian,\xe2\x80\x9d\nGingrich said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I mean, tell me what she\xe2\x80\x99s done, and tell me what she stands for,\xe2\x80\x9d\nGingrich told the radio host. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, she currently stands for the idea\nthat it\xe2\x80\x99s time for her to be president because she\xe2\x80\x99s been standing around\nwaiting for the time for her to be president.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo she\xe2\x80\x99d like to be president, because after all, I mean, she and Bill\nthink it would be good to be president, and why don\xe2\x80\x99t we make her\npresident,\xe2\x80\x9d the former Speaker said. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, I have no idea is she going to be different than Obama, or if\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s going to be Obama\xe2\x80\x99s third term. If she\xe2\x80\x99s going to be different than\nObama, can she take the heat of disagreeing with the incumbent Democratic\npresident?\xe2\x80\x9d Gingrich asked Hewitt. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if she\xe2\x80\x99s going to be his third\nterm, do you really think the country\xe2\x80\x99s going to vote for four more years\nof this mess?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just think her candidacy has some big internal contradictions,\xe2\x80\x9d the\nformer presidential candidate added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sec.
