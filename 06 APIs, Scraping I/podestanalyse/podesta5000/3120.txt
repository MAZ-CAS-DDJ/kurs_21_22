You helped push the administration\xe2\x80\x99s climate policies into high gear when you were in the White House, and I\xe2\x80\x99d be interested in your perspective on this case of odd bedfellows, and what happens next. We can do it on background if you prefer\xe2\x80\xa6. Also, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to establish a line of communication with you before you decamp to NY and take over the reins of the Clinton campaign, and things get crazy.  My direct line at the Beast is 202-626-2030<tel:202-626-2030>; my cell is 202-257-6388<tel:202-257-6388> \xe2\x80\x93 Please let me hear from you, Thanks so  much, Eleanor Clift, DB, Washington\r\n\r\n'
