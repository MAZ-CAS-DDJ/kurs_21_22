john.podesta@gmail.comb'Also I want to mention that a Daily Beast reporter from the hill beat emailed and asked the diversity question.  I reminded him that anyone that\'s come on to help out doesn\'t replace those who have been close advisers for sometime, and I mentioned Cheryl and Maggie\'s names.  I don\'t know that he\'ll write but FYI.\n\nFrom: NSM <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com<mailto:nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>>\nDate: Friday, January 16, 2015 at 3:07 PM\nTo: Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com<mailto:huma@hrcoffice.com>>, Robby Mook <robbymook2015@gmail.com<mailto:robbymook2015@gmail.com>>, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com<mailto:dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>>, Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com<mailto:jbenenson@bsgco.com>>, John Anzalone <john@algpolling.com<mailto:john@algpolling.com>>, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>, Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com<mailto:gruncom@aol.com>>, Philippe Reines <pir@hrcoffice.com<mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com>>, Jim Margolis <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com<mailto:Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com>>, Cheryl Mills <cheryl.mills@gmail.com<mailto:cheryl.mills@gmail.com>>\nSubject: Re: Press Updates\n\nHi everyone,\n\nWe wanted to share a tweet HRC sent out a little while ago and give some background on it.\n\nIn short, Barney Frank reached out to us yesterday and asked if she would engage on Dodd-Frank.  He made the obvious arguments, that it would be good for her and good for him as he is spending a lot of time making the case for why the GOP chipping away at it is such a travesty.  After thinking through the language with HRC, Jake, Dan, and Philippe, we tweeted the below.\n\n[https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/443004417596329986/3kgV0RJE_normal.jpeg]  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton<https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton?refsrc=email&s=11>)\n1/16/15, 1:57 PM<https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/556163273738166272?refsrc=email&s=11>\nAttacking financial reform is risky and wrong. Better for Congress to focus on jobs and wages for middle class families.\n\n\nFrom: NSM <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com<mailto:nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>>\nDate: Wednesday, January 14, 2015 at 11:12 AM\nTo: Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com<mailto:huma@hrcoffice.com>>, Robby Mook <robbymook2015@gmail.com<mailto:robbymook2015@gmail.com>>, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com<mailto:dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>>, Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com<mailto:jbenenson@bsgco.com>>, John Anzalone <john@algpolling.com<mailto:john@algpolling.com>>, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>, Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com<mailto:gruncom@aol.com>>, Philippe Reines <pir@hrcoffice.com<mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com>>, Jim Margolis <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com<mailto:Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com>>\nSubject: Re: Press Updates\n\nAmy Chozick posted, here it is below.\n\nA Field Guide to Who\'s Who in the Fledgling Clinton Campaign\n\nRepublicans are already clawing for spots in next year\'s presidential race, and so are the Democratic operatives who are meeting in Hillary Rodham Clinton\'s living room and her New York offices.\n\nMrs. Clinton, whose schedule has been unusually quiet of late, and her advisers are fielding r\xe9sum\xe9s and talking to potential campaign aides (a mix of old and new). As the presumptive front-runner, Mrs. Clinton has her pick of talent. But several people with knowledge of the discussions say that some of the Democrats\' most gifted political professionals have decided, for the moment, that the safest place to be is on the sidelines.\n\nAfter all, in 2008, things didn\'t end so well for Mrs. Clinton\'s first campaign manager or her first chief strategist.\n\nSo here\'s an informal and wildly incomplete guide to the Clinton 2016 campaign as it slowly, quietly and cautiously begins to take shape (No, Mitt Romney has not called):\n\nPeople to impress: Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin and Evelyn S. Lieberman.\n\nDoesn\'t tolerate drama: John Podesta.\n\nWill run things: Robby Mook (and his mafia).\n\nDark horse: Stephanie Schriock of Emily\'s List.\n\nSpin meisters: Brian Fallon or Jennifer Palmieri (a Podesta pick)\n\nMoney man: Dennis Cheng.\n\nPolicy wonk: Jake Sullivan.\n\nMessage makers: Wendy Clark, the Coca-Cola marketing whiz, and Roy Spence, the advertising guru based in Austin, Tex. ("Don\'t Mess with Texas," or Hillary.)\n\nThe X-Factor: Chelsea.\n\n- Amy Chozick\n\nFrom: NSM <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com<mailto:nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>>\nDate: Wednesday, January 14, 2015 at 11:08 AM\nTo: Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com<mailto:huma@hrcoffice.com>>, Robby Mook <robbymook2015@gmail.com<mailto:robbymook2015@gmail.com>>, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com<mailto:dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>>, Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com<mailto:jbenenson@bsgco.com>>, John Anzalone <john@algpolling.com<mailto:john@algpolling.com>>, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>, Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com<mailto:gruncom@aol.com>>, Philippe Reines <pir@hrcoffice.com<mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com>>, Jim Margolis <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com<mailto:Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com>>\nSubject: Press Updates\n\nI\'ll use this to circulate things for discussion as they break.  I\'d also like to revisit getting a regular call on the books assuming we all agree that makes the most sense.\n\nFor our first installment, here\'s what we teed up with Maggie.\n\n[cid:40AF3DAE-5D7C-4328-A4E9-BFAB9B515E17]\n'
