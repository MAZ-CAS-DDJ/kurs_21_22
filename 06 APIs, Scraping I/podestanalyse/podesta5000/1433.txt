john.podesta@gmail.comb'::: ProgressNow - Advancing Progressive Agendas, State by State ::: \n\n\n\nDear Friends and Colleagues,\n\nThey say that imitation is the highest form of flattery, and if\nthat\'s the case then Progress Michigan and Alliance for a Better\nMinnesota should be very proud of their work. In these two states\nright-wing groups have attempted to create communication organizations\nto counter our affiliates\' work. As hard as the right wing may\ntry they cannot stop what we do every day - make progress\nhappen, and happen NOW.\n\nAs always, let me know what you think, or even better, contribute to\nus here.\n\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=mPjvikS7BokVHPlstBWaXA\n\nBest,\n\nDenise Cardinal\nExecutive Director\nProgressNow\nProgressNow Education\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\nIs the Michigan Freedom Fund the Conservative Response to Progress\nMichigan?\n\nOn August 23rd\'s edition of Off the Record, Tim Skubick\ndiscussed what the struggle for power between Republican Party\nstalwarts and Tea Party activists means for Medicaid expansion in\nMichigan. Chad Livengood, a reporter at the conservative-leaning\nDetroit News, cited The Michigan Freedom Fund as evidence of a\nRepublican party realignment. Specifically, he said\n"They\'ve gone from Right to Work debate, to now being the\nconservative, right-wing answer to Progress Michigan."\nThat\'s right - the fact that Progress Michigan is calling\nout Republicans and holding them accountable has inspired\nconservatives to attempt to do the same.\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=6mQYsTETfqRQIN2wCmSchA\n\nAccording to the Detroit News, the Michigan Freedom Fund has increased\ntheir capacity and staff members in order to branch out into political\nfights with Democrats. While promoting freedom might be the\ngroup\'s stated goal, it seems that their true intention is to\nattack Democrats. This includes Representative Alberta Tinsley-Talabi\nand gubernatorial candidate Mark Schauer. Unlike Progress Michigan,\nthe Michigan Freedom Fund\'s actions may be motivated by a fear\nof losing rather than a need for accountability. Their attempt to\nbring up seven-year-old campaign finance violations against Schauer\nshows that Republican Governor Rick Snyder is in trouble and is trying\nany tactic he can to paint Schauer in a negative light.\n\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=G2FkccWd8zZ91kew5hj1tA\n\n\xa0\n\nRight-Wing Groups Take Tips from Alliance for a Better Minnesota\n\nIn Minnesota, right-wing groups have been attempting to copy Alliance\nfor a Better Minnesota for years. This year, however, three groups\nhave been successful in uniting corporate and business interests with\ncommon messages and themes. These include: Minnesota Jobs Coalition,\nUnited for Jobs, and Minnesota Action Network. The MN Jobs Coalition\nseems to be imitating ABM\'s rapid response use of social\nnetworks. Recently, they have been hitting Democratic Governor Dayton\non Twitter about the farm equipment repair tax, "secret"\ntrips, and regarding the Lieutenant Governor re-election. United for\nJobs is a new advocacy organization that was formed during the 2013\nlegislative session. They represent corporate special interests and\ntheir main focus has been on taxes. This is seen in TV ads they ran\nagainst the Governor\'s tax bill that increased income taxes on\nthe richest 2% of Minnesotans, and the petition they are currently\nrunning to repeal all three business taxes.\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=j2-AtJmymzsIE5TvWetHzw\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=ufShNHjdkaSMrmLHBnMe6A\n\nLastly, the MN Action Network is the Minnesota arm of former Senator\nNorm Coleman\'s American Action Network. This group has been\nconsolidating conservative power and building funds for paid election\ncommunications for next year. In a fundraising letter, media mogul\nStan Hubbard and CEO Tom Rosen each committed $50,000 to flip the\nGovernor\'s seat and legislature to Republican control. With\nconservative groups increasing their communication efforts, it is\nextremely important that we continue to hold right-wing groups and\npoliticians accountable.\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=wMwhHyZ6wFQiNtxKq82Lrw\n\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=i71spodL9a1LWsLwE3e4HQ\n\n\n\n:::\n\nCopyright 2012 ProgressNow\n\nChange your e-mail preferences or unsubscribe: http://www.pnstate.org/site/CO?i=LJzkbPbhQgFwp3so60apy2IGXu8Lfr2l&cid=0\n\n'
