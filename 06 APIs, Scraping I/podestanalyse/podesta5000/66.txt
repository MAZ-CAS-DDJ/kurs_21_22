I could also potentially do tomorrow, I just have a few different commitments from 11 am-1:45 pm.\r\nThanks, Juliet\r\n\r\nJuliet Eilperin\r\nWhite House Bureau Chief\r\nWashington Post\r\njuliet.eilperin@washpost.com<mailto:juliet.eilperin@washpost.com>\r\n(O) 202-334-7774\r\n(C) 202-302-3663\r\n@eilperin\r\n\r\nFrom: Jennifer Palmieri [mailto:jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com]\r\nSent: Wednesday, June 10, 2015 3:45 PM\r\nTo: Eilperin, Juliet\r\nCc: john.podesta@gmail.com\r\nSubject: Re: checking in on my book idea\r\n\r\nHi - this week is rough since we have launch on Saturday so don't think either one of us could give this good consideration at moment but could discuss next week.\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n\r\nOn May 28, 2015, at 5:48 PM, Eilperin, Juliet <Juliet.Eilperin@washpost.com<mailto:Juliet.Eilperin@washpost.com>> wrote:\r\nDear John,\r\nI sent you an email several weeks ago but you might have missed it, so I thought it would make sense to just email you once more, and cc Jen. Long story short, I have been discussing the idea of writing a third book with my agent and my editor at Knopf/Pantheon. In the course of those discussions, I have tentatively settled on the idea of a book that would look at the role you have played in the Democratic Party over the course of the last few decades. This would allow me to examine pivotal moments in two presidencies and one presidential campaign, as well as key ideas (including what does it mean to be a progressive and key environmental decisions).\r\n\r\nAs I\xe2\x80\x99m writing up my proposal, it would be helpful to know whether you\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to cooperate with such a book. I would imagine you would have reservations about a book that would be akin to a biography, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not really what this would be. I\xe2\x80\x99m aiming to write a book that helps explain how Washington works, by examining how someone behind the scenes has helped moved the levers of government and operated the machinery of campaigns. And of course, if the book doesn\xe2\x80\x99t garner a good advance I won\xe2\x80\x99t write it, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve got plenty of other things on my plate. But I think it could be an interesting project, and it would be great to know to what extent you\xe2\x80\x99d be open to talking to me about this.\r\n\r\nI know both of you are very busy, but just drop me a line when you get a chance. I will be traveling in Canada from Friday to Tuesday, but will be reachable all of the usual ways.\r\nBest, Juliet\r\n\r\nJuliet Eilperin\r\nWhite House Bureau Chief\r\nWashington Post\r\njuliet.eilperin@washpost.com<mailto:juliet.eilperin@washpost.com>\r\n(O) 202-334-7774\r\n(C) 202-302-3663\r\n@eilperin\r\n\r\n"
