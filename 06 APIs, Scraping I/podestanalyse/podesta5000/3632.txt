Seems a little late to call. We are planning to take the noon ferry to oak bluffs. Should get to the vineyard at 12:45. We can tale a cab to the house. What is the address?\n\nOn Aug 24, 2014 4:45 PM, "Sandler, Herbert" <hms@sandlerfoundation.org<mailto:hms@sandlerfoundation.org>> wrote:\n\n\nSent from my iPad\n'
