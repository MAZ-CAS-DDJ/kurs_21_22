We need to help Patrick with legal costs to fight this, because we don't need West's radical views in Congress any longer. \n\n*CLICK HERE TO HELP PATRICK MURPHY AGAINST ALLEN WEST* [ https://secure.actblue.com/page/vv_murphy ] \n\nIt's ironic that in his last desperate attempt to hold on to power, Allen West is turning to court. It's ironic because West violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice laws on torture, when he was in Iraq.\n\nIn short, Allen West turns to the law, only when he thinks the law will help Allen West. When he doesn't like the law, he thumbs his nose at it.\n\nAs in Iraq, Allen West is on the wrong side of the law, and is suing because he is the same loose cannon that he was in the military. \n\n*CLICK HERE TO HELP SEND ALLEN WEST HOME, FOR GOOD* [ https://secure.actblue.com/page/vv_murphy ] \n\nI take this extremely personally. Allen West's actions in Iraq put the lives of all the men and women I served with in danger. That he parades around like a man with honor is disgusting.\n\nSo, I am asking you to help one last time this year. Let's finally be rid of this man who is an embarrassment to all of us who served.\n\nSincerely, \nJon Soltz \nIraq War Veteran\nChairman, VoteVets.org\n@jonsoltz [ http://www.twitter.com/jonsoltz ] \n\n\n\n\nPAID FOR BY VOTEVETS PAC\nNOT AUTHORIZED BY ANY CANDIDATE OR CANDIDATE'S COMMITTEE\n\nUnsubscribe Here: https://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/6676/unsubscribe.jsp?Email=john.podesta@gmail.com&email_blast_KEY=1225506&organization_KEY=6676"
