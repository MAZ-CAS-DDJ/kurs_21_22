Just let me know if you'd like me to forward to\nprint there and I can, but just erring on caution.  Sandler Found will have\nyour LA memo, LA maps, and OGE 278 printed.\n\nOn this memo attached, totally fine to ignore everything outside this week\nfor a little longer, but if I don't get answers on some of these for this\nweek, they'll be OBE or we'll be scrambling to rearrange things.  Which is\nfine, but wanted you to be aware of the choices available.\n(i.e.,\nAre you going to NYC on Friday, whether in part or in total, either way\nmeaning we're cancelling/rearranging a few things like the run with\nStephanie Tata and lunch with Madeleine?\nMaybe Video in on Friday?\nDo you want to see Tawfic Khoury separately from Tony's dinner, because he\nwants to see you?\netc. etc)\n\nIt's selfish of me, I know, but mom is leaving Friday mid-day, and I'd\nrather not spend Thursday night scrambling on scheduling.  That said, of\ncourse I will if I have to.\n\nThanks!\n\nChat tomorrow if you like?  I have the house inspection in the morning and\nearly afternoon EST but will be working remotely while we follow the\ninspector around.\n"
