These\nlobbyists, who McCain has called "good people," have made millions by\nadvocating for Big Oil, insurance companies and Iraq contractors and white\nwashing the crimes of dictators.\n\n \n\n.         McCain has a history of doing favors for lobbyists -- from the\nKeating Five scandal to favors for Paxson, McCain has been a long-time\nadvocate for special interests that benefit him.  Being admonished by the\nSenate Ethics Committee for personally profiting from a real-estate deal\ndidn\'t curb McCain\'s favors for lobbyists.\n\n \n\n.         McCain\'s campaign is in the news yet again for the questionable\nlobbying activities of McCain\'s top aides.  The Washington\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/25/AR200806250\n2858.html?sid=ST2008062502934&pos=list>  Post wrote a front-page story on\nCampaign Manager Rick Davis, and how his lobbying career has profited from\nhis relationship with McCain.  And earlier this week, Tom Ridge, a campaign\nco-chair was in the news because he failed to disclose he was working for\nthe Albanian government.  \n\n \n\n.         Like Bush, McCain\'s campaign is run by lobbyists, for lobbyists.\nMcCain\'s campaign manager, top senior adviser, congressional liason and\nfinance director are just a few of McCain\'s lobbyists. His top adviser,\nCharlie Black, even made lobbying calls from the Straight Talk Express.\n\n \n\no    McCain has had at least 134 LOBBYISTS\n<http://mccainsource.com/corruption?id=0006>  who are advising, working for\nor raising money for his presidential campaign. \n\n \n\n.         McCain\'s lobbyist advisers, who develop his policies and would\nlead his administration, have made millions fighting against the interests\nof Americans. These lobbyists have received nearly half a billion dollars in\nlobbying fees from domestic clients over the past ten years according to a\nCampaign <http://www.campaignmoney.org/files/Embedded.pdf>  Money Watch\nreport.\n\n \n\n.         Like Bush, McCain\'s policies are crafted by lobbyists and help\nlobbyists and wealthy CEOs instead of helping families.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
