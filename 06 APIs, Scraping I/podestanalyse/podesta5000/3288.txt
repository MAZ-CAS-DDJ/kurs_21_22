In Flint, while the Mayor is awaiting the federal and state\n   resources to remove and replace the lead pipes, the Union Labor Life\n   Insurance Company (ULLICO) will offer up to $25 million in \xe2\x80\x9cgap financing\xe2\x80\x9d\n   in the form of low-cost loans so Flint can start this work immediately.\n   - And in Detroit, the American Federation of Teachers just announced\n   they will work to make sure that union pension funds can also be used to\n   renovate and overhaul classrooms and school infrastructure in Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s 97\n   pubic school buildings. Of course, the state must act as a partner in\n   addressing Detroit\'s public school debts, but the unions are doing more\n   than their part to help fix these egregious problems.\n\nBACKROUND:\n\n*FLINT*\n\n\n\n\xc2\xb7      *CGI/Labor Infrastructure Pension Funds* \xe2\x80\x93 In 2014, some of the\nlargest pension funds that handle union pensions made a CGI commitment,\npledging to invest over $10 billion in infrastructure projects nationwide.\nPresident Clinton encouraged this fund to help with Mayor Weaver\xe2\x80\x99s plans to\nreplace the city\xe2\x80\x99s lead pipes. Mayor Weaver\xe2\x80\x99s Fast Start Plan would replace\nthe city\'s 15,000 lead pipes in one year. This $55 million project would\ntarget high-risk households first, and expand in phase two to replace pipes\nfor all Flint water customers. While the Mayor is awaiting the federal and\nstate resources for the project, Union Labor Life Insurance Company\n(ULLICO) believes they can provide $25 to $30 million in \xe2\x80\x9cgap financing\xe2\x80\x9d in\nthe form of a low-cost loan. They also have experience investing in and\nmanaging municipal water systems (Rialto, CA). The Building Trades are also\nan important partner on the workforce side. The Mayor said one of their\nbiggest challenges is "lack of capacity" and manpower to move this project\nand will be working with the building trades to get the manpower she\nneeds. The Plumbers Union has provided early help (Chelsea visited the\nPlumbers Hall to thank them when she went to Flint), but the city will\nlikely need to draw on the skilled trades from around the region to\ncomplete a project of this scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*DETROIT*\n\n\n\n*Outline of Detroit Infrastructure Commitment Announcement*\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\x95      The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) has partnered with the\nAmalgamated Bank, the National League of Cities and the First Five Years\nFund to launch a $100 million Education Infrastructure Fund.\n\n\xc2\x95      This revolving loan fund provides affordable, flexible capital loans\nto public school systems for capital improvements and other infrastructure\nupgrades for early childhood facilities and K-12.\n\n\xc2\x95      It provides for acquisition, construction and term financing to\nbuild or improve classrooms..\n\n\xc2\x95      The capital needs of the Detroit public schools are critical and\ngrowing. The city\xe2\x80\x99s public schools have limited availability to adequate\nfacilities, and a dearth of low cost capital providers.\n\n\xc2\x95      Access to affordable capital will allow Detroit schools to renovate\nclassrooms to provide for a healthy & safe learning environment.\n\n\xc2\x95      The state of Michigan will serve as a critical backstop in the\nrestructuring lead by transition manager Judge Steven Rhodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\x95      The labor movement, together with its asset manager partners and\nother stakeholders (North America\xe2\x80\x99s Building Trades Unions and the Kresge\nFoundation) commit to provide the following for Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s schools;\n\no   Low-interest loans, technical and business assistance and energy audits\nto upgrade heating and water systems, retrofit lighting and replace\ninefficient windows, and provide for removal and abatement of lead, mold\nand asbestos;\n\no   Work closely with the Mayor, community, Detroit Public School District\nand Judge Rhodes and other stakeholders to renovate and overhaul classrooms\nand school infrastructure in Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s 97 pubic school buildings. This\neffort is conditioned on local control and the state acting as a partner in\nassuming and Detroit public schools debt, and in backing any new financing;\n\no   Other projects as mutually agreed;\n\no\n\n\n\n\xc2\x95      *Our consortium sets a goal of deploying $50 million in capital over\nthe next year to achieve the goals outlined above*.\n\n\xc2\x95      In the event the local landscape is stabilized and strengthened with\nthe return of local control to the people of Detroit and the creation of a\ngenuinely local entity with broad authority  to oversee new schools,\ninterventions, and closures, we anticipate exploring the possibility of\ncommitting even more capital and support to all public schools in the City.\xe2\x80\x9dOn\nSun, Mar 6, 2016 at 1:27 PM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com> wrote:\n\nHe\'s leaving for North Carolina so highlighting will need to be done on\nsocial or by her.
