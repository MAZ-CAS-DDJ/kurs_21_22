john.podesta@gmail.comb'John --\n\nKirsten said it best: "When the radical, right-wing fringe launches its attacks against Democrats, there\'s only one good way to respond -- FIGHT BACK."\n\nThis week, Republicans blocked the DISCLOSE Act in the Senate. This was one of our best chances to rein in the unlimited power the Supreme Court gave to corporations and special interests in their Citizens United decision. Republicans know that progressives like Kirsten have a better plan and message, which is why they\'ll do anything to protect their money flowing in from mega-corporations. We need you to help Kirsten so she has the resources to stand up to them in November. \n\nWe\'re just three days from our critical goal of 500 donors before July 31, and we need your help before it\'s too late. \n\nClick here to rush your contribution of $250, $500, or more to Kirsten\'s campaign. You\'re donation will help Kirsten continue to fight back.

When BP tried to duck responsibility for the oil spill, I helped lead the effort to guarantee a thorough investigation to hold them accountable. I\'m doing everything I can to repeal "Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell."\n*\nBut taking on the usual right-wing bullies means they will surely come after me. I need help from 500 donors before July 31 to make sure I can fight back. *\n*\nClick here to make a contribution today of $250, $500, or more to my campaign. Even a small contribution from you helps show the extreme right wing that we\'ll never back down.* [ https://secure.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/827/p/wfc/dscc/senators/gillibrand/donate.sjs?donate_page_KEY=8332 ]\n\n*The reason these national Republicans spend all their time attacking us is obvious. They don\'t have a real plan for getting Americans back to work and moving this country forward.*\n\nTheir only response to any problem is to figure out what Democrats are for, and then rant and rave about repealing it. That\'s not leadership. That\'s just flat-out obstruction.\n\nSo instead of real ideas for creating jobs or finally doing something about climate change, we get the right-wing media running sideshow stories 24/7. Their only interest is making Democrats look bad and scaring us into backing down from the values we hold dear.\n*\nThey don\'t scare me, and I\'ll never give up our core principles.* I need your help before the end of the month to show them once and for all: we\'re sick of their scare tactics, and we\'re fighting back.\n*\nClick here to make a contribution of $250, $500, or more to my campaign.

But the truth is that hearing the radical right say some nasty words about me is nothing compared to the struggles New Yorkers face every day trying to put food on the table and to give their kids a better life.\n\nThat\'s who I\'m fighting for. I know I can count on you to stand with me every step of the way.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKirsten Gillibrand \n\nContribute.
