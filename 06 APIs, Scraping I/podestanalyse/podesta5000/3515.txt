john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hey sir. This was just sent to me from the ap. I didn\'t call back.\nThought you would be interested in this.  Js\n\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: "Kuhnhenn, Jim" <jkuhnhenn@ap.org>\nDate: Tue, 13 May 2008 10:44:45 -0500\nSubject: Obama donors\nTo: jon@votevets.org\n\nJon,\nLong time since we last talked. Hope you are well.\nWanted to check in with you because last night I heard that at a recent\nmeeting of Obama\'s finance team, Penny Pritzker, Obama national finance\nchair, urged top fundraisers to cut off organizations deemed to be too\nclose to Hillary Clinton.\nAmong the ones I was told she mentioned were Media Matters, Center for\nAmerican Progress and VoteVets. I never considered you guys partisan in\nthat sense, so I was surprised to hear your group mentioned by my\nsource.\nThe source has this third hand and was not present at the meeting.\nBut I wondered if you had heard anything along these lines. And if you\nhad, whether you could put me in touch with a primary source _ someone\nwho heard Pritzker say this.\nBest,\njimk\n\nJim Kuhnhenn\nPolitics reporter\nWashington Bureau\nThe Associated Press\n1100 13th St. NW, 5th Floor\nWashington, D.C. 20005\n\n202-641-9465 (office)\n202-264-0783 (cell)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information contained in this communication is intended for the use\nof the designated recipients named above.
