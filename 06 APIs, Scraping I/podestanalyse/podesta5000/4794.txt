John McCain\x92s selection today of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate is further evidence that a McCain presidency will be just another four years of the same old Bush-style anti-choice policies. Just like McCain, Palin opposes a woman\x92s right to choose. Palin has also stated her opposition to abortion even in cases of rape or incest. \n\x93John McCain\x92s choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate proves just how rigid and extreme his administration would be when it comes to a woman\x92s right to choose,\x94 Keenan said. \x93For 25 years, McCain has opposed a woman\x92s right to choose, and we know that he will continue to push anti-choice policies in the White House. McCain\x92s pick of anti-choice Sarah Palin is further evidence that his White House will be just another four years of Bush-style policies. Any remaining doubts about McCain\x92s extreme anti-choice position should be put to rest when voters learn about the combined anti-choice records of Sarah Palin and John McCain.\x94 \nPalin, a member of the anti-choice group Feminists for Life, said during her campaign for governor that she is opposed to abortion, even in cases of rape or incest. [Juneau Empire, \x93Abortion Draws Clear Divide in State Races,\x94 accessed 8/29/08 and Anchorage Daily News, \x93Governor\x92s Race: Top contenders meet one last time to debate,\x94 11/03/06.]\xa0 \n\x93Americans are tired of the kind of divisive anti-choice policies that Sen. McCain and Gov. Palin have pledged to continue to support. The contrast between pro-choice Sen. Obama and anti-choice Sen. McCain is clear. Voters are looking for a leader who respects women\x92s freedom and privacy.\xa0 Barack Obama is that leader.\x94 \nSen. McCain\x92s selection of Palin as his vice-presidential running mate is especially troublesome for the unique audience of women voters NARAL Pro-Choice America is targeting: Independent and Republican pro-choice women in suburban and exurban swing districts. These women play a pivotal role in the presidential election. Recent polling confirms how, once these voters know McCain\x92s extreme opposition to a woman\x92s right to choose and family planning, they will switch parties to support Sen. Barack Obama. \nNARAL Pro-Choice America, which tracks all choice-related votes in Congress and ranks all 50 states on the status of women\x92s reproductive rights, classifies Sarah Palin as anti-choice. \nInformation about the polling can be found here [link to:  <http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/files/naralpollmemo061608.pdf> http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/files/naralpollmemo061608.pdf].
