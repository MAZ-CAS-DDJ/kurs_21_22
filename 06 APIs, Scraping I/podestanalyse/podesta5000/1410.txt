But we should be mindful that Al Qaeda has attempted to influence elections in the past  to magnify the media coverage of their terrorist activities and reminding us they are still around.   Even more disturbing is the fact that Abu Yahya al-Libi should never have been able to make this statement in the first place, if the Bush administration had done its job and kept him from escaping Bagram Air Force base."\n\nPlease also see recent articles written by Richard Clarke <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=6pnchtcab.0.0.olnitxbab.0&ts=S0371&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Farticles%2Fopinion%2F2008%2F10%2F02%2Fwhy-osama-bin-laden-and-al-qaeda-might-try-to-affect-the-election-between-barack-obama-and-john-mccain.html&id=preview> and R.P.
