That's what Karl Rove's Super PAC just spent in one day - one day!\n\nI'm not sure where Rove is getting this money, but he's not running out any time soon. Rove and his Tea Party buddies are pounding us right now.\n\nWe're on TV responding, which is keeping us in the game. But if we don't raise $30,000 by Friday at 5 P.M., we won't have enough to fund our TV ads and we'll have to pull them down. If that happens, this race is over. \n\nWe're only $9,522 away, but we only have 26 hours - I need your help right now.\n\nI'm counting on you. In 26 hours, it'll be too late. Click here to rush $20 or more right away to keep us up on TV.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/seanmaloney?refcode=20121025d&amounts=20,50,100,250,1000\n\nThere's only 12 days left. If we finish strong and close the gap, we're going to win this thing. And it will be because of your support. Thank you.\n\nSean\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\nPaid for by Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n\nSean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n18 West Main St\nBeacon, NY 12508\n\nTo unsubscribe from this mailing list, click here - http://images.myngp.com/unsubscribe.aspx?crypt=Casv%2frrJxGAq9DTl%2f1OHiHqjYnYu9HWT1Mk1a0mUrSE%3d\n\nPowered by NGP VAN, Inc.\n\n"
