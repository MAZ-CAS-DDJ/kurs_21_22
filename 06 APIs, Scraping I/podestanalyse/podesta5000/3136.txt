I forgot to mention something critical on the pace calculator: the estimated time is done according to relative miles (which factors in elevation as best it can). If your pace has changed drastically, let me know and I'll update the calculator accordingly in another week or so. Final versions will go in the binders I'll make for each van (including the race bible and directions to exchanges and to/from hotel). \n\nVan 2, Emily has been training like a beast and offered to switch running slots if anyone has been having difficulty training or physical ailments. Let her and me know if you want to switch. \n\nEryn M.

And don't limit yourself to just vans--think Suburbans too!  Please please please!  Otherwise we're going to have to rent a van, which will be split in the total cost at the end.\n> \n> 2) START TIME FYI: Due to a glitch in the Ragnar system on the day of start time assignments, many users got booted out.  If your account we got booted, let me know.  But also, we 9:30 am.  I'm appealing for 10 am (we did this last year successfully) since that's now an option.\n> \n> 3) PACE CALCULATOR: See attached for timing estimates based on a 9:30 am start time.  If we get 10 am, then it's just a simple matter of adding ~30 minutes. Now if any of you are math geeks, here's where I might need your help!  If you notice any gross errors (don't nitpick me over 30 seconds--sometimes I rounded up or down), please let me know, as I'm not getting much more than 2-3 ours of sleep at a time these days and my math could be off. Hopefully this helps everyone with training.\n> \n> Happy running!\n> Eryn\n> \n> -- \n> Eryn M. Sepp\n> Cell: 818-456-2881\n> <Ragnar Race Tracker_2015.pdf>\n"
