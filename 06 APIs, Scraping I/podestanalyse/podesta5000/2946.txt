She has\nmany friends in the reception today at 230 in Seattle.   Linden, the host,\nis intending to speak with you about privately.  I suspect that Linden will\nask you to ask HRC to call Ambassador Stroum.\n\nAmbassador Stroum did raise millions for Obama and has put the blame\nsquarely on HRC for this situation.  I just wanted to give you a heads-up,\nI'm not sure there is a clean solution to this but I didn't want you to be\nsurprised.\n\nThanks for visiting Seattle, enjoy our people!\n\n-- \nLindsay Roitman\nDeputy National Finance Director, NW\n206-851-5092\n"
