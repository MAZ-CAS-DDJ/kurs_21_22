Just a couple weeks ago, an outside group launched baseless attacks to drag Ann's name through the mud.\n\nOne thing's clear: Ugly attacks like this aren't going to stop.\n\nThat's why we're launching Ann's Grand Canyon Action Fund -- a project dedicated to backing up Ann so she can continue to fight for Arizona families.\n\nWe need to reach 100 donations before Wednesday to get this project off the ground, but we can't do it without your help.\n\nYou can become a Founding Member of the Grand Canyon Action Fund, but only if you act fast. Please chip $5 or more to become a member immediately.\n\nJohn Podesta\nGOAL: 100 DONATIONS\nYour Support: $5.00\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/kirkpatrickq42014?refcode=em_FR_2014.12.29_b1_admin_ldnd-nd&amp;amp;recurring=auto&amp;amp;amount=25&amp;amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;amp;firstname=John&amp;amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;amp;city=Washington&amp;amp;state=DC&amp;amp;zip=20016&amp;amp;phone=2162818851&amp;amp;occupation=&amp;amp;employer=\n\nEvery donation helps us hit our goal.
