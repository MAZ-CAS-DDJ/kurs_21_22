Bush's most loyal buddies.  Her 39th birthday that year was my first event working for her. Despite the long odds, Kirsten believed that the strength of her message, coupled with a relentless determination to serve her community, would carry her candidacy to victory.\n\nThanks to the support of people like you... she was right.\n\nFour years later, on the threshold of her 43rd birthday, that same drive, that same message - of honesty, transparency, and integrity, of a government that is responsible to the people it serves - is as strong as ever.\n\nI hope you'll take a moment to join me in signing a birthday card for Kirsten. She spends each and every day thinking about how she can fight for every New Yorker, and now is our chance to let her know just how much we appreciate the work that she does.\n\nAlso, for folks in the NYC area, this Saturday, December 12th we are having a birthday celebration fundraiser.\n\nDetails can be found at www.kirstengillibrand.com/december12.\n\nWarmly,\nRoss Offinger"
