That would seem like a private comment that she didn\'t intend to become public -- to an unfriendly audience, no less -- and so it might achieve the same effect of getting her on the record on this issue, but with less perception that she is putting a finger to the wind. I just worry that announcing our position so fulsomely in an oped amounts to leading with our chin and will inspire loud cries of hypocrisy from reporters.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could just issue an infrastructure fact sheet, acting like that was our planned announcement, and rely on the Keystone to leak, either organically or with an assist from us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Sep 8, 2015 at 5:32 PM, Nikki Budzinski <nbudzinski@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:nbudzinski@hillaryclinton.com>> wrote:\r\nYes, correct to Joel\'s comment.

Can you live with that?\r\n\r\n\r\nKeystone XL points us toward an energy future that puts the United States and our global climate at even greater risk. But building clean, secure, and affordable North American energy future is bigger than Keystone XL or any other single project.\r\n\r\nWe can make the United States the global leader in the fight against climate change and the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. That\xe2\x80\x99s why today I am announcing a comprehensive strategy to modernize American energy infrastructure and forge a new partnership with Canada and Mexico to cut carbon pollution across the continent and combat climate change, unleashing billions in investment, delivering reliable and affordable energy, protecting the health of our families and communities, and creating good-paying jobs and careers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Mon, Sep 7, 2015 at 7:59 PM, Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com<mailto:jbenenson@bsgco.com>> wrote:\r\nI understand the point.

We have to have a single big idea that encapsulates her vision on this and link it to our country\xe2\x80\x99s future.

In answer to research: changed 20 to 40, and Trevor can provide calculations based on EIA data, if reporters need it, on the Mexico/Canada trade point. It isn\'t written up neatly in one place online, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nJoel, we pumped up the climate impacts but in discussing with Jake decided we do still need to address why she\'s making her position known, when she has previously said she will wait for the President to make a decision. Added a line about wanting to let voters know where she stands, and added a more expansive graf about making the US the leader in fighting climate change and becoming a clean energy superpower.
