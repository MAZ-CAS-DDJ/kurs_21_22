I get a lot of credit for the speech I gave at the 2004 convention -- but I think she may have me beat.\n\nYou have to see it to believe it:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/michelle\n\nAnd make sure to forward this email to your friends and family -- they'll want to see it, too.\n\nYou really don't want to miss this.\n\nAnd I'm not just saying that because she's my wife -- I truly believe it was the best speech of the campaign so far.\n\nBarack\n\n\nDonate: https://donate.barackobama.com/standtogether\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Obama for America\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscribe\n\n"
