Paid media catching up with her.\n\nI have done a careful review of the processes for the project we discussed\ngoing back to 1976. Would like to deliver a memo to you on the history,\nlessons learned, and a recommended process for you this time around. Do you\nhave time for a short call this weekend? Should we get together at the end\nof next week?\n\nDone well, this is a time consuming task. Given the early convention date,\nwill need to get an agreed task and timeline in place fairly soon.\n\nBest.\n\nTom\n"
