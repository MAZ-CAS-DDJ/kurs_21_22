I'm glad Mandy was\nstand up.  And as I said, I'm really glad you were there - I know it\nwouldn't have been the same.  It's not the best dynamic, but sometimes she\nreally just needs to be pushed really, really hard.\n\nI'm glad I emailed - thanks for telling me -and I'm glad she responded to\nme, but I know campaign did the work here.\n\nOn Tue, Sep 8, 2015 at 5:28 PM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n> See my comments on back end of this.
