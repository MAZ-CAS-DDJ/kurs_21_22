I think she can refer to the debate without specifically citing him, because skeptics of her will say, Hillary's jumping on the piketty bandwagon.  \n\nOn May 16, 2014, at 7:04 AM, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin.hrco@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n> + Jake on Picketty. HRC had wanted to mention him as you suggest but Jake thought that it ended up sounding like she was trying too hard to clamor on board the latest bandwagon and made the rest of the speech feel less authentic -- which to me was convincing. Does that resonate with you at all?\n> \n> \n> \n> On May 16, 2014, at 4:23 AM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com> wrote:\n> \n>> Dan,\n>> This is good. Three small points:\n>> 1) In the section on her Mom, if possible, I'd add a couple of sentences on background of what progressive politics did to help her succeed. Good public schools, minimum wage, something so it's not just her grit that worked. That's the conservative narrative. If that's not doable in this speech, I think we need to work on that going forward. I do a version of that in my book Power of Progress, around my parents who come from even more humble backgrounds, but who succeeded and gave a chance for us to succeed.\n>> 2) what do you think about a conscious reference to Picketty in the section on economists analysis of growth and inequality? It's all the rage and weighing in on the the debate may make her seem tuned in and sympathetic to the leaning left argument. Not arguing for much here. Just a reference to the debate he has set off.\n>> 3) strike the gushing on Anne-Marie.

Tomorrow, HRC is going to speak at the New America Foundation. We have two goals with this: 1) Preview her youth employment work at the Foundation and 2) add her voice to the national debate about economic inequality and mobility.  This will very likely get a fair amount of attention.  So would love your thoughts. Have also sent to Neera, who has helped me develop the material. \n>>> \n>>> Thanks\n>>> Dan\n>>> <2014-05-16 New America 2am.docx>\n"
