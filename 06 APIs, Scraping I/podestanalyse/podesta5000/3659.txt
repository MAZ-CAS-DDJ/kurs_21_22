john.podesta@gmail.comb"Hi all -\n\nWanted to share the current plans for nyc - we still have a lot of\nflexibility. I made a few reservations so we had them but we can make\nchanges. Current thinking is no formal party.\n\nDec 22 - tent. reservation at Gato (Bobby Flay) at 6:45 - this may be too\nearly so we can do something else or we can eat at home\n\nDec 23 - matinee - dinner TBD\n\nDec 24th - dinner at home with Metexia and the boys; Mom is in charge of\nexploring church\n\nDec 25th - Dinner at Marea at 7:30; afternoon at Rolfs.  Tony, if you'd\nprefer to switch the ressie to another spots you forwarded to me, please\nfeel free!\n\nDec 26th - lunch at Bouley at 2:15 (it's a pre-fix 5 courses for $50 and is\nsupposed to be a good deal, but if we're sick of eating at fancy places,\nwould rather go to one of the cooler spots, or prefer to do other\nactivities like see a play definitely don't need to do this)\n\nDec 26th - evening -> tentative plan to have dinner with Alex / Sam, Swe\nand Jost...maybe in Brooklyn? But nothing confirmed.\n\nDec 27th - may be only non-wet day so we can go see the tree, etc. Have a\nreservation at Nonna's on Staten Island at 530 or 6. Tony, if you'd rather\ngo to Italian spot with the reviews in the Bronx instead we definitely can\n(thinking we'll do one or the other)\n\nMae\n"
