That's how much time we have left to prepare for the Obama-Biden Administration that will bring the change Americans demanded so strongly in this past election.\n\nPresident-elect Obama has set a high bar for the Transition team: to execute the most efficient, organized, and transparent transfer of power in American history. As a co-Chair for the Transition, I want to tell you about a few steps we've already taken to achieve this goal.\n\nFirst, we adopted the strictest ethics guidelines ever applied to any transition team. President-elect Obama pledged to change the way Washington works, and that begins with shifting influence away from special interests and restoring it to the everyday Americans who are passionate about fixing the problems facing our country.\n\nOpening up the Transition means listening to your ideas and stories and providing a window into how the process works.\n\nTo give you a look at how we're approaching some of the nation's most pressing issues, we filmed this meeting of our Energy and Environment Policy Transition Team and interviewed team member Heather Zichal.\n\nWatch the video and submit your ideas on energy and the environment:<http://change.gov/energyteamvid>\n[http://www.change.gov/page/-/email/20081119_envirovid.jpg]<http://change.gov/energyteamvid>\n\nPresident-elect Obama and Vice President-elect Biden have set an ambitious agenda, and we are going to make Change.gov<http://change.gov> a source of information, as well as a place to participate in the decisions being made about your government.\n\nSince the decisions we're making affect all Americans, we're counting on citizens from every walk of life to get involved. You can help us right now by making sure your friends and neighbors know about Change.gov<http://change.gov> and give their input, too.\n\nWe're continuing to develop new ways to open up the process, and we'll keep you posted along the way.\n\nThanks,\n\nJohn\n\nJohn Podesta\nObama-Biden Presidential Transition Team\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent copyright (c) 2008.
