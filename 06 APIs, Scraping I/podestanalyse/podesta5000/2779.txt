Since then, I've been teaching Business Communications\nin Singapore through a year-long fellowship with Princeton in Asia.\n\nI will be back in October, and I am applying for a Advocacy Associate\nposition in the Generation Progress area of the Center for American\nProgress. I'd like to learn more about the position, and I was wondering if\nyou could put me in touch with someone at the organization to get more\ninformation. I've attached my resume for further background on my\nexperiences.\n\nThank you very much for your advice, and I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest,\nDan Healy\n\n-- \nDaniel G. Healy\nPrinceton in Asia 2013-14\nGeorgetown University 2013\n"
