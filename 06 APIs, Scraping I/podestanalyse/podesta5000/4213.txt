Today, because of you, we\'re calling on\none Senator to use today to truly honor veterans by ending his\nhold on a veterans spending bill.\n\nEarlier in the week, I urged you to sign our petition calling on\nmy Senator Tom Coburn to end his hold of S. 1963, "The\nCaregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2009." \n\nWithin hours, over 10,000 of you signed. Today, we\'re turning\nover 13,000 signatures to the Senator. The petition was covered\nby the Military Times newspapers, which you can read here\n(http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/11/military_akaka_coburn_veteransbill_110609w/).\n\nBy blocking this bill Sen. Coburn is denying veterans a myriad\nof benefits and services: Caregiver assistance to our most\nwounded veterans, who often need assistance to do some of the\nsmallest tasks; Funding for such issues as mental health care\nfor women who suffered military sexual trauma, women\'s health\ncare needs and medical services for newborn children; Aid for\nrural veteran health care issues; Mental health care; and,\nPrograms to help ease the burden of veteran homelessness.\n\nOn this veterans day, I\'d urge Senator Coburn to think about the\nthousands and thousands of veterans he?s hurting by playing\npolitics with veterans care. The best thing he can do to honor\nveterans today is to release his hold on this bill. Because of\nyou, the pressure is on him to do so. \n\nToday, we honor all of America?s veterans. Now it\'s time for\nSenator Coburn to join us.\n\nSincerely,\nMiranda Norman\nIraq War Veteran\nOklahoma State Captain, VoteVets.org\n\nAnd Jon, Peter, Brian, Richard, and the entire VoteVets.org team\n\nPaid for by VoteVets.org\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nVisit the web address below to tell your friends about this.\n\nhttp://ga3.org/join-forward.html?domain=votevets&r=61dUYd5au-T2\n\nIf you received this message from a friend, you can sign up for\nVoteVets.org at:\n\nhttp://ga3.org/votevets/join.html?r=61dUYd5au-T2E\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThis message was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.
