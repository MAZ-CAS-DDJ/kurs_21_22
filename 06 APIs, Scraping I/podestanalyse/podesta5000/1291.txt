john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi,\n\n \n\nI think this is a good idea.  \n\n \n\nSo it is not perceived as a snub by us policy teams, could someone on the\nboard let the agency leads know that this is a general decision and why?  At\nleast the HHS team knows we are working on a memo (draft has not been\nshared).  We are trying to do that "lashing up" thing and would appreciate\nthat the news not come from us.  \n\n \n\nThanks, Jeanne\n\n \n\nFrom: Christopher Edley [mailto:cedley@gmail.com] \nSent: Saturday, October 18, 2008 6:48 PM\nTo: John Podesta; Benjamin Todd Jealous; Chris Lu; Cassandra Butts\nCc: Jeanne Lambrew; Alex Aleinikoff; Mariano-Florentino Cuellar;\nDarling-Hammond, Linda\nSubject: Leaks\n\n \n\nI\'ve spoken or corresponded with a few people on my policy teams.  I\nrecommend that we share no policy documents with the agency review teams --\nincluding the leads.  For the 20-page documents this week, I have grave\nreservations about electronic distribution to anyone other than members of\nthe board and the most senior members of the staff. I see very little upside\nto broader distribution, and a great deal of risk, especially prior to 11/4.\n\n\n-- \n(personal email)\nChristopher Edley, Jr.\nProfessor and Dean\nUC Berkeley Law School\n\n'
