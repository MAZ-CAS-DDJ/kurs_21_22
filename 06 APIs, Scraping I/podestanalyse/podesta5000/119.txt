DelReal\n\n\n\nJanuary 28, 2015\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post\n\n\n\nFormer GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney on Wednesday will lodge some of his sharpest attacks yet against likely Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nHis comments, which come as speculation over a third Romney White House bid grows, suggest a strong push to orient his next campaign around economic issues facing the poor and to tie Clinton to the Obama administration\x92s economic policies.\n\n\n\n\x93Short term, our economy is looking up. But it is a lot better for the few, and pretty darn discouraging for the many,\x94 Romney will say in a speech at Mississippi State University Wednesday, according to a copy of his prepared remarks. \x93How can Secretary Clinton provide opportunity for all if she doesn\'t know where jobs come from in the first place?\n\n\n\nRomney\x92s comments appear to reference a Clinton stump speech from October, in which the former secretary of state dismissed \x93trickle-down\x94 economic theory.\n\n\n\n"Don\'t let anybody tell you that, you know, it\'s corporations and businesses that create jobs. You know that old theory, trickle-down economics. That has been tried. That has failed," Clinton said in a speech in October.\n\n\n\nCritics seized upon her comments to paint her as anti-business and her team later said that she had intended to make a comment about tax cuts for corporations. Critics pointed to the botched line as evidence that Clinton would run into trouble appealing to the growing populists voices in her party.\n\n\n\nThis isn\'t the first time Romney has gone after Clinton on middle class issues. Earlier Wednesday, Romney\'s team criticized Clinton\x92s \x93lifestyle of the rich and famous" in an effort to downplay the extent to which his own wealth may factor into another White House run.\n\n\n\n\x93It\'s going to be hard for Hillary Clinton to make Mitt Romney\'s wealth a fruitful line of attack, with her multi-million dollar mansions in Georgetown and Chappaqua and her jet-setting lifestyle of the rich and famous," a Romney aide told the Boston Globe.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Romney will also hit Clinton on her tenure as secretary of state, experience which Clinton touted in her most recent book, Hard Choices,\x94 and which will likely become a linchpin in her rationale for her White House run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\x93Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cluelessly pressed a reset button for Russia, which smiled and then invaded Ukraine, a sovereign nation. The Middle East and much of North Africa is in chaos,\x94 Romney is expected to say. \x93Doesn\'t the President understand that some of what we are seeing in the world is in part the result of his timid foreign policy. \x85 Strong American leadership is desperately needed for the world, and for America.\x94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRomney aims at Clinton, Obama in Mississippi speech<http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2015/01/28/romney-hillary-clinton-foreign-policy/> (USAT)\n\nBy Catalina Camia\n\n\n\nJanuary 28, 2015\n\n\n\nUSA Today\n\n\n\nMitt Romney plans to swing at possible rival Hillary Rodham Clinton and President Obama when he speaks Wednesday night at Mississippi State University.\n\n\n\nThe once-and-possibly-future presidential candidate will criticize Clinton and Obama on foreign policy, and jab at the former secretary of State on economics. In one line, Romney will make reference to remarks on job creation that Clinton had to clarify during the 2014 midterm elections.\n\n\n\n\x93How can Secretary Clinton provide opportunity for all if she doesn\x92t know where jobs come from in the first place?\x94 Romney will say, according to excerpts provided to USA TODAY.  \x93We need a president who will do what it takes to bring more good paying jobs to the placement offices of our college campuses.\x94\n\n\n\nAt a campaign event in Massachusetts, Clinton suggested corporations and businesses don\x92t create jobs when making a point about the impact of trickle-down economics. She later said she \x93shorthanded\x94 her point and was not clear in denouncing tax breaks for corporations that outsource jobs or stash their profits overseas.\n\n\n\nThe speech at Mississippi State University is only Romney\x92s third public appearance since the 2012 GOP presidential nominee told donors that he\x92s seriously considering a 2016  campaign for the White House. In the excerpts, Romney touches on foreign policy, economic opportunity and poverty \x97 the topics he says that have concerned him the most since his 2012 campaign.\n\n\n\nOn foreign policy, Romney plans to hit Clinton on tense relations with the government in Moscow and say she \x93cluelessly pressed a reset button for Russia, which smiled and then invaded Ukraine, a sovereign nation.\x94\n\n\n\nAs he did in the 2012 campaign, Romney will charge that Obama has mishandled a wide range of threats in the Middle East. He\x92ll also criticize Obama for misreading the danger of terrorist groups such as the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\n\n\n\n\x93The president\x92s dismissal of real global threats in his State of the Union Address was naive at best and deceptive at worst,\x94 Romney will. \x93ISIS represents a new level of threat, given its oil revenues, vast territory and ability to recruit even in the West. I don\x92t know how the president expects to defeat the jihadists if he won\x92t even call them what they are.\x94\n\n\n\nRomney also plans to make the case that a new set of policies are needed to help end \x93chronic generational poverty\x94 as a way to help people who find themselves in a cycle that goes from one era to the next.\n\n\n\n\x93It\x92s finally time to apply conservative principles that improve America\x92s education system, promote family formation and create good-paying jobs,\x94 he will say, according to his speech excerpts.\n\n\n\nRomney speaks at 7 p.m. ET as part of Mississippi State\x92s global lecture series. He also plans to take questions after the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans Have Finally Found Their Answer to Hillary Clinton<https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ver=16.0.554.16&cver=16.0.547.11#path=/mail> (VICE)\n\nBy Kevin Lincoln\n\n\n\nJanuary 28th, 2015\n\n\n\nVICE\n\n\n\nAmerica, we have our Benghazi candidate. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina endeared herself to the right wing by invoking that most beloved of conservative hobbyhorses, positioning herself as the GOP\'s response to the Democratic heir apparent.\n\n\n\n"Like Hillary Clinton, I too have travelled hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe. But unlike her, I have actually accomplished something. Mrs. Clinton, flying is an activity, not an accomplishment," Fiorina told activists at the Iowa Freedom Summit Saturday. "I have met Vladimir Putin and know that it will take more to halt his ambitions than a gimmicky red Reset button," she boasted. "I know Bibi Netanyahu and know that when he warns us, over and over and over again, that Iran is a danger to this nation as well as to his own, that we must listen."\n\n\n\nAnd then the kicker: "Unlike Hillary Clinton, I know what difference it makes that our ambassador to Libya and three other brave Americans were killed in a deliberate terrorist attack on the anniversary of 9/11 and that the response of our nation must be more forceful that the arrest of a single individual a year later."\n\n\n\nIt was a ballsy move for a potential candidate whose name is so far down the list of Republican 2016 favorites that most voters don\'t even know who she is, much less that she\'s thinking about running for president. But it worked: In a party desperate for female faces, Fiorina might be the Mitt Romney\x96Hillary Clinton hybrid conservatives have been waiting for.\n\n\n\nFiorina\'s origin story is a good one: Stanford-educated wanderer who ends up working as a secretary, then, with a little hard work and ingenuity, ascends the corporate ladder to take over Hewlett Packard in 1999, becoming the first woman in history to run a Fortune 20 company\x97a glass-ceiling milestone Time magazine described as "arguably more important" than "America\'s women winning the soccer World Cup." The parallels to Clinton and her own glass-ceiling-breaking are obvious\x97they even picked matching memoir titles.\n\n\n\nBut for Fiorina, unlike Clinton, the summit proved harder than the climb. Her career at HP was mired in corporate soap operas, during which time the company\'s stock lost more than 50 percent of its value and thousands of employees lost their jobs. Fiorina, meanwhile, became a CEO celebrity and an outspoken cheerleader for outsourcing, developing a reputation as an autocratic manager and generally terrible boss. She was eventually forced out in 2005, leaving HP with a $21 million golden parachute and an unenviable legacy. (InfoWorld listed Fiorina as one of "Tech\'s All-Time Top 25 Flops," calling her the "anti-Steve Jobs.")\n\n\n\nFive years after being ousted, Fiorina attempted a comeback, running for Senate in California against veteran Democratic incumbent Barbara Boxer. This initial foray into electoral politics was a disaster, highlighted by what\'s known as the "Demon Sheep Ad," a breathtaking piece of incoherence that compared Fiorina\'s primary opponent to a demonic sheep. It\'s one of the worst/best political advertisements of all time, and it put Fiorina on national radar, at least until Boxer obliterated her in the statewide election.\n\n\n\nIf Fiorina does decide to run for president, this is the record she will have to spin for voters: a controversial career as a real-life Bill Lumbergh, and a Senate campaign that reached its zenith by dressing a man up as a farm animal. But judging by her speech in Iowa and the elated response from right-wing activists, the idea of a Carly 2016 campaign may not be quite as ludicrous as it sounds.\n\n\n\nConservatives have always fantasized that the president is just "America\'s CEO," and Fiorina, despite her very mixed record as a business executive, seems to fill that role, at least for the kinds of people who show up at the Iowa Freedom Summit, a right-wing circus that exists mostly for the economic benefit of the state\'s Tea Party cottage industry. In addition to her Benghazi drum-beating, she staked out territory as a fervent opponent of abortion\x97"liberals believe that flies are worth protecting," she told the audience, "but that the life of an unborn child is not"\x97and a free-market conservative. Recently, she even went so far as to write an op-ed for the Washington Post defending corporate victims like Royal Dutch Shell, the 11th-biggest company in the world, against Greenpeace\'s "climate-change pressure campaigns."\n\n\n\nThe truth is, Republican voters have fallen for a lot worse. Herman Cain, for example. Or Fred Thompson. In time, Fiorina will almost certainly meet the same fate as these other Republican one-night-stands. But as the only potential female candidate in a vast sea of old, mostly white men, she\'s uniquely positioned to bash Hillary Clinton from the right\x97a priceless trump card that could give this Benghazi lemon more juice than anyone imagined.\n\n\n\n\nAn unnoticed part of Hillary Clinton\'s record -- her work for foster kids<http://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2015/01/an_unnoticed_part_of_hillary_c.html> (PennLive.com)\n\nBy Ann F. Lewis\n\n\n\nJanuary 28, 2015\n\n\n\nPennLive.com\n\n\n\nWhat do Hillary Clinton, former Republican Whip Tom DeLay, and the founder of Wendy\'s have in common?\n\n\n\nHint: It isn\'t politics. This unusual coalition worked together to make a better life for children in orphanages and foster care; work that has made a real difference for tens of thousands of young people.\n\n\n\nOrphans and foster care children are not exactly a high-powered political group in Washington.\n\n\n\nThere were no lobbyists calling on their behalf, no one demanding Hillary take this on. I was working in the White House at the time, so I got to watch up close \x96 but otherwise I might never have known!\n\n\n\nSo why did she do it? Because Hillary believed it was the right thing to do.\n\n\n\n>From working at the Children\'s Defense Fund right after law school to her efforts to expand early learning for children today, Hillary Clinton has worked throughout her adult life \x96 in and out of public office \x96 to improve the lives of children. Her work on behalf of orphans and foster care children is not an exception, but an important example.\n\n\n\nOrphans and foster care children are not exactly a high-powered political group in Washington.\n\nAs First Lady, Hillary made adoption and foster care one of her priorities. She worked across the partisan aisle, with two unlikely partners: former Republican Minority Whip Tom Delay of Texas and business leader Dave Thomas of Wendy\'s, a lifelong Republican.\n\n\n\nTogether, they held events at the White House to raise awareness, and built support for legislation that would encourage adoptions, provide more aid for foster families, and help foster children find permanent, safe, loving homes.\n\n\n\nThe first piece of legislation was the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, which provided support and services for adoptive families, and increased foster adoptions by 64 percent by 2002.\n\n\n\nIt\'s no wonder the Washington Post called the law "the most significant change in federal child-protection policy in almost two decades."\n\n\n\nThe second piece of legislation, the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999, was focused on children who "age out" of the foster care system when they turn 18.\n\n\n\nToo often, these children leave their foster home with only a green plastic bag of their belongings \x96 and too little hope.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this legislation was to make the transition easier for these kids and to give them, as President Clinton said, "the tools they need to make the most of their lives."\n\n\n\nAccess to healthcare, education, housing assistance, and counseling services are just some of the tools this law provided to give these kids the chance they deserve.\n\n\n\nHillary introduced legislation in the Senate to help interested adults learn more about adoption.\n\n\n\nShe was also a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption and partnered with Democrats and Republicans alike to remove barriers to adoption and support the adoption of children in foster care.\n\n\n\nAt the State Department, Secretary Clinton brought the issue to the world stage. She appointed the first ever special advisor on international children\'s issues and worked with other countries to improve foster care programs worldwide.\n\n\n\nAdoption and foster care are not likely to be an issue in any political campaign. They aren\'t hot button issues or ones that gather big headlines; but they\'re important to Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nThat is what her life has been about: building coalitions, working with partners, doing whatever it takes to make a real difference on issues that make a real difference in people\'s lives \x96beginning with the very youngest among us.\n\n\n\nThat\'s the Hillary Clinton I know.\n\n\nYes, Michelle Obama Didn\x92t Cover Her Hair In Saudi Arabia, But Neither Did Laura Bush Or Hillary Clinton<http://www.thegloss.com/2015/01/28/beauty/michelle-obama-saudi-arabia-hair-headscarf-laura-bush-hillary-clinton-photos/> (The Gloss)\n\nBy Samantha Escobar\n\n\n\nJanuary 28th, 2015\n\n\n\nThe Gloss\n\n\n\nWhile visiting Saudi Arabia to pay respects to the late King Abdullah, the Obamas found themselves at the center of a scandal. Well, actually, it was first lady Michelle Obama\x96who is not an elected official\x96drawing the world\x92s focused on as a result of her hair. Rather, the fact that her hair remained out and about while in Saudi Arabia, a country wherein women are expected to conceal their heads with scarves or other coverings.\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press explains:\n\n\n\nUnder the kingdom\x92s strict dress code for women, Saudi females are required to wear a headscarf and loose, black robes in public. Most women in Saudi Arabia cover their hair and face with a veil known as the niqab. But covering one\x92s head is not required for foreigners, and some Western women choose to forego the headscarf while in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\nNumerous Saudi officials shook hands with President Barack Obama, and while some also shook hands with the first lady, many simply nodded her way. After photos began surfacing that showed her not wearing a scarf in Saudi Arabia, Twitter exploded, with many Arabic users picking a hashtag that roughly translates to \x93#MichelleObamaImmodesty.\x94 The tweets ranged from rage to disappointment to cheering, but some simply pointed out the most important issue here: Michelle Obama is not the first American political figure to go scarf-free in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\nYuuuup. Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, Condoleeza Rice\x96they all skipped the headscarf. Oh, but it\x92s totally disrespectful and un-American and practically the same as murdering puppies when Michelle Obama does it, right?\n\n\n\nYeahhhh, remember that whole thing? But I guess if he now makes paintings at the same level as a third grader, all is forgiven.\n\n\n\nIf a woman wants to wear a hijab, niqab, burqa, abaya, or other covering, she should be able to. She should not be critiqued or told she\x92s \x93brainwashed\x94 by American self-declared saviors who believe they are know better than she does what she should wear. Nothing good comes from telling women\x96or anyone, for that matter\x96what to wear or what not to wear. However, that goes both ways; focusing on what Michelle Obama did or didn\x92t wear while visiting any country is only distracting from (yet simultaneously emphasizing) the stark contrast between how male and female bodies are treated all over the world, including in Saudi Arabia and the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRomney to Slam Hillary Clinton on Foreign Policy, Economy<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/romney-slam-hillary-clinton-foreign-policy-economy-n295391> (NBC News)\n\nBy Kelly O\x92Donnell and Carrie Dean\n\n\n\nJanuary 28, 2015\n\n\n\nNBC News\n\n\n\nPotential presidential candidate Mitt Romney will take explicit aim at possible rival Hillary Clinton on both economic and foreign policy issues in an address at Mississippi State University Wednesday night, according to excerpts from his prepared remarks.\n\n\n\nAnd he appears ready to outline his case for another likely run for the president, declaring that "strong American leadership is desperately needed for the world, and for America."\n\n\n\n"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cluelessly pressed a reset button for Russia, which smiled and then invaded Ukraine, a sovereign nation," he will say, according to text provided to NBC News by aides. "The Middle East and much of North Africa is in chaos. China grows more assertive and builds a navy that will be larger than ours in five years. We shrink our nuclear capabilities as Russia upgrades theirs."\n\n\n\nRomney, who lost the general election to President Barack Obama in 2012, will also paint the Republican Party as better equipped than Clinton\'s Democrats to address issues of income inequality and poverty.\n\n\n\n"How can Secretary Clinton provide opportunity for all if she doesn\'t know where jobs come from in the first place?" he\'ll add.\n\n\n\nThe former Massachusetts governor, a onetime CEO with a highly-publicized net worth in the $250 million range, was painted by his Democratic foes in 2012 as out of touch with the problems of regular Americans.\n\n\n\nHis remarks at Mississippi State University appear squarely aimed at challenging that label - and at blunting the Obama administration\'s claims that the economic recovery has been successful.\n\n\n\n"Short term, our economy is looking up," he\'ll say. "But it is a lot better for the few, and pretty darn discouraging for the many. Incomes haven\'t gone up in decades."\n\n\nHillary Clinton vs. Elizabeth Warren Could Be a Dream Match, for Republicans<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/us/politics/hillary-clinton-vs-elizabeth-warren-could-be-a-dream-match-for-republicans.html> (NYT)\n\nBy Amy Chozick\n\n\n\nJanuary 28, 2015\n\n\nThe New York Times\n\n\n\nThey have called Senator Elizabeth Warren \x93an extremely attractive candidate\x94 in the 2016 presidential campaign. They have said that she is the \x93hottest commodity\x94 in the Democratic Party and that she has demonstrated the \x93passion and intensity\x94 that Hillary Rodham Clinton lacks.\n\n\n\nThose glowing compliments are not from the liberal activists who are trying to persuade Ms. Warren to challenge Mrs. Clinton, who is expected to be the party\x92s leading contender in 2016. They come from conservatives who are eager to drum up a contentious Democratic primary and who see Ms. Warren, a first-term senator from Massachusetts, as best positioned to weaken, and potentially defeat, Mrs. Clinton.\n\n\n\nOn cable television and in private strategy sessions, conservatives are steadily stoking the flames of a movement to recruit Ms. Warren, who has said she will not run but whose anti-Wall Street economic message resonates with the liberal base of the Democratic Party.\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton speaking in December in New York. As she prepares for a likely presidential campaign in 2016, the cottage industry that opposes her is evolving to attack her on new grounds.Clinton Opponents Hone New Barbs and Attacks as 2016 Campaign NearsJAN. 23, 2015\n\nAmong the Republicans who have been vying for a chance to, they assume, take on Hillary Rodham Clinton is Senator Rand Paul.G.O.P. Hopefuls Honing Attacks Against Hillary ClintonDEC. 13, 2014\n\n\x93Please give us Elizabeth Warren. Please, God, let us have Elizabeth Warren,\x94 said Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas who is considering a presidential bid.\n\n\n\n\x93I respect her because she has the courage to speak her convictions,\x94 Mr. Huckabee said on Fox News.\n\n\n\nFormer Representative Michele Bachmann, a Tea Party Republican from Minnesota, told CNN that Ms. Warren would be \x93an extremely attractive candidate.\x94 Mrs. Bachmann also said that if she were Mrs. Clinton, she would be \x93extremely concerned.\x94\n\nThe tactic says much about the 2016 landscape for Republicans. A crowded field of people who say they are considering running for president \x97 including Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts \x97 has emerged. That means the party is expecting a bruising ideological battle for the nomination.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state and 2008 presidential candidate, could emerge from the primary season relatively unscathed. Other Democrats \x97 including Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, former Gov. Martin O\x92Malley of Maryland and Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont \x97 may also run, but at this early stage none is expected to have the funding or political apparatus to pose a serious threat to Mrs. Clinton.\n\n\n\nAn easy path to the nomination would allow Mrs. Clinton to potentially enter a general election with more funding than the Republican nominee, who would have had to spend heavily to beat a wide field of competitors. Ms. Warren represents Republicans\x92 best hope for an expensive, prolonged battle for the Democratic nomination, weakening Mrs. Clinton along the way, political operatives on both sides say.\n\n\n\nThat desire appears to trump the fact that Ms. Warren\x92s views about taxation, regulation and the role of government are so at odds with Republican tenets. \x93There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own,\x94 she famously said in 2011.\n\n\n\nMs. Warren told Fortune magazine this month that she would not run to succeed President Obama, but that has not stopped speculation.\n\n\n\n\x93Elizabeth Warren says, \x91I\x92m not running, I don\x92t want to be president,\' \x94 the radio host Rush Limbaugh said recently. \x93Translation: \x91I can\x92t wait and I am running. But I\x92m just not going to admit it right now.\x92 \x94\n\n\n\nRepublicans said Ms. Warren would deliver a perfect \x93trifecta\x94 in diminishing Mrs. Clinton. She attracts young, liberal supporters who view Mrs. Clinton as too centrist. A Warren candidacy would take away a central theme expected of Mrs. Clinton\x92s campaign \x97 that it is time to elect a female president. And Ms. Warren\x92s presence in the primary season could push Mrs. Clinton to adopt liberal positions that might turn off independents in a general election.\n\nIt first became apparent that Ms. Warren could be an effective tool in moving Mrs. Clinton off message when the two appeared at a joint rally in October for Martha Coakley, the Democratic nominee for governor of Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nIn her speech, Mrs. Clinton tried to channel some of Ms. Warren\x92s populist zeal, but flubbed a variation of the senator\x92s controversial line about the roots of success. \x93Don\x92t let anybody tell you that, you know, it\x92s corporations and businesses that create jobs,\x94 Mrs. Clinton said.\n\n\n\nShe later said she had misspoken and was referring to certain tax policies that stifle job creation, but Republicans had already pounced, portraying the comment as evidence that Mrs. Clinton was pandering to liberal voters.\n\n\n\n\x93You could just see it gets in Secretary Clinton\x92s head when she has to compare herself vis-\xe0-vis Senator Warren,\x94 said Tim Miller, executive director of America Rising, a conservative \x93super PAC.\x94 He added, \x93From that perspective, a food fight could be good.\x94\n\n\n\nR. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., editor in chief of The American Spectator and a longtime critic of Mrs. Clinton and her husband, said her comment in Massachusetts could help inform younger voters about how she shifts opinions based on what is popular. \x93She pulled a line from Obama and Elizabeth Warren to try to make a very au courant crony-capitalist or socialist statement,\x94 Mr. Tyrrell said.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, a groundswell of support for Ms. Warren among liberal activists has aided Republicans\x92 behind-the-scenes efforts.\n\n\n\nIn December, the liberal group MoveOn.org said it would spend $1 million on a campaign to draft Ms. Warren into the 2016 race.\n\n\n\nLiberals cheered Ms. Warren this month after Antonio Weiss, a Wall Street banker whom Mr. Obama had picked as a Treasury Department official, eliciting vehement objections from Ms. Warren, asked Mr. Obama to rescind his nomination.\n\n\n\nMs. Warren is still largely unknown even in Iowa, where the draft-Warren movement has focused its efforts. In a poll of likely Democratic caucus goers conducted in early October by The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics, 44 percent said they had a favorable opinion of the Massachusetts senator, compared with 76 percent for Mrs. Clinton.\n\nWhile many Republicans are engaging in mischief as they promote Ms. Warren, some of her populist positions resonate across the political aisle. During debates over the Wall Street bailout, Ms. Warren and Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, often agreed on objections to parts of the Troubled Asset Relief Program and in their criticism of former Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner.\n\n\n\n\x93It was almost like the enemy of my enemy is my friend,\x94 Kurt Bardella, a former spokesman for Mr. Issa, said. The tendency for Republicans to align with Ms. Warren is particularly strong among those who emphasize libertarianism.\n\n\n\nBrian Darling, a senior aide to Mr. Paul, said he would like to see a 2016 general election between Ms. Warren and the Kentucky senator to hear the fresh ideas that the matchup might yield.\n\n\n\n\x93She hates Wall Street for a very different reason than libertarians,\x94 Mr. Darling said. \x93Yet they both would agree that the bailouts of Wall Street were a gaming of the system.\x94\n\n\n\nTucker Carlson, a libertarian political pundit, said Ms. Warren has an authenticity that resonates with both sides. \x93She has this spark of genuine ideological fervor, and I mean that as a compliment,\x94 he said. \x93It\x92s not just pure opportunism.\x94\n\n\n\nMs. Warren, of course, has given the anti-Clinton movement plenty of fodder. She frequently says that income inequality is due, in part, to the economic and trade policies of President Bill Clinton. In her 2003 book, \x93The Two-Income Trap,\x94 written with her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, Ms. Warren accused Mrs. Clinton of snapping at her staff and of shifting her position on bankruptcy legislation when she became a New York senator in order to appease her Wall Street donors.\n\n\n\n\x93As New York\x92s newest senator, however, it seems that Hillary Clinton could not afford such a principled position,\x94 Ms. Warren wrote. Republicans could not have said it better themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRomney home-building may clash with talk of income gap ; Costly projects began after last race ended (Boston Globe)\nJanuary 28, 2015\nThe Boston Globe\n\n\n\nLA JOLLA, Calif. -- On a recent weekday, a half-dozen construction workers crowded onto a small plot of land in this pricey community, banging away on an 11,000-square-foot house with expansive oceanfront views that will soon replace one a fraction of the size.\n\n\n\nThere\x92s a large master suite, a room for all the beach gear -- and a car elevator. Outside, scrawled in graffiti on a wall separating the property from the beach, was a message touting Mitt Romney for president.\n\n\n\nTwo years ago, Mitt Romney didn\x92t think he would run for political office again. And in the aftermath of his bitter defeat in the presidential campaign, he embarked on something of a real estate spree. He simultaneously began building two multimillion-dollar homes, one here on the Pacific Ocean and another outside Salt Lake City. He also bought a third, a slopeside ski chalet in Park City, Utah.\n\n\n\nFor the first time in more than a decade, unencumbered by political considerations, the two-time presidential candidate and former private equity executive was free to spend his many millions without concern of how it might look. But now that he\x92s considering a third presidential bid, the monuments of his wealth could become a political inconvenience, particularly as one of his key themes has been America\x92s growing income divide.\n\n\n\nRomney is traveling on Wednesday to Mississippi State University, a campus in the country\x92s poorest state, where aides say he will outline his vision for a better America.\n\n\n\nRomney, whose last presidential bid was hampered by his image of excessive privilege and insensitivity, may recognize the trouble his real estate holdings could cause in another campaign.\n\n\n\nHe is taking steps to shed some of his property, including retaining a broker who is currently showing the La Jolla home to potential buyers, according to a Romney aide. The aide would not disclose the asking price or explain why the former Massachusetts governor and his wife, Ann, want to sell the home after more than four years of city permitting, hearings, and construction.\n\n\n\nIn all, Romney has four homes. All of them are at least twice as large as the average home in the United States. They contain spas and hot tubs, and garages to hold up to four cars. They\x92ve built kitchens and dining rooms large enough to accommodate their large, sprawling family (5 sons, 5 daughters-in-law, and 23 grandchildren and counting).\n\n\n\n\x93He wants to be close to his family,\x94 said Ron Kaufman, a longtime Romney confidant. \x93There\x92s nothing more important to him than his kids and grandkids. . . . And if you could afford a house, and you\x92re as close as the Romneys are to their kids, that\x92s what you do.\x94\n\n\n\nRomney\x92s plans to tear down and rebuilt his home in La Jolla were already underway during his last campaign. But since he lost the 2012 election, Romney has also purchased a six-bedroom home that was listed for $8.9 million in Park City, Utah, and he\x92s built another 5,900-square-foot home 30 miles away near Salt Lake City.\n\n\n\nHe still has his New Hampshire vacation home on Lake Winnipesaukee, but last year sold his condominium in Belmont for $1.2 million, cutting his remaining ties to Massachusetts and raising questions about whether his 2016 campaign would again be headquartered in Boston.\n\n\n\n\x93During the campaign neither Ann nor I had any time to think about home projects,\x94 Romney said in an interview a year after the 2012 election. \x93But now that the campaign is over, we have a little more time.\x94\n\n\n\nThe new home in California includes an infamous \x93car elevator,\x94 first reported in 2012 by Politico and used by Romney\x92s opponents to cast him as out of touch. A May 2013 planning document described it this way: \x93The proposed garage will have the appearance of a two- car garage, but will include a lift inside that will rotate two cars below grade to the basement area.\x94\n\n\n\nBuilding the home was the culmination of a long battle, which at times became heated with neighbors who said Romney\x92s new home -- much larger than his former one -- was out of character with the neighborhood. Some neighbors also complained that he was incorporating square footage from a beach long believed to be public in order to build a larger home. Romney\x92s home is on a street where houses are clumped together on small lots, with cherished views of the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n\n\x93It was contentious,\x94 said Anthony A. Ciani, a local architect and the chief opponent of Romney\x92s expansion. \x93The issue was the bulk of it compared to the houses right next to it. It\x92s not compatible with the gingerbread houses that are immediately adjacent. It\x92s two, three times bigger than those.\x94\n\n\n\nA group of neighbors appealed to the state, but local and state officials ruled in the Romneys\x92 favor, a process followed by the Los Angeles Times. Their former 3,000-square-foot home has been demolished -- except for a swimming pool and spa -- and a new one is under construction.\n\n\n\nPlanning documents call for a first floor that includes a library, and a large combined living room and dining room. The basement includes an exercise room, recreation room, and a room to hold the beach gear. Outside there will be a wraparound porch, as well as several palm trees, and a mixture of shrubs -- boxwoods, coffeeberry, and California blue sage -- to cover the property.\n\n\n\nThe work is expected to be completed by the end of the year, although it is unclear whether the Romneys will move in or find a buyer.\n\n\n\n\x93Mitt and Ann\x92s plans are firm,\x94 Matthew Peterson, the Romneys\x92 San Diego-based attorney, said in an e-mail. \x93They will be completing the construction of the home by the end of the year, but no decision has been made at this time whether to keep it, or sell it.\x94\n\n\n\nHe said that the home has been shown to potential buyers already, but \x93it is the Romneys\x92 expectation that if the home were to be sold, it would best be sold after it is completed.\x94\n\n\n\nRomney\x92s wealth defined him in 2012, with a mixture of inadvertent comments, a reluctance to talk about his successful business career, and a video showing him disparaging 47 percent of Americans who rely on government assistance.\n\n\n\nIn a Washington Post-ABC News poll taken shortly before the 2012 election, 53 percent of likely voters said that Romney\x92s policies would favor the wealthy, with only 34 percent saying he would favor the middle class. Romney often seemed more comfortable talking with donors than he did in diners.\n\n\n\nBut those close to Romney have long described him as far more frugal than the caricature of him suggests. He frequently flies in coach, carrying his own bags. He repairs winter gloves with duct tape, refuses to spend money on apps for his iPad, and has a go-to meal that consists of a home-made peanut butter and honey sandwich.\n\n\n\nRomney is donating his $50,000 honorarium from Wednesday\x92s speech to charity, a contrast with Hillary Rodham Clinton, who collects fees that are five times higher. Clinton, too, has struggled in talking about her wealth, saying she was once \x93dead broke\x94 while in her $5 million home.\n\n\n\n\x93It\x92s going to be hard for Hillary Clinton to make Mitt Romney\x92s wealth a fruitful line of attack, with her multimillion dollar mansions in Georgetown and Chappaqua and her jet-setting lifestyle of the rich and famous,\x94 said a Romney aide, who declined to be identified.\n\n\n\nBut even if he is modest in some of his personal spending decisions, one area Romneydoes splurge on is real estate. His properties are all close to where his five sons are living. Every summer, they all gather at the home in Wolfeboro, N.H., and they spent last Christmas at the home in Deer Valley, where the massive stone fireplace was large enough to hold stockings for nearly two dozen grandchildren.\n\n\n\nIn August 2013, a holding company managed by Ann Romney purchased the home in Park City that had been listed at $8.9 million. The 8,730 square-foot home -- which has six bedrooms, eight bathrooms, an outdoor hot tub and a sauna -- was once featured in Architectural Digest, showcasing blond wood, two-story windows, and a chandelier made from antlers.\n\n\n\nA Romney aide said that he co-owned the home with L.E. Simmons, a prominent Romney donor who runs a Houston-based private equity firm.\n\n\n\nThe Romneys also bought property in Holladay, Utah, where they tore down a smaller home and built a 5,900-square-foot house that features a fountain, terraces, a gazebo, a fire pit, and a spa, according to plans reviewed by the Salt Lake Tribune.\n\n\n\nThe plans also called for a hidden room, an 11-foot-long area masked by a bookshelf that swings open. But Romney told the Globe that it was much less mysterious than initial news reports suggested.\n\n\n\n\x93It\x92s a closet where we plan on keeping the copying machine, and the printer, and paper,\x94 he said, laughing. \x93Not even a lock on the door. It\x92s hardly a secret room.\x94\n\n\n\n\nA burst of Democratic ideas (LAT)\nBy Doyle McManus\nJanuary 28, 2015\nLos Angeles Times\n\n\n\nOnly a few months ago, it looked as if Republicans had recaptured their old claim to be the party of ideas, especially on the economic issue that has seized the attention of most Americans: the stagnation of middle-class incomes.\n\n\n\nThe GOP\x92s former vice presidential nominee, Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), unveiled proposals to help the struggling middle class. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), another conservative hero, inveighed against income inequality. Even Mitt Romney, the once and perhaps future presidential candidate, has started saying it is time to get serious about poverty.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats seemed like an extinct volcano. Many of them campaigned for November\x92s midterm election without any clear economic message at all. It didn\x92t turn out well.\n\n\n\nIn politics, nothing concentrates the mind like electoral defeat -- unless it\x92s the low roar of an oncoming presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nAnd so, in the last few weeks, the Democratic volcano has erupted with ideas. President Obama listed dozens in his State of the Union speech, beginning with a tax increase on the top 1% to pay for child-care and education benefits for the middle class. House Democrats went further, proposing a tax on financial transactions that would allow for broader tax cuts for workers. And a think-tank task force co-chaired by former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers proposed tax breaks for middle-income folks as well as tax incentives to push companies toward sharing profits with their workers.\n\n\n\n\x93Stagnation in wages and income is a choice, not a necessity,\x94 Summers said. \x93A different choice is possible.\x94\n\n\n\nYou probably haven\x92t seen much about, much less read, his report; It\x92s 160 pages long and stuffed with serious economic analysis of why most Americans\x92 incomes haven\x92t grown much in real terms since -- ouch -- 1973.\n\n\n\nBut its prescriptions are serious, and they are probably close to what Hillary Rodham Clinton\x92s economic platform will be, when we get to see it. The report was sponsored by the liberal Center for American Progress, whose founder, John Podesta, is expected to become chairman of Clinton\x92s presidential campaign. The think tank\x92s president, Neera Tanden, was Clinton\x92s chief policy advisor in 2008.\n\n\n\nAnd the report isn\x92t coy about its political purpose; it sets out to update the centrist Democratic policies Bill Clinton ran on in the 1990s. \x93The world has changed,\x94 Summers said.\n\n\n\nThe core argument is that economic growth alone isn\x92t enough to ensure sustained prosperity any more. Unless profits are broadly shared, the argument goes, the economy won\x92t generate enough domestic spending to keep growth going -- or alleviate the widening gap between rich and poor.\n\n\n\nMost of the solutions would be on almost any Democrat\x92s wish list: more spending on education and training, more spending on roads and bridges and airports, paid parental leave for both fathers and mothers, and paid sick and vacation days for all.\n\n\n\nAnd there\x92s that corporate reform: legislation to push employers to share more of their growing profits with their employees, and to shift financial incentives for executives from short-term stock price increases to long-term growth.\n\n\n\nThe report calls for strengthening the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law, including tougher punishment for financial crimes beginning with mandatory \x93clawbacks\x94 of bonuses paid to executives who are found responsible for malfeasance.\n\n\n\nThat sounds like a bow to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and others on the Democratic left who have long complained that Wall Street got away with too much in the Great Recession. But the Summers report doesn\x92t call for breaking up or shrinking big banks, as Warren has proposed, so it\x92s unlikely to satisfy every progressive.\n\n\n\nIt won\x92t make every centrist Democrat happy, either. The Progressive Policy Institute, a think tank spawned by Bill Clinton\x92s New Democrat movement, began work this week on a list of policies focused on promoting private sector growth. \x93We need to expand our growth agenda to attract voters who may not agree with us,\x94 the group\x92s president, Will Marshall, told me.\n\n\n\nAnd what does Hillary think? She\x92s not saying. As the prohibitive front-runner in a race she hasn\x92t formally joined, she can let the arguments percolate.\n\n\n\nShe\x92s given clues, of course -- but in all directions. She said she loved \x93watching Elizabeth [Warren] give it to those who deserve to get it.\x94 In Canada last week, she struck a less populist note, saying the pressing problem is \x93small- and medium-sized business formation.\x94\n\n\n\nAnd she has offered terse tidbits of policy via Twitter, warning Congress that \x93attacking financial reform is risky and wrong\x94 and praising Obama\x92s State of the Union address -- but adding: \x93Now we need to step up & deliver for the middle class.\x94\n\n\n\nBut for Democrats who worried that their party\x92s idea shortage might be chronic and disabling, the eruption of economic prescriptions must come as a relief. There\x92s a debate underway, and the front-runner even has a draft platform in hand. The Democrats won\x92t have to wage another campaign without an economic message after all.\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats see new chance to attack Kochs after $1 billion spending announcement (WAPO)\nBy Anne Gearan and Sean Sullivan\nJanuary 28, 2015\nWashington Post\n\n\n\nForget Jeb, Rand and Ted. For Democrats, it\x92s all about Charles and David.\n\n\n\nThe announcement this week that the vast political network backed by the wealthy industrialist Koch brothers aims to spend nearly $1 billion on the 2016 elections has reignited Democratic hopes of casting the brothers as electoral villains and linking them closely to Republican candidates.\n\n\n\nIt\x92s a campaign strategy that yielded little success for the party in 2014, a banner year for the GOP. But Democratic officials and operatives say they are hopeful that their anti-Koch message will have more potency in a presidential election year.\n\n\n\nGroups supporting potential Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, as well as the House and Senate Democratic campaign arms, plan to single out the Kochs in their advertising and fundraising efforts.\n\n\n\n\x93I think the Koch brothers dumping a billion dollars on the elections is definitely something the American people are interested in learning about,\x94 said Rep. Ben Ray Luj\xe1n (N.M.), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\n\n\nHe said the DCCC plans to mention the brothers in online fundraising efforts. The DCCC raised $70 million in the last election cycle.\n\n\n\nDavid Brock, founder of the pro-Clinton American Bridge political action committee, said his group will be retooling a 2014 war-room operation called \x93Real Koch Facts,\x94 which he acknowledged did not achieve big results. The project aims to educate potential voters about what Democrats say is the Kochs\x92 largely hidden agenda and to attempt to shame recipients of Koch money.\n\n\n\nSaid Peter Kauffmann, a spokesman for the pro-Clinton Priorities USA Action super PAC: \x93Will Priorities USA Action talk about the Koch brothers\x92 attempt at a hostile takeover of the government of the United States? Stay tuned.\x94\n\n\n\nBut former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who ran for president in 2012, compared Democratic attacks against the Kochs to failed GOP efforts to tar Democrats for receiving support from organized labor.\n\n\n\n\x93The fact is we never got anywhere trying to explain to the country all of the extra advantage they got, for example, from labor unions,\x94 Gingrich said. \x93It\x92s too indirect an argument.\x94\n\n\n\nThe Koch-backed network\x92s plan to spend $889 million on the 2016 elections was announced Monday at a Rancho Mirage, Calif., event hosted by Freedom Partners, a tax-exempt organization that serves as the nerve center of the political operation supported by the brothers and several hundred other conservative donors. Not all of the money will be put toward shaping elections; it will cover advertising and policy work as well as education and academic research, among other things. Much of the spending will be cloaked in secrecy.\n\n\n\nJames Davis, a Freedom Partners spokesman, said in an e-mail: \x93Democrats\x92 past attempts to divide America by demonizing job creators didn\x92t work too well. We remain focused on advancing free-market principles.\x94\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Democrats made a concerted effort to make the Kochs into bogeymen. Then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) routinely used Senate floor speeches to castigate them. Democratic groups ran TV and radio ads tying the Kochs to GOP candidates and presenting them as polluters and job outsourcers who were out of touch with the middle class.\n\n\n\n\x93The oil billionaire Koch brothers are showering millions on Thom Tillis like he\x92s one of the family,\x94 said an ad from the Democratic-aligned Patriot Majority USA.\n\n\n\nBut Tillis is now a U.S. senator from North Carolina, part of a wave of Republican wins that cost the Democrats their majority.\n\n\n\n\x93It clearly didn\x92t work in 2014,\x94 said Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the center-left Brookings Institution. \x93That election was a disaster for Democrats. It seems to me they need to recalibrate the message.\x94\n\n\n\nHe said Democrats would need to tie their anti-Koch rhetoric to \x93substantive issues in a way that resonates with voters.\x94\n\n\n\nMost voters don\x92t know who the Kochs are. Sixty-four percent of voters said they had no opinion or a neutral impression of them, according to an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll conducted about a month before the November midterms. But among those who did, attitudes were overwhelmingly negative.\n\n\n\n\x93The Koch brothers are not going to be a household name overnight, but our goal of making them a political liability for the people they are funding will continue,\x94 Brock said.\n\n\n\nThe newly announced spending goal is unlikely to affect Clinton\x92s plans to begin her formal campaign in early April, strategists said. The goal is for her to raise an impressive total for the fundraising quarter that begins April 1.\n\n\n\nBut the early flurry of activity could apply pressure on mega-donors such as billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, a former Republican and staunch gun-control advocate who has donated mostly to Democratic candidates. The two were among the biggest givers in 2014.\n\n\n\nAdviser Chris Lehane said Steyer will be looking at \x93where he can have the biggest impact\x94 in 2016.\n\n\n\nLike many Democrats, Lehane subscribes to the view that an anti-Kochs attack strategy could work better in 2016 than it did in 2014. \x93There will be a better voter pool, the Senate states will be more blue states than red states, and the media interest will be even bigger,\x94 he said.\n\n\n\nCampaign finance reform advocates also say the Koch-backed spending plan is a fresh opportunity to push for revamping laws that allow well-funded independent groups to dominate elections, often without revealing their donors.\n\n\n\n\x93There is just no matching this amount of wealth directed in this way,\x94 said Rep. David E. Price (D-N.C.), who introduced a bill this week that would create a matching system for small donations and seek to limit the influence of super PACs. \x93Of course, nobody should have to match it. We should have a system that keeps spending within reasonable limits.\x94\n\n\n\nBut Price acknowledged that it would be difficult to pass such reforms in a Republican-controlled Congress. In the meantime, he said, raising the Kochs as an electoral issue isn\x92t a bad idea.\n\n\n\n\x93I think in some cases it does work to dramatize the issue and make it more real,\x94 Price said.\n\n\n\n\nFight the Temptation to Pay Attention to Polls (NYT)\nBy Brendan Nyhan\nJanuary 28, 2015\nNew York Times\n\n\n\nPublic service announcement: For now, you should ignore surveys testing potential Democrat/Republican matchups for the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\n\nI\x92m referring to polls like The Washington Post-ABC News survey released last week, which made headlines with the finding that Hillary Clinton enjoys a big lead against Republicans like Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney. Other media organizations have also been releasing head-to-head polls like this, and more are sure to follow in the coming months.\n\n\n\nI realize it\x92s tempting to believe that these head-to-head polls have at least a little bit of meaningful information in them. Poll numbers are irresistible to political obsessives like me, but it\x92s just too early for them to be useful in forecasting the general election.\n\n\n\nTake the case of Mrs. Clinton\x92s husband, Bill. In October 1991, Mr. Clinton, then the little-known Arkansas governor, pulled in only 20 percent of the vote in a prospective head-to-head matchup against President George H.W. Bush. His standing in the polls against Mr. Bush averaged only 34 percent as late as January 1992. But in the months that followed, Mr. Clinton gained stature while winning the Democratic nomination, and Mr. Bush\x92s numbers plunged as his Gulf War-induced surge in approval dissipated. The campaign eventually brought the electoral fundamentals into focus: an electorate ready for change after 12 years of Republican control of the White House, a relatively weak economy, and an unpopular president. Mr. Clinton went on to beat President Bush by more than five points, winning 53.5 percent of the major-party vote in a three-way contest that also featured the eccentric billionaire H. Ross Perot.\n\n\n\nThe polls are likely to be even less accurate further from Election Day. In polls conducted in January 2003, for example, President George W. Bush led Democratic Senator John Kerry by 8 and 17 percentage points, but Mr. Bush\x92s final margin of 2.5 percent of the popular vote was the narrowest of a re-elected president since Woodrow Wilson in 1916.\n\n\n\nThe political scientists Robert S. Erikson and Christopher Wlezien have shown that this pattern of early inaccuracy is consistent across the post-World War II era. Trial heat polls measuring support for potential general election candidates even 300 days from an election have virtually no predictive power in forecasting the final vote. (We are currently more than 650 days away.) It\x92s not until near the end of primary season \x97 mid-April of 2016, or approximately 200 days from Election Day \x97 that polls start to be useful predictors, they find.\n\n\n\nWhy are polls so inaccurate for so long? The reality is that ordinary people pay very little attention to politics most of the time. Their responses to early survey questions are unconsidered and reflect factors like name recognition. Over time, however, the campaign eventually brings the state of the country into focus, drawing people\x92s voting intentions into line with their partisanship and their perceptions of the state of the economy. As a result, the polls tend to converge toward the result predicted by forecasting models based on the fundamentals.\n\n\n\nA key post-primary turning point, Mr. Erikson and Mr. Wlezien show, are the nominating conventions, which effectively deliver party messages to voters, helping influence independents and reel back in wayward partisans. By that point, the polls are almost as predictive as they will be at the end of the campaign. (The debates, by contrast, provide conflicting flows of information that rarely move the polls appreciably despite all the media coverage they attract.)\n\n\n\nFor all of these reasons, Mrs. Clinton\x92s giant lead wouldn\x92t hold up in an actual election contest. Her public standing has been artificially inflated by her tenure as secretary of state, which largely removed her from the partisan fray. A campaign would remind many Americans why they used to have unfavorable views of her. The winner of the Republican nomination will gain in stature and consolidate the support of the party in the first part of next year \x97 the reason that the performance of G.O.P. candidates against Mrs. Clinton right now is not especially instructive in analyzing their prospective appeal. (At this point in January 2011, for instance, a McClatchy/Marist poll found President Obama leading Mitt Romney, 51 percent to 38 percent, but Mr. Romney ultimately attracted 47 percent of the vote and narrowly lost the race.)\n\n\n\nMoreover, despite Mr. Obama\x92s recent uptick in approval, approximately half of all Americans disapprove of his performance in office. While the growing economy is likely to continue to improve his standing and strengthen the prospects for a Democratic successor, any competent Republican would be expected to outperform the 39-41 percent mustered by G.O.P. candidates in The Post\x92s polls.\n\n\n\nUltimately, all we can do is wait. We know head-to-head polls won\x92t be useful for more than a year. Until then, your time is better spent following the direction of the economy \x97 the most important predictor of presidential election outcomes \x97 and the battle among G.O.P. candidates, who are already contesting the invisible primary that will help determine which candidate Mrs. Clinton or some other Democrat will face in November.\n\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\x92s diversity problem ; It\x92s a lot like Obama\x92s diversity problem (WAPO)\nBy Nia-Malika Henderson\nJanuary 27, 2015\nWashington Post\n\n\n\nWhen I first read the list of top campaign staffers with whom Hillary Rodham Clinton will surround herself in her presumed 2016 campaign for the White House, I had two thoughts.\n\n\n\nOne, that\x92s a lot of white men. (Over at the Daily Beast, Tim Mak had the same reaction, wondering if Clinton needs \x93binders full of women.\x94)\n\n\n\nBut my second thought was this: Of course it\x92s that way.\n\n\n\nOf the six people named in Anne Gearan and Philip Rucker\x92s story, every single one is a white man. Now, in fairness, it\x92s still early, and Karen Finney, Dennis Cheng, Jennifer Palmieri and the DNC\x92s Mo Elleithee have been floated as options for top jobs. And Clinton\x92s standing cast of advisers is also fairly diverse, with Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills among her closest counselors and aides. Clinton picked Patti Solis Doyle as campaign manager in 2008.\n\n\n\nBut in filling out the top slots, Clinton has drawn from Obama\x92s campaign circle, and that group of people is largely white and male. The frustration among black staffers and strategists has been that rather than creating and growing a new class of black politicos, Obama has surrounded himself with a cast of mostly white men. Obama and Clinton have relied on what academics call \x93path dependence,\x94 a theory that could explain everything from why the majority of labor secretaries over the last 25 years have been women to why women who appear on television have a similar look.\n\n\n\nThe person who has the job gets the same job again and looks like the person who had the job before. (Robert Gibbs. Jay Carney. Josh Earnest.) But in political campaigns, which are dynamic -- especially in the age of Twitter -- this kind of stasis can be a drawback.\n\n\n\nTypically, surface diversity has been an easy thing to achieve. It\x92s akin to the one-drop rule. If you have one black/Hispanic/Asian/woman in a group of white men, then, presto, you\x92ve achieved diversity. Obama\x92s race came with expectations of more diversity, but it also shielded him from public complaints. He was sometimes the one drop, and that was often enough.\n\n\n\nClinton, who will bank big on women and minorities, will have to do much more than simply follow Obama\x92s path. She will have to create something new and different that matches the times and her profile, rather than absorb Obama\x92s inner circle into her own.\n\n\n\n\x93I love Barbra Streisand,\x94 said Donna Brazile, in an interview with The New York Times Magazine, \x93but Beyonc\xe9 is what\x92s happening now. I love Peter, Paul and Mary, but she needs to be Justin Timberlake. She can\x92t afford to kick people out, but she can afford to let new people come in. I realize that\x92s uncomfortable.\x94\n\n\nHillary Clinton and Her Detractors: Reporter\x92s Notebook (NYT)\nBy Amy Chozick\nJanuary 27, 2015\nNew York Times\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton\x92s presumed 2016 presidential campaign is already drawing a lot of criticism. That may not be a surprise. But Amy Chozick, a political reporter, is finding that the attacks against Mrs. Clinton have a new angle. She describes the challenge of reporting fairly on this subtle shift and what it may mean.\n\n\n\nThe cottage industry of attacking Hillary Rodham Clinton is not new, but I noticed over the past several months that the attacks that landed in my inbox struck a very different tone than those that Republicans used when she was first lady and later when she ran for president in 2008.\n\n\n\nRemember when she was portrayed as the embodiment of bra-burning feminism? Then, in 2008, there were a lot of attacks that seemed based on gender, like an anti-Hillary website that called her a witch.\n\n\n\nBut ahead of the 2016 presidential campaign, the groups trying to stop Mrs. Clinton instead focus on her paid speeches, her response to the attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, and her comments last summer that her family was \x93dead broke\x94 when leaving the White House. Instead of being the 1960s radical, she is portrayed as an elitist who is overly centrist.\n\n\n\nThe tricky thing in reporting this type of story is that you don\x92t want to dismiss legitimate questions about her record as partisan \x93hating.\x94 Every political candidate faces attacks and should be thoroughly vetted if they\x92re running for president. George W. Bush and other Republicans have certainly faced intense partisan attacks from the left.\n\n\n\nBut for some reason, Mrs. Clinton has always sparked a different level of ire. Mrs. Clinton\x92s supporters largely believe the level of ire she sparks has to do with her being the first woman with a real chance to become president. Others point to how polarizing she is; polls show the country is almost equally divided in opinions about her.\n\n\n\nWhatever the reason, I can\x92t think of another candidate who has prompted an entire industry of kitschy items \x97 like a \x93Hillary nutcracker,\x94 \x93No way in Hellary\x94 aprons, and \x93Even Bill Doesn\x92t Want Hillary\x94 bumper stickers.\n\n\n\nAll this is a good way to rally Republicans, but it remains to be seen how much impact it would have on Mrs. Clinton\x92s presumptive campaign.\n\n\nCan Hillary Clinton Get Along With the Press? (Bloomberg)\n\nBy Joshua Green\n\nJanuary 27, 2015\n\nBloomberg\n\n\n\nLast week, I was speaking with a veteran Republican strategist for a likely presidential candidate about what factors would shape the 2016 race that weren\x92t already being obsessed over by the press. He replied, with grim satisfaction, that Hillary Clinton would have to endure more hostile press coverage than Barack Obama did and that this would redound to the GOP\x92s benefit. For this strategist, as for many Republicans, it has long been an article of deep, almost cult-like faith that Obama\x92s electoral success owed in no small part to the media\x92s fawning coverage of his campaigns\x97and that this supposed bias will not be extended to Clinton.\n\n\n\nEvidently, Clinton agrees. In a blockbuster piece in Monday\x92s Politico, Mike Allen reports that a major component of Clinton\x92s soon-to-emerge presidential campaign is a new approach to dealing with the press, which \x93Hillaryland,\x94 radiating the conviction of its principal, has generally abhorred and treated with hostile disdain. It seems those feelings haven\x92t changed. \x93Advisers know that Clinton doesn\x92t like or trust the press,\x94 Allen reports. But he quotes one of them conceding that open hostility toward the press hasn\x92t been a successful strategy and that Clinton is ready to try something different. \x93You do see what works, and address what works the next time around,\x94 the adviser tells Allen. \x93The default isn\x92t toward the pit-bull mentality.\x94 The campaign is apparently even searching for someone who could play the role of \x93good cop.\x94\n\n\n\nIf anything, Allen undersells his scoop. Clinton\x92s relationship with the press isn\x92t some minor campaign detail along the lines of who\x92ll run Iowa or who\x92ll shoot her ads. It\x92s what\x92s shaped her as a politician. As Allen\x92s colleagues Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman detailed last summer, Clinton\x92s relationship with the press has been caustic throughout her career.\n\n\n\nOver the 25 years Hillary Clinton has spent in the national spotlight, she\x92s been smeared and stereotyped, the subject of dozens of over-hyped or downright fictional stories and books alleging, among other things, that she is a lesbian, a Black Widow killer who offed Vincent Foster then led an unprecedented coverup, a pathological liar, a real estate swindler, a Commie, a harridan. Every aspect of her personal life has been ransacked; there\x92s no part of her 5-foot-7-inch body that hasn\x92t come under microscopic scrutiny, from her ankles to her neckline to her myopic blue eyes\x97not to mention the ever-changing parade of hairstyles that friends say reflects creative restlessness and enemies read as a symbol of somebody who doesn\x92t stand for anything.\n\n\n\nThis has instilled a resentment that her closest allies consider unshakeable. \x93Look, she hates you. Period,\x94 a Clinton adviser tells Thrush and Haberman. \x93That\x92s never going to change.\x94 Of course, these bad feelings toward the press are not entirely unjustified. In addition to the deranged and misogynistic attacks Thrush and Haberman lay out, Clinton has also been raked through the coals over more serious matters, such as Whitewater, that never merited such treatment and inflicted real damage. What both Clintons learned, and what eventually got her into trouble, was that attacking the press allowed them to survive scandals both real (Monica Lewinsky) and imagined (Whitewater).\n\n\n\nThis bred a kind of paranoid hubris that was the hallmark of Clinton\x92s 2008 presidential campaign. My own experience in the Clinton crosshairs stands as a good example of why her \x93old\x94 approach to the press often backfired.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, I was writing a story for GQ on the inner workings of the Clinton campaign. The Clinton campaign was unhappy about this. At the time, Clinton was presumed (by herself and nearly everyone else) to be the inevitable Democratic nominee and likely future president. This gave her a great deal of power and the illusion that she could control how the press covered her. So a Clinton aide threatened to withdraw Bill Clinton\x92s cooperation to be the magazine\x92s \x93Man of the Year\x94 cover model if GQ didn\x92t kill my piece. GQ killed my piece. (Full story here, via Ben Smith.)\n\n\n\nThe problem with this strategy, as anyone outside the Clinton bubble would easily recognize, is that it created more problems for her than it solved. Information wants to be free\x97especially juicy tales of Clinton campaign turmoil. When the story inevitably leaked, it drew far more attention than it otherwise would have, deepening the impressions of Clinton as imperious and entitled and her campaign staff as goonish extras from House of Cards. The stories they\x92d tried to squelch simply wound up in a different magazine  (here, for anyone interested).\n\n\n\nCan Clinton really let bygones be bygones and try a new approach? It would make all the sense in the world, since the lack of competition in the Democratic primaries means she\x92ll have to contend with a bored and restless press corps. But it would also require her to willingly give up a measure of control at a time when she is even more powerful and inevitable-seeming than she was before. (For what it\x92s worth, I haven\x92t yet been invited to tea.)\n\n\n\nThat\x92s a pretty tall order. Allen doesn\x92t mention it, but a New York Times story last week raises some doubts. Amy Chozick and Michael Cieply report that Bill Clinton has broken off cooperation with a Martin Scorsese documentary for HBO that would have been released during his wife\x92s campaign. Clinton wanted to control the interview questions and the final cut of the film, according Chozick and Cieply, and Scorsese refused.\n\n\n\nThis doesn\x92t mean that Clinton\x92s desire to reset her relationship with the media isn\x92t sincere, or at least a sincere recognition of her self interest. Nor does it mean the effort is doomed. But it is a reminder that old habits die hard.\n\n\nObama Is Setting Up Hillary Clinton to Fail (National Journal)\n\nBy Joshua Kraushaar\n\nJanuary 27, 2015\n\nNational Journal\n\n\n\nPresident Obama delivered his penultimate State of the Union with renewed confidence, eager to take credit for the economy\x92s recent growth spurt. He offered few olive branches to Republicans for their landslide victory two months earlier; articulated a panoply of liberal proposals that stand little chance of passing through Congress; and took the rosiest possible view of the economy and international landscape\x97even in the face of contrary evidence. In the moment, it\x92s a savvy political play: Claim credit for an improving public mood and force Republicans on the defensive.\n\n\n\nBut despite the hoopla, recent polling shows that the public is much more in sync with the GOP\x92s agenda than the White House\x92s. This month\x92s NBC/WSJ survey illustrated a striking disconnect between the president\x92s improving approval rating (at 46 percent, up 2 points since November) and the top priorities of the American electorate. In the survey, 85 percent of voters rank \x93creating jobs\x94 as a top priority, followed by defeating and dismantling ISIS (74 percent), reducing the federal deficit (71 percent), securing the border with Mexico (58 percent), and addressing Iran\x92s nuclear program (56 percent). The last four are core GOP strengths; polls consistently show Republicans with an edge on those issues.\n\n\n\nThe items at the bottom of the priority list are all top administration priorities: closing the Guantanamo prison camp (24 percent rate as top priority), addressing the issue of climate change (34 percent), creating a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants (39 percent), and increasing the minimum wage (44 percent). It wasn\x92t just Obama\x92s assessment of the international stage that was disconnected from reality. It was also his assessment that the American people are with him on his agenda.\n\n\n\nThat disconnect will be driving the upcoming presidential election, which will provide a decisive verdict on the sustainability of Obama\x92s accomplishments. Obama, as he ad-libbed in the State of the Union, couldn\x92t help but brag that he won two elections as proof of his mandate. The GOP also won a historic number of seats in Congress, capitalizing on public anger over his policies. Rather than move to the middle and compromise with Republicans, Obama appears intent on playing to his party\x92s progressive base in the run-up to the 2016 elections \x96 and pass along that legacy to Hillary Clinton\x92s nascent campaign. It\x92s a gamble that will determine whether his landmark legislation will remain law, or be rolled back by a new Republican president.\n\n\n\nObama should recognize how much of his post-election bump is being driven by forces outside of his control. The president is eagerly taking credit for the improved economy, even though little has passed legislatively in recent years. It wasn\x92t long ago that he was blaming GOP intransigence for the slow growth. Now he\x92s betting his remaining political capital that the encouraging economic trends will continue into next year\x97hardly a guarantee, given the history of false starts in the past.\n\n\n\n\x93We\x92re going to have to see sustained growth in the number of middle-class jobs and an increase in median income before we really see attitudes about the economy turn around,\x94 said Republican pollster Whit Ayres, who is advising potential presidential candidate Marco Rubio. \x93Debates on how to get the economy going to get more well-paying middle-class jobs will remain one of the very top issues in the next presidential campaign. The depth of middle-class anxiety is so widespread.\x94\n\n\n\nObama\x92s own emphasis on \x93middle-class economics\x94 demonstrated that, despite his optimism, he recognizes that many Americans are still struggling to make ends meet. But his solutions were oddly disconnected from both the economic and the political realities he faces.\n\n\n\nConsider the lack of creativity from the administration in its signature initiative from the State of the Union: free community college tuition for everyone. For most low-income Americans, the tuition is already free or heavily subsidized. There\x92s not a groundswell of middle-class households whose goal is to receive an associate degree. The plan wasn\x92t accompanied by a more ambitious approach to, say, help community colleges teach certain skills that aren\x92t taught at traditional four-year colleges. (Rubio, for instance, has proposed expanding access to career and vocational education as part of his detailed educational blueprint.)\n\n\n\nIt\x92s merely a tuition giveaway, one that originally was partly paid for by the very middle- and upper-middle-class families that are saving money for the four-year colleges that Obama has called essential for a successful career. The plan proposed getting rid of the tax exemption on 529 college savings accounts, which have been growing in popularity, to help parents prepare for their childrens\x92 rising education expenses. That provision was so politically tone deaf that the White House withdrew it just one week after the president introduced it.\n\n\n\nThe proposal smacked of the very redistributive schemes that dogged Democrats throughout the 1980s.\n\n\n\nAnytime a politician promises to \x93lower the cost to zero,\x94 as Obama did in his address, it\x92s worth remembering the economic maxim \x93there\x92s no such thing as a free lunch.\x94 And it directly puts a squeeze on the very middle-class constituency that Obama claims to be courting. Hillary Clinton will certainly want to echo a message centered on educational opportunity, but she\x92s probably not eager to alienate a sizable group of voters who will be up for grabs in the next election.\n\n\n\nClinton has been publicly supportive of the president, but he\x92s boxed her into a corner. She can\x92t afford to publicly break with a president whose fortunes align closely with hers. Yet she\x92s undoubtedly aware that her odds of winning the Democratic nomination are very strong, and moving away from the center won\x92t help her in a general election.\n\n\n\n\nPalin receives plaudits from pro-Hillary Clinton group (AP)\nJanuary 27, 2015\nAssociated Press\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \x97 Sarah Palin is picking up an unexpected title: top fundraiser for a group promoting a potential Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign for president.\n\n\n\nDuring a speech in Iowa last weekend, the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee held up a Ready for Hillary car magnet as she talked about ways for Republicans in Iowa to stop a Clinton campaign. Ready for Hillary, the super PAC backing a possible Clinton campaign, used the moment as a fundraising tool and said they raised more than $25,000.\n\n\n\nAdam Parkhomenko, Ready for Hillary\x92s executive director, sent an email to supporters saying: \x93By raising $25,000, Sarah officially qualifies as a co-chair of our National Finance Council. (We will wait until Sarah calls before officially adding her name to the list.)\x94\n\n\n\nPalin appeared alongside several potential GOP presidential candidates at the weekend event organized by Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa. On the question of whether anyone can stop Clinton, she borrowed a phrase from the Obama campaign and said, \x93Yes we can.\x94\n\n\n\nA SarahPAC official did not immediately comment on the Ready for Hillary email.\n\n\n\n\nGowdy: Benghazi investigation \x91incomplete\x92 without Clinton testimony (WAPO)\nBy Colby Itkowitz\nJanuary 28, 2015\nWashington Post\n\n\n\nWhether she runs for president or not, Hillary Rodham Clinton is probably not done answering questions about Benghazi, Libya.\n\n\n\nThe House panel investigating the deadly attacks on the Benghazi mission in September 2012 met Tuesday in a fiery public hearing where Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), who is chairing the 12-member select committee, said he would \x93ratchet up\x94 the investigation and claimed the administration wasn\x92t cooperating.\n\n\n\nAfter the hearing, Gowdy told reporters he planned to call on Clinton to testify, saying a Benghazi investigation would be \x93incomplete\x94 without questioning the former secretary of state.\n\n\n\n\x93Every witness who has relevant information needs to be talked to,\x94 Gowdy said, according to ABC News.\n\n\n\nGowdy said he is waiting for pertinent documents from the State Department before calling Clinton to appear before the committee. Clinton has said she doesn\x92t think the committee\x92s investigation is necessary \x97 other independent panels have not found any wrongdoing by the Obama administration \x97 but has also said she would testify if asked.\n\n\n\nBut Democrats accused Gowdy of delaying the invitation to coincide closer with the 2016 election. At the hearing, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said the committee, which was created eight months ago, is at risk of becoming a \x93partisan fishing expedition, or it\x92ll be drawn out to affect the presidential election cycle.\x94\n\n\n\nAt Gowdy\x92s request, ranking member Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said he asked Clinton back in September if she would willingly testify, and she offered to come in December or January.\n\n\n\n\x93She said I\x92ll do it, period. The fact is she was very clear. She did not hesitate for one second,\x94 Cummings said. But Gowdy has yet to formally invite her to come testify, citing the need for additional documents.\n\n\n\nClinton appeared before Senate and House committees during back-to-back hearings on Benghazi as one of her final acts as secretary of state in January 2013. She defended the White House\x92s response and famously lost her patience at one point, asking a Republican \x93what difference does it make\x94 when pressed on the White House\x92s initial explanation of why the attack occurred.\n\n\n\nA year ago, Clinton said the attacks were her \x93biggest regret\x94 during her years at State.\n\n\nCongressman: Hillary Clinton agrees to testify to House\x92s Benghazi panel (CNN)\nBy Dan Merica\nJanuary 27, 2015\nCNN\n\nWashington (CNN) - Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has agreed to testify to the House\x92s select committee investigating Benghazi, the panel\x92s Democratic ranking member told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings said that Clinton agreed to testify before the committee investigating the 2012 terrorist attack in December after he contacted her months earlier.\n\n\x93The chairman asked me back in September to inquire as to whether Secretary Clinton would testify,\x94 Cummings said. \x93She immediately said she would and that she wanted to come in December, but if December did not work, she would come in January. She said I\x92ll do it, period. The fact is she was very clear. She did not hesitate for one second.\x94\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Libya was attacked on Sept. 11, 2012. Four Americans, including the U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, were killed. Initially, the attack was thought to be perpetrated by an angry mob responding to a video made in the U.S. which mocked Islam and the Prophet Mohammed, but was later determined to be a terrorist attack.\n\nNick Merrill, the former first lady\x92s spokesman, declined to go into detail about why Clinton agreed to testify and when she might do so.\n\n\x93I\x92m going to leave it to the committee to address their plans,\x94 said Merrill.\n\nCummings\x92 comments on Tuesday revealed the clearest indication to date that Clinton was willing to show up before the committee, though many details remain to be agreed upon and the appearance could well never happen.\n\nWhile touring the country selling her new memoir in June 2014, Clinton was asked whether she would be willing to testify before the House committee.\n\n\x93We\x92ll see,\x94 she told NBC in an interview. \x93I\x92m not going to prejudge it.\x94\n\nClinton added that she took a lot of notes during the attack, but declined to say whether she would hand over the notes.\n\n\x93Let\x92s see if it\x92s on the level or not. I don\x92t want to be part of anything that in any way politicizes or demeans the sacrifice that we saw happen there,\x94 Clinton said.\n\nThe attack has remained a political issue for Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time, since 2012. As the former first lady eyes a potential presidential bid, a number of Republicans have signaled that Benghazi will be a main line of attack against Clinton.\n\nSen. Rand Paul has said the attack should disqualify Clinton from higher office.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy, the chairman of the Benghazi committee, told reporters on Tuesday that he still intends to have Clinton testify as part of the investigation.\n\n\x93Every witness who has relevant information needs to be talked to,\x94 he said.\n\nAccording to The Hill, Gowdy is prepared to hear from Clinton 30 days after receiving \x93all the [State Department] documents\x94 on the attack.\n\nClinton testified for more than five hours before another House committee investigating Benghazi in January 2013, shortly before she left the State Department. At the time, Clinton acknowledged a \x93systemic breakdown\x94 but said that her department was taking additional steps to increase security at U.S. diplomatic facilities.\n\nSince then, Clinton has said her biggest regret a during the four years she served as America\x92s top diplomat was the Benghazi attack.\n\n\x93My biggest regret is what happened in Benghazi,\x94 Clinton said in January 2014. \x93It was a terrible tragedy losing four Americans, two diplomats and -- now it is public so I can say -- two CIA operatives.\x94\n\n\nClinton willing to testify before Benghazi panel, Democrat says (Hill)\nBy Martin Matishak\nJanuary 27, 2015\nThe Hill\n\nHillary Clinton is willing to testify before the House Select Committee that is investigating the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, according to the panel\x92s top Democrat.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) on Tuesday said he has spoken to Clinton about the possibility of testifying at the request of Rep. Trey Gowdy (S.C.), the panel\x92s Republican chairman, and she \x93did not hesitate for one second.\x94\n\n\x93She said ... I\x92ll do it, period,\x94 Cummings said after the committee\x92s third hearing.\n\nCummings said Clinton, who was secretary of State at the time of the Benghazi attacks, indicated to him last year that she \x93wanted to come in December\x94 to testify but could also come in January.\n\x93The fact is that she was very clear,\x94 Cummings said.\n\nThe possibility of an appearance from Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 if she makes a bid, has loomed as the biggest question for the Benghazi panel since its formation last summer.\n\nGowdy first floated the possibility of Clinton testifying late last year, creating the potential for a dramatic confrontation with the former secretary of State over a security failure that some Republicans argue should disqualify her from the presidency.\n\nClinton is \x93a witness that we would like to talk to. I cannot tell you when,\x94 Gowdy said in December.\n\nWith the race for the White House set to erupt soon, Democrats could be maneuvering to accelerate the work of the Benghazi panel so that it is not investigating Clinton while she is running for the presidency.\n\nGowdy, a former prosecutor, on Tuesday said he and Cummings had initially agreed last year that Clinton should be brought before the panel.\n\nBut after that discussion, Gowdy said, Cummings had an unexpected change of heart.\n\n\x93The deal I had with Mr. Cummings is we will bring her before the committee within 30 days of receiving all the [State Department] documents responsive to our request,\x94 Gowdy said.\n\nHe said the State Department must hand over the information the panel is seeking, including potentially some of Clinton\x92s emails, before Clinton testifies.\n\n\x93If I were to conclude this investigation having not talked to the secretary of State at the time it would be an incomplete investigation,\x94 Gowdy said. \x93But I can\x92t talk to her until I have the documents that would make that conversation productive. I\x92m not interested in having a conversation where old allegations are repeated or a shouting match.\x94\n\n\x93I want to ask specific questions rooted in documents,\x94 he added.\n\nGowdy said he would be \x93happy to take her in January, February, March, whenever\x94 but that it was up to the panel\x92s Democrats on \x93how quickly\x94 they get to her testimony.\n\n\x93I\x92m willing to work with them on the timing. I\x92m willing to do it sooner rather than later,\x94 Gowdy said. \x93What I\x92m not willing to do is do it in a vacuum where I don\x92t have access to the documents.\x94\n\nCummings disputed that he changed his mind about having Clinton appear.\n\n\x93That\x92s not true. I don\x92t know how he could say that because we\x92ve never been against it. He asked me to check with her. I did that she said she was willing to come so it was a non-issue,\x94 Cummings said.\n\n\x93If the committee wants her to come, she\x92s willing to come,\x94 the Democrat added.\n\nThe spat over Clinton\x92s testimony comes at time of rising partisan tensions on the select committee, with members clashing over how the panel is conducting its investigation.\n\nOn the eve of an open hearing Tuesday, Cummings released letters in which he accused Republicans of conducting witness interviews in secret and withholding information from the Democratic members of the panel.\n\n\x93I am saddened to report today that there are major, major problems with this committee and its work,\x94 Cummings said in his opening statement, adding that its work is moving at a \x93glacial pace.\x94\n\nGowdy fired back that the criticism was \x93interesting\x94 coming from Democrats, given that they fought the creation of the panel and have repeatedly threatened to boycott its work.\n\nBut Gowdy saved most of his ire for the State Department, taking it to task for failing to comply with requests for witness testimony and documents.\n\n\x93This is not a political exercise for us,\x94 Gowdy said. \x93We\x92re going to ratchet it up because I need access to the documents and the witnesses and we need to be able to conclude our work.\x94\n\nThe House created the select committee last May to investigate the 2012 Benghazi attacks. Republicans argue a new probe was needed to explore unanswered questions about the administration\x92s response to a terrorist assault that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.\n\nDemocrats have accused the GOP of launching a \x93witch hunt\x94 against Clinton, and on Tuesday portrayed the panel as a partisan exercise.\n\n\x93Now, more than ever, I\x92m convinced that my colleagues are in search of a mythical creature \x97 a unicorn, that is, a made-up conspiracy that does not exist,\x94 said Rep. Linda S\xe1nchez (D-Calif.).\n\nRep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) said the Republican majority on the committee made no document requests between May and December, adding that Gowdy\x92s comments about wrapping up their work \x93boggles the mind.\x94\n\nRepublicans dismissed the complaints as \x93ridiculous\x94 and said the five Democrats\x92 on the panel were hypocrites because they have not suggested any witnesses or requested any documents for the probe.\n\n\x93The happiness of the Democrats was never my objective in the first place,\x94 Gowdy said after the hearing.\n\n\x93They\x92re looking for a reason to leave.\x94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
