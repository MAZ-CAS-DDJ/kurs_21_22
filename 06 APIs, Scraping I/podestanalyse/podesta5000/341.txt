He'll\nbe done in Boulder around 7:30 pm, and the team there expects about a 45\nmin - 1 hr drive to your home.\n\nHowever, on the breakfast question, John will certainly chime in for\nhimself!\n\nAgain, thanks so very much for the accomodation.\n\nAll the best,\nEryn\n\nOn Mon, May 4, 2015 at 5:03 PM, Eryn Sepp <esepp@equitablegrowth.org> wrote:\n\n>\n>\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Phillip Caplan [mailto:pcaplan@renovacapitalpartners.com]\n> Sent: Monday, May 04, 2015 5:03 PM\n> To: John and Mary Podesta\n> Cc: Steven C.
