If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter.\nCGI also wasn't pushing for a meeting in Morocco and it wasn't their first choice.\nThis was HRC's idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting.\nIt will break a lot of china to back out now when we had so many opportunities to do it in the past few months.\nShe created this mess and she knows it.\n________________________________\nFrom: Robby Mook <robbymook2015@gmail.com>\nSent: Sunday, January 18, 2015 10:38:52 AM\nTo: Huma Abedin; John Podesta\nSubject: FYI CGI Africa\n\nCame up on our call with HRC.
