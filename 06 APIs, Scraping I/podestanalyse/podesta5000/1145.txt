john.podesta@gmail.comb'Friend -- \n\nAfter the fundraising deadline on June 30th, my team will have some difficult choices to make about the future of this campaign.\n\nWhat you do today will directly affect what we can say yes to in the next quarter.\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve set a goal of 50,000 grassroots donations before midnight on Tuesday. That\xe2\x80\x99s not something we pulled out of thin air -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what we think we need to build the best possible campaign we can over the next few months.\n\nI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll step up and make a contribution of $1 toward that goal right now:\n\n http://links.hillaryclinton.com/ctt?kn=16&ms=MjI5MzkxNTkS1&r=MTExODA4Mjg2NjExS0&b=2&j=NTgyODEyMjU0S0&mt=1&rt=0 \n\nThank you,\n\nKP\n\nKP Trueblood\nBudget Director\nHillary for America\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n*************** \n\nPAID FOR BY HILLARY FOR AMERICA\n\nContributions or gifts to Hillary for America are not tax deductible.\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.
