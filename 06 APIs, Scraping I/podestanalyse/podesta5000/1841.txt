john.podesta@gmail.comb'This is absolutely fucking brilliant.\n\nCheck out the following flickr set for some fist-bump fun with Obama at a\nBay Area fundraiser:\n\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/97177334@N00/sets/72157607764171158/\n\nThen read the email below. These folks are based in the Bay Area, but all\nyou need to replicate their "Obama Photo Booth" idea is Photoshop and some\nequipment.\n\nFunniest one, from the "awkward white guy" file:\n\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/97177334@N00/2916521376/in/set-72157607764171158/\n\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Edie Irons <edieirons@inthefire.com>\nDate: Mon, Oct 6, 2008 at 6:58 PM\nSubject: Any Obama fundraisers coming up?\nTo: Edie Irons <edieirons@inthefire.com>\n\n\nHey folks,\n\nI\'ve got an incredible offer.\n\nTwo friends of mine devised this Obama Photo Booth (\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/97177334@N00/sets/72157607764171158/) where people\ncan get their picture taken "fist-bumping" with Obama.\n\nThey have offered to bring their computer, camera, backdrop, high-quality\nphoto printer, and photoshop skillz to fundraisers between now and the\nelection to help raise money for Obama. This was a HUGE hit at a fundraiser\nI was just at, and they charged $10 per photo, which includes a glossy\nprintout and an electronic copy via email.\n\nSo, do you know of any Obama fundraisers coming up where they can set up\nshop? Ideally they need about a 8x8 space indoors where they can set up\ncomputer, printer, lights, backdrop, etc. I believe they have all the\nmaterials they need, so you wouldn\'t have to do much extra besides give them\nspace. Decisions about where they will go will be made based on their\nschedules, and if demand is high, then possibly on the expected size of the\nevent (i.e. they\'ll come out for larger events if they have to pick and\nchoose).\n\nLet me know!\n\nEdie\n510.334.1344\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
