I wonder why even the small number of\nRepublicans who are \xe2\x80\x9cless positive\xe2\x80\x9d ---\n\n\n\nI also find lumping minimum wage in with \xe2\x80\x9cdefending the right of worker to\nbargain\xe2\x80\x9d for better wages turns a minimum wage policy into something that\nsounds like a sop to unions.\n\n\n\nAnd breaking big banks was positioned as leading to another collapse and\nbailout???\n\n\n\nWhy include matching small donor contributions as a way to get corporate\nmoney out of the system\xe2\x80\xa6. Without telling them that match is with taxpayers\n$$$ -- seems you would get a different result doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\n\n\n\nSorry to be less enthusiastic about this issues battery but if you load up\nsome and not others, it simply is not a balanced test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*From:* Mandy Grunwald [mailto:gruncom@aol.com <gruncom@aol.com>]\n*Sent:* Tuesday, July 07, 2015 10:51 AM\n*To:* oshur@hillaryclinton.com; john.podesta@gmail.com;\nre47@hillaryclinton.com; jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com;\nkschake@hillaryclinton.com; Joel Benenson; jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com;\nJim Margolis; dcheng@hillaryclinton.com; John Anzalone\n*Subject:* Re: Dcorps deck\n\n\n\nAlso interesting that Medicare/Social Security and Infrastructure proposals\nwere at or near the top.
