john.podesta@gmail.comb"Dear Mr. Podesta,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is Lina Xing and I am Vice\nPresident of the Yale Political Union. The YPU is currently in the process\nof inviting guest speakers for the Fall Semester of 2015, and we are very\nexcited to invite you to headline one of our debates. In particular, we\nwould be excited for you to lead\nour Fall Organizational Debate on September 8th, 2015.\n\nThe Yale Political Union is the oldest undergraduate political society in\nthe country and the largest student organization at Yale. Every week, we\nhold a parliamentary debate where a guest helps bring an intellectual focus\nand a unique perspective to our debates on a topic related to his or her\nexperience and intellectual work. Throughout our history, we have hosted\nnumerous national and international thinkers and political figures on our\nfloor. In the past three years alone, we have debated with guests as\ndiverse as Governor Howard Dean, Senator Rick Santorum, and Gayatri\nSpivak. Given your myriad work in climate change policy, global\ndevelopment, and law and technology, among other fields, we believe you\nwould bring a particularly versatile perspective to a debate.\n\nThe attached formal invitation contains a more thorough introduction to our\norganization, and our interest in hosting you. But to give you a brief\nsummary of what the event will entail, here are some important details:\n\n*Date:* We are particularly interested in the possibility of hosting Mr.\nPodesta on *September 8th, 2015* for our Organizational Debate of\nthe Fall semester. However, we are also open to the possibility of moving\nthis date forward or backward by a day. In general, our schedule is\nflexible, and we would be more than happy to accommodate yours however we\ncan.\n\n*Time:* On the day of the debate, guests are invited to pre-debate dinner\nat 5:30 PM. The debate starts at *7:30 PM *and usually ends around 9:30 or\n10 PM (depending on the level of energy).\n\n*Format:* The guest opens with a speech advocating one side of\na debate resolution, usually ranging 20-25 minutes in duration. This speech\nis typically followed by a round of questions. Students then give speeches,\nalternating between sides also with a brief questioning period. After about\nan hour and half, the debate comes to close and the guest gives closing\nremarks before a vote is taken on the resolution.\n\n*Parliamentary Format: *Our goal is to encourage debate and discussion on\nimportant and controversial political topics. The Union follows\nparliamentary procedure, with our Speaker directing the course of the\ndebate. We believe parliamentary format particularly encourages students to\nbe responsive to each other\xe2\x80\x99s arguments in a challenging, but\nnon-adversarial way. Guests should also note that our format is lively and\nengaging, with students pounding and hissing to indicate their feelings\ntoward each speech.Our guests often enjoy how lively the debates can get!\n\n*Logistics:* We are generally able to provide for any accommodations,\ntravel costs, and incidental costs during the guest's visit to Yale,\nincluding any meals.\n\nThank you for your consideration. If you have any questions, please don't\nhesitate to send me an email at \xc2\xad\xc2\xad*a\n<elizabeth.scruton@yale.edu>ngelina.xing@yale.edu <ngelina.xing@yale.edu> *or\ncall me at (914) 355-1148. We look forward to the possibility of you\njoining us, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nLina Xing\n\nVice President, Yale Political Union\n\n( <%28502%29410-9133>914) 355-1148\n\n*a <elizabeth.scruton@yale.edu>ngelina.xing@yale.edu\n<ngelina.xing@yale.edu>*\n"
