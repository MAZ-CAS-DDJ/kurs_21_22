[...] I\'m reading on my\nStarbucks mocha cup, ok? the quote of the day. [...] It was Madeline\nAlbright, former Secretary of State [crowd boos] and UN ambassador. [...]\nNow she said it, I didn\'t. She said, "There\'s a place in Hell reserved for\nwomen who don\'t support other women." [crowd cheers] Ok, now thank you so\nmuch for receiving that well. I didn\'t know how that was gonna go over. And\nnow, California, let\'s see what a comment like I just made, how that is\nturned into whatever it\'ll be turned into tomorrow with the newspaper.\n(Rally; Carson, CA 10/04/08)\nTo View: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S03ZfFf_gGQ\n\n-- \nSara DuBois\nTracking / Communications Manager\nProgressiveAccountability.org\nsara@progressiveaccountability.org\n202-609-7681 (office)\n410-967-7306 (cell)\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
