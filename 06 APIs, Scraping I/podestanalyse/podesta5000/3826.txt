He is also on the board of\ncadence. He is a late rsvp but will be there this eve.\n\nIt\'s China and their market power and govt pressure -- which I alluded to\nin my email on Friday. He comes at it from the hardware perspective --\nobviously being blocked from the China market is beyond material.\n\n"My question -- Given China\'s recent stated goal to win in semiconductors\nbacked by $100 billion in a government fund, how can we protect our\ndomestic leadership in design,!IP and manufacturing. We are faced with a\ngo-no go dilemma... Government can be a big influence on how this plays out\nand what can they do to help?  I don\'t need to manufacture there but need\nto sell.\n\nAs we all know - cn wields incredible influence and can, though won\'t\npublicly state -- figure out ways to block sales in cn if a co doesn\'t\n"play the game.\n\nER:  parallel issue on internet and censorship... And the power they yield\nif u don\'t play their game\n\nGoing to 10k foot level -- All comes down to access to the cn market (given\nthe 1.4B people that live there).... And protection of a co\'s Crown Jewels\n(ip, data) and values (free expression/censorship/democracy) ---- our govt\nhas a trade deficit w China so what can govt do to help companies compete?\n (There is a lot in here - which we won\'t get into tonight --  I spent a\nlot of time at linkedin on our China launched studying their market and\nthese dynamics. One thing is clear - the Cold War w cn doesn\'t work and we\nneed to figure out a way to compete. Otherwise our children\'s children will\ngrow up in a very difft world.\n\n(Answer "moving mountains slowly". As access to info and the increased\nmiddle class will demand more freedoms and rights)\n\n\n\n\nSent from my iPhone, and likely with dictation\n'
