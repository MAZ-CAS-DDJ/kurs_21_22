john.podesta@gmail.comb'Cheryl--\nI downloaded this to John about my conversation with Simas this evening,\nbut wanted to make sure you were up to speed as well.\nBig takeaway--she should meet with POTUS at her earliest convenience.\nSimas is open to whatever we think is best for the DNC, but said that she\nwill definitely need to meet with POTUS before any action can be taken.  He\nsaid that in their last meeting she said she was "considering" running and\nhe suggested she be more definitive in this meeting to help create some\nurgency with POTUS.  There are a few other resources POTUS has (his time,\nhis lists, etc) that we should brief HRC on before she meets, but John\nrightly suggested she only touch on those lightly and ask the best way to\nfunnel requests.\nSimas also reinforced the turnout challenge, so we should make sure to\nbrief her on that as well.\nLet me know when we should start a memo.\n'
