john.podesta@gmail.comb'   Hey Everyone:\n\n   The Texas rally with Wendy Davis just finished and if you\'re like me,\n   even if you\'re doing work on or giving to the cause, you wish you were\n   there. Ilyse Hogue went straight from her honeymoon to Austin and spoke at\n   the event with an amazingly powerful and passionate group. It\'s an\n   incredibly galvanizing moment for the movement and folks around the country\n   want to know how they can help.\n\n   Today NARAL invited our activists to get a free "I Stand With Wendy"\n   bumper sticker asking them to help show that our momentum is growing around\n   the country and that we\'re all paying attention. You\'re part of that\n   activist network\n\n\n   We\'d love to send one your way too.\n   <\n   http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/donate/stand-with-wendy-sticker.html?utm_source=nar.al&utm_medium=urlshortener&utm_campaign=FB\n   >\n\n   *Would you help spread the word? *Here\'s one message that was posted\n   earlier if you need inspiration: "At the TX rally with Wendy Davis in\n   spirit. But showing support with\n   NARALs great bumper sticker (PS, it\x92s free): http://nar.al/tn\n    #StandWithWendy"\n\n   Thanks, Sasha\n\n-- \n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.
