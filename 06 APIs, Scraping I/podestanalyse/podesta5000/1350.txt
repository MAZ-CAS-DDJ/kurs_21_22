(She didn\xe2\x80\x99t release a statement on the beheading\nof Jim Foley by ISIS, for instance)\n\n\n\nWell, she finally addressed Ferguson on Thursday, during a prepared speech,\nand it turns out that her comments were among the most substantive compared\nto what other political leaders have said.\n\n\n\nWhereas most Democrats and Republicans, and eventually President Obama,\naddressed the militarization of the police, Clinton actually went there on\nan issue that most avoided:  racism and the criminal justice system.\n\n\n\nAt her speech at the Nexenta OpenSDx Summit in San Francisco, she said \xe2\x80\x9cwe\ncannot ignore the inequities that persist in our justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd then she did what few of her prominent fellow white Democrats have done\nin the context of Ferguson\xe2\x80\x93she acknowledged the well-known statistics that\nshow that blacks get treated differently than whites when it comes to\neverything from traffic stops to sentencing.\n\n\n\nBut rather than just listing the statistics, she got personal by asking\nwhites to put themselves in the shoes of black Americans:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cImagine what we would feel and what we would do if white drivers were\nthree times as likely to be searched by police during a traffic stop as\nblack drivers instead of the other way around. If white offenders received\nprison sentences ten percent longer than black offenders for the same\ncrimes. If a third of all white men \xe2\x80\x93 just look at this room and take\none-third \xe2\x80\x93 went to prison during their lifetime. Imagine that. That is the\nreality in the lives of so many of our fellow Americans in so many of the\ncommunities in which they live.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHer statements in many ways echo those of Sen. Rand Paul\xe2\x80\x99s who also\nimagined himself as Michael Brown, mouthing off at a cop as a teen, but\nwith a very different outcome based on race.  Both Paul and Clinton went\nfurther in their statements than Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Obama, who in\nhis third statement on Ferguson, touched on black crime rates, and only\nallowed that there might be sentencing disparities and differential\ntreatment for blacks in the criminal justice system.\n\n\n\nPaul and Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s boldness on racism and the criminal justice system is a\nrisky and bold move, given the wide divide in how blacks and whites think\nabout and experience race.  Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s easier for whites to talk about\nracism than it is for blacks (witness Obama), but in asking whites to\nchange their thinking about race and to essentially imagine themselves as\nblack, both Paul and Clinton are doing something that has rarely been done\nin national politics in the last decade.\n\n\n\nProgressives, fueled by buyer\xe2\x80\x99s remorse over Obama, are set on portraying\nClinton as too moderate, ignoring, for instance, that she actually ran to\nthe left of Obama on health care, and has spoken out, in formal settings,\non voting rights as well.\n\n\n\nSome progressives noticed her comments on Ferguson, but even as they\npraised her, they questioned her motives:\n\n\n\n*Marc Lamont Hill* @marclamonthill: In honesty, Hillary Clinton offered the\ntype of commentary that many of us were quixotically expecting from\nPresident Obama.

Correct the Record, the rapid\nresponse outfit in the proto-Hillary 2016 campaign infrastructure, shared\nwith TPM new talking points detailing her record on climate change at the\nState Department.\n\n\n\nThe group has been regularly releasing reports outlining Clinton\'s record\non various issues, from LGBT rights to income equality, for months. They\nare part of the group\'s overall mission of greasing the wheels for\nClinton\'s various public appearances and putting a positive spin on her\npast work -- all in the context of an anticipated 2016 run.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton looked to the future, planning for our generation and the\nnext generation of Americans when she prioritized the fight against climate\nchange as a matter of foreign policy," Adrienne Elrod, communications\ndirector at Correct the Record, told TPM in a statement. "Clinton led the\nway through partnerships and developed incentives to encourage cooperation\nand progress toward reducing our footprint on the environment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nCorrect the Record credited Clinton with changing the way the United States\napproached climate change, pointing to her establishment of a special envoy\nfor climate change within the State Department, which it called the Obama\nadministration\'s point person for climate negotiations, and to the creation\nof a new Bureau of Energy Resources, which Clinton had said would be\ndevoted to tracking worldwide energy use.\n\n\n\nOther points of emphasis for Correct the Record were an agreement with\nBrazil to improve bilateral coordination on climate change and the Climate\nand Clear Air Coalition, a group of 37 countries that is working to reduce\nmethane emissions, per the pro-Clinton outfit.\n\n\n\nThe group also singled out one of Clinton\'s favorite anecdotes on the\nsubject, which she included in her recent book, "Hard Choices": The time\nthat she and President Barack Obama forced their way into a 2009 meeting in\nCopenhagan between leaders from China, India, Brazil and South Africa so\nthat they could talk about the Kyoto Protocol.\n\n\n\nThe meeting led to a non-binding agreement that all developed countries\nwould set 2020 goals for cutting their carbon emissions. The United Nations\nlater said that the goals set in the so-called Copenhagen Accord were\ninsufficient, though they were considered "an important step toward the\nobjective of limiting growth of emissions" in the words of an U.N. official.\n\n\n\nThe Thursday speech is one of the first forums for Clinton to talk\nextensively about climate change as the 2016 speculation has kicked into\nfull gear. She has, however, continued to addressed it with regularity\nduring her frequent speaking engagements.\n\n\n\nIn March, according to the Associated Press, she said climate change was\n"not just some ancillary issue," but one that required "mass movement."\n\n\n\n"I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping that there will be this mass movement that demands political\nchange," she said, "and it becomes just as powerful as some of the other\nissues that effect the outcome of elections here and around the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Slate: Jamelle Bouie: \xe2\x80\x9cIs Hillary Clinton Better at Talking About Racial\nInjustice Than Obama?\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/hillary_clinton_on_ferguson_protests_and_michael_brown_s_killing_the_former.html?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed>*\n\n\n\nBy Jamelle Bouie\n\nAugust 29, 2014, 10:36 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] It may take the next white president to talk to white Americans\nabout race.\n\n\n\nAfter almost three weeks of silence, Hillary Clinton has finally spoken on\nthe shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\n\n\nToward the end of her paid remarks at a tech conference in San Francisco,\nClinton shifted gears to address the shooting and its related issues. \xe2\x80\x9cI\napplaud President Obama for sending the attorney general to Ferguson, and\ndemanding a thorough and speedy investigation,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s both\nthorough and necessary to find out what happened, to see that justice is\ndone, and to help this community begin healing itself.\xe2\x80\x9d On criminal justice\nreform, she echoed President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s comments from last week\xe2\x80\x99s press\nconference. \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot ignore the inequities that persist in our justice\nsystem,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cinequities that undermine our deepest values of\nfairness and equality.\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton also condemned the draconian police\nresponse to peaceful protesters. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody wants to see our streets look like\na war zone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cNot in America, we are better than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n>From there, Clinton addressed racial prejudice and inequality. But unlike\nObama\xe2\x80\x94whose comments were limited to banalities and \xe2\x80\x9cboth sides\xe2\x80\x9d\nposturing\xe2\x80\x94she had something smart to say.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cImagine what we would feel and what we would do if white drivers were\nthree times as likely to be searched by police during a traffic stop as\nblack drivers, instead of the other way around,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cif white\noffenders received prison sentences 10 percent longer than black offenders\nfor the same crimes, if a third of all white men\xe2\x80\x94just look at this room and\ntake one third\xe2\x80\x94went to prison during their lifetime. Imagine that. That is\nthe reality in the lives of so many of our fellow Americans and so many of\nthe communities in which they live.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe few times President Obama has made serious comments on race, he\xe2\x80\x99s been\ncandid, personal, and conciliatory. He\xe2\x80\x99s either tried to universalize his\nexperience\xe2\x80\x94as he did in his 2008 Philadelphia speech\xe2\x80\x94or contextualize the\nparticular experiences of black Americans, as he did in his 2013 remarks on\nthe George Zimmerman verdict. Put simply, being black lets Obama empathize\nwith black Americans in a way unique to his presidency. At the same time,\nit acts as a limit on what he can say. Or, as I noted on Tuesday, Obama\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t address racial issues without polarizing the public along racial\nlines. He tip-toed around Ferguson, but given the rancor caused by his\ncomments on Henry Louis Gates\xe2\x80\x99 arrest or Trayvon Martin\xe2\x80\x99s killing, it was\nthe smart path to take.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s statement is neither candid, personal, or especially\nconciliatory. Instead, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little blunt, and in a good way. She asks for\nunderstanding and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give her listeners a rhetorical escape. \xe2\x80\x9cImagine\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, pushing her audience to conjure a world where white men\nwere targets for law enforcement, and where their lives were routinely\nderailed for trivial offenses.\n\n\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s also the optics of the audience. When most white politicians talk\non race or racial subjects, they go to a black audience. Hence Ken\nMehlman\xe2\x80\x99s 2005 apology to the NAACP for the GOP\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSouthern Strategy,\xe2\x80\x9d or\nmore recently Reince Preibus\xe2\x80\x99 comments on Republican outreach at this\nyear\xe2\x80\x99s convention of the National Association of Black Journalists.\n\n\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure there were black people in the audience in San Francisco, but this\nwas Silicon Valley. Clinton was talking to white people. And she was asking\nthem, as white people, to show empathy and concern for the conditions of\ntheir black fellow citizens. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say this is unprecedented, but it\nis rare. Especially since there\xe2\x80\x99s no attempt to deflect or blame black\nAmericans for their own problems. Clinton doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mention \xe2\x80\x9cblack-on-black\ncrime\xe2\x80\x9d or give a brief respectability lecture. She simply says, Look at how\nwe treat them, and imagine if it were you.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, political scientist Daniel Gillion found that in his first two\nyears in office President Obama spoke less on race than any Democratic\npresident since 1961. And judging from his relative silence since then, I\nexpect that when Obama leaves office, he will have said less on racial\nquestions than most recent presidents, period.\n\n\n\nFor Americans who wanted Obama\xe2\x80\x99s voice on race, this is disappointing. At\nthe same time, there\xe2\x80\x99s a decent chance we\xe2\x80\x99ll get Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s voice on\nrace, and while the modern presidency brings political limits on what any\npresident can say, that might be the better alternative.\n\n\n\nIn the same way that only a hardline anti-communist could go to China and\nonly an arch-conservative could raise taxes, it might be that it takes a\nwhite person in the White House to have real candor with white people on\nrace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*CNN: \xe2\x80\x9cChelsea Clinton is leaving NBC\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/08/29/chelsea-clinton-is-leaving-nbc/>*\n\n\n\nBy Dan Merica\n\nAugust 29, 2014, 12:05 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nChelsea Clinton, who joined NBC as a special correspondent in 2011, is\nstepping down from the news network.\n\n\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton\'s daughter announced her departure in a Facebook\npost, hanging the decision on her desire to continue working for the\nClinton Foundation and the fact that she and her husband Marc Mezvinsky\nwill be welcoming their first child this fall.\n\n\n\n"I am profoundly grateful to NBC viewers who responded to the stories I\nshared, providing funds to help expand the reach of those programs and who\nencouraged their schools\xe2\x80\x99 principals, their mayors and local activists to\nthink about how to build similarly transformative programs in their own\ncommunities," Clinton wrote. "It\xe2\x80\x99s been a privilege to be part of the NBC\nFamily."\n\n\n\nWhile at NBC, Clinton worked on stories for "Rock Center with Brian\nWilliams," which was canceled in 2013, and \xe2\x80\x9cNBC Nightly News.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHer stories were largely service-focused, including features on a boxing\ngym that offers tutoring in Detroit; a diner in Albuquerque, New Mexico\nthat helps kids with homework and feeds them; and an education program in\nPine Bluff, Arkansas that deals with hunger and education in the region.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s role with NBC was reportedly lucrative. Politico reported earlier\nthis year that the former first daughter was paid $600,000 for the first\nfew years of her contract with the network.\n\n\n\nTo much ballyhoo, Chelsea Clinton announced she was pregnant in April. With\nher mother, Hillary Clinton, considering a run at the presidency in 2016, a\nconsiderable amount of attention has focused on Chelsea Clinton\'s pregnancy.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday in San Francisco, Hillary Clinton was asked whether the baby\nwould be a boy or a girl.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t know because my daughter and her husband don\'t want to know,"\nClinton said.

It\xe2\x80\x99s something we didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay much attention to last time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Super PAC system is not to everybody\xe2\x80\x99s liking in the US with many\narguing that it massively inflates election spending and leads to more\nnegative campaigning from non-official sources.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Dwyer is not opposed to this view: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99d be in favour of it\nif I was asked but that\xe2\x80\x99s the system we find ourselves in at the moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn the election itself, O\xe2\x80\x99Dwyer says that he feels Clinton is performing\nwell in the phoney campaign after she\xe2\x80\x99s hit headlines with her opinions on\nIsrael, a tiff with President Obama and yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s comments on Ferguson:\n\n\n\nI think particularly since she left as Secretary of State she\xe2\x80\x99s spoken out\nmore. Americans are looking for strong decisive leadership that\xe2\x80\x99s not\nideological. Particularly among women who feel that it\xe2\x80\x99s long overdue that\nwe have a female president.\n\n\n\nAs for Ireland Dwyer, who\xe2\x80\x99s a New York lawyer and prominent within the\nIrish-American community, says that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Irish are like any other people,\nthey appreciate when people pay attention to them and take their issues\nseriously\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\n\nHe says that Irish-America has always had great affection for both Clintons\nwith Irish people were only behind African-Americans in the loyalty they\nshowed to the former President Clinton.\n\n\n\nAs for whether Hillary Clinton will make a trip to Ireland before 2016,\nO\xe2\x80\x99Dwyer says he will be lobbying for this but is confident that \xe2\x80\x9csome\nmember of the Clinton family\xe2\x80\x9d will make it here in the next 18 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*CNN: \xe2\x80\x9cFormer Presidents Clinton and Bush to launch new initiative\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/08/29/former-presidents-clinton-and-bush-to-launch-new-initiative/>*\n\n\n\nBy Kevin Bohn\n\nAugust 29th, 2014 10:01 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nWashington (CNN) \xe2\x80\x93 Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W.
