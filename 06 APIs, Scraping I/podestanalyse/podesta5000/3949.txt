I have no problem putting a reference in, but the truth is the cost is not that much as we constructed the policy b/c (1) the annual ACA out of pocket cap that already exists buys out the costs of the most expensive drugs\xe2\x80\x8e and (2) the policy is a per drug cap that is only FDA approved uses on the plans formulary. As such, the premium impact done by respected actuaries on this policy is modest. In CA, which has already done this, for example, the cost is projected to be no more than 1 percent. Therefore, relative to the other problems addressed in the memo, this is small. Moreover, this memo is more a nationwide, state of play review -- not a future policy impact analysis. Having said, as one alternative, you may wish to drop the reference in this memo to the drug cost cap as an ACA reform she has already proposed which, as you point out, will not help on the premium front.

I totally agree with you on the need to hold back any of the preliminary new policy ideas.  I threw the list in mostly in case you guys required a placeholder set of ideas to illustrate that work is underway.  Having said, much better to defer until package that builds on what she has already done/is doing is complete and signed off through our process.  Other than one other thing, I like the rest of the edits.  The one thing:  I think when the legitimate problems underscoring the current law are deferred to end, the memo seems to flow less logically.  Moreover, I would like to acknowledge the bad news up front so she isn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking we are burying the problems.  Principals sometimes don\xe2\x80\x99t trust the messenger who appears to be pooh poohing the challenge.  If ok with you guys, I would like to get that stuff out of the way and restore that ordering.  As I reviewed memo, I found places to tighten and shorten. Again, I think it helps with the flow and the digesting of the info. Other than that, good to go.

I have edited and reordered it to: (1) have her focus on the arguments about why not to panic too much about United Health Care at the beginning of the memo; and (2) left the background on why ACA needs to be strengthened to the end; and (3) I deleted your list of improvements at the end as I'd prefer for us to work on giving her a package together rather than a few ideas now.\r\n\r\nIf this works for you and Jake, Shapiro can clean it up and get it into HRC's briefing book.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nAnn\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Mon, Nov 23, 2015 at 6:52 AM, Jake Sullivan <jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\r\nThanks Chris.

I present the conflicting issues around plan positioning, enrollment and risk selection.  I think you will find it to be consistent with our conversation.  You will note that besides raising the issues, I make a recommendation about HRC being a bit more aggressive about the need to strengthen the ACA over time.  I also raise a few very preliminary new policy outlines that may spur further conversations with Ann, Jake and the rest of the team.
