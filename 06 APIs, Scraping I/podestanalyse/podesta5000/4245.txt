It's also been our busiest month at Swan House so far this year. Our work on Law in Global Economic Justice saw Mr David Bradbury (OECD) give the second of our Lectures in Transnational Justice, on the case for reforming our international tax rules on base erosion and profit shifting. The faculty also finished their discussion of Thomas Picketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century - bringing to an end our first semester reading group.\r\n\r\nA group of students and faculty saw the reality of the economic crisis when their visit to Brussels had them in the heart of the EU on a day when 10,000 protesters took to the streets. See Michael Kramer's report here in the newsletter for more. Our European Human Rights Advocacy students are off to Strasbourg next week - check out next month's newsletter for a report.\r\n\r\nAlthough the end of term is nigh there remains much to do. We have our third Transnational Justice Lecture on 3rd December, when Professor Jennifer Hillman (Georgetown), former member of the WTO Appellate Body, will ask 'Can Multilateralism Make a Comeback?'. We also have the end of semester celebration on 5th December - taking in a boat tour on the Thames and dinner for faculty, staff and students. More on that too next month.\r\n\r\nElsewhere in this issue Executive Director Scott Foster welcomes a new staff member, we shine a spotlight on the Fall Semester Student Government, and we bring you news from the CTLS network. Please do remember that if you have any news about a CTLS partner school or alumnus, let us know so we can include it in a future issue. Email cian.murphy@kcl.ac.uk<mailto:cian.murphy@kcl.ac.uk?subject=CTLS%20Bulletin> and we will be sure to follow up. We look forward to hearing from you!\r\nYours in transnational legal education,\r\nCian Murphy & Alvaro Santos\r\nAcademic Co-Directors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[https://gallery.mailchimp.com/50d719ffbfdc236beb8f2133a/images/8c385a8f-b745-4702-8015-cf682fd02975.jpg]<http://georgetown.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=50d719ffbfdc236beb8f2133a&id=8b778d3d46&e=1c75f0b644>\r\nBook Launch & Network News\r\nOn 13 November CTLS was delighted to host the launch of International Capital Markets: Law and Institutions, by Professor Cally Jordan (Melbourne Law and former CTLS faculty member).

Students had a chance to hear talks from European Council and European Commission officials to supplement their classroom experience. Lecture topics included the organisation of the EU's law-making structures, the EU's response to the Eurozone crisis, and a look ahead at the tasks facing the Juncker Commission.\r\n\r\nMost of the group arrived early enough the day before to enjoy a night on the town, with visits to the world-famous Mannekin Pis statue and the picturesque Grand Place. The students and Professors Tsoukala and Santos enjoyed a pint of beer and engaged in spirited legal discussions into the wee hours. Check out some photographs here.<http://georgetown.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=50d719ffbfdc236beb8f2133a&id=1bd7926c88&e=1c75f0b644>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[https://gallery.mailchimp.com/50d719ffbfdc236beb8f2133a/images/a5bff86a-7cb7-4702-9a80-537d64e0b57c.jpg] Student Government\r\nThe Student Government has had a wonderful semester.
