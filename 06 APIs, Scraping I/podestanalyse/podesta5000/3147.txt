After the last month in Washington, watching Theo and Henry play with toy cars, trains and every kind of Lego set has been a true delight.\n\nLast week was a crucial moment in our nation's history.  By taking a meaningful step forward to reform our broken health care system, we will make an extraordinary difference in the lives of so many Americans.  Many of you got involved in politics to fight for this type of reform - no one will be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions, preventive care will now be covered, and no one will go bankrupt because of one illness.  In NY, 2.7 million New Yorkers will now have access to coverage whereas they did not before, and small businesses all across America will receive billions in tax credits to offer quality coverage.  Many of us would have loved Medicare for All to be part of this bill, but we must remember this is only the first step of many on a path toward reform.\n\nSo much of what we have accomplished was only possible because of your generous support and effective advocacy.  Your sustained commitment to our campaign and this fight has strengthened my ability to be a champion for all those who will no longer accept the status quo and a system that is pricing out more and more families each day.\n\nWe have 4 short days left before the end of our quarter.  As you know, the timing of your support could not be more important or have a greater impact than now.\n\nClick here to rush $1000, $2400 or more to my campaign.  It's the best way to build our strength and win in 2010. https://secure.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/827/p/wfc/dscc/senators/gillibrand/donate.sjs?donate_page_KEY=5879\n\nPlease know how much I need and appreciate your generous and thoughtful help.  We have a midnight deadline on December 31st.  Please give what you can before that deadline.  Whether your personal maximum is $25, $480, or the maximum allowable $4,800, each and every dollar helps.  We hope to raise an additional $100,000 in the next 4 days.  Your help will get us there.  Maintaining our majority in Congress could not be more important.\n\nThank you for your generous help today.\n\nWarmly,\nKirsten\n\n----\n\nPaid for by Gillibrand for Senate\n\nTo unsubscribe please click here\nhttp://www.democratsenators.org/o/44/unsubscribe.jsp?Email=john.podesta@gmail.com&email_blast_KEY=11899&organization_KEY=44\n"
