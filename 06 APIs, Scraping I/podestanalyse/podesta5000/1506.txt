It\xe2\x80\x99s\nimportant that Clinton \xe2\x80\x9cfind ways to connect with the grassroots\nprogressives our organizations represent,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, calling them the \xe2\x80\x9cfoot\nsoldiers\xe2\x80\x9d of the party.\n\nClinton plans an unofficial \xe2\x80\x9clistening tour\xe2\x80\x9d after the election, according\nto The New York Times, but Green says his group\xe2\x80\x99s outreach pre-dated the\nelections by several months.\n\n\n\nActivists involved with several other labor and progressive groups said\nthey have not yet been contacted by Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team. One suspected the tour\nwill be confined to \xe2\x80\x9cknown likely friends,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than people skeptical of\nClinton. Still, they acknowledged it\xe2\x80\x99s early yet.\n\n\n\nDean\xe2\x80\x99s DFA has gotten a jump on 2016 by trying to take the temperatures of\nits more than 1 million members. Last week, it launched an internal poll\nthat, \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrates our commitment to making sure the fight for the\nDemocratic nomination is a contest, not a coronation,\xe2\x80\x9d Sroka said. The poll\nis still ongoing, but this week, the group sent a series of emails to\nsupporters making \xe2\x80\x9cthe progressive case\xe2\x80\x9d for several different candidates,\nincluding Clinton.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton is a brawler, willing to take Republicans head on and\nexpose their lies. Can you imagine watching Hillary demolish Ted Cruz or\nRand Paul in a debate? It would be epic,\xe2\x80\x9d the Clinton email notes. It also\npraises her experience and political strength, concluding: With \xe2\x80\x9cthe\nmistakes of her 2008 presidential campaign in her rearview mirror, Hillary\nClinton appears to be ready to win the White House.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe other emails tout the progressive bona fides for Warren and Sen. Bernie\nSanders. There\xe2\x80\x99s also an email for, curiously, former Labor Secretary\nRobert Reich.\n\n\n\nOn a DFA conference call in February, Reich said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think that there will\nbe a lot of people \xe2\x80\x93 Elizabeth Warren, others, maybe even me \xe2\x80\x93 who will\ntoss our hats in the ring.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nProgressives are encouraged by Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s recent rhetoric on the stump for\nDemocratic midterm candidates, especially the speech she gave while\nappearing with Warren in Massachusetts on behalf of failed Democratic\ngubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s clear that she\xe2\x80\x99s listening,\xe2\x80\x9d\nSroka said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Hill: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton in no hurry to announce 2016 plans\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/223801-hillary-clinton-in-no-hurry-to-announce-2016-plans>*\n\n\n\nBy Amie Parnes\n\nNovember 12, 2014, 6:00 a.m. EST\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton is in no rush to announce that she\xe2\x80\x99s running for president.\n\n\n\nSources in Clinton World say while there\xe2\x80\x99s been some chatter about an\nearlier-than-expected announcement, given the\n\n\n\nDemocratic midterm thumping, Clinton is likely to stick to the timeline of\nmaking her plans known early next year.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not going to get in early. Period. End of sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d said one\nClinton ally. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not ready. She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t fully decided that\xe2\x80\x99s what she\nwants to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton formally launched her first White House bid on Jan. 20, 2007, with\na statement on her website that said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd the expectation has been that she would follow a similar plan, at least\non the timing of an announcement, if she chooses to run for the presidency\nagain.\n\n\n\nBut suggestions that she should move up her plans have become more common\nin recent weeks \xe2\x80\x94 particularly after the midterms.\n\n\n\nThose arguing that Clinton should get in sooner rather than later say an\nearlier bid would help her fundraising and organizing. It would also\nprovide some, much-needed energy to a party still reeling from an electoral\ndisaster.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a good reminder that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see them on the playing field in\ntwo years,\xe2\x80\x9d said one Democratic strategist. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be continued.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt could also downplay the storyline that Clinton is too cautious and is\ntaking cues from old playbooks.\n\n\n\nDavid Plouffe, who ran President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 campaign, recently advised\nher to stop playing coy and push the go button as soon as possible,\naccording to a report in Politico.\n\n\n\nAnd Clinton herself offered remarks last month during a Q-and-A in Ottawa\nthat left some wondering if she was readjusting her timeline.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been dodging this question now for a year and a half or more,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid at an event hosted by a Canadian think tank. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep\ndodging it, certainly until the midterm elections are over. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking\nhard about it. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to really bear down and think hard about\nit in a way you make a decision until after these elections.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHillaryland sources say Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 who recently celebrated the birth of her\ngranddaughter \xe2\x80\x94 is currently in \xe2\x80\x9clistening mode,\xe2\x80\x9d as one put it. After\ncampaigning with Democratic candidates, she wants some downtime to really\nmull the decision inside and out.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see any reason to announce anytime in the next two months,\xe2\x80\x9d said\none Clinton insider. \xe2\x80\x9cFrankly, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking, \xe2\x80\x98Take your time.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThese sources maintain she will likely make a decision about her next steps\nsometime over the holidays. Should she choose to run, she could then form\nan exploratory committee, allowing her to have a soft launch of sorts.\n\n\n\nThe committee would in turn send a clear message of her intent without a\nhuge announcement or quick ramp-up of a large team, allowing her to remain\nsomewhat low-key for the time being.\n\n\n\nVoters could suffer from an early dose of Clinton fatigue, argue those\nsaying Clinton should not get in early.\n\n\n\nAnd once a campaign begins on the early side, there\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmore time for\nnegative coverage to set in and doubts in the media,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julian Zelizer,\na professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University.\n\n\n\nThe longtime Clinton adviser maintained that the election results don\xe2\x80\x99t and\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t affect the general timeline of an announcement.\n\n\n\nFor one thing, the aide pointed out, there is plenty of action already\ntaking place to eat up the political oxygen including the debate between\nmainstream Republicans and Tea Partyers in addition to the string of\nwould-be presidential candidates on the GOP side.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the source added, issue-oriented debates on immigration reform\nand other issues are also taking up space in the political stratosphere.\n\n\n\nBut most of all, Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 who spent the bulk of the year on a book tour,\ngiving speeches and then stumping for Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 needs more time.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe timeline is what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d one longtime Clinton ally said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nsee that changing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Washington Post: PostPartisan: \xe2\x80\x9cThe central challenge for Hillary Clinton\nand Democrats in 2016\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/11/11/the-central-challenge-for-hillary-clinton-and-democrats-in-2016/>*\n\n\n\nBy Carter Eskew\n\nNovember 11, 2014, 12:33 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nDavid Leonhardt has an essential article today for those who wish to\nunderstand the recent volatility in electoral outcomes generally, and the\nmisfortune of Democrats specifically.  The key driver of these outcomes,\naccording to Leonhardt, is stagnant middle-class incomes. The average\nAmerican worker, who is lucky enough to have a job, makes $3,600 less today\nin inflation-adjusted wages than he did in 2001. That is an extraordinary\nfact, and one that overshadows all other aspects of our politics. It is why\nObama and Democrats not only fail to receive any credit for a decline in\nthe unemployment rate, but also are currently seen as weaker than\nRepublicans on what was always their strength: running the economy for the\nbenefit of the middle-class. It is why the \xe2\x80\x9cwar on women,\xe2\x80\x9d climate change,\nhealth care, and Social Security, Democratic go-to issues, cut so little\nthis year, and seem exhausted for the foreseeable future. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just the\neconomy, stupid; it\xe2\x80\x99s the fact that people are working the same and making\nless, moron.\n\n\n\nHere, then, is the central challenge for Hillary Clinton and Democrats in\n2016: Convince enough voters that they have a credible plan to raise\nincomes for the middle class through jump starting economic growth. It\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be easy, as Leonhardt makes clear. Democratic ideas for the economy,\ninvestment in infrastructure and education, to cite two favorites, take\nyears to pay dividends. A faster way to prime the pump, Leonhardt suggests,\nwould be to cut taxes on the middle class, offset by an increase in rates\nfor the wealthy, which echoes, to some degree, the platforms Bill Clinton\nand Barack Obama campaigned on in 1992 and in 2008, respectively.\n\n\n\nFor Mrs. Clinton, of course, economic growth and raising stagnant wages\nmust be the sine qua non of her candidacy. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to bring the \xe2\x80\x9claser\nbeam\xe2\x80\x9d that Bill Clinton promised in 1992 out of storage and refocus it on\nthe economy. Politically, all else is distraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Washington Post blog: Plum Line: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy a Bernie Sanders presidential\ncandidacy is good for Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 and for Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/11/11/why-a-bernie-sanders-presidential-candidacy-is-good-for-democrats-and-for-hillary-clinton/>*\n\n\n\nBy Paul Waldman\n\nNovember 11, 2014, 1:44 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nEver since people started thinking about the 2016 presidential primaries,\nthe assumption has been that the Republican side will feature a fascinating\nand bloody donnybrook with no initial frontrunner and as many as a dozen\npotentially realistic candidacies, while the Democratic contest will be no\ncontest at all, but rather a coronation for Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nBut might we finally have a real clash of ideas on the Democratic side?\nYes, we might:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has spent months fishing for a strategist to\nguide his potential 2016 presidential campaign. On Monday, he hooked a big\none: Tad Devine, one of the Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s leading consultants and a\nformer high-level campaign aide to Al Gore, John Kerry, and Michael Dukakis.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If he runs, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to help him,\xe2\x80\x99 Devine said in an interview. \xe2\x80\x98He is\nnot only a longtime client but a friend. I believe he could deliver an\nenormously powerful message that the country is waiting to hear right now\nand do it in a way that succeeds.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevine and Sanders, who first worked together on Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s campaigns in\nthe 1990s, have been huddling in recent weeks, mapping out how the brusque\nprogressive senator could navigate a primary and present a formidable\nchallenge to Hillary Rodham Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic\npresidential nomination.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe height of Devine\xe2\x80\x99s influence may be in the recent past, but he still\nbrings establishment credibility that could lead people in the media to\ngive Sanders more attention. His involvement is also a sign that Sanders\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t just thinking he\xe2\x80\x99ll get a van and drive around New Hampshire, but\ninstead that he\xe2\x80\x99d mount a serious campaign, no matter how formidable the\nobstacles to victory. That could mean a genuinely interesting debate about\nthe problems America confronts and how the Democratic party should address\nthem.\n\n\n\nSanders says he\xe2\x80\x99ll center his campaign on economic inequality and the\nstruggles of the middle class, and this is what Clinton needs to address as\nwell. That may be the most important message for Democrats of the 2014\nelection, not to mention Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s continuing low approval ratings:\nDemocrats need to figure out how to address persistent economic insecurity,\nstagnating wages, and the failure of the recovery\xe2\x80\x99s gains to achieve\nwidespread distribution.\n\n\n\nIf you look at most economic measures, the Obama administration seems\nspectacularly successful. Since the economy stopped hemorrhaging jobs at\nthe end of 2009, it has added 10 million. We\xe2\x80\x99ve now had nine straight\nmonths with over 200,000 jobs created, which hadn\xe2\x80\x99t happened since the\nmid-1990\xe2\x80\xb2s. Unemployment is below 6 percent, GDP growth is steady, and the\nfederal deficit is less than half what it was when Obama took office. Yet\nhis approval on the economy is an anemic 40 percent.\n\n\n\nThe reasons why are many and complicated (the most important is that wages\nare not increasing), but one problem Democrats face is that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have\na coherent story to tell on the economy that explains what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done\nright, connects with people\xe2\x80\x99s current displeasure, and shows a way forward.\nIf by focusing on the economy Sanders forces Clinton to articulate that\nstory and support it with a specific agenda that she could implement if she\nwins, he will have done her a great service.\n\n\n\nOf course, he\xe2\x80\x99d say he isn\xe2\x80\x99t running to do Hillary Clinton any favors. But\nthe reality is that he would. By critiquing her from the left, he could\npull her in his direction in order to satisfy primary voters, which on many\nissues would wind up being to her advantage. At the same time, the broader\nmessage their debates would communicate to the general electorate is that\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s a moderate. When Republicans try to argue that she\xe2\x80\x99s some wild-eyed\nAlinskyite radical bent on turning America socialist (just as they did with\nObama), she can say, \xe2\x80\x9cI ran against an actual socialist in the primaries,\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty obvious we aren\xe2\x80\x99t the same person.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA strong Sanders candidacy will do something else: make liberal Democrats\nfeel that their opinions and their concerns are getting a fair hearing in\nthe 2016 process. Sanders is an eloquent and unapologetic voice for\nliberalism. His presence as a real contender on the campaign trail would\nassure liberals that their party can still be a vehicle for their ideology,\neven if the candidate who triumphs is the more centrist establishment\nfigure. And that\xe2\x80\x99s something they could use right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Politico Magazine: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Wall Street Loves Hillary\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/11/why-wall-street-loves-hillary-112782.html#.VGNLdvldWSp>*\n\n\n\nBy William D.

Speaking at the Park\nPlaza Hotel in Boston as she did her part to try to rescue the failing\ngubernatorial campaign of Martha Coakley in Massachusetts, Clinton paid\ndeference to Senator Elizabeth Warren, the anti-Wall Street firebrand who\nhas accused Clinton of pandering to the big banks, and who was sitting\nright there listening. \xe2\x80\x9cI love watching Elizabeth give it to those who\ndeserve it,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said to cheers. But then, awkwardly, she appeared to\ntry to out-Warren Warren\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps build a bridge too far to the left\xe2\x80\x94by\nuttering words she clearly did not believe: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let anyone tell you that\nit\xe2\x80\x99s corporations and businesses that create jobs,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said,\nerroneously echoing a meme Warren made famous during an August 2011 speech\nat a home in Andover, Massachusetts. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that old theory,\ntrickle-down economics? That has been tried, that has failed. It has failed\nrather spectacularly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe right went wild. See? Hillary Clinton has finally shown her hand. After\nhaving sat out the financial crisis and all the economic turmoil that has\nfollowed in the past six years\xe2\x80\x94and with good reason, since for most of that\ntime she was tending to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s diplomacy as secretary of state\xe2\x80\x94she is\nproving to be an anti-Wall Street populist too, and as much a socialist as\nher former boss, President Obama.\n\n\n\nBut here\xe2\x80\x99s the strange thing: Down on Wall Street they don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it for\na minute. While the finance industry does genuinely hate Warren, the big\nbankers love Clinton, and by and large they badly want her to be president.\nMany of the rich and powerful in the financial industry\xe2\x80\x94among them, Goldman\nSachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, Tom Nides, a\npowerful vice chairman at Morgan Stanley, and the heads of JPMorganChase\nand Bank of America\xe2\x80\x94consider Clinton a pragmatic problem-solver not prone\nto populist rhetoric. To them, she\xe2\x80\x99s someone who gets the idea that we all\nbenefit if Wall Street and American business thrive. What about her forays\ninto fiery rhetoric? They dismiss it quickly as political maneuvers. None\nof them think she really means her populism.\n\n\n\nAlthough Hillary Clinton has made no formal announcement of her candidacy,\nthe consensus on Wall Street is that she is running\xe2\x80\x94and running hard\xe2\x80\x94and\nthat her national organization is quickly falling into place behind the\nscenes. That all makes her attractive. Wall Street, above all, loves a\nwinner, especially one who is not likely to tamper too radically with its\nvast money pot.\n\n\n\nAccording to a wide assortment of bankers and hedge-fund managers I spoke\nto for this article, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s rock-solid support on Wall Street is not\nanything that can be dislodged based on a few seemingly off-the-cuff\ncomments in Boston calculated to protect her left flank. (For the record,\nshe quickly walked them back, saying she had \xe2\x80\x9cshort-handed\xe2\x80\x9d her comments\nabout the failures of trickle-down economics by suggesting, absurdly, that\ncorporations don\xe2\x80\x99t create jobs.) \xe2\x80\x9cI think people are very excited about\nHillary,\xe2\x80\x9d says one Wall Street investment professional with close ties to\nWashington. \xe2\x80\x9cMost people in New York on the finance side view her as being\nvery pragmatic. I think they have confidence that she understands how\nthings work and that she\xe2\x80\x99s not a populist.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe bottom line for Wall Street, says this executive\xe2\x80\x94echoing many others\xe2\x80\x94is\nthat Clinton understands that America\xe2\x80\x99s much-maligned financial industry\nwants to be part of the solution to the country\xe2\x80\x99s problems. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody who\nmakes money feels a shared responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d he continues. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody sort\nof looks at her with a lot of optimism because they feel she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind\nmaking hard decisions. She\xe2\x80\x99ll do what she needs to do, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a \xe2\x80\x98Let\nme blame you.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x98Hey, here\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do.\xe2\x80\x99 And I think\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s very different.\xe2\x80\x9d During a speech last December at the Conrad Hotel,\nin New York, her message could not have been more different from Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\nhot, anti-Wall Street rhetoric: \xe2\x80\x9cWe all got into this mess together, and\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re all going to have to work together to get out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDuring the 2012 presidential election, Wall Street felt burned by Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\nrhetoric and regulatory positions and overwhelmingly supported with their\nmoney Republican candidate Mitt Romney, co-founder of private-equity firm\nBain Capital. Now, though, there\xe2\x80\x99s a significant momentum back behind the\nDemocratic contest. \xe2\x80\x9cThe money is already behind her,\xe2\x80\x9d the Wall Street\nmoney manager says. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s starting to line up behind her:\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s there for her if she wants it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe informal head of her informal Wall Street outreach effort for her\ninformal campaign is a finance executive she knows well\xe2\x80\x94and recruited to\nwork for her at the State Department. Tom Nides, 53, the Morgan Stanley\nexecutive, knows both New York and Washington intimately. Today he speaks\nwith Clinton regularly and has begun to play the role of gatekeeper on Wall\nStreet to her embryonic campaign. He also has been known to run\ninterference between the Obama administration and the leaders of the\nIsraeli government, in order to try to patch up their dysfunctional\nrelationship. \xe2\x80\x9cTom at the end of the day is the guy\xe2\x80\x94she trusts him, she\nknows him,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Wall Street investment manager.\n\n\n\nNides returned to Morgan Stanley in 2013 after two years working for\nClinton at the State Department as deputy secretary of state for management\nand resources. Nides (with whom I once shared a one-week summer rental on\nNantucket) epitomizes the revolving door that has long existed between\nWashington and Wall Street. Born in Duluth, Minnesota, he served in a\nsenior leadership role for a diverse group of Washington politicians, from\nRepresentatives Tony Coehlo and Tom Foley to, as chief of staff, Mickey\nKantor, Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s U.S. trade representative. He worked at Fannie Mae\nfor six years, ran Joe Lieberman\xe2\x80\x99s 2000 vice-presidential campaign and\nserved a brief stint as CEO of Burson Marsteller, the public relations firm.\n\n\n\nIn 2001, Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack took Nides under his wing. When Mack\nwas named CEO of Credit Suisse, Nides went along with him as chief\nadministrative officer. When Mack returned to Morgan Stanley as CEO in\n2005, Nides accompanied him again as chief operating officer and then\nstayed another year serving in the same role for James Gorman. Then Nides\nreturned to Washington to work for then-Secretary Clinton at the State\nDepartment, replacing Jack Lew, who became head of the Office of Management\nand Budget. Many thought Nides\xe2\x80\x99 time at Morgan Stanley was over, especially\nwith Mack\xe2\x80\x99s retirement at the end of 2011. But Gorman\xe2\x80\x94also a Hillary\nsupporter\xe2\x80\x94surprised people by bringing Nides back to the firm as a\nvice-chairman.\n\n\n\nNow Nides is the first stop in New York for many a visiting dignitary and\nfor those ambitious Wall Street types hoping to get access to Clinton.\nNides declined to comment on the record, as did other Wall Street\nexecutives with whom Clinton is said to confer, among them Blair Effron,\none of the three founders of Centerview Partners, an investment banking\nboutique, and Marc Lasry, the founder of Avenue Capital, a New York hedge\nfund, who was almost named Obama\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador to France.\n\n\n\nBut Greg Fleming, Nides\xe2\x80\x99 partner at Morgan Stanley and the president of\nMorgan Stanley Wealth and Investment Management, was pleased to discuss his\nenthusiastic support for Clinton. He says that the \xe2\x80\x9cbroad perception\xe2\x80\x9d\nacross Wall Street, among both Democrats and Republicans, is that she,\n\xe2\x80\x9clike her husband, will govern from the center, and work to get things\ndone, and be capable of garnering support across different groups,\nincluding working with Republicans.\xe2\x80\x9d He agreed that, as a former senator\nfrom New York, Clinton is trusted by Wall Street and will tackle issues,\nsuch as fiscal and tax reform, that have been long neglected thanks to the\nintractable polarization that rules Washington these days. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will be\ntrying to govern from the center with a problem-solving bent like her\nhusband,\xe2\x80\x9d Fleming says.\n\n\n\nBeyond that, Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x94and the Clintons generally\xe2\x80\x94have always courted\nWall Street assiduously and without apology. In June, the biggest donors to\nthe Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation met with the Clintons at\nGoldman Sachs\xe2\x80\x99 headquarters in lower Manhattan for a day-long discussion\nabout the foundation\xe2\x80\x99s goals. Goldman has donated hundreds of thousands of\ndollars to the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 foundation, and in October 2013, Hillary Clinton\ngave two speeches at Goldman. Her usual speaking fee is $200,000, and\nGoldman is known to be a full payer on the speaking circuit. Goldman is\nhardly alone\xe2\x80\x94Clinton is popular in the financial industry: In 2013, she\nalso gave speeches to KKR and the Carlyle Group, two private-equity\nbehemoths.\n\n\n\nWall Street does not seem to be the slightest bit shy about coming out for\nHillary\xe2\x80\x94and are now contributing their money to prove it. While Priorities\nUSA Action, a super PAC dedicated to getting Clinton elected in 2016, does\nnot have any Wall Street banks among its top 50 donors to date, there have\nbeen large contributions from wealthy hedge funds, such as Renaissance\nTechnologies, which has donated $4 million (the largest single\ncontribution); D.E. Shaw, which has donated $1.375 million; Khosla Ventures\nand Soros Fund Management, which have each donated $1 million; and\nRipplewood Holdings, a private equity firm, which contributed $400,000.\nThere are many Wall Street financiers who have donated $25,000\xe2\x80\x94by design,\nthe maximum contribution\xe2\x80\x94to the Ready for Hillary superPAC.\n\n\n\nGoldman is an interesting case study. As in nearly every other way, it has\nalways been careful to hedge its bets where electoral politics is\nconcerned. Historically, although trending Democratic, Goldman employees\nhave managed to give nearly equally to both parties in presidential\nelections. And a lot of it: Since 1990, Goldman\xe2\x80\x99s employees have given $47\nmillion to political candidates and various political action\ncommittees\xe2\x80\x94more than any other single group of company employees. But that\ncalculus changed dramatically in 2008 when Goldman employees gave about $1\nmillion to Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign, according to the Center\nfor Responsive Politics, second only to that given to Obama by the\nemployees of the University of California, who donated nearly $1.8 million.\nBy contrast, Goldman employees gave only $235,000 to Senator John McCain,\nthe Republican Party nominee.\n\n\n\nBy 2009 the bloom was off the rose. In an interview with 60 Minutes, Obama\nnot only referred to Wall Street as the \xe2\x80\x9cfat cat bankers\xe2\x80\x9d but also blamed\nWall Street for causing the financial crisis. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople on Wall Street still\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t get it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. In July 2010, just weeks after a much-vilified\nGoldman agreed to pay a $550 million fine to the Securities and Exchange\nCommission\xe2\x80\x94then the largest fine ever\xe2\x80\x94to settle charges stemming from\nGoldman\xe2\x80\x99s underwriting and selling of a synthetic collateralized debt\nobligation, the details about which the SEC believed Goldman had failed to\nproperly disclose to investors, Obama joked at the White House\nCorrespondents Dinner: \xe2\x80\x9cAll of the jokes here tonight are brought to you by\nour friends at Goldman Sachs. So you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry\xe2\x80\x94they make money\nwhether you laugh or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBy 2012, in an historic turnaround, Goldman went full force for Romney.\nAccording to the Center for Responsive Politics, Goldman employees gave\n$1.2 million to the Republican National Committee and another $1 million or\nso to Romney directly. By contrast, Obama received a mere $210,000 from\nGoldman employees (who also gave $493,000 to the Democratic National\nCommittee). \xe2\x80\x9cIn the four decades since Congress created the\ncampaign-finance system, no company\xe2\x80\x99s employees have switched sides so\nabruptly, moving from top supporters of one camp to the top of its rival,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe Wall Street Journal observed. So far this year, Goldman remains a\nRepublican shop. Some 63 percent of the firm\xe2\x80\x99s political contributions, or\n$1.75 million, has gone to support Republican candidates.\n\n\n\nThat will change if Clinton decides to run. For starters, as the former\nU.S. senator from New York, she is well known to many of Goldman\xe2\x80\x99s leaders.\nThey have seen her at numerous Goldman events over the years or at\nfundraisers in the Hamptons. Blankfein ran into the Clintons in August at a\nparty in the Hamptons at Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein\xe2\x80\x99s house, and\nthere are the many pictures of Blankfein smiling broadly at her side during\nSeptember\xe2\x80\x99s Clinton Global Initiative in New York. A few weeks later, they\nspent time together at a dinner celebrating the Goldman Sachs \xe2\x80\x9c10,000 Women\nInitiative,\xe2\x80\x9d a Goldman-funded training and education program for female\nentrepreneurs.\n\n\n\nMany Goldman employees, especially women, are also excited about the\nhistoric potential of the 2016 presidential election since Clinton could\nbecome the first female president. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not going to reflexively\nsupport any woman, but she\xe2\x80\x99s a woman that seems more or less in sync with\nthe way they think about the world,\xe2\x80\x9d says another former Clinton\nadministration official who now works on Wall Street. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she\xe2\x80\x99s\nsuccessful, and they just like her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMore significant, the 10,000 Women Initiative was designed by Clinton\noperatives and is being implemented at Goldman by people who still have\nclose ties to her. For instance, Goldman paid Gene Sperling, a longtime\nWashington insider who was director of the National Economic Council under\nboth Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, nearly $900,000 in 2008 for his help in\ncreating the 10,000 Women Initiative. Noa Meyer, who runs the program at\nGoldman, once wrote speeches for Hillary Clinton when she was First Lady.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole idea to spend money on women and women\xe2\x80\x99s education in developing\ncountries came straight out of her playbook,\xe2\x80\x9d says someone familiar with\nthe origins of the 10,000 Women Initiative. \xe2\x80\x9cThe same people who got her\ninterested in that issue are the people who \xe2\x80\xa6design[ed] the program.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOf course, the ties between Goldman Sachs and Washington run deep, very\ndeep, and many analysts have argued that the broad deregulatory moves\npushed by former Goldman senior partner Robert Rubin\xe2\x80\x94who later became Bill\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s National Economic Council director and then Treasury\nsecretary\xe2\x80\x94were a major part of the process that led to the subprime\nmortgage disaster. But Rubin was only among the latest in a long line of\nGoldman executives who went to Washington and helped create the\ntalent-and-ideas nexus that later became derisively known as \xe2\x80\x9cGovernment\nSachs.\xe2\x80\x9d Sidney Weinberg, the longtime senior partner at Goldman Sachs in\nthe 20th century, was a confidante of Franklin D. Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s who enticed\nhim to Washington on several occasions before, during and after World War\nII. In 1938, Roosevelt offered Weinberg the position of ambassador to the\nSoviet Union, but Weinberg thought better of it because he did not speak\nRussian, was a Jew from Brooklyn and didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave Goldman. In\nNovember 1943, FDR did succeed in enlisting Weinberg to go to the Soviet\nUnion \xe2\x80\x9copenly\xe2\x80\x9d as a representative of the Office of Strategic Services\xe2\x80\x94the\npredecessor of the CIA\xe2\x80\x94although what he did there and for how long has been\nlost to history.\n\n\n\nIn 1968, Henry Fowler joined Goldman Sachs as a partner, and thus became\nthe first former Treasury secretary to spin the revolving door and land a\nWall Street job. John Whitehead, who was the co-senior partner of Goldman\nSachs in the 1970s and the early 1980s, became deputy secretary of state in\nthe second Reagan Administration, after he retired from the firm. John F.\nW. Rogers, a former close Reagan advisor, has been the longtime consigliore\nat Goldman and oversees both the global communications and government\nrelations departments. Rubin, who had befriended Fowler during his time at\nGoldman and who went on to run Goldman Sachs in the 1980s, along with Steve\nFriedman, left Goldman in January 1991 to join the Clinton administration.\nIn 1995, he succeeded Lloyd Bentsen as Treasury secretary. Friedman,\nmeanwhile, became chairman of the National Economic Council under George W.\nBush, and, of course, Hank Paulson, the former CEO of Goldman, was Bush\xe2\x80\x99s\nTreasury secretary during the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008.\n\n\n\nRubin, apparently, is not content to go gracefully into the good night when\nit comes to wielding power, and lingering questions about his continued\ninfluence inside the Clinton camp are at the center of an issue that is\nlikely to dog Hillary through 2016. From his perches as co-chairman of the\nCouncil on Foreign Relations and as a founder of the Hamilton Project at\nthe Brookings Institution, Rubin\xe2\x80\x94long considered a Washington\nkingmaker\xe2\x80\x94continues to cast his spell on the Obama administration, which\nhas been, and continues to be, chock full of appointees with close ties to\nhim, including Tim Geithner, Larry Summers, Peter Orszag, Gene Sperling,\nJason Furman, Jack Lew, Michael Froman and Sylvia Matthews Burwell. While\nRubin\xe2\x80\x99s reach is both unprecedented and stunning, it remains to be seen\nwhether he is able to work his magic and position Blankfein into an\nimportant role in a Hillary Clinton administration, should there be one and\nif he aspires to such a thing.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nAll of which raise the most pertinent question of all: rhetoric and\nfundraising aside, where does Clinton really stand on Wall Street? If she\nbecomes president, is she going to side with the Rubinites\xe2\x80\x94or has she come\nto realize, as even her husband apparently has, having conceded in remarks\nthat he naively supported too much deregulation, that Wall Street must be\ncarefully watched and kept at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length?\n\n\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s been fairly cagey about this issue, eager to assuage both sides.\nWhere Obama blamed Wall Street\xe2\x80\x94not inaccurately\xe2\x80\x94for behavior that caused\nthe 2008 financial crisis and championed new Wall Street regulations like\nthe Volcker Rule and the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that really stick in the craw\nof money men\xe2\x80\x94all while presiding over a veritable profit boon for the\nfinancial industry\xe2\x80\x94Clinton said hardly a word on the topic of Wall Street\nshenanigans.\n\n\n\nHer nascent populism has only appeared in the last year or so, as the\nElizabeth Warren movement took off. For instance, in a speech at the\nprogressive New America Foundation, she spoke about the dangers of the\ngrowing inequality in the country. \xe2\x80\x9cAmericans are working harder,\ncontributing more than ever to their companies\xe2\x80\x99 bottom lines and to our\ncountry\xe2\x80\x99s total economic output, and yet many are still barely getting by,\nbarely holding on, not seeing the rewards that they believe their hard work\nshould have merited,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd where\xe2\x80\x99s it all going? Well, economists\nhave documented how the share of income and wealth going to those at the\nvery top\xe2\x80\x94not just the top one percent, but the top one-tenth percent or the\ntop-hundredth percent of the population\xe2\x80\x94has risen sharply over the last\ngeneration. Some are calling it a throwback to the Gilded Age of the Robber\nBarons.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe also lamented how government regulators had \xe2\x80\x9cneglected their oversight\xe2\x80\x9d\nof Wall Street and \xe2\x80\x9callowed the evolution of an entire shadow banking\nsystem that operated without accountability.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAsked about these issues, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman Nick Merrill is quick to\npoint out times she has called for more regulation\xe2\x80\x94an eagerness that\nunderscores how the Clinton operation wants to appear populist even as it\ncollects the Wall Street money. Merrill noted that back in March 2008, as a\npresidential candidate, she called for \xe2\x80\x9cmuch more vigorous government\noversight and enforcement of the subprime mortgage market.\xe2\x80\x9d He also said\nthat she staked out positions, in the year or so before the financial\ncrisis hit, on reducing or eliminating the carried interest of private\nequity partners being taxed at capital gains rates; on a financial\ntransaction tax; and on repatriating overseas income by U.S. corporations.\nIn a 2007 press release from her campaign, for example, Clinton declared:\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur tax code should be valuing hard work and helping middle class and\nworking families get ahead. It offends our values as a nation when an\ninvestment manager making $50 million can pay a lower tax rate on her\nearned income than a teacher making $50,000 pays on her income. As\npresident I will reform our tax code to ensure that the carried interest\nearned by some multi-millionaire Wall Street managers is recognized for\nwhat it is: ordinary income that should be taxed at ordinary income tax\nrates.\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said she would use the funds generated by the tax\nchange\xe2\x80\x94which some have estimated at $4 to $6 billion per year\xe2\x80\x94to invest in\nmiddle-class and working families.\n\n\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no question, when and if she decides to run, that she\xe2\x80\x99s going to\nhave an incredible support foundation from Wall Street.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nYet all of these efforts seem at best a combination of campaign trail\nrhetoric or minor tweaks around the edges\xe2\x80\x94rather than the wholesale change\nthat an Elizabeth Warren-type populist would want to impose on the\nfinancial industry.\n\n\n\nProbably the best answer to the question of what Clinton will do to Wall\nStreet comes from Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s own support of her. Wall Street executives,\nbankers and traders have already shown their hand in support of the two\nClintons individually as well as of the causes they care about most\ndeeply\xe2\x80\x94money they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t contribute if they thought her political future\nwould be detrimental to their economic future. And, in return, one thing we\nknow about the Clintons: They value loyalty profoundly. They are unlikely\nto turn their backs on the banks, especially since it seems highly unlikely\nthat Warren will mount the kind of outsider challenge to Hillary in 2016\nthat Barack Obama did in 2008. Instead, Clinton will find ways to work with\nWall Street on issues it cares about, rather than vilifying it for\npolitical gain.\n\n\n\nDemocratic pollster Douglas Schoen says that Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s hope is that she can\nuse supposed slips like the one in Boston to appeal just enough to the\nliberal wing of the Democratic party to ward off Warren, who offers a \xe2\x80\x9cfar\nmore resonant message with the Democratic base than Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d Without a\nstrong national ground organization and a strong financial network,\nWarren\xe2\x80\x99s message alone won\xe2\x80\x99t get her very far, but the Clintons want to\navoid repeating the mistakes of 2008, when an idealism-based campaign\nderailed her inevitability campaign.\n\n\n\nShe will also have much of her former opponent\xe2\x80\x99s network behind her again\nin 2016. Robert Wolf, the former president of UBS\xe2\x80\x99 investment bank who now\nhas his own advisory boutique, 32 Advisors, has long been described as\nObama\xe2\x80\x99s BFF (Best Friend in Finance), and although he has little direct\ninvolvement with Clinton or her campaign team, he plans to support her\nfully when the time comes. He is one of the hosts of a December 16 gala in\nNew York City where she will be honored. By his rough calculus, six in 10\nWall Street types are Democrats, three are Republicans and just one is\nindependent.

Bernie Sanders, who says he is seriously\nconsidering a presidential run as a Democrat, has hired veteran Democratic\nstrategist Tad Devine, while the group trying to draft Sen. Elizabeth\nWarren is also staffing up.\n\n\n\nWith a career in presidential politics stretching more than three decades,\nDevine is highly respected in Democratic political circles. His involvement\nwith Sanders will instantly lend credibility to the progressive senator,\nwho has sometimes struggled to be taken seriously as a viable national\ncandidate.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe he could deliver an enormously powerful message that the country\nis waiting to hear right now and do it in a way that succeeds,\xe2\x80\x9d Devine told\nThe Washington Post. Devine played senior roles in Al Gore and John Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s\npresidential campaigns, as well as those of 17 winning Senate races.\n\n\n\nSanders and his message of \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical revolution\xe2\x80\x9d have been well received\non recent trips to New Hampshire and Iowa, both key early presidential\nstates. And some Clinton allies fear he could find a following on the left.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn terms of fundraising, there would be real interest in him at the\ngrassroots level,\xe2\x80\x9d Devine told the Post. \xe2\x80\x9cHe knows how to do the organizing\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s required. As a mass media person, I also think he would be a great\ntelevision candidate. He can connect on that level.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Ready for Warren announced Monday that it had hired a deputy\ncampaign manager to help run its day-to-day operations. Kate\nAlbright-Hanna, who is also an Emmy-award winning documentary filmmaker,\nworked with Ready for Warren founder Erica Sagrans on Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 2008\ncampaign. This year, she served as communications director for Zephyr\nTeachout, who mounted a surprisingly competitive Democratic primary\ncampaign against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The group is also in the\nprocess of hiring several field directors in key states. Warren has\nrepeatedly said she is not running.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, former Virginia senator Jim Webb, an anti-war moderate,\nis more seriously considering a run that previously disclosed. \xe2\x80\x9cI do\nbelieve that I have the leadership and the experience and the sense of\nhistory and the kinds of ideas where I could lead this country,\xe2\x80\x9d he told\nThe New Yorker\xe2\x80\x99s Ryan Lizza for a profile of the Democratic field published\nMonday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re just going to go out and put things on the table in the next\nfour or five months and see if people support us. And if it looks viable,\nthen we\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd then there\xe2\x80\x99s Maryland Gov. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, who has the most complete\ninfrastructure in place of anyone not named Clinton, but now to has figure\nout whether or not to dismantle it after the election. His political action\ncommittee dispatched 32 staffers to help Democrats in key states, and now\nhas to decide how many to keep. Many of the staffers were fairly junior,\nbut earned positive reviews from Iowa Democrats. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley was seen as\ndamaged by the loss of lieutenant governor Anthony Brown in last week\xe2\x80\x99s\nrace to replace him in the Maryland statehouse.\n\n\n\nClinton still has an enormous lead in early public opinion surveys, and\nallies think her party\xe2\x80\x99s drubbing last week will encourage Democrats to\nrally around Clinton and help clarify her message against a Republican\nCongress. At the same time, many Democrats, especially in early states, say\nthey want to see a vigorous primary campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*New Republic: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary\'s Going to Have a Primary After All, and She Should\nBe Grateful\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120237/facing-hillary-clinton-jim-webb-bernie-sanders-and-martin-omalley>*\n\n\n\nBy Danny Vinik\n\nNovember 11, 2014\n\n\n\nWith the midterms over, political operatives and professional pundits are\nquickly turning their attention to the 2016 presidential election. Their\ninterest, though, is unbalanced, focused on the wide-open Republican field.\nMany don\xe2\x80\x99t expect a competitive Democratic primary. Will anyone even\nchallenge Hillary Clinton? Some Democrats worry Clinton\'s supposed\ninevitability will come across as arrogance. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\'s an enormously capable\ncandidate and leader,\xe2\x80\x9d Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick told CNN in\nMay. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I do worry about the inevitability thing, because I think it\'s\noff-putting to the average voter."\n\n\n\nIt is appearing more and more likely, however, that Clinton will face\nprimary opponents. In fact, three potential candidates\xe2\x80\x94Senator Bernie\nSanders, former Senator Jim Webb and Maryland Governor Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x94have\nall signaled they will seek the Democratic nomination.\n\n\n\nOf the three potential candidates, Sanders seems most serious about running\nfor president. The clearest sign came Tuesday when Tad Devine, a major\nDemocratic consultant who worked closely with Al Gore, John Kerry, and\nMichael Dukakis, said that he would work with Sanders. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he runs, I\xe2\x80\x99m\ngoing to help him,\xe2\x80\x9d Devine told the Washington Post. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not only a\nlongtime client but a friend. I believe he could deliver an enormously\npowerful message that the country is waiting to hear right now and do it in\na way that succeeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSanders, who is a socialist, has been a vocal critic of President Obama and\nthe Democratic Party for failing to go after Wall Street and being too\nclose to big-money interests. He believes Clinton is no different, and this\nhas made him consider a presidential run. On Saturday, he appeared on\nC-SPAN\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cNewsmakers\xe2\x80\x9d and talked about a potential campaign as well. "If\nthere is not that support, I will not run,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to run a good\ncampaign and a meaningful campaign and a winning campaign. If I can\'t do\nthat, I\'m not interested in running."\n\n\n\nRyan Lizza documents Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to challenging the Democratic\nParty in a new piece for The New Yorker focusing on Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s supposed\ninevitability. Lizza does not assess whether Clinton is actually\ninevitable. Instead, he describes how O\xe2\x80\x99Malley and Webb, along with\nSanders, are both positioning themselves for presidential campaigns. For\ninstance, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley spent time in Iowa campaigning for Democratic\ngubernatorial candidate Jack Hatch. Hatch lost by nearly 22 points, but\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley still used the campaign to introduce himself to Iowa voters. On\nSunday, the Washington Post reported that O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, whose term is up in\nJanuary, sent 32 staffers to battleground states across the country during\nthe midterms\xe2\x80\x94another sign he is thinking about 2016.\n\n\n\nWebb has done the least to prepare for a presidential run, but he is\ncertainly flirting with the idea. \xe2\x80\x9cI do believe that I have the leadership\nand the experience and the sense of history and the kinds of ideas where I\ncould lead this country,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Lizza. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re just going to go out and\nput things on the table in the next four or five months and see if people\nsupport us. And if it looks viable, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\xe2\x80\x9d He travelled to New\nHampshire in October to discuss his memoir, a chance to introduce himself\nto voters in the pivotal state.\n\n\n\nAll three of these campaigns are in their infancy but there\xe2\x80\x99s a very good\nchance that at least one\xe2\x80\x94and possibly several\xe2\x80\x94of them will run. Each would\nlikely challenge Clinton from the left on economic issues, attempting to\ntie her to Wall Street. Webb and Sanders have also been critical of her on\nforeign policy issues such as the interventions in Libya and Syria. In\naddition, there\xe2\x80\x99s always the chance that Vice President Joe Biden or\nSenator Elizabeth Warren enter the race as well.\n\n\n\nCan any of them derail Clinton as Obama did in 2008? Unlikely. Clinton is\neven better positioned now to ward off Democratic challengers than she was\nsix years ago. But at the very least, a Sanders, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, or Webb campaign\nwill force Clinton to defend her record and persuade primary voters that\nher agenda is best for the country. She may still be the inevitable\ncandidate. But at least she\xe2\x80\x99ll be prepared as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Hill blog: Ballot Box: \xe2\x80\x9cBill Clinton: Hillary \'happy as a clam\' even\nwithout run\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/223655-bill-clinton-hillary-happy-as-a-clam-even-without-run>*\n\n\n\nBy Peter Sullivan\n\nNovember 11, 2014, 1:28 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nFormer President Clinton says that Hillary Clinton would be "happy as a\nclam" even without running for president in 2016.\n\n\n\nAppearing on the "Ellen DeGeneres Show" in a segment airing Tuesday,\nDeGeneres jokingly presented Clinton with two baby\'s onesies. One said "My\ngrandma\'s running for president in 2016" and the other read "My grandma\'s a\nstay-at-home granny."\n\n\n\n"If I pick that one, it would be best for the country," Clinton said,\npointing at the 2016 onesie.\n\n\n\nPointing at the "granny" onesie, he said "If I pick that one, she would be\nhappy as a clam and so would I."\n\n\n\n"So keep \'em both and give her the right one when she decides," he said.\n\n\n\nThe Clintons\' granddaughter, Charlotte, was born in September, and Hillary\nClinton has made clear in her speeches since then how much she values being\na grandmother.\n\n\n\nWhen DeGeneres joked that Clinton was going to make a "big announcement"\nabout his wife, Clinton replied, "She\'s the happiest grandmother."\n\n\n\n"I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s going to do, that\xe2\x80\x99s the truth," Clinton said,\nas he has said before. "If I did I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know."\n\n\n\nClinton pointed to a program at the Clinton Foundation to encourage parents\nto read to their children to boost development. "Whatever she wants to do\nI\xe2\x80\x99m for, she\xe2\x80\x99s the ablest public servant I ever worked with, but I\xe2\x80\x99m more\ninterested, now that I have a granddaughter, than I ever have been in this\nproject she and Chelsea started at our foundation called Too Small to\nFail," Clinton said.\n\n\n\nDespite these comments, Hillary Clinton is seen as all but certain to run.\nShe has campaigned across the country for Democrats, including trips to\nIowa and New Hampshire, and there have been several reports of strategy\nmeetings lining up a campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Mediaite: \xe2\x80\x9cFox\xe2\x80\x99s Cavuto Hammers Rand Paul for \xe2\x80\x98Condescending Swipe\xe2\x80\x99 at\nHillary\xe2\x80\x99s Age\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.mediaite.com/tv/foxs-cavuto-hammers-rand-paul-for-condescending-swipe-at-hillarys-age/>*\n\n\n\nBy Josh Feldman\n\nNovember 11, 2014, 5:36 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nFox\xe2\x80\x99s Neil Cavuto scolded Senator Rand Paul today for his \xe2\x80\x9ccondescending\nswipe\xe2\x80\x9d at Hillary Clinton for maybe being too old to be president. Paul\nsaid yesterday that Hillary might not be ready for the \xe2\x80\x9crigorous physical\nordeal\xe2\x80\x9d of a presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nWell, Cavuto thought that was a pretty cheap shot, worse than Chris\nChristie shouting at someone to \xe2\x80\x9cshut up.\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed out that Ronald\nReagan was 69 on inauguration day, as Clinton would be, and no Republican\nwould say he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t up to the job.\n\n\n\nAnd just to stick the knife in a little further, Cavuto invoked Paul\xe2\x80\x99s\nfather, who happens to be a couple of years older than Clinton.

There was an ebbing, an ebb tide, for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAs for whether she would consider stepping down as minority leader, Pelosi\nsaid she\xe2\x80\x99s needed now more than ever.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite frankly, if we would have won, I would have thought about leaving,\xe2\x80\x9d\nPelosi declared, a remark that will likely surprise both admirers and\ndetractors.\n\n\n\nPelosi\xe2\x80\x99s take on the midterms is this: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a Republican wave, her\nparty\xe2\x80\x99s message is fine and while President Barack Obama thinks Democrats\nneed to play better politics, she believes Democrats just need to better\nengage voters.\n\n\n\nAs Pelosi prepares to run for another term as House minority leader, a\nposition she\xe2\x80\x99s expected to win unchallenged next week, the powerful\nCalifornian is unrepentant about a brutal election night.\n\n\n\nSeated in her Capitol Hill office on Friday, the 74-year-old Pelosi offered\nher thoughts on the state of her caucus in a Republican-controlled\nCongress, revealing a leader who is standing by her principles, policies\nand strategies.\n\n\n\n>From plans to harness her power among fellow Democrats to keep her job as\nminority leader, to digging in on Obamacare and the party\xe2\x80\x99s economic\nmessaging, Pelosi is setting up her party to fight to take back the House\nin 2016 on similar grounds as this year, apparently without a dramatic\nshakeup of the Democratic leadership team.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s always time for fresh leadership, but my members have asked me to\nstay,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they want me to stay, I stay. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t want me to\nstay, I won\xe2\x80\x99t stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSome of this is the spin that any party leader uses. Some of it is vintage\nPelosi \xe2\x80\x94 she shrugs off defeats as lessons learned, and never overplays her\nvictories. She is an experienced enough pol to know that both happen\nroutinely in a political career that has spanned nearly four decades.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s also a reflection of her own power inside the House Democratic Caucus.\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s built loyalty around her incredible fundraising prowess, raising more\nmoney than anyone else for House Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 $65 million for the Democratic\nCongressional Campaign Committee and another $35 million for members this\ncycle alone, her office said. She hit 750 fundraisers and events in the\npast two years, spending 200 days on the road this year raising money.\n\n\n\nDemocrats don\xe2\x80\x99t often rebuke her publicly, but since the election, a number\nof younger members and staffers have begun to say privately it\xe2\x80\x99s time for\nnew blood in leadership to energize the party ahead of the 2016 elections \xe2\x80\x94\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t want Pelosi gone but want her to cast a wider net within the\nparty for advice.\n\n\n\nOn a conference call with members last Thursday, just two days after the\nelection, Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) said Democrats need to \xe2\x80\x9crethink\xe2\x80\x9d\ntheir message after a number of young people voted for Sen.-elect Cory\nGardner, a Republican, over Sen. Mark Udall, a Democrat.\n\n\n\nPelosi cut her off, sources on the call said.\n\n\n\nOther Democratic aides and insiders have grumbled privately, too, that they\nwant more dramatic moves on the policy and messaging front.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a party, we need to change,\xe2\x80\x9d a senior Democratic aide said. \xe2\x80\x9c[Voters]\nlike our policies. All this leftie [talk], the country likes, but somehow\nthe message about us as individual members of the conference isn\xe2\x80\x99t breaking\nthrough. There is great unrest.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPelosi is giving ground that Democrats need to do a better job at bringing\nyoung people to the polls \xe2\x80\x94 suggesting that Democrats launch an aggressive\nvoter engagement drive for 2016 just one day after the election.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have to engage people in voting again. Two-thirds of the electorate did\nnot vote in this election the other night,\xe2\x80\x9d Pelosi said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s shameful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPelosi suggested the new effort has to go far beyond just registering\nlikely Democratic voters \xe2\x80\x94 the party needs to provide an \xe2\x80\x9cinspiration\xe2\x80\x9d to\nget people to the polls.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just registration. You can\xe2\x80\x99t just go up to someone and say, \xe2\x80\x98Will\nyou register to vote?\xe2\x80\x99 You have to have an inspiration. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just\nregistration, it\xe2\x80\x99s the whole engagement of it,\xe2\x80\x9d Pelosi said.\n\n\n\nOn Nov. 4, as the Election Day drubbing for Democrats unfolded, Pelosi\ngathered with a small group of supporters and staffers at Rep. Chellie\nPingree\xe2\x80\x99s (D-Maine) home on Capitol Hill to watch the results. Attendees\ndescribed the event as \xe2\x80\x9csomber\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdownbeat.\xe2\x80\x9d Congressional Campaign\nCommittee Chairman Steve Israel of New York talked about turnout and the\nparty\xe2\x80\x99s effort to defend all incumbents \xe2\x80\x94 unlike when in 2010 the DCCC had\nto cut off some vulnerable members because of stretched resources.\n\n\n\nBy the time she left the event at 11 p.m., a number of high-profile\nDemocrats in California and New York were in tight \xe2\x80\x94 and unexpected \xe2\x80\x94\nbattles for their careers.\n\n\n\nFlanked by Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.), her husband and Democratic\nstaffers, Pelosi went back to the DCCC\xe2\x80\x99s Capitol Hill headquarters. By 1\na.m., when races across the country were still turning against Democrats,\nPelosi began drafting a letter to colleagues, asking for their support as\nminority leader. At the center of her pitch was the voter engagement drive.\n\n\n\nPelosi argues that House Democrats aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting enough credit for\npreventing a total rout. Compared with losses in the Senate, the losses\namong incumbent House Democrats were better than expected, she says.\n\n\n\nShe also disputes that the White House had a \xe2\x80\x9cfailure of politics\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a term\nObama used after POLITICO\xe2\x80\x99s interview with Pelosi \xe2\x80\x94 during the midterm that\nhurt Democrats.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was a failure of his message; it was the extent of his\nsuccess. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say it in a more positive way. This president has\naccomplished many great things,\xe2\x80\x9d Pelosi said of the president. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know\nthere is always an October eclipse. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t catch a break.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nInstead, Pelosi faulted a series of international crises \xe2\x80\x94 fighting in\nUkraine, the terrorist group ISIL and the deadly outbreak of Ebola \xe2\x80\x94 for\ndistracting the media and voters from Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 economic message.\n\n\n\nPelosi\xe2\x80\x99s outlook was wildly optimistic running into the homestretch. She\ninsisted in July that Democrats were going to win 25 seats and take back\nthe House. As Congress adjourned in September, Pelosi was still claiming\nthat Democrats had a \xe2\x80\x9c60 percent\xe2\x80\x9d chance of winning the House, even when\nall the polls said the exact opposite. \xe2\x80\x9cThe momentum is coming our way,\xe2\x80\x9d\nPelosi said at the time. In private, members-only conference calls before\nNov. 4, Pelosi was predicting Democrats would break even on Election Day.\n\n\n\nPelosi isn\xe2\x80\x99t backing away from the liberal economic message that House\nDemocrats based their campaign on, such as their focus on equal pay for\nwomen and an increased minimum wage. Those messages were poll tested,\nPelosi said, and did well in districts that weren\xe2\x80\x99t distracted by\nhigher-profile statewide races.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe message that is important for everybody is financial stability \xe2\x80\xa6 our\nmessage was about that,\xe2\x80\x9d Pelosi said. \xe2\x80\x9c[It was] jump-start the middle\nclass, stop tax breaks that send jobs overseas \xe2\x80\xa6 [the idea that] when women\nsucceed, America succeeds, equal pay for equal work and investments in\neducation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDemocrats were also hit by an onslaught of outside money, Pelosi said. Even\nin the minority, the DCCC had a huge fundraising advantage over the GOP,\nbuoyed by Pelosi\xe2\x80\x99s network of deep-pocketed donors. Yet despite outraising\nthe National Republican Congressional Committee, Democrats couldn\xe2\x80\x99t compete\nwith a torrent of late spending by Republican super PACs.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe controlled the damage enormously. They were coming endlessly without\none fact. Endless money, no commitment to truth. They will say anything,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said.\n\n\n\nPelosi isn\xe2\x80\x99t nearly ready to give up on her tenure as the House Democrat\xe2\x80\x99s\ntop fundraiser and leader. The veteran lawmaker said she has no plans to\nleave or stay past 2016, but she said that to win back the House, Democrats\nwill need access to her expansive donor network.\n\n\n\nAs for leaving after a tough loss, Pelosi said she is committed to helping\nDemocrats regain the majority. In fact, Pelosi insisted that she would have\nonly considered stepping down had Democrats won the House, returning her to\nthe speaker\xe2\x80\x99s chair.\n\n\n\nMany expect her to serve until at least Obama leaves office in 2017 \xe2\x80\x94 in\npart to defend the 2010 Affordable Care Act from a Republican-led Congress.\n\n\n\nPelosi adamantly declined to say what she would do if Hillary Clinton won\nthe White House in 2016, turning into a joke about her relationship with a\npresidential front-runner.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read? I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that my lifelong dream is to serve as\nspeaker with Hillary Clinton as president. So what? My lifelong dream \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\nPelosi deadpanned.\n\n\n\nHouse Democrats remain intensely loyal to Pelosi. She\xe2\x80\x99s known for\nimpressing donors with handwritten \xe2\x80\x9cthank you\xe2\x80\x9d notes and personal phone\ncalls. Members say she pushes them not with threats or strong-arming but by\nasking them what they need from certain legislation or votes.\n\n\n\nThat bond with her rank and file explains why Pelosi has been able to stave\noff any challenge to her leadership post. It helps that no current Democrat\ncould take up her fundraising network. Pelosi has raised more than $400\nmillion since 2002.\n\n\n\nShe does it by attending roughly 750 fundraising and campaign events in the\npast two years, her office said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe would have lost more than 15 [seats] without Nancy Pelosi,\xe2\x80\x9d Israel\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s the one who raised the money that gave us the resources to\nbuild the firewall that mitigated against even worse losses.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWith Republicans in the majority in both sides of the Capitol, Pelosi now\nfaces a new Congress that will be more conservative than in the past four\nyears of just a GOP-controlled House. Already, GOP hard-liners are\ndemanding a series of votes on Republican-friendly legislation that will\nanger Democrats. Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Sen. Mitch McConnell\n(R-Ky.), poised as the next Senate majority leader, already pledged to hold\nan Obamacare repeal vote early in the new session.\n\n\n\nThe 2010 health care law is one of the cornerstones of Pelosi\xe2\x80\x99s legacy in\nthe House \xe2\x80\x94 and the California Democrat said she would remain in leadership\nto defend the law at least for another term.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m honestly here to protect the Affordable Care Act from the clutches of\n\xe2\x80\xa6 whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d Pelosi said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sec.
