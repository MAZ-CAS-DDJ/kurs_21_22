Hope you're getting at least a little rest this\nholiday season as things only get crazier from here, I'm sure.\n\nSorry to bother you just before the holiday but I'm writing a piece for the\nweekend on the eighth year of a presidency and how despite the obvious\nlame-duck issues and the legislative window narrowing considerably, it can\nstill turn out to be an eventful year.\n\nAny chance that's something you'd get on the phone with me for just a\ncouple minutes to talk about? Would love to have your voice and experience\nin the story wearing your Clinton White House hat rather than your campaign\nhat. Promise no questions about Trump.\n\nThanks so much.\n\nBest,\nPeter\n"
