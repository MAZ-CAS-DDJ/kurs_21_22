Chip in and help make Ed Markey the next U.S. Senator from Massachusetts: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=OGTc0OXdTDTNUlv1o_5Qtg\n\nJohn,\nthis weekend is the final election push for Ed Markey in the\nMassachusetts special Senate election. We are just FOUR days away from\nElection Day.\n\nHelp Ed Markey win the Massachusetts special Senate election on Tuesday! There are just four days left and thousands more Massachusetts voters to contact. Can you help? Contribute today: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=nfLp74dy9Jmf4ngwHGfrvA .\n\nWe need to raise another $35,000 by Monday to get Ed Markey the help he needs on the ground in Massachusetts. It's a door-to-door, neighbor-to-neighbor campaign right now and we need your help to win.\n\nRecent polls show Ed Markey's opponent, Gabriel Gomez within striking distance. Gomez is trying to sell himself as a new kind of politician, but he has the same old extreme positions that make him out of step in Massachusetts.\n\nEven more troubling, Gomez stands with Big Oil, opposes key actions to address climate change, and supports the dirty and dangerous Keystone XL tar sands pipeline.\n\nDonate to LCV Victory Fund. Turnout is key and we need to make sure that every Ed Markey supporter turns out on Tuesday: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=Y8Wr7fdNVHF2Sc7gw6cZSw .\n\nThis race has been a top 2013 priority for LCV Victory Fund. We've made more than 430,000 voter contacts during the primary and just last week, we launched a mail program to target 150,000 households in the state.\n\nBut it's not enough. Out of state money is expected to pour into Massachusetts this weekend. Big Oil has a lot riding on this race and they refuse to let it slip away. We can beat Gabriel Gomez, but we need your help to do it.\n\nWhether Ed Markey wins or loses next Tuesday all depends on turnout. In the Massachusetts special Senate election, a few thousand votes could mean the difference between winning and losing. I hope you will chip in right now to help LCV Victory Fund put Ed Markey over the top: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=XmQSJ41DCiTFSLWYna5bNg .\n\nAs we've said before, we need more climate champions in the U.S. Senate. We may never be able to match the amount of money that Big Oil spends to elect its cronies to Congress, but with the help of LCV Victory Fund supporters like you, we can ensure that a candidate like Ed Markey -- who champions our environmental values -- has the resources he needs to win next Tuesday.\n\nThank you for supporting Rep. Ed Markey and LCV Victory Fund.\n\nBest--\n\nGene\n\nPaid for by LCV Victory Fund, 202-785-8683, and not authorized by any\ncandidate or candidate's committee.\n\n\n\nUpdate Your Profile\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=HK9VF0TGZGR1pq6vDZIbEg\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=fWQxrVCjPlbI0id0jiFKkWLS3SrOafkX&cid=0\n\n1920 L Street, NW Suite 800\nWashington, DC 20036\n202-785-8683\n\n"
