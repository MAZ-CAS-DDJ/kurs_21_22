I told her we were still going through it.  She wanted \xe2\x80\x93 and I imagine we are already doing this \xe2\x80\x93 to make sure we are matching up dates of Jeb\xe2\x80\x99s events and travel pre-announcement with the report.  Or good project for an outside group.  But he really should have to suffer through a lot of questions on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nNOTICE: This communication may contain privileged or other confidential information.
