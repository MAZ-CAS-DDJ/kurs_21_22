john.podesta@gmail.comb'Know her?\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: <catherinehand5@aol.com>\nDate: Sunday, August 16, 2015\nSubject: Today\'s Post story on HRC\nTo: jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com, john.podesta@gmail.com\nCc: lorraine@xeolux.com\n\n\nDear Jake and John:\n\nI\'m sending this to you at the suggestion of my friend Lorraine Hariton.\nBy way of introduction, back in 1980 I helped Norman Lear create People For\nthe American Way -- even before Tony Podesta came into the picture.  I\nspent months traveling across the country with Norman meeting with so many\npeople to talk about the rise of something Norman was seeing -- the rise of\nthe Religious Right and its impact on our politics.  You know the rest.\n\nCurrently, I am one of the producers of a film adaptation of the award\nwining children\'s classic, A Wrinkle in Time, that Jennifer Lee (FROZEN) is\nscripting for Disney.  I mention this, because this book has meant a great\ndeal to millions of young people over the past 50 years.  Even Sheryl\nSandberg was quoted in the New York Times during an interview for her\nbook, *Lean\nIn*, that A Wrinkle in Time was her favorite childhood book.\n\nWrinkle was written in 1962 and received the Newberry Award for children\'s\nliterature in 1963, the year I first read it. As you will read in this\nnote, 1963 was quite a tumultuous year.  The year before, in 1962, the\nCuban missile crisis threatened the world with the possibility of nuclear\nwar.  Against a backdrop of uncertainty, death, and fear, *A Wrinkle in\nTime,* came along at a time when young people needed a way to understand\nthe changing world around them.  It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily a conscious need,\nmore a longing or yearning for a way to comprehend the evil that existed,\nand to feel comforted by a story that helped us see that it could be\novercome.  I think the need for a vision of a loving and empathetic\nuniverse is as needed today as it was 50 years ago.\n\nI\'m writing a book about my 50 year journey to make Wrinkle into a movie\nand have been doing research on the past 5 decades which moved me to write\nthis note to Lorraine this morning.\n\n\nLorraine-\n\n            Just wanted to send along a few thoughts re today\'s Post story\non HRC. First, hope you are enjoying your time in NY. The emails and phone\ncalls about the campaign are very helpful.\n\n            Something struck me in reading the Post piece that you may want\nto consider. When Hillary speaks of the email issue or other issues, her\ncounter is "politics as usual." Those very words are what contribute to the\ngeneral feeling of her tone deafness. I have no idea what is said in your\ndiscussions, but I assume lots of very smart, savvy people are thinking\nabout this problem everyday. Most people do not know what she really means\nwhen she says "politics as usual\' and it might help her if she were more\nprecise in her reply. What I mean by that is not to use words that mean\nsomething to people who follow politics, but use words that mean something\nto people who don\'t.   And, \xe2\x80\x9cpolitics as usual\xe2\x80\x99 is immediately heard as\n\xe2\x80\x9cpolitics as usual in Clinton-world.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n            Take every single opportunity she has to explain in the\nsimplest way over and over again that she represents change to a more\nconservative way of thinking and rather than talk about the need for\ninclusivity in all things for all Americans, her opponents only want to\ninstill fear about her as a person and the change she represents.\n\n            I\'ve been doing a little research on the big historical events\nover the past 50 years and it is a real awakening to take in how much\nchange this country has been dealing with ever since 1963.\n\n            Hillary\'s candidacy is an accumulation of a 50-year shift in\nattitudes and ever since the early 1970s a backlash to this change has\ntaken shape and strengthened. It\'s not a vast right wing conspiracy - it is\nreal fear of change. When she uses the words \xe2\x80\x98politics as usual\xe2\x80\x99 it only\nhelps to strengthen that backlash.\n\n            She needs to be seen and heard as someone who can lead us to a\nmore empathetic world where we can learn to actually get along with those\nwho are different than us.\n\n            Take a look at what happened in 1963:\n\nGeorge Wallace became Governor of Alabama and proclaimed \xe2\x80\x9csegregation now,\nsegregation tomorrow, and segregation forever. \xe2\x80\x9c\n\nBetty Friedan\xe2\x80\x99s  *The Feminine Mystique* launched the reawakening of the\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s movement in the United States as women\xe2\x80\x99s organizations and\nconsciousness raising groups spread.\n\n70,000 marchers arrived in London to demonstrate against nuclear weapons.\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. issued his  *Letter from Birmingham Jail*.\n\nThe US Supreme Court ruled that state-mandated Bible reading in public\nschools was unconstitutional.\n\nPope Paul VI succeeded Pope John XXIII and continued the Vatican Council\nII.  Priests were now asked to celebrate Mass in the language of the\ncountries in which they lived, face the congregation, and not only to be\nheard and seen but also to signal to worshippers that they were being\nincluded because they were a vital component of the service. No longer was\nprayer to be seen as a performance, but active participation.\n\nThe United States, United Kingdom, and Soviet Union signed a nuclear test\nban treaty.\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr delivered his *I Have A Dream* speech on the steps\nof the Lincoln Memorial to an audience of 250,000 people participating in\nthe March on Washington for Jobs and Freedoms.\n\nSouth Vietnamese President Diem was assassinated following a military coup.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c *I Want to Hold Your Hand*\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c *I Saw Her Standing There\xe2\x80\x9d* were\nreleased in the U.S., marking the beginning of Beatlemania on an\ninternational level.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy was assassinated.\n\n            And the 1970s became fertile ground for even more divisiveness:\n\nAs the protests against the Viet Nam war intensified, the backlash began to\ntake shape.  When Richard Nixon won the presidency in 1968 he dismantled\nprograms put in place by President Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s War on Poverty.  The anti-war\nprotests increased in frequency and no longer only w ere students\nprotesting, but professors, scientists, and stay at home mothers.\n\nIn response to protesters, hippies and the new drug culture, President\nNixon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98silent majority,\xe2\x80\x99 -- mostly white working and middle class voters,\nwere angry at what they saw as the destruction of a country they had known\nand loved.\n\nThe nation seemed to tear apart at the seams as America watched the live\ncoverage of the Watergate hearings.  When President Nixon finally resigned\nfrom office in 1974 the seeds of government mistrust were firmly rooted.\n\nThe women\xe2\x80\x99s rights movement took hold when Congress approved the Equal\nRights Amendment (ERA) to the Constitution in 1972.  Twenty-two of the\nnecessary 38 states ratified with no difficulty, but the conservative\nfaction in the country saw it as a threat to the traditional role of wife\nand mother and successfully fought back and defeated it.\n\n            The 1980s were a difficult period for Democrats. I remember\nhelping to mount the Democratic convention in 1984 and standing on the\npodium that last night looking at a sea of waving American flags, excited\nthat the first woman had been nominated for Vice President, inspired by\nMario Cuomo\'s speech about the "two cities on a hill" and all I could think\nabout was my dog. I didn\'t believe in any of it anymore. Reagan had done a\ngreat job of making the word liberal sound like a dirty word. Few Democrats\nhad passion back then- we were so splintered and couldn\'t get along which\nlead to the creation of Democratic Leadership Forum and the eventual rise\nof Bill Clinton in 1992.\n\n            Hillary is the embodiment of the changes that have been\nbubbling up since 1963. She is a woman embracing the need to include\neveryone at the table. But, she is falling into a trap that started in the\n80s -- demonizing her opponent. That happened back in the 80s to raise\nfunds. Direct mail campaigns for Dems, Republicans, and special interests\ngroups had to demonize their opponents to fan the flames of fear to\nsurvive.\n\n            What Bernie Sanders represents is someone who doesn\'t seem to\nbe caught in that demonizing cycle. There has to be a way for Hillary to\nrise above it, too, with humor, compassion and empathy.  She needs new\ntactics, a new strategy and to breakaway fro m how she handled her\nadversaries in the past.  She most likely first developed her deep distrust\nof conservative operatives in her formative years working as a lawyer\nduring the Watergate hearings.  That mistrust of Nixon and his associates\nleft a lasting scar on so many of us. But, we need to move passed it.\n\n            Stephen Hawking said something recently that might help ground\na new strategy:\n\n            \xe2\x80\x9cThe human failing I would most like to correct is aggression.\nIt may have had survival advantage in caveman days, to get more food,\nterritory or a partner with whom to reproduce, but now it threatens to\ndestroy us all. We need to replace aggression with empathy, which \xe2\x80\x9cbrings\nus together in a peaceful loving state.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n            Hillary needs to be President of the United States to act upon\nHawking\xe2\x80\x99s insight and her ability to lead must start with a new kind of\ncampaign.\n\nCatherine\n'
