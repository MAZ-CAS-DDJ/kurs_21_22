Most important is a request from comms for\nyou to go on *Andrea Mitchell tomorrow at NOON*. I've outlined those\npotential logistics below, so you can get a sense of how it would work.\n\nI have a few other items for the rest of the week as well. I'll be around\non my cell, whenever you have a second.\n\n_____\n\n*COMMS REQ: Andrea Mitchell Tomorrow, 12:00 PM ET*\n\nJen has asked if you would be available to go on Andrea Mitchell--tomorrow\nat 12:00 PM. You would do the hit between your meetings with Addisu\nDemissie and Bobby Stein. Addisu can move your meeting up from 11:00 to\n10:30 AM to give you a full 2 hours between the two meetings.\n\nThe show would provide a car to drive you roundtrip from Perkins Coie to\nAndrea's studio (4001 Nebraska Ave NW).\n\n*Here's the tick-tock of what those movements would look like:*\n\n9:45     Prep Call *(w/ Jen, Fallon, Reynolds, Tony, Schake, Sara)*\n10:15\n\n10:30    Addisu Demissie Meeting [Perkins Coie]\n11:00    *Suggestion: he could meet you at CAP and walk over to Perkins*\n\n11:00    Car Pickup & Drive to Andrea\n11:30    *(10 minute buffer)*\n\n11:45    Studio Prep\n\n12:00    HIT TIME\n\n12:15    Car Pickup & Drive back to Perkins Coie\n\n1:00      Bobby Stein Meeting [Perkins Coie]\n1:45\n\n\n-- \nMilia Fisher\nSpecial Assistant to the Chair\nHillary for America\nmfisher@hillaryclinton.com\nc: 858.395.1741\n"
