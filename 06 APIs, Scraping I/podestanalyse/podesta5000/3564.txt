john.podesta@gmail.comb"Hi all \x96 We wanted to give you some updates on recent events, Foundation work, and announcements in the news this week.\n\nRefinery29 partners with CGI U for Mental Health Week\nThis week, Refinery29 announced<https://twitter.com/Refinery29/status/704754388150013954> its partnership with CGI to discuss the topic of mental health during the CGI U 2016 meeting. The partnership includes a co-hosted breakout session moderated by their Health & Wellness Director, Anna Maltby, which will be covered on Refinery29 as part of a larger Mental Health Week feature. Content will include profiles on CGI U participants as well as articles on key topics covered during the session.\n\n            refinery29 \xfe@Refinery29  March 1\nWe\x92ve teamed up with @ClintonGlobal<https://twitter.com/ClintonGlobal> to fight the stigmas around mental health at the 2016 @CGIU<https://twitter.com/CGIU> meeting: http://bit.ly/1REg4BG <https://t.co/FWwaVIiJlc>  #CGIU<https://twitter.com/hashtag/CGIU?src=hash>\n\nShare the announcement on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/CGIU/status/704769806906597376\n\n\nHow CHMI is working to combat the prescription opioid epidemic\nThe Spring Issue of the Magazine for the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health<http://magazine.jhsph.edu/2016/spring/forum/the-exchange-a-different-lens/index.html> includes a Q&A with Clinton Health Matters Initiative CEO Rain Henderson. Rain discusses the prescription opioid epidemic and ways to reduce opioid-related tragedies.\n\n\x93We know that substance misuse is a huge and growing epidemic, and we see it just undercutting people\x92s economic prosperity, their mental health and well-being, and the ability for families to thrive. So we were watching the trends and seeing the data, and then simultaneously President Clinton knew three young people (whom he\x92d known since they were very small) who suffered from accidental overdose. It compelled us to look much more closely at the issue.\x94\n\n\nVirtual reality films and \x93changing hearts and minds\x94\nA piece in WIRED<http://www.wired.com/2016/03/virtual-reality-social-change-fundraising/> discusses how virtual reality technology can be a tool for charities to tell stories and change hearts and minds. The piece uses the Clinton Global Initiative\x92s \x93Inside Impact: East Africa<https://www.facebook.com/clintonglobalinitiative/videos/10153250212525318/>\x94 virtual reality film as an example and includes a video<https://vimeo.com/140688208> of President Clinton introducing it at the 2015 CGI Annual Meeting.\n\n\x93And last year the Clinton Foundation produced a VR series with Felix & Paul Studios that followed President Clinton visiting Africa on behalf of the Clinton Global Initiative.\n\nAccording to Bryan Mochizuki, a CGI marketing director who was behind the organization\x92s use of VR, the reaction to the experience was unlike anything he\x92d ever seen from just showing photos, videos, or statistics. \x91Here you see the interweaving of an issue, a public that wants to take action but needs to be informed, and media,\x92 he says. \x91If you look at that formula with VR as the third piece, then VR has the highest ceiling in terms of how well people can actually understand an issue.\x92\x94\n\nShare the article on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/ClintonGlobal/status/704815226601000961\n\n\nContinuing Coverage of the CGI Commitment Announcement on Detroit Home Mortgages\nThe CGI commitment announcement in Detroit two weeks ago continues to gain coverage. This week, KOB4<http://www.kob.com/article/stories/s4063955.shtml>, Michigan Radio<http://michiganradio.org/post/detroit-mortgage-program-aims-fix-broken-system>, and Daily Detroit<http://www.dailydetroit.com/2016/02/29/new-second-mortgage-program-could-be-a-real-game-changer-for-detroit/> discussed how \x93The Detroit Home Mortgage initiative,\x94 a new mortgage program, aims to increase homeownership opportunities in Detroit by offering new and much needed financing tools for homebuyers who are ready to buy a home, but lack the upfront capital to pay for necessary home repairs.\n\nDaily Detroit: \x93Last week, Detroit\x92s Mayor Mike Duggan unveiled the Detroit Home Mortgage Initiative, a new program that could be a potential game changer\x85At the urging of Duggan, and with organizing support from the Obama administration\x92s Detroit Federal Working Group, Clinton Global Initiative, local banks, foundations, and nonprofits joined forces last summer to help solve Detroit\x92s appraisal gap problem.\x94\n\nRead passed coverage of the announcement in the Associated Press<http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article61010962.html>, The Atlantic\x92s CityLab<http://www.citylab.com/housing/2016/02/detroit-home-mortgage-housing-market-appraisals-lending-clinton-global-initiative/463395/>, the Detroit Free Press<http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2016/02/18/new-program-aims-1000-mortgages-detroit/80563174/>, Crain\x92s Detroit Business<http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20160218/NEWS/160219832/duggan-unveils-40-million-fund-to-help-detroit-homebuyers> , and Next City<https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/plan-fix-detroit-mortgages-homebuying-program-clinton-global>.\n\nShare a blog about the announcement on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/ClintonGlobal/status/702226010973020160\n\n\nExpanding CGI Commitment highlights LGBT-inclusion\nAn article in Money Market UK<http://www.money-marketuk.com/business-and-finance/inditex-and-burberry-join-business-coalition-pushing-for-lgbti-rights> describes how two international fashion brands \x96 Burberry and Inditex \x96 have joined the CGI commitment \x93Open For Business,\x94 a coalition of businesses pushing to make LGBT inclusiveness the norm.\n\n\x93Spain's Inditex and Burberry, which include well-known brands such as Zara, Bershka and Massimo, have signed up to the Open for Business coalition, a collection of companies advocating for global LGBTI inclusion and rights. The coalition was officially launched last September with announcements at the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting in New York with the belief that governments and lawmakers in some countries with homophobic laws may be more likely to be persuaded by arguments presented from multi-national corporates.\x94\n\n\nEncouraging social entrepreneurship through the Hult Prize\nTwo separate pieces on the Huffington Post explain how the Hult Prize, which is awarded by President Clinton each year at the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting, is helping to nurturing social entrepreneurship among students around the world. The first piece discusses<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jaron-soh/finance-vs-social-enterpr_b_9335490.html> how the Hult Prize Challenge is encouraging London School of Economics students to pursuit careers in the social impact space.\n\n\x93Beyond educating youths of the fallacy that the concepts of profit and charity are mutually exclusive, more so than ever, our education systems need to inculcate empathy and instill a much-needed social agency\x85 The past fall was also the first time the US$1,000,000 Hult Prize Challenge was held at LSE. Held in partnership with the Clinton Global Initiative, the Hult Prize is a social impact competition that challenges university\n\nAnother piece in the Huffington Post<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bipul-saha/can-social-entrepreneursh_b_9329104.html> explains how the winners of the Hult Prize PAN India are working to address India\x92s \x93skill gap\x94 by connecting career trainers to those who lack formal job training. Using this network, the winning team will then develop an ecosystem to provide jobs to those who have completed the training successfully.\n\n\x93It is also the duty of individuals with sufficient resources to come forward and develop scalable businesses which can impart training and skill to India's labour force. This is exactly how the winners of the Hult Prize PAN India Initiative plan to provide meaningful employment opportunities to millions in India.\x94\n\n\nIn Case You Missed It:\n\n\xb7         The Thomson Reuters Foundation wrote a piece<http://news.trust.org/item/20160226145933-ly6r4/>, titled \x93It's time for women to take power in the global move toward clean energy,\x94 spotlighting yesterday\x92s launch of the Clinton Climate Initiative\x92s Women in Island Energy Leadership Network.\n\n\xb7         Inside Philanthropy<http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/girls-women-grants-funding/2016/2/23/whats-the-clinton-foundation-doing-for-womens-empowerment.html> covered the 2016 Clinton Global Initiative Winter Meeting with two articles that provided in-depth looks at two issue-areas discussed during the meeting: women\x92s empowerment<http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/girls-women-grants-funding/2016/2/23/whats-the-clinton-foundation-doing-for-womens-empowerment.html> and LGBT-inclusion<http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2016/2/24/also-on-the-clinton-foundation-agenda-getting-business-behin.html> in the workplace.\n\n\xb7         Last week, Mashable<http://mashable.com/2016/02/18/how-to-talk-about-race-kids/#ss.jZE8DhZqT> used Too Small to Fail\x92s Twitter tips<https://twitter.com/2SmallToFail> as a resource for a piece about how to talk to kids about race.\n\n\xb7         The CGI Annual Meeting was included in the Biz Bash 2016 Top 100 Events in NYC<http://www.bizbash.com/clinton-global-initiative-annual-meeting-1-political-diplomatic-event/gallery/177280>.\n\n"
