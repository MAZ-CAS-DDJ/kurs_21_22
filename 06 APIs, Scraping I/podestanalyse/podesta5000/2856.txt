john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\n\nOur campaign will not be financed by the leaders of Wall Street. Nor will it be financed by top business executives whose bonuses are more than most hardworking Americans earn in a lifetime.\n\nInstead we are making our campaign publicly financed.That means our campaign will be fully funded by supporters like you. We will answer to you. We will fight for you.\n\nIn order for us to fight for you, we need smaller donations from thousands of supporters.\n\nWith the matching funds provided by becoming publicly financed, the first $250 you contribute will be matched. That means your donation of $10 is now worth $20 to our campaign. Your donation of $25 is now worth $50 to our campaign. \n\nYour matched donation can become the extra boost we need to meet our end-of-year fundraising goals.\n\nWill you pitch in today so we can have your donation up to $250 matched before the end of the year deadline?\n\nhttps://martinomalley.com/donate\n\nThank you,\nMartin O\'Malley__________________\n\nPaid for by O\'Malley for President\n\nContributions to O\'Malley for President are not tax deductible.\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.\nClick here to <a href="https://secure.martinomalley.com/unsubscribe">unsubscribe</a>.\n\nO\'Malley for President\n1501 St. Paul Street, Suite 115\nBaltimore, MD 21202\n\n'
