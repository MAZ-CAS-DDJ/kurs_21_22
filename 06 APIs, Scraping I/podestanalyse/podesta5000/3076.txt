(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nHillary Clinton raised the right question, which is a start.\n\n"Why," she asked Monday morning, "do some communities have, frankly, more\nladders for opportunity than other communities?"\n\nThe likely 2016 Democratic frontrunner was headlining a roundtable\ndiscussion at the Center for American Progress\n<https://www.americanprogress.org/events/2015/03/16/108864/expanding-opportunity-in-americas-urban-areas/>\non expanding opportunity in urban America. This question is actually a\nsophisticated and hugely important one, and the fact that Clinton is\nthinking about it hints at what could be an important theme in the coming\nelection.\n\nBy definition, the American Dream sounds like an *American phenomenon*,\nsomething equally accessible to hard workers whether they live in a big\ncity or a rural community, the North or the South, a Rust Belt town or a\nSun Belt suburb. But, in fact, an accumulating body of research suggests\nthat children growing up in some parts of the country have much better odds\nthan children elsewhere of climbing up the economic ladder, of rising from\npoor roots to head middle- and upper-class households of their own.\n\nThe American dream, it turns out, is not a universal promise. It\'s more\nreal for children in Seattle than Atlanta\n<http://www.citylab.com/work/2013/07/child-seattle-has-much-better-chance-escaping-poverty-child-atlanta/6275/>,\nfor poor kids growing up around Salt Lake City than Charlotte\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/business/in-climbing-income-ladder-location-matters.html?hp>\n.\n\nClinton cited Monday the research that helped document this, a landmark\nstudy <http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/> led by Raj Chetty and other\nresearchers at Harvard and the University of California at Berkeley\nreleased in 2013. They found that a child\'s prospects for economic\nmobility vary\ngreatly \xe2\x80\x94 and disturbingly \xe2\x80\x94 by geography in America\n<http://obs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/chetty/mobility_geo.pdf>. There\'s something\nabout metropolitan Seattle, in other words, that\'s more conducive to\nintergenerational mobility than Atlanta.\n\nSo what is that something (or somethings)? A couple of years ago \xe2\x80\x94 as\nrecently as the last presidential election \xe2\x80\x94 we didn\'t even know to ask\nthis question. Now that we do, we can have an election-season debate about\nsocial mobility that goes far beyond empty platitudes about hard work\nversus helping hands.\n\n"How do we promote success and upward mobility?" Clinton said on Monday.\n"It\xe2\x80\x99s not only about average income, as important as that is. You can look\nat cities that on average have similar affluence, but people are trapped\nand not able to move up in one city, and are moving up in another."\n\nMetropolitan Seattle and Atlanta have comparable median incomes\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highest-income_metropolitan_statistical_areas_in_the_United_States>.\nBut in Seattle, about one in 10 kids raised by families in the bottom fifth\nof household incomes will rise to the top fifth by age 30. In Atlanta, the\nsame is true for only about one in 25 kids at the bottom.\n\nChetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Patrick Kline and Emmanuel Saez have offered\nsome initial answers as to what might be going on. Social mobility appears\nto be higher, they found, in metropolitan areas with less economic and\nracial segregation, with better schools, more social capital and lower\nrates of single parenthood. Other researchers at CAP have found higher\nsocial mobility among metros with a large middle class\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/04/born-poor-you-want-to-live-where-the-middle-class-is/>\n.\n\nThe importance of good schools isn\'t surprising. Nor is the role of\ntwo-parent families, although part of the finding on this front is\nfascinating: Even children with married parents have higher mobility when\nthey live in communities with fewer single parents. Perhaps this happens\nbecause overwhelmed single mothers are able to contribute less time to not\nonly their own children, but to the communities around them \xe2\x80\x94 to the PTA or\neven the parenting of a neighbor\'s kids.\n\nThe findings about segregation reinforce the idea that social mobility and\ngeographic mobility are intimately linked. If poor communities live\nsegregated far from jobs, as is often the case in a sprawling metro like\nAtlanta\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/opinion/krugman-stranded-by-sprawl.html>,\nemployment and opportunity are harder to access for poor residents. When\npoor people are segregated, they\'re also less likely to benefit from the\nconnections to middle- or upper-income neighbors who might know about a\nbetter job opportunity or a good after-school program.\n\nChetty and his co-authors can\'t explain all of these relationships; they\'re\njust starting the work of highlighting them. But their data raises crucial\nquestions about who we\'re leaving behind in America and what might be\nimportant to help them ahead. And that\'s precisely the kind of policy\ndebate we might want to have in the upcoming election if we really want to\nensure more equality of opportunity.\n\nClinton\'s comments Monday suggest that she\'s already thinking about these\nproblems. Few voters in either party are likely comfortable with the idea\nthat a child\'s future is significantly determined in the U.S. today by\nwhere he or she lives. Talking about the difference between Seattle and\nAtlanta \xe2\x80\x94 as she did Monday \xe2\x80\x94 is powerful both because it tugs at the\nAmerican sense of fairness, and because it turns abstract fears about\ninequality into something terribly real.\n\nIf Clinton talks more about it, the topic gives her a chance to unite many\npolicy goals \xe2\x80\x94 investing in better schools, greater job access for the\npoor, stronger civic institutions like unions and larger middle-class\ncommunities \xe2\x80\x94 under the much larger theme of social mobility at a time when\nmany Americans worry their children will grow up to be worse off than them\n<http://time.com/3618322/census-millennials-poverty-unemployment/>.\n'
