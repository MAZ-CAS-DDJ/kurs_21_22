"Last\nmonth, Congressman Chandler voted to meet President Obama\'s challenge to\ncreate millions of clean energy jobs, not in India or China, but right\nhere in America," says a version of the ad that will run in Rep. Ben\nChandler\'s (D-Ky.) district.\n\nSimilar ads will run in the districts of Democratic Reps. John Boccieri,\nMary Jo Kilroy and Steve Driehaus of Ohio; Mark Schauer of Michigan;\nMark Schauer of Colorado; Baron Hill of Indiana; Frank Kratovil of\nMaryland; Dan Maffei of New York; Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania; and Tom\nPerriello and Rick Boucher of Virginia.\n\nMeanwhile, another left-leaning coalition -- including groups such as\nAmerica\'s Building Trade Unions, Blue Green Alliance and Environmental\nDefense Fund -- is expected to launch its own campaign in the next few\ndays in about a dozen congressional districts thanking members for their\nvotes.\n\nThe ads come on the heels of media attacks launched by the National\nRepublican Congressional Committee against some of those same lawmakers.\nThus far, the NRCC effort has consisted primarily of radio ads and\nrobo-calls, but the group also launched a television spot in Perriello\'s\ndistrict, accusing the freshman Democrat of voting in favor of\nlegislation that will significantly increase costs to consumers (\nGreenwire <http://www.eenews.net/Greenwire/2009/07/01/archive/3> , July\n1).\n\nTop Republicans have made it clear that they view the climate change\nvote as a politically potent issue that will cost a number of House\nDemocrats their seats in 2010.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0709/MoveOn_thanks_members_on_ene\nrgy_bill.html?showall\n\nJuly 06, 2009\nCategories: Environment\n<http://dyn.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/index.cfm/category/Environment> \n\n\nAmerican United thanks members on energy bill\n\n\nAmericans United for Change is going up with cable buys for a series of\npositive spots, praising the patriotism of members of Congress who voted\nfor the American Clean Energy and Security Act; the one above is running\nin the district of Ohio Rep.

Thomas Perriello\n(D-Va.), who last week was the target of a National Republican\nCongressional Committee TV ad urging voters to call Perriello to tell\nhim "he was wrong to vote for the Pelosi energy tax." \n\n"Last month, Congressman Perriello voted to meet President Obama\'s\nchallenge to create millions of clean energy jobs - not in India or\nChina, but right here in America," the Americans United for Change ad\nsays. \n\nAll told, the organization has invested $150,000 to run 14 different ads\nthis week.

In\naddition to the TV ads that will run through the end of the week, which\nthe group has spent $150,000 on, it will also begin using robo calls in\n74 congressional districts, according to a statement.\n\nThis bill has been\n<http://www.wkhm.com/story.php?more_group=83&more_block=news&more_item=7\n5740>  the subject of much debate\n<http://blog.mlive.com/getting_in_your_business/2009/06/us_rep_mark_scha\nuer_votes_for.html> , and will continue to be as the 2010 election cycle\nramps up.\n\n"These Members helped America take a giant leap towards becoming the\nglobal standard for clean energy while creating millions of new jobs in\nthe process. The Obama clean energy jobs bill will help build a solid\nfoundation for long-term economic prosperity while reducing our nation\'s\ndependence on foreign oil and curbing pollution that causes global\nwarming," Tom McMahon, Acting Executive Director, Americans United for\nChange said in a statement. "We want to make sure these Members\'\nconstituents know that what their Representative voted for was creating\ntens of thousands of new clean energy jobs in their states.

The message to Ohioans: These Democrats voted against\nyour interests and would force your energy bills to spike. \n\nGoes one automated call: "Your congressman, John Boccieri, voted this\npast Friday for a huge\nnational energy tax -- a tax on natural gas and electricity that will\nhit every American family and small business." \n\nIt notes others\' criticisms of the bill and instructs constituents to\ncall Boccieri and "let him know that his vote on the Nancy Pelosi\nNational Energy Tax is a vote against American families."\n\nBut now comes a group with strong Democratic and organized labor ties, \nAmericans United for Change <http://www.americansunitedforchange.org/> ,\nwith plans to run ads supporting three Ohio Democrats for their votes on\nthe bill. \n\nAds in support of Boccieri, whose district includes Canton and part of\nMedina County, will run in the Cleveland television market next week,\nsaid Lauren Weiner, a spokesman for Americans United. Similar ads will\nrun in the markets served by Kilroy, of Columbus, and Steve Driehaus, of\nsuburban Cincinnati. Each market will have "five-figure" media buys, she\nsaid, and the ads will start Tuesday and run for about a week.\n\nAmericans United has run numerous campaigns like this before, promoting\nan issues agenda that often is indistinguishable from that of the\nDemocratic Party. Weiner said the ads in support of the three Ohioans\nare an extension of a commercial that ran in Washington, D.C., this\nweek, thanking Congress for supporting the clean-energy bill.\n\nBut if the ads are not a direct response to the NRCC\'s criticism of\ncarefully selected Democratic lawmakers -- each one potentially\nvulnerable in the 2010 election -- they are at least in recognition of\nthe political risks the lawmakers took.\n\n"We appreciate their support and recognize this decision in Ohio is a\nsensitive one," said Weiner, adding that Americans United also believes\nit is one that will move the nation\'s economy and energy development\nalong. The commercials say, "Through investments in scientific research\nand development, and the vigorous pursuit of alternative and renewable\nenergy, we can create millions of green jobs that allow us to reduce\ngreenhouse gases and\nexcel in a competitive global economy."\n\nPaul Lindsay of the NRCC sees it differently, noting that the energy\nbill has a tough road to passage in the Senate -- and saying that\'s a\ngood thing.\n\n"Hopefully Ohio families will never have to pay the price for the\nskyrocketing costs and lost jobs that this National Energy Tax would\nimpose if it became law, but that doesn\'t mean their representatives in\nWashington shouldn\'t have to pay a price for supporting it," Lindsay\nsaid. "This ad offensive by phone and the Web is only the beginning of\nwhat Ohio Democrats like John Boccieri can expect for making this\npotentially career-ending vote."\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nProgressive group plans pro-Markey ads on cap and trade\n<http://coloradopols.com/diary/9790/progressive-group-plans-promarkey-ad\ns-on-cap-and-trade>  \n<http://coloradopols.com/showDiary.do;jsessionid=F79ED19BB1EC86A443A66F4\nCFF341751?diaryId=9790> \n\n\nby: BobMoore <http://coloradopols.com/user/BobMoore> \n\n\nThu Jul 02, 2009 at 17:11:37 PM MDT\n\n\n( - promoted by Colorado Pols)\n\nThe progressive group Americans United for Change announced today that\nit plans a five-figure TV ad campaign next week, praising Rep. Betsy\nMarkey for her vote on cap and trade. \n\nThe ads will air on Fort Collins and Denver cable systems, according to\nspokesman Jeremy Funk. (Denver cable? Really?) \n\nThe announcement came a day after the National Republican Congressional\nCommittee announced it was beginning a campaign critical of 14 House\nDemocrats who supported cap and trade, including Markey. The anti-Markey\ninitiative will consist of robo-calls and a YouTube video. \n\nFunk said the AUC ads are not a response to the NRCC efforts. However,\nthe NRCC is active in 14 districts on cap and trade, while AUC will be\nactive in 13. \n\nA version similar to the planned Markey ad can be seen here: \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v...\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6IxvU9qNDQ>  \n\n \n\n \n\nProgressive group promises TV ads to defend Markey on energy vote\n<http://www.coloradoan.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=PluckPersona&U\n=07deebf354a64ac8be008d9811c3b205&plckController=PersonaBlog&plckScript=\npersonaScript&plckElementId=personaDest&plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&plc\nkPostId=Blog%3a07deebf354a64ac8be008d9811c3b205Post%3ab4689a57-a42c-4790\n-bcd4-fcc9c1d3c355&plckCommentSortOrder=TimeStampAscending&sid=sitelife.\ncoloradoan.com> \n\nhttp://www.coloradoan.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=PluckPersona&U=\n07deebf354a64ac8be008d9811c3b205&plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&plckUserId\n=07deebf354a64ac8be008d9811c3b205&plckPostId=Blog%3a07deebf354a64ac8be00\n8d9811c3b205Post%3ab4689a57-a42c-4790-bcd4-fcc9c1d3c355&plckController=P\nersonaBlog&plckScript=personaScript&plckElementId=personaDest\n\n \n\nPosted 7/2/2009 4:18 PM MDT on coloradoan.com \n\nA day after the National Republican Congressional Committee\n<http://www.nrcc.org/> announced it would begin a robo-call and Web ad\ncampaign\n<http://www.coloradoan.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=PluckPersona&U\n=07deebf354a64ac8be008d9811c3b205&plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&plckUserI\nd=07deebf354a64ac8be008d9811c3b205&plckPostId=Blog%3a07deebf354a64ac8be0\n08d9811c3b205Post%3a2e3555dc-40e0-457f-ad70-c627736ea36a&plckController=\nPersonaBlog&plckScript=personaScript&plckElementId=personaDest>\ncriticizing Rep. Betsy Markey\n<http://www.coloradoan.com/apps/pbcs.dll/betsymarkey.house.gov> for her\nvote on the "cap and trade" energy bill, a progressive group is riding\nto her defense. \n\nAmericans United for Change <http://www.americansunitedforchange.org/>\nannounced Thursday that it will begin running TV ads in Fort Collins and\nDenver next week supporting Markey for her vote. The ad is a tweaked\nversion of one praising House supporters\n<http://www.youtube.com/user/AmericansUnited#play/uploads/0/z6IxvU9qNDQ>\nof the bill that\'s now airing in the D.C. market. \n\nHere\'s the text of the ad that spokesman Jeremy Funk said will begin\nairing on cable stations next week. Funk said the group will spend "in\nthe five-figure range" to air the ad.  \n\n \n\nWho will build the wind turbines.... the solar panels.... that will\ncreate new businesses...new industries?Clean energy represents the jobs\nof the future. But will they be American jobs?Last month, Congresswoman\nMarkey voted to meet President Obama\'s challenge to create millions of\nclean energy jobs ....not in India or China, but right here, in\nAmerica...It\'s a foundation for America\'s long-term economic\nsuccess...making us world leader in clean energy.The challenge is\nglobal.  And the solution...uniquely American.\n\n \n\nThe ad closes with a screen image urging viewers to call Markey to thank\nher for voting for the bill. \n\nBob Duffy\n<http://www.colostate.edu/dept/PoliSci/fac/rd/rdtitlepage.html> , the\nchairman of the Colorado State University political science department,\nsaid the ad is "an effort to help Markey, give her some cover for the\nvote." \n\n"The purpose of these competing \'campaigns\' is to generate some free\nmedia coverage, and to frame the vote (for the long term) as either a\ntax hike (Republicans) or job creation (Democrats). This will be a\nbattle that plays out until November 2010, as both sides seek to find\nissues or votes to create a \'picture\' of Markey for the general\nelection," Duffy said. \n\nCSU political scientist John Straayer\n<http://www.colostate.edu/dept/PoliSci/faculty/straayer.html> called the\nad "predictable, and a prelude in the run-up to the election." He also\nsaid the NRCC and Americans United for Change efforts are an attempt to\nframe issues for 2010. \n\n"For Markey, it\'s jobs, clean environment, solving problems.  For the\nRepublicans, on the same issues, it will be rising deficits thus\njeopardizing our future, energy "taxes" on hard working folk and\ncreating problems."  \n\nAmericans United for Change is organized under Section 501(c)4\n<http://www.irs.gov/charities/nonprofits/article/0,,id=96178,00.html>\nof the tax code, which means it\'s not required to disclose its donors.\nIt\'s "a progressive issue advocacy organization," Funk said. \n\nHe said the group\'s ad is not a response to the NRCC efforts. Americans\nUnited for Change will run similar ads in 13 congressional districts.\nThe NRCC is targeting 14 districts in its campaign.

Tom Perriello, the\nstation\'s general manager said Thursday.\n\nLast week, WDBJ-TV did not run the original version of the ad, which was\nsponsored by the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\nPerriello, D-5th District, was the only congressman for whom the NRCC\nbought TV time to attack his vote in favor of the Clean Energy and\nSecurity Act, also known as the cap-and-trade bill.\n\nJeffrey Marks, president and general manager of WDBJ Television Inc.,\nsaid the NRCC revised the ad after the station relayed to it some\nconcerns Perriello\'s office had raised.\n\n"They revised the ad, it dealt with those issues and it\'s on the air,"\nMarks said Monday.\n\n"There were issues the Perriello camp raised that we thought were\nlegitimate about the source of the information and what it referred to.\n\n"We passed those on to the Republican group that was sponsoring the ad.\nThey revised the ad, and it seemed to address those issues," Marks said.\n\nPerriello said the original version of the ad was inaccurate because it\ncited a Washington Times editorial about the bill\'s cost to consumers.\n\nThe cost analysis, one of several that emanated from Washington sources\nlast week, was done by the Heritage Foundation, and that data was used\nincorrectly, Perriello said.\n\nMarks said WDBJ didn\'t take sides in the dispute. The actual argument\nwas between Perriello\'s office and the NRCC, he said.\n\n"This came off as being very adversarial," Marks said. "It wasn\'t, as\nfar as we were concerned. The parties may be adversaries," but the\nstation wasn\'t, he said.\n\nAlso on Monday, a Democrat-leaning interest group said it would\nbroadcast a TV ad in the Roanoke-Lynchburg market supporting Perriello\'s\nvote on the energy bill.\n\nAmericans United for Change said it was praising members of Congress in\n15 districts for voting for the bill, which the group said would help\nestablish America as a leader in clean energy and create millions of\nAmerican jobs.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nhttp://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/morning-fix/070109-morning-fix.h\ntml#more\n\n \n\nAmericans United on TV With Energy Spots: Americans United, the most\nactive liberal outside group in the early months of the Obama\nadministration, is launching a five-figure television buy today in\nsupport of the president\'s energy plan. The ad\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6IxvU9qNDQ> , which is running in the\nWashington media market on cable stations for now, seeks to tie the\nenergy proposal to job creation. "Clean energy represents the jobs of\nthe future," says the ad\'s narrator. "But will they be American jobs?"\nThe ad goes on to tout the Obama plan as the "foundation for America\'s\nlong term economic success". A source familiar with the buy suggested\nthat it may well be expanded to include states represented by senators\nwho remain uncommitted to supporting the legislation.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/07/americans-united-ad-climate-b\nill-creates-jobs-not-in-india-or-china-but-right-here.php\n\nAmericans United Ad: Climate Bill Creates Jobs "Not In India Or China,\nBut Right Here"\n\nBy Eric Kleefeld <http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/kleefeld>\n- July 1, 2009, 11:08AM\n\nAmericans United for Change has this new TV ad in the D.C. media market\n-- essentially aimed at the political and journalistic classes --\npraising the energy bill that was passed in the House and now faces a\ntough fight in the Senate:\n\n \n<http://www.americansunitedforchange.org/blog/entries/uniquely_american_\ngreen_jobs/> \n\nThe ad gives a patriotic fervor to the bill, focusing on the development\nof clean-energy jobs in this country.

"It\'s a foundation for America\'s long-term economic\nsuccess, making us world leader in clean energy," the announcer says.\n"The challenge is global. And the solution uniquely American." \n\nAfter lots of arm-twisting by President Obama and his aides, and quite a\nbit of horse-trading, the House on Friday narrowly passed the bill\n<http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/green/articles/2009/06/27/house_approve\ns_overhaul_of_environmental_policy/>  on a 219-212 vote. It is designed\nto lower how much carbon is pumped into the atmosphere through a\n"cap-and-trade" system in which carbon emissions are capped and permits\nto pollute are given away or sold by the government.\n\nBut the bill faces tough sledding in the Senate, and some observers\ndon\'t believe it will pass this year, though Obama wants final passage\nbefore he attends an international global warming conference in\nCopenhagen. \n\nObama and his allies are ramping up their grassroots efforts to put\npressure on senators.\n\n"Thanks to the extraordinary leadership in Congress, America has taken a\ngiant leap towards becoming the global standard for clean energy while\ncreating millions of new jobs in the process," Tom McMahon, acting\nexecutive director of Americans United for Change, said in a statement.\n"This historic legislation will help build a solid foundation for\nlong-term economic prosperity by meeting President Obama\'s challenge to\nreduce our nation\'s dependence on foreign oil and curbing pollution that\ncauses global warming. This ad is designed to encourage Congress to\ncontinue standing up to the forces of \'status quo\' and move this\nhistoric clean energy jobs bill to the President\'s desk as quickly as\npossible." \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://briefingroom.thehill.com/2009/07/01/video-auc-launches-cap-and-tr\nade-ad/\n\n \n\nVIDEO: AUC launches cap and trade ad\n<http://briefingroom.thehill.com/2009/07/01/video-auc-launches-cap-and-t\nrade-ad/> \n\n@ 7:54 am by Jeremy P.
