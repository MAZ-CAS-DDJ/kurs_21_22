john.podesta@gmail.comb'Friend,\n\nCan you please explain to me why Ken Cuccinelli thinks\nbreast exams, cancer screenings, and STD prevention are\nsomething to get up in arms about?\n\nThose are three core offerings of Planned Parenthood, which\nCuccinelli has repeatedly made a target of his legislative\ncareer.\n\nFirst we learned that Ken Cuccinelli suggested Planned\nParenthood was racist. Just yesterday, we found out he\nclaimed they provided sex education classes for students as\na pathway to "abortion on demand."\n\nIt\'s one thing after another with this guy.\n\nWill you join Terry and me and declare: "I stand with\nPlanned Parenthood"\n\nhttp://action.terrymcauliffe.com/stand-with-planned-parenthood\n\nIn 2008, Cuccinelli wrote a letter to the editor in the\nVirginia Pilot that said, "Planned Parenthood\'s sex-ed\nprograms in our schools are what a marketing executive might\ncall a \'loss leader,\' used to introduce their organization\nand all it has to offer, e.g., abortion on demand, to our\nchildren."\n\nIn 2011, Cuccinelli suggested Planned Parenthood was trying\nto do harm to the African American Community.\n\nAnd this isn\'t just about his beliefs -- as scary as they\nmay be -- it\'s about his actions too. When he was a State\nSenator, Cuccinelli added an amendment to the annual budget\nbill forbidding any funding for Planned Parenthood, which\nalmost derailed the entire budget.\n\nIf you reject Cuccinelli\'s attempts to block services like\ncancer screenings and STD exams, add your name to this\npetition.\n\nhttp://action.terrymcauliffe.com/stand-with-planned-parenthood\n\nWhile I\'d really like a logical explanation for Cuccinelli\'s\napparent opposition to providing critical health services to\nwomen who wouldn\'t otherwise have access to them, I\'m not\nexpecting to get one.\n\nInstead, I\'ll ask that you join us and dedicate your energy\nto preventing Cuccinelli from being in an even greater position\nto interfere with women\'s access to health care.\n\nThanks for standing with Terry and women across Virginia,\n\nEmily Aden\nResearch Director\nTerry McAuliffe for Governor\n\n\nDONATE NOW: https://donate.terrymcauliffe.com/page/contribute/donate?source=ema_20130601_testA&utm_medium=email&utm_source=mcauliffe&utm_campaign=ema_20130601\n\n\n\n---\nPaid for by Terry McAuliffe for Governor\n---\n\nUnsubscribe: http://action.terrymcauliffe.com/page/unsubscribe?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\n\n'
