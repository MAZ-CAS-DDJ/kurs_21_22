Senator Bernie Sanders, a\nsocialist who is also seeking the party\xe2\x80\x99s nomination, drew a crowd of 300\npeople at an event here in May.\n\n\n\nIn her speech, an animated Mrs. Clinton seemed to try to hit all the\nliberal notes, including combating climate change, giving women access to\nreproductive health care and celebrating the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s recent\ndecisions to legalize same sex marriage nationwide and uphold a key\nprovision of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s health care overhaul.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf a Republican is elected president, that will be the end of the\nAffordable Care Act,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Clinton said.\n\n\n\nHer calls to make college more affordable played well in the almost\nall-white and largely female crowd. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many of you had loans to go to\nhigher education? I did, I did, so did Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had\nlike two jobs. He had like five. We were just working around the clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDespite pleas from liberal groups, Mrs. Clinton has not gone as far as Mr.\nSanders, who said he would eliminate tuition at public colleges to reduce\nstudent debt.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton pushed for greater gun control measures, which contrasts her\nto Mr. Sanders, who has been one of the Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s most ardent\ndefenders of Second Amendment rights. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s not be afraid of the gun\nlobby, which does not even really represent the majority of gun owners,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said.\n\n\n\nAfter the event, Mrs. Clinton took questions from reporters. She called the\ncollapse of the Greek economy a \xe2\x80\x9ctragedy\xe2\x80\x9d and called on European leaders to\nreach an agreement. And she declined to comment on a controversial\nprovision of a nuclear agreement with Iran that would require the nation to\ndisclose its previous nuclear experimentation, an issue that has divided\nthe Obama Administration.\n\n\n\nWhen asked about Mr. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s surge in the polls, Mrs. Clinton said she\nalways expected the race to be competitive. \xe2\x80\x9cIt should be competitive. It\xe2\x80\x99s\nonly the presidency of the United States we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, so the more\nthe better,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nAfter Iowa City, Mrs. Clinton headed to Ottumwa, Iowa, where she would talk\nto Iowans at a grassroots-organizing event. The campaign said it has\nalready directly reached 16,000 Iowans and recruited at least one committed\ncaucusgoer in each of the state\xe2\x80\x99s 1,682 precincts.\n\n\n\nBut Mrs. Clinton still has much to do in this state where voters expect to\npersonally meet their candidates before participating in the famous\ncaucuses, which take place Feb 1, 2016. Her lead over Mr. Sanders has\nnarrowed in a recent poll \xe2\x80\x94 she still leads by double digits \xe2\x80\x94 and Iowans\nare clearly checking their options.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99m here out of curiosity more than anything else at this point,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Ashley Heffernen, 22, a recent graduate who waited in line with her\nboyfriend to hear Mrs. Clinton and hopefully ask a question about\nimmigration. \xe2\x80\x9cI want t see all the candidates,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Heffernen said.\n\n\n\nColleen Russo also waited in line outside the library. She supported Mr.\nObama in 2008, but said she wanted to show her five-year-old granddaughter\nViviana, who wore a pink dress and purple tiara, that a woman could be\npresident. \xe2\x80\x9cShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more experienced,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Russo said of Mrs.\nClinton.\n\n\n\nJorge Guerra, 26, who stood next to the Ms. Russo and her grandchild,\ninterjected: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring her to see Michele Bachmann.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Guerra said part of what is holding him back from being all-in for Mrs.\nClinton was her relationship to Wall Street and corporations. \xe2\x80\x9cIt unnerves\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want her to be as honest about and be as open as possible\nabout a lot of these questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMs. Russo agreed and said there were still things about Mrs. Clinton that\ngave her pause, but said Mrs. Clinton was most likely to win a general\nelection. \xe2\x80\x9cI think she needs to be more exposed and talk to bigger groups,\nlike Bernie does,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, referring to Mr. Sanders. Mr. Guerra nodded.\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe can\xe2\x80\x99t hide. Not someone like her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton seemed acutely aware of how tough things may be for her in\nIowa. After her remarks, she took questions from the audience. Dozens of\nhands went up.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m gonna let you pick,\xe2\x80\x9d she told the crowd. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose\nany potential caucusgoers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Clinton steps up attacks on GOP presidential candidates in Iowa \xe2\x80\x94 but\nsteers clear of knocking her Democratic rivals\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/07/07/clinton-steps-up-attacks-on-gop-presidential-candidates-in-iowa-but-steers-clear-of-knocking-her-democratic-rivals/>\n// WaPo // Jose Del Real \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton escalated her criticism of her GOP presidential\nrivals during a campaign stop here in Iowa City on Tuesday, knocking the\nfield of candidates on immigration reform, health care and LGBT issues\nwhile steering clear of directly attacking her Democratic primary rivals.\n\n\n\n"How many people running on the Republican side try to demean immigrants,\ninsult immigrants, cast aspersions on immigrants? They know as well as we\nknow, we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people living here,\xe2\x80\x9d she\ntold a crowd of about 250 attendees in a packed room at the Iowa City\nPublic Library. "I hear the Republican candidates \xe2\x80\x94 and it\'s not even the\nmost vitriolic \xe2\x80\x94 none of them any longer support a path to citizenship. All\nof them would basically consign immigrants to second-class status."\n\n\n\nClinton echoed those sentiments in an interview with CNN after the campaign\nevent, in which she said the Republican field is on "a spectrum of\nhostility." During that interview she denounced controversial comments by\nGOP presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump about Mexican\nimmigrants. She specifically criticized former Florida governor Jeb Bush\nfor not supporting an immigration reform plan that would give immigrants a\npath to citizenship, a position he once said he favored.\n\n\n\nThe former secretary of state paired those comments with warnings that a\nRepublican president in 2016 would roll back the Affordable Care Act and\nwould continue fighting for same-sex marriage bans, which the Supreme Court\nrecently ruled were unconstitutional. She told supporters at the event that\nthose issues highlight why she believes the country needs a Democrat in the\nWhite House after President Obama leaves office.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Republicans want to turn the clock back. They are going to look for\nevery way they can,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cInstead of saying marriage equality is the\nlaw of the land and now let\xe2\x80\x99s move on to the next part of the agenda, which\nis ending discrimination against LGBT folks, they are going to try to fight\na rearguard action.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut even while she spoke critically and aggressively about the GOP\npresidential hopefuls, the presumed Democratic frontrunner avoided making\nswipes at her primary challengers \xe2\x80\x94 mostly pointedly, Sen. Bernie Sanders\n(I-Vt.), who has received outsize attention from the left flank of the\nparty and is drawing crowds at campaign events that reach into the\nthousands.\n\n\n\n"This is going to be competitive. It should be competitive \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s only the\npresidency of the United States we\'re talking about," she joked during a\nquestion-and-answer session with reporters after the campaign event. She\ndid not, however, directly answer the question: what she thought about\nSanders\'s recent surge on the left.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the campaign\'s months-long ramp-up in the four early voting\nstates hit a new peak Tuesday when 20 additional field organizers joined\nthe Clinton campaign\'s Iowa operation, where the campaign has already\ninvested a large amount of resources in hopes of capturing a decisive win\nin the first-in-the-nation caucuses. That addition, as the Des Moines\nRegister first reported and the Washington Post confirmed, means her team\nnow includes an imposing 47 paid organizers \xe2\x80\x94 in Iowa alone.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis continues from our assumption that this is a competitive caucus that\nneeds a significant organization to earn every vote,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clinton\nspokesperson Jesse Ferguson. \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e\xe2\x80\x99ll have to work for every vote.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton: On immigration, the GOP is just like Donald Trump\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/hillary-clinton-last-rodeo-campaign-stop-iowa-2016-119810.html#ixzz3fIDR7BDz>\n// Politico // Gabriel Debenedetti \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015*\n\n\n\nIOWA CITY, Iowa \xe2\x80\x94 Hillary Clinton believes Donald Trump should be thrown in\nthe doghouse for his comments on immigration. And that the rest of the\nRepublican party should be tossed in there with him.\n\n\n\nIn her first national TV interview since she launched her campaign, the\nDemocratic front-runner seized on the real estate mogul\xe2\x80\x99s controversial\ncomments on immigration (calling many Mexican immigrants \xe2\x80\x9crapists\xe2\x80\x9d and\n\xe2\x80\x9ccriminals\xe2\x80\x9d) to shame the rest of the Republican presidential field.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very disappointed in those comments and I feel very bad and very\ndisappointed with him and with the Republican Party for not responding\nimmediately and saying, enough, stop it,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said to CNN after\nheadlining an organizing meeting in a local public library.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they are all in the \xe2\x80\x94 you know, in the same general area on\nimmigration. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to provide a path to citizenship. They range\nacross a spectrum of being either grudgingly welcome or hostile toward\nimmigrants.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton has already publicly bashed Trump for his comments, through not by\nname, after having previously accepted campaign contributions from him and\neven attending one of his weddings.\n\n\n\nBut on Tuesday, she played into fears the Republican establishment has\nabout Trump dragging down the rest of the party with his inflammatory\ncomments.\n\n\n\nShe also took aim at former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has been more\nsupportive of immigration reform than his rivals.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in a path to citizenship. If he did at one time, he no\nlonger does,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so pretty much they\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x94 as I said,\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re on a spectrum of, you know, hostility, which I think is really\nregrettable in a nation of immigrants like ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton touched on the email controversy that has bogged down the early\ndays of her campaign, as well, saying she did not violate any rules by\nusing a private email server while serving as secretary of state.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s take a deep breath here. Everything I did was permitted by law and\nregulation,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nAnd, she added, there\xe2\x80\x99s an upshot \xe2\x80\x94 the public now gets a glimpse into her\ndaily life, from telling aide John Podesta to wear socks, to her struggles\nwith operating a fax machine.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I think it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of fun. People get a real-time behind-the-scenes\nlook at what I was emailing about and what I was communicating about,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid.\n\n\n\nThe interview, with Brianna Keilar, touched on a broad range of topics \xe2\x80\x94\nfrom Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s doppelganger on \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday Night Live\xe2\x80\x9d to her plans for an\neconomic policy speech in Kansas City on Monday to Democratic rival and\nsurging candidate Bernie Sanders (\xe2\x80\x9cI always thought this would be a\ncompetitive race.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\n\n\nClinton also answered a question about the brouhaha around a woman possibly\nbumping Alexander Hamilton off the $10 bill. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s not crazy about a\ncompromise in which a woman might share the bill with Hamilton.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds pretty second class to me. So I think a woman should have her\nown bill,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nThe airing of the interview followed a full day in Iowa, during which the\nfront-runner appeared looser-than-usual on the campaign trail.\n\n\n\nNearly three months into what could be the political fight of her life,\nClinton noted on Tuesday that her time to ride off into the sunset is not\nall that far away.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my last rodeo,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said during a campaign stop in the\nfirst-in-the-nation voting state on Tuesday afternoon before taking\nquestions from reporters. Clinton said she wants to play a role in setting\nthe country on the right path before hanging up her hat \xe2\x80\x94 but hopefully,\nshe said, not until 2025, after eight years in the Oval Office.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe that we can leave not just the country in good shape for the\nfuture, but we can get a deep bench of young people to decide they want to\ngo into politics to continue the fights that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be waging,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid.\n\n\n\nThe rodeo characterization may have been more apt than she intended. Her\ncampaign has been criticized in recent days for using a rope to corral\nreporters who were following Clinton during a parade over the July 4th\nweekend. Greeting reporters after an organizing meeting at the Iowa City\nPublic Library, Clinton nodded to the minicontroversy, looking at the\nbarrier between her and the press and asking if it was the equivalent of a\nrope holding them back.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it should come down,\xe2\x80\x9d she deadpanned.\n\n\n\nShe also glanced upon a range of issues in the news.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s not be afraid of the gun lobby, which does not even really represent\nthe majority of gun owners in America,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton told the crowd of more than\n350 locals. While she refused to take the bait and attack Sanders when\nprompted, she has recently been speaking more about gun control \xe2\x80\x94 an issue\non which she differs from Sanders, who hails from gun-friendly Vermont.\n\n\n\nClinton also focused on the dangers of climate change more than she usually\ndoes, calling it \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most existential threats to our country and\nour world.\xe2\x80\x9d And she again said that \xe2\x80\x9cif a Republican is elected president,\nthat will be the end of the Affordable Care Act.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton \'disappointed\' in Donald Trump\n\nAt times musing on her career as secretary of state, Clinton at one point\nsaid that she jokes with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger about\nthe difficulties of conducting diplomacy in the modern era.\n\n\n\nBut she refused to weigh in forcefully on the ongoing negotiations over\nIran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, telling reporters, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s useful for\nme to publicly comment right now on what the negotiations are attempting to\nresolve.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere needs to be full transparency, disclosure and verifiable inspections\ngoing forward, and certainly any part of the Iranian nuclear or military\nestablishment that has anything to do with the program past, present and\nfuture needs to be subject to that,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, the former top diplomat did call the economic situation in\nGreece a \xe2\x80\x9ctragedy,\xe2\x80\x9d insisting that it is important \xe2\x80\x9cthat we can see an\noutcome here that will actually help Greece recover and keep them in the\neurozone, and keep Europe united.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*SOCIAL MEDIA*\n\n\n\n*Zeke Miller (7/7/15, 4:53 pm)*\n<https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/618523312272977920>* - Inbox:\nTomorrow in NH, @MartinOMalley will unveil his plan to make college\ndebt-free for every student in America.*\n\n\n\n*Philip Rucker (7/7/15, 5:25 pm)*\n<https://twitter.com/PhilipRucker/status/618531335456600065>*  - Very good\n@brikeilarcnn interview of Hillary.

In that time, she\xe2\x80\x99s done\na few news conferences and a smattering of local interviews in early\nstates, but no national sit-downs.\n\n\n\nBut this afternoon, she will sit with the CNN reporter Brianna Keilar in\nIowa. The interview comes as Mrs. Clinton has faced increasing criticism\nfor avoiding questions on policy (the trade deal supported by President\nObama but opposed by many Democrats) and on personal issues (her use of a\nprivate email account at the State Department and the fund-raising\npractices of her family\xe2\x80\x99s foundation).\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s aides said that her early focus was on interacting with as\nmany voters as possible in small settings and that this national interview\nwould be the first of several.\n\n\n\nMuch of the early campaign was about allowing Mrs. Clinton to exist in a\nsafe political space, bringing one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most famous political\nfaces back down to earth from her days as secretary of state so that voters\ncould forge a bond with her. But over the weekend, a half-dozen protesters\ncreated an unpredictable environment for Mrs. Clinton as she marched in a\nparade in northern New Hampshire. At the same time, her aides sought to\ngive her a buffer so that voters could see her, separating journalists with\na rope, creating a series of viral photos that ricocheted through Twitter.\n\n\n\nThe challenges that the Clinton campaign, and the candidate, face are\nunique. But while her political problems may be complex, the solution that\nher team seems to have settled on, at this point, is fairly simple: Open\nthe doors to the news media a bit wider.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton relied heavily on white voters in 2008. In 2016, it\xe2\x80\x99s\nreversed.\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/07/07/hillary-clinton-relied-heavily-on-white-voters-in-2008-in-2016-its-reversed/>\n// WaPo // Philip Bump \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of reasons that Hillary Clinton lost in 2008. One of the\nmost prominent was that she was running against one of the most dynamic\ncandidates in recent memory at a time when people were eager for something\nnew. Another was that the dynamic candidate she was running against was\nblack.\n\n\n\nThe latter became more of a problem over the long term, as Obama racked up\nprimary victories in states with large black populations in the Deep South\nand cut into Clinton\'s dominance elsewhere. In Iowa and New Hampshire, two\nof the whitest states in the union, it played less of a role.\n\n\n\nBut now, weirdly, the whiteness of those early states might be something of\na problem for her. And she\'s actually doing better among non-whites.\n\n\n\nThe CNN/ORC poll released last week reinforced that Clinton is doing much\nbetter in 2016 than any of her opponents -- especially among non-white\nvoters.\n\n\n\nShe leads among white voters, too, of course -- and handily. But her lead\nover Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) among white voters is 34 points and\nappears to be narrowing. Among non-white voters -- which we will emphasize\nalso includes Latinos -- it\'s 52 points.\n\n\n\nIf Sanders keeps closing the gap with white voters, that could be a problem\nin Iowa and New Hampshire. Clinton\'s big lead among non-white voters won\'t\nbe much of an advantage until South Carolina -- which, incidentally, she\nlost by a wide margin in 2008.\n\nOne question mark: What becomes of the support for Joe Biden if he finally\ndecides not to run? In CNN\'s polling, Biden ate up one-fifth of the\nnon-white support. If that support goes to Clinton, the dynamic above\nbecomes even more stark.\n\n\n\nRemember, there is no reason at this point to think that Hillary Clinton\nwill not be the Democratic nominee. There is not much of a reason to think\nthat she will lose Iowa, and there\'s only a speculative idea that she might\nlose New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nBut those two states might end up being much closer than we might once have\nexpected in part because they are awfully white -- a fact that might have\nbeen one reason Clinton won New Hampshire in 2008 and was able to stay in\nthe race.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton: Republican candidates \xe2\x80\x98on a spectrum of hostility\xe2\x80\x99 toward\nimmigrants\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/07/07/hillary-clinton-republican-candidates-on-a-spectrum-of-hostility-toward-immigrants/>\n// WaPo // Ed O\xe2\x80\x99Keefe \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton says that Republican presidential candidates "range across\na spectrum of hostility" when it comes to immigration and that her campaign\nwill advocate for comprehensive reforms.\n\n\n\nSitting on Tuesday for her first national television interview as a\ndeclared presidential candidate, the Democratic frontrunner lumped together\nall GOP candidates when asked by CNN about Donald Trump\'s recent comments\nabout Mexican immigrants. Interviewer Briana Keilar asked Clinton what she\nmade of Trump\'s comments, noting that he had been a donor to some of her\nprevious campaigns.\n\n\n\n"I\xe2\x80\x99m very disappointed in those comments and I feel very bad and very\ndisappointed with him and with the Republican Party for not responding\nimmediately and saying \'Enough, stop it,\' " she said. "But they are all in\nthe same general area on immigration. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to provide a path to\ncitizenship. They range across a spectrum of being either grudgingly\nwelcome or hostile toward immigrants. And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to talk about\ncomprehensive immigration reform. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to talk about all the good,\nlaw-abiding, productive members of the immigrant community that I\npersonally know, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve met over the course of my life. That I would\nlike to see have a path to citizenship."\n\n\n\nClinton added that no Republican candidate supports establishing a system\nthat would allow eligible illegal immigrants to eventually apply for\ncitizenship. But Keilar noted that Bush has previously supported such a\nsystem.\n\n\n\nClinton shot back: "He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in a path to citizenship. If he did\nat one time, he no longer does."\n\n\n\nShe added that Republicans are "on a spectrum of hostility, which I think\nis really regrettable in a nation of immigrants like ours. All the way to\nkind of grudging acceptance but refusal to go with a pathway to\ncitizenship. I think that\'s a mistake."\n\n\n\nIn his 2013 book "Immigration Wars," Bush laid out a specific set of\ncriteria that illegal immigrants \xe2\x80\x94 adults and children \xe2\x80\x94 would need to meet\nto apply for legal status and in limited circumstances, perhaps\ncitizenship. He has more recently suggested that citizenship could be\nextended only as part of a bipartisan agreement that included changes in\nU.S.-Mexico border security, a reduction in immigrants allowed to enter the\ncountry due to family ties and an increase in the number allowed to enter\nthe United States for economic purposes.\n\n\n\nBush\'s campaign responded to Clinton\'s comments just moments after they\naired, noting that she voted for amendments that stopped immigration reform\nwhen she was a senator and that she said last year that unaccompanied\nminors crossing the U.S.-Mexico border "should be sent back."\n\n\n\n"She is now running further to the left on immigration policy than even\nPresident Obama\xe2\x80\x99s White House believes is legally feasible," Bush\nspokeswoman Emily Benavides said in a statement. "Hillary Clinton will say\nanything to get elected and her numerous flip-flops on immigration prove\nit."\n\n\n\nBenavides added that as he wrote in his book, Bush "believes in a\nconservative legislative solution to fix our broken immigration system that\nincludes earned legal status for those currently in the country after they\npay fines and taxes, learn English, and commit no substantial crimes while\nsecuring our border."\n\n\n\nIn the CNN interview, Clinton sounded similar to Bush when expressing\ngeneral views on immigration \xe2\x80\x94 that the United States will never be able to\ndeport the 11 million to 12 million people believed to be in the country\nillegally, and that a revamped immigration system would spur economic\ngrowth and increase tax revenues.\n\n\n\n"We know we\'re not going to deport 11 or 12 million people. We shouldn\'t be\nbreaking up families," she said. "We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be stopping people from\nhaving the opportunity to be fully integrated legally within our country.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s good for us, it\xe2\x80\x99s good economically, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the taxes that will\nbe legally collected. It\xe2\x80\x99s good for the children so that they can go as far\nas their hard work and talent will take them. So I am 100 percent behind\ncomprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship."\n\n\n\nAnother GOP presidential candidate, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.),\nco-authored the bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill that\npassed the Senate in 2013, and remains an advocate for allowing eligible\nimmigrants to apply for citizenship.\n\n\n\nClinton made similar charges against GOP candidates to a wider group of\nreporters just before taping the CNN interview in Iowa City.\n\n\n\n"How many people running on the Republican side try to demean immigrants,\ninsult immigrants, cast aspersions on immigrants? They know as well as we\nknow, we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people living here," she\ntold reporters.\n\n\n\n"I hear the Republican candidates \xe2\x80\x94 and it\'s not even the most vitriolic \xe2\x80\x94\nnone of them any longer support a path to citizenship. All of them would\nbasically consign immigrants to second-class status."\n\n\n\nKeilar also asked Clinton about the possibility that she might face Bush in\nthe general election.\n\n\n\n"Well, we\'ll see, that\xe2\x80\x99s up to first the Republicans on his side and the\nDemocrats on my side," she said. "What\xe2\x80\x99s great about America is anyone can\nrun for president. That\xe2\x80\x99s literally true. And you have to go out and do\nwhat everybody else does \xe2\x80\xa6 you have to work really hard. So whoever is\nnominated by their respective parties will be the nominee, and then we\'ll\nsee who\xe2\x80\x99s on the other side."\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton Blames \xe2\x80\x98Constant Barrage of Attacks\xe2\x80\x99 by GOP for Polls\nQuestioning Her Honesty\n<http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-blames-constant-barrage-of-attacks-by-gop-for-polls-questioning-her-honesty-1436312049>\n// WSJ // Laura Meckler \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton on Tuesday blamed voter perceptions that she is\nuntrustworthy on a \xe2\x80\x9cconstant barrage of attacks\xe2\x80\x9d by Republicans over many\nyears, and said she\xe2\x80\x99s confident she will overcome them during the course of\nthe 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nSome of those attacks have focused on her exclusive use of a private email\naccount for official business as secretary of state. In an interview with\nCNN, Clinton repeated her assertion that she had complied with rules in\nplace at the time. Mrs. Clinton added that said she went \xe2\x80\x9cabove and beyond\xe2\x80\x9d\nthose standards by submitting her emails to the State Department, though\nrules in place did require her to preserve the records.\n\n\n\nIn her first national television interview, and before that in a brief news\nconference with reporters in Iowa, the front-runner for the Democratic\nnomination hedged as much as she revealed. She declined to say whether she\nsupports raising taxes on the wealthy, said it was best for her to withhold\ncomment on the Iran nuclear negotiations, and dodged a question about which\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s image should be on the $10 bill. She also declined to discuss the\nrise of the long-shot campaign of rival Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\n\n\nShe said she is \xe2\x80\x9cvery disappointed\xe2\x80\x9d by the disparaging remarks Republican\ncandidate and entrepreneur Donald Trump uttered last month about Mexican\nimmigrants, calling them \xe2\x80\x9crapists,\xe2\x80\x9d and denounced the GOP presidential\nfield for opposing a path to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are all in the same general area on immigration,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to provide a path to citizenship. They range across the spectrum\nof being either grudgingly welcome or hostile toward immigrants.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton also criticized the city of San Francisco for failing to\nfacilitate the deportation of a repeat felon who had been kicked out of the\nU.S. five times before and who earlier this month killed a woman walking on\na city pier. \xe2\x80\x9cThe city made a mistake not to deport someone that the\nfederal government thought should be deported,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nSome recent polls have found a drop in the number of voters who see Mrs.\nClinton as honest and trustworthy. Asked about that by CNN, Mrs. Clinton\nsaid that was to be expected \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you are subjected to the kind of\nconstant barrage of attacks that are largely fomented by and coming from\nthe right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis has been a theme that has been used against me and my husband for\nmany, many years,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She said that entire books were filled with\n\xe2\x80\x9cunsubstantiated allegations\xe2\x80\x9d so \xe2\x80\x9cof course that\xe2\x80\x99s going to raise questions\nin people\xe2\x80\x99s minds.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA recent book suggested conflicts of interest between foreign donations to\nthe Clinton family foundation and her work as secretary of state, though it\nfailed to reveal evidence of a quid pro quo.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have every confidence during the course of this campaign people are\ngoing to know who will fight for them and be there for them,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt\nthe end of the day, I think voters sort it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn the question of her email practices, she said that everything she did\nwas permitted by law in place at the time. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no law. There was no\nregulation. There was nothing that did not give me the full authority to\ndecide how I was going to communicate,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nShe dismissed concerns expressed by Republicans about her decision to\ndelete emails that she and her aides determined to be unrelated to\ngovernment work. \xe2\x80\x9cI turned over everything I was obligated to turn over and\nthen I moved on,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople delete on a regular basis.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe said that her decision to turn over the government-related emails to\nthe State Department, which requested them last year, was \xe2\x80\x9cabove and\nbeyond\xe2\x80\x9d what was required. In fact, in 2009, the National Archives and\nRecords Administration issued regulations that said agencies allowing\nemployees to do official business on unofficial email accounts had to\nensure that any records sent on private email systems are preserved \xe2\x80\x9cin the\nappropriate agency record-keeping system.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*The making of a Hillary Clinton echo chamber\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-making-of-a-hillary-clinton-echo-chamber/2015/07/07/01625c5e-24ae-11e5-b72c-2b7d516e1e0e_story.html>\n// WaPo // Philip Rucker \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nOne day in May, operatives from a Washington-based super PAC gathered New\nHampshire mayors, state representatives and local politicos at St. Anselm\nCollege for a day of training.\n\n\n\nThey rehearsed their personal tales of how they met Hillary Rodham Clinton\nand why they support her for president. They sharpened their defenses of\nher record as secretary of state. They scripted their arguments for why the\nDemocratic front-runner has been \xe2\x80\x9ca lifetime champion of income\nopportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d And they polished their on-camera presentations in a series\nof mock interviews.\n\n\n\nThe objective of the sessions: to nurture a seemingly grass roots echo\nchamber of Clinton supporters reading from the same script across the\ncommunities that dot New Hampshire, a critical state that hosts the\nnation\xe2\x80\x99s first presidential primary.\n\n\n\nThe super PAC, called Correct the Record, convened similar talking-point\ntutorials and media-training classes in May and June in three other early\nvoting states \xe2\x80\x94 Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada \xe2\x80\x94 as well as sessions\nearlier this spring in California.\n\n\n\nPresidential campaigns have for decades fed talking points to surrogates\nwho appear on national television or introduce candidates on the stump. But\nthe effort to script and train local supporters is unusually ambitious and\nillustrates the extent to which the Clinton campaign and its web of\nsanctioned, allied super PACs are leaving nothing to chance.\n\n\n\nWhen, say, a Londonderry Times reporter calls a Rockingham County\nDemocratic Committee member for comment on Clinton, he or she will parrot\nCorrect the Record\xe2\x80\x99s talking points about Clinton having been a fighter for\nthe middle class \xe2\x80\x94 from improving rural health care as first lady of\nArkansas to raising the minimum wage as a senator from New York.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are holding sessions with top communicators across the country where we\ntalk about the best ways to discuss Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s strong record of\naccomplishments, how to articulate Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s positions most\neffectively and how to correct Republican operatives\xe2\x80\x99 distortions of the\nfacts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrienne Watson, communications director at Correct the Record.\n\n\n\nBut asking local supporters to use talking points could undermine the\norganic nature of grass-roots political interactions. No longer can a\njournalist call up a state representative in Iowa and expect to hear his or\nher personal, unvarnished take on Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 nor can a Rotary Club member\nwatch a fellow small-business owner talk about Clinton at their monthly\nluncheon \xe2\x80\x94 without suspecting he or she is reading from a script.\n\n\n\nThe super PAC\xe2\x80\x99s effort also comes as Clinton struggles on the campaign\ntrail to appear accessible and genuine. Some Democrats have long believed\nClinton sounds too scripted on the stump, especially compared to Sen.\nBernie Sanders (I-Vt.), her insurgent primary rival whose authenticity and\nliberal message are drawing thousands of Democrats to his rallies.\n\n\n\nNew Hampshire state Sen. Lou D\xe2\x80\x99Allesandro, a local elected official for\ndecades and a longtime Clinton supporter, said he did not attend Correct\nthe Record\xe2\x80\x99s session, which was held May 18 at the New Hampshire Institute\nof Politics at St. Anselm.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve known Hillary for a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d D\xe2\x80\x99Allesandro said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve known her\nhusband for a long time.

"So I have absolutely no\nsupport for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted\non.\'\'\n\n\n\nThe Sheriff\'s Department ignored "strong evidence" that Sanchez should have\nbeen turned over to immigration officials and deported, according to\nClinton.\n\n\n\nIn a similar vein, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) issued a statement\nTuesday saying that she has personally been investigating the circumstances\nsurrounding Kathryn Steinle\'s fatal shooting July 1.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI strongly believe that an undocumented individual, convicted of multiple\nfelonies and with a detainer request from ICE, should not have been\nreleased," she said. "We should focus on deporting convicted criminals, not\nsetting them loose on our streets."\n\n\n\nFeinstein also wrote to San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee to express her "deep\nconcern" about Sanchez\'s release, adding that it "led to last week\xe2\x80\x99s tragic\ndeath." Her letter "urged" Lee to "prevent such a tragedy" from reoccurring\nby joining the Department of Homeland Security\'s Priority Enforcement\nProgram, which would enable local law enforcement agencies to "provide\nnotice to ICE before releasing aliens with long criminal records."\n\nThe San Francisco mayor\'s office said it has reached out to Department of\nHomeland Security officials to determine if there\'s a way to cooperate with\nfederal immigration officials while still maintaining the sanctuary policy.\n\n\n\n"Mayor Lee shares the senator\'s concerns surrounding the nature of Mr.\nSanchez\' transfer to San Francisco and release,\'\' said Christine Falvey, a\nspokeswoman for the mayor. "As the mayor has stated, we need to gather all\nof the facts as we develop potential solutions.\'\'\n\n\n\nDemocratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, also from Northern California, said she\nasked Gov. Jerry Brown if state law was followed in the release of Sanchez.\n\n\n\n"For decades, I have supported deporting violent criminals, and I have\nalways believed that sanctuary should not be given to felons,\'\' Boxer said.\n\n\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis) echoed the same sentiment.\n\n\n\n"He had a criminal warrant but was released into the general society to\ncommit a murder. Does that make any sense to you?\'\' Johnson, who chairs the\nSenate\'s homeland security committee, demanded to know at a hearing.\n"Because I\'ll tell you it doesn\'t make any sense to the American public.\'\'\n\n\n\nPhilip Miller, an official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,\nblamed San Francisco, saying officials there did not honor a federal\nrequest, known as a "detainer," to keep Francisco Sanchez in custody.\n\n\n\nSanchez, who is from Mexico and is in the United States illegally,\nallegedly shot and killed 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle last week as she was\nsightseeing with her father along a popular local pier.\n\n\n\n"In that particular case our detainer was not honored,\'\' Miller said. "San\nFrancisco sheriff\'s department did not honor our detainer.\'\'\n\n\n\nSan Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi has defended his office\'s decision,\nsaying ICE should have issued an arrest warrant earlier. Miller declined\nafter the hearing to comment on that assertion. But Virginia Kice, a\nspokeswoman for ICE told NBC Bay Area this week that "obtaining judicial\nwarrants is not only unnecessary, it would place an immense burden on both\nICE and the federal courts." She added that last year, ICE deported more\nthan 177,000 immigrants with criminal convictions.\n\n\n\nSteinle\'s death has offered ammunition to GOP critics of Obama\nadministration policies, including presidential candidate Donald Trump,\nwho\'s cited it to justify his claims that many immigrants are criminals.\nSanchez has a long criminal history, but mostly for drug use, dating back\nto the 1990s, federal records show.\n\n\n\nAt the same time it plays into a larger, politically charged immigration\ndebate between federal authorities and local jurisdictions.\n\n\n\nHundreds of local jurisdictions have refused to participate in a disputed\nfederal program, Secure Communities, that allows local authorities to turn\nover information on immigrants they pick up to the federal government. San\nFrancisco takes it farther than many, even boasting of itself as a\n``sanctuary city\'\' that protects immigrants.\n\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama announced last fall he was ending the Secure\nCommunities program and replacing it with a new approach meant to address\nconcerns about immigrants being targeted.\n\n\n\nBut that has sparked more criticism from Republicans who embraced Secure\nCommunities as an effective law enforcement tool and oppose Obama\'s\nattempts to change immigration law through executive actions without\nCongress\' consent.\n\n\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., announced Tuesday he would\nbring Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson before his committee next\nweek to answer questions on the matter.\n\n\n\n"Just recently, we were reminded that the Obama administration\'s reckless\nactions, such as permitting sanctuary city policies, lead to tragic and\ndeadly consequences,\'\' Goodlatte said.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton Hands Jeb Bush A Present On Immigration\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/07/hillary-clinton-jeb-bush-immigration_n_7747652.html?1436306696>\n// HuffPo // Igor Bobic \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton denounced Donald Trump\'s controversial comments about\nimmigrants in her first national interview as a 2016 presidential\ncandidate. But in the process, she inadvertently handed Republican rival\nJeb Bush a present on a silver platter.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic front-runner told CNN\'s Brianna Keilar Tuesday that she was\n"very disappointed" with the celebrity hotelier for calling some Mexican\nmigrants rapists and criminals. She criticized the rest of the 2016\nRepublican presidential candidates for not moving quickly enough to\ndistance themselves from Trump and noted their opposition to comprehensive\nimmigration reform.\n\n\n\n"He doesn\'t believe in a path to citizenship. If he did at one time, he no\nlonger does," she said of Bush, the former governor of Florida.\n\n\n\nThe broadside could hurt Bush among Hispanic voters if Clinton succeeds in\nportraying him as opposed to immigration reform. It\'s a smart, long-term\nplay against a well-funded Republican with a decent chance of winning the\nnomination.\n\n\n\nFor the moment, however, Bush faces more immediate challenges as he\ntraverses early primary states. Chief among them is his effort to win over\nconservatives who believe that he supports granting undocumented immigrants\n"amnesty." In fact, Bush says that undocumented workers should be able to\nearn legal status, \xe2\x80\x9cnot necessarily citizenship.\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton, however, says\nthat anything short of a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants is\n"code for second-class status."\n\n\n\nImmigration remains one of the most divisive topics among Republicans in\nthe early caucus state of Iowa, but there are still far more who oppose a\npath to citizenship than support it. According to a Quinnipiac University\npoll released Monday, 46 percent of likely Republican caucus goers in Iowa\nsaid undocumented immigrants should be required to leave the country, while\n34 percent said they should be allowed to stay with some sort of path to\ncitizenship.\n\n\n\nAny reminder that Bush opposes "amnesty" is good news in Iowa -- regardless\nof whether it comes from the candidate or his potential Democratic rival.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton Piles On San Francisco Officials, Putting Sanctuary Cities\nUnder Even More Heat\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/07/sanctuary-cities_n_7749406.html>\n// HuffPo // Elise Foley \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nAfter a deadly shooting in San Francisco, allegedly by a man who had been\ndeported five times, lawmakers are calling on the county to drop its policy\nagainst cooperating with immigration enforcement.\n\n\n\nPresidential candidate Hillary Clinton became the most high-profile\nDemocrat to wade into the debate on Tuesday, telling CNN that San Francisco\nshould have worked with agents at Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\n\n"The city made a mistake, not to deport someone that the federal government\nstrongly felt should be deported," she said in an interview. "So I have\nabsolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that\nshould be acted on."\n\n\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), meanwhile, sent a letter on Tuesday to\nSan Francisco Mayor Ed Lee urging him to cooperate with ICE, implying the\ncounty\'s failure to do so allowed for the shooting of 32-year-old Kathryn\nSteinle, allegedly at the hands of a previously deported undocumented\nimmigrant named Francisco Sanchez.\n\n\n\nGOP lawmakers, who are more prone to support a greater federal thumbprint\non detention policy, have decried San Francisco leaders for acting\nirresponsibly. One of them, Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), said he plans to\nintroduce a bill penalizing cities that do not cooperate with ICE.\n\n\n\nWith the debate around immigration already red hot due to the charged\nrhetoric of the 2016 campaign, the incident in San Francisco could end up\nprompting a shift in recent trends in detention policy. For years, local\ncommunities have been limiting their collaboration with immigration\nenforcement officials, with more than 300 cities and counties adopting\npolicies against fully complying with ICE\'s requests. Some, like San\nFrancisco, barely deal with the agency at all, while others limit\ninteractions except in cases of more serious crimes.\n\n\n\nThe widespread resistance led the Obama administration to announce in\nNovember that it would drop the Secure Communities program, which asked\npolice to hold individuals for ICE so they could be picked up for\ndeportation purposes.\n\n\n\nThe immediate fallout from the shooting in San Francisco appears to be a\nchange in those particular political winds.\n\n\n\nBut the debate remains a sensitive one, with activists and even local\nofficials warning that a greater federal role could harm other law\nenforcement activities, drain resources and spark court challenges.\n\n\n\nAt issue is whether local law enforcement, at the request of ICE, should --\nor even legally could -- hold individuals who it otherwise would have\nreleased. Immigration advocates have warned that doing so creates fear in\nthe undocumented community and sweeps up people for deportation because of\nlow-level crimes or arrests they are never convicted for.\n\n\n\nTo accommodate those concerns, the administration is pushing a new policy\ncalled the Priority Enforcement Program, which was announced last November.\nUnder PEP, according to the administration, ICE would target individuals at\nhigher priority for deportation, such as convicted criminals. The program\nalso will ask local law enforcement to notify the agency when it plans to\nrelease a suspected deportable immigrant, rather than for holds.\n\n\n\nThat program hasn\'t been rolled out nationwide, and an ICE official said\ntheir appeals to San Francisco officials to work with them haven\'t gone\nanywhere. But critics are charging that had ICE implemented PEP in San\nFrancisco sooner, Sanchez, who said he shot Steinle last Wednesday before\nsaying on Tuesday that he was not guilty, would not have been released into\nthe community.\n\n\n\nPrior to the shooting, Sanchez had been deported five times and had seven\nfelony convictions, according to authorities. Twice, ICE put in detainer\nrequests for him. The first was with the Bureau of Prisons, where he was\nserving a sentence for the federal crime of illegally re-entering the U.S.\nas a felon. Sanchez was transferred by the Bureau of Prisons to the San\nFrancisco sheriff\'s office because he had an arrest warrant for a\n20-year-old marijuana case. ICE then put in a request to the sheriff\'s\noffice to detain him. After the district attorney declined to prosecute\nthat charge, he was released in April.\n\n\n\nOfficials at the San Francisco County Sheriff\'s Office and ICE have since\nblamed each other for that release, with the local authorities saying ICE\nshould have gotten a judicial warrant if they wanted Sanchez to be held,\nand ICE claiming it was never notified that the man was about to be let go.\n\n\n\nWith the debate expanding beyond the particulars of what happened and into\nthe realm of public policy, critics of Secure Communities worry the tragedy\nin San Francisco will be used as a cudgel against cities that have tried to\nmove their police departments out of the immigration enforcement business.\nThey warn there are not just humanitarian and budget constraints to\nconsider, but constitutional complications as well.\n\n\n\n"I\'ve seen this happen over and over again where anti-immigrant groups try\nto use these types of horrible cases to change policies but there are\nconstitutional protections, and people cannot be held for immigration\nwithout a judge signing a warrant," said Angela Chan, a policy director at\nthe Asian Law Caucus.\n\n\n\nPolice chiefs could be an ally in pushing back against greater federal\ninvolvement in local immigration matters. Many have contended that they\nneed to strike a balance between acting as enforcement agents and\nperforming their duties to protect the public. Montgomery County Police\nChief J. Thomas Manger, also the president of the Major Cities Chiefs\nAssociation, said doing too much of the former risks hurting the\nrelationship law enforcement has with the broader community.\n\n\n\nMontgomery County officials announced last year that immigrants would no\nlonger be held for ICE without demonstration that the individual likely\ncommitted a crime. Manger approves of PEP and said his office notifies ICE\nwhen individuals are being released upon request. But the fact that\nindividuals are released and go on to commit crime is a risk in all law\nenforcement, he insisted, and not just specific to immigration.\n\n\n\n"I\'ve been a cop for 38 years," he said. "And for longer than I\'ve been a\ncop, [criminals] have been getting out of jail and doing bad things again.\nThe fact is that the law allows you to hold someone for a certain amount of\ntime and when the law says you\'ve got to release them, you\'ve got to\nrelease them.\n\n\n\n*Clinton says GOP field ranges from \'grudgingly welcome\' to \'hostile\'\ntoward immigrants\n<http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2015/07/07/clinton-in-iowa-warns-about-gop-control-of-white-house>\n// AP // Catherine Lucey & Ken Thomas \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton said a Republican in the White House would mark a\n"big U-turn" for the nation and assailed the GOP presidential field\'s\nstance on an immigration overhaul.\n\n\n\nAsked about Jeb Bush, the Democratic presidential candidate said: "He\ndoesn\'t believe in a path to citizenship. If he did at one time, he no\nlonger does."\n\n\n\nIn an interview Tuesday with CNN, Clinton said the Republican presidential\ncontenders range "across a spectrum of being either grudgingly welcome or\nhostile toward immigrants."\n\n\n\nCampaigning in one of the most liberal pockets of Iowa, Clinton offered\nherself up as a Democratic standard-bearer at a time when her main\nDemocratic rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has generated big crowds\nand stoked interest among progressives. Clinton also addressed criticism\nthat she has avoided scrutiny, taking questions from reporters and then\nsitting down for her first national television interview since starting her\ncampaign.\n\n\n\nClinton cited her husband\'s eight years in office as a time of strong\neconomic growth that helped not only the wealthy but the poor as well. She\nsaid Republicans afterward left President Barack Obama to tend to an\neconomic crisis.\n\n\n\n"Right now our country deserves to keep moving forward, not to do a big\nU-turn going back to where we came from," Clinton said at the Iowa City\nPublic Library. "That didn\'t work before. It won\'t work again."\n\n\n\nShe told CNN she planned to outline some of her economic policies Monday.\n\n\n\nClinton has said any immigration legislation needs to include a path to\n"full and equal citizenship." She has defended Obama\'s use of executive\nactions to shield millions of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally from\ndeportation.\n\n\n\nIn the interview, Clinton said she was "disappointed" in Republican\ncandidate Donald Trump for his disparaging comments about Mexican\nimmigrants along "with the Republican Party for not responding immediately\nand saying, \'Enough, stop it.\'"\n\n\n\nClinton demurred in discussing the possibility of another Bush-Clinton\ncampaign \xe2\x80\x94 Bill Clinton defeated President George H.W. Bush in 1992 \xe2\x80\x94 but\nlumped former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in with other Republicans who have\nopposed immigration overhauls in Congress.\n\n\n\nBush, in his 2013 book "Immigration Wars," called for a process that would\nallow people living in the U.S. illegally to remain, as long as they take a\nseries of steps. He wrote that withholding citizenship is a suitable\npenalty for those who have broken the law. Bush\'s co-author, Clint Bolick,\nsaid the former Florida governor would probably bend to support\ncitizenship, if that was necessary to strike a deal on immigration.\n\n\n\nBush spokeswoman Emily Benavides said in a statement that Bush "believes in\na conservative legislative solution to fix our broken immigration system\nthat includes earned legal status for those currently in the country after\nthey pay fines and taxes, learn English and commit no substantial crimes\nwhile securing our border."\n\n\n\nDuring the CNN interview, Clinton defended her decision to delete some of\nher emails as secretary of state from her private email server, saying,\n"Everything I did was permitted by law and regulation." She said she used\none device for email, although an email message obtained by The Associated\nPress earlier this year showed Clinton used an iPad for email, in addition\nto her BlackBerry, while she was secretary of state.\n\n\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi,\nresponded Tuesday, saying "the committee does not know why or when she\nchose to wipe clean her personal server, but we do know her way of doing\nthings provided an incomplete public record." The committee sought\nClinton\'s emails as part of its investigation into the 2012 attack on the\nU.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya.\n\n\n\nAt her Iowa event, Clinton made no mention of Sanders but drew an implicit\ncontrast with his record on gun control. Sanders, a favorite of liberal\nDemocrats, has opposed some gun control measures in the Senate and drew\ncriticism from some Democrats for voting in 2005 to protect gun\nmanufacturers from lawsuits filed by victims of gun violence.\n\n\n\nClinton said she would speak out "about the uncontrollable use of guns in\nour country" and believes most Americans and gun owners support universal\nbackground checks. "Let\'s not be afraid of the gun lobby, which does not\neven really represent the majority of gun owners in America," she said.\n\n\n\nSanders says most gun owners in the country obey the law, and he makes a\ndistinction on the gun-control question between rural states like Vermont,\nwhere hunting is common and gun-ownership traditions go deep, and big\ncities.\n\n\n\n"I want to see real, serious debate and action on guns, but it is not going\nto take place if we simply have extreme positions on both sides," he told\nCNN on Sunday. "I think I can bring us to the middle."\n\n\n\nAsked about Sanders, Clinton said she welcomed a contested race. "This is\ngoing to be competitive \xe2\x80\x94 it should be competitive," Clinton said.\n\n\n\n*Hillary confronts the enemy\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/hillary-confronts-the-enemy-119826.html>\n// Politico // Annie Karni & Gabrielle Debenedetti \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, unlike those of her rivals, has provided the\nmedia with information about the fundraisers attended by the former\nsecretary of state, down to the names of the donors who hosted and the head\ncount for each event. Its communications shop has so far maintained a\nconstructive working relationship with the press corps \xe2\x80\x94 senior staffers\nlast month mingled with reporters over beers after a background briefing at\nthe Brooklyn campaign headquarters.\n\n\n\nThat new spirit of openness may have neutralized the famously toxic\nrelationship between the press and the Clinton operation, but with Bernie\nSanders turning out huge crowds and the Republicans about to steal the\nspotlight next month with their first debate, Clinton operatives have\nrealized it\xe2\x80\x99s time to cross the final, harrowing frontier: providing access\nto the candidate herself.\n\n\n\nFor the first three months of her campaign, Clinton remained virtually\noff-limits to the national press. She did not sit down for a national\ntelevision interview (her most recent occurred during her book tour for\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices\xe2\x80\x9d in 2014), nor did she grant any interviews to national\nnewspapers or websites. With questions surrounding her use of private email\nduring her years at the State Department, and surrounding the Clinton\nFoundation, the candidate herself remained as distant from the national\nmedia as ever \xe2\x80\x94 and it shows in the press coverage of her second\npresidential bid.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, after a campaign stop in New Hampshire, the campaign sought to\nenter a new phase of its relations with the press \xe2\x80\x94 Clinton sat with CNN\xe2\x80\x99s\nBrianna Keilar (notably a beat reporter, not one of the network\xe2\x80\x99s anchors\nwho are household names) for her first nationally broadcast interview.\n\n\n\nMore interviews will follow, communications director Jennifer Palmieri has\npromised.\n\n\n\nClinton insiders said July makes sense for Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s moment to finally\nembrace national television \xe2\x80\x94 enough time has passed since the height of\nthe controversies surrounding the Clinton Foundation and her use of a\nprivate email address at the State Department that she will have space to\ntalk about her own campaign message.\n\n\n\nBut the campaign doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the luxury of waiting much longer: In August,\nClinton is scheduled to go on vacation, and then the crowded Republican\nfield will be chewing up news cycles with the first debate \xe2\x80\x94 possibly\ndefining Clinton on a national stage.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow is a good time for the campaign to take back control of the story of\nwho Hillary Clinton is,\xe2\x80\x9d said longtime donor Jay Jacobs. \xe2\x80\x9cShe can now use\n[national television] to accomplish that.\xe2\x80\x9d In terms of the controversies\nshe will have to respond to, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe tide has been turned.\xe2\x80\x9d Beginning\nMonday, Clinton will also start rolling out more detailed policy proposals\nto discuss.\n\n\n\nUntil now, Clinton has favored the confines of local media outlets. Since\nher Roosevelt Island rally in early June, she has participated in\ninterviews only in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.\n\n\n\nFor a candidate with effectively 100 percent name recognition in the\ncountry, national media interviews have been low on the priority list.\nDuring the \xe2\x80\x9cramp-up\xe2\x80\x9d period of her campaign, which lasted two months,\nClinton answered only a handful of questions from reporters, mostly yelled\nat her from a large gaggle. Instead, she spent time asking the questions at\nroundtable events in the early voting states.\n\n\n\nSome of that is par for the course in a primary. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important to do some\nnational press, but your time should be heavily weighed towards the places\nwhere people vote first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy Vietor, a former Obama campaign\nspokesman.\n\n\n\nBut even the favored local press has begun to note \xe2\x80\x94 and chafe at \xe2\x80\x94 the\nlack of access. \xe2\x80\x9cHigh-horse Hillary corrals a wimpy news media,\xe2\x80\x9d blared the\nheadline of a front-page editorial in Manchester, New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s\ninfluential Union-Leader newspaper, after reporters were corralled with a\nrope during a July 4 parade in Gorham, New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nIronically, it was the \xe2\x80\x9chigh-horse\xe2\x80\x9d image that the campaign has tried to\navoid by steering clear of the national news networks and focusing instead\non \xe2\x80\x9ceveryday Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut on Sunday, Palmieri conceded to Fox News\xe2\x80\x99 Howard Kurtz that \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re\npaying a price\xe2\x80\x9d for not participating in sit-down interviews on national\ntelevision and that the inevitable pivot to more engagement would start now.\n\n\n\nThe tipping point may have come over the weekend in New Hampshire, where\nthe awkwardness of the situation came to a head. Clinton answered four\nquestions from a group of pool reporters while waiting for a scoop at the\nDaily Twirl ice cream stand. The following day, reporters were awkwardly\ncorralled away from Clinton by a rope line as she marched in a small July 4\nparade in Gorham. Afterward, while speaking to locals at a diner, she\nrefused to answer any questions, even a softball about Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna sit down and have some pie,\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled, before the\ngaggle of press was ushered out, leaving the rope-line incident to take on\ngreater significance because there was no other news to report on.\n\n\n\nThe next phase of the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s media strategy, as unveiled Tuesday, seems\ndesigned to avoid a similar situation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe more media interviews you do,\xe2\x80\x9d\nPalmieri explained to Kurtz, \xe2\x80\x9cthe less any one interaction matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nYet judging from Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s CNN interview, it\xe2\x80\x99s not quite clear the\ncandidate has bought in \xe2\x80\x94 while she sat down for questions, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nreally open up. Asked by CNN why she decided to sit for an interview, and\nwhether anything has changed when it comes to her approach to the media,\nthe famously press-averse candidate had a ready answer.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, nothing\xe2\x80\x99s really changed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI just have a different rhythm\nto my campaign.

The meeting is expected to focus on policy issues,\naccording to sources familiar with the agenda.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMembers of the Congressional Black Caucus are invited to a policy meeting\nwith Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The meeting will be an\noverview on pressing foreign and domestic policy issues impacting the\nAfrican American Community,\xe2\x80\x9d according to an email sent by the Clinton\ncampaign.\n\n\n\nThe black vote will be critical for Clinton in 2016. Democrats will need\nstrong support from African-Americans to push their party over the finish\nline in key congressional races and during the general election. Meanwhile,\nthe GOP is also actively courting black voters.\n\n\n\nThe Tuesday meeting will be one of the first that Clinton has held with the\nCBC since declaring her candidacy earlier this year.

She dodged questions about Bernie Sanders\' appeal, refused to\nsay whether she would seek to raise taxes, dismissed data showing that the\nmajority of Americans\' don\'t trust her, and was repeatedly forced to defend\nher lack of transparency at both the State Department and the Clinton\nFoundation.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, toward the interview\'s conclusion, the long-evasive Democratic\nfront-runner pledged to do more uncomfortable sit-downs like the one she\nhad just, painstakingly, endured.\n\n\n\n"Obviously \'ll be doing a lot more press," Clinton told CNN\'s Brianna\nKeilar.\n\n\n\nThe only reason Clinton hadn\'t been doing national interviews, she said,\nwas because she had been busy listening to American voters.\n\n\n\n"I just have a different rhythm to my campaign. I\'m not running my campaign\nfor the press, I\'m running it for the voters," she explained. "I totally\nrespect the press and what the press has to do. I wanted and was determined\nto have the time that I needed to actually meet and listen to people. I had\nnot been involved in domestic politics while I was Secretary of State, and\nI just wanted to get my own feel, my own time, face to face with people."\n\n\n\n"Everything has its own time and I\'m on my own rhythm," she said.\n\n\n\nWhile that may be true, avoiding the press had become a dominant theme of\nClinton\'s early days on the campaign trail. Clinton said she\'d always\nplanned "to spend the first 90 days... getting my feel of what was going on\nin the country," but her refusal to answer questions from reporters on the\ntrail was so frequent that it made headlines.\n\n\n\nAs Clinton told Keiler, "it\'ll be 90 days [since the launch of her\ncampaign] on Sunday," and the time to open up to the media has come. But if\nAmericans are expecting more transparency from Clinton, they may be sorely\ndisappointed.\n\n\n\n"I didn\'t hear a more open or transparent Hillary Clinton," Keilar said\nafter her interview. "I heard her not engaging on the issue of Bernie\nSanders. He\'s a self-described Democratic socialist. I asked her why is he\ngarnering this support, this enthusiasm, that you don\'t seem to among\nDemocrats. She wouldn\'t engage on that. Even on this concern of if she were\nto face off against Jeb Bush, and there would be this dynastic race between\na Bush and a Clinton... she wouldn\'t engage on that. She was very quick to\nmove on."\n\n\n\nKeilar bears some responsibility for that, of course. She hardly pressed\nClinton to answer the questions she was dodging and rushed from topic to\ntopic. If an interviewer is hoping to pin Clinton down on anything, she or\nhe will probably have to take a more Terry Gross-like approach.\n\n\n\nMore likely, however, is that Clinton herself will decide to be more\ntransparent. There are almost 500 days left till election day; if she is\nserious about "doing a lot more press," she\'ll need to come up with a\nbetter strategy than "dodge and defend."\n\n\n\n*Clinton says Puerto Rico should have access to U.S. bankruptcy laws\n<http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/07/us-usa-election-clinton-puertorico-idUSKCN0PH11920150707>\n// Reuters // Amanda Becker \xe2\x80\x93 June 30, 2015 *\n\n\n\nU.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that\nPuerto Rico\'s public entities should be able to use U.S. bankruptcy laws to\nrestructure some $72 billion in debt.\n\n\n\nLike U.S. states, Puerto Rico, a commonwealth, cannot file for bankruptcy\nprotection. Unlike U.S. states, Puerto Rico\'s public entities, including\nmunicipalities, are not covered by U.S. Chapter 9 bankruptcy laws.\n\n\n\nPuerto Rico\'s non-voting delegate in the U.S. Congress has called for\nlegislation that would allow Puerto Rico to access the same bankruptcy laws\navailable to other municipalities, as has Puerto Rico\'s Governor Alejandro\nGarcia Padilla.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit late Monday affirmed a\nlower court decision to strike down Puerto Rican legislation aimed at\ngranting local municipalities the right to enter bankruptcy, but said\nexcluding the U.S. territory\'s public entities from federal bankruptcy law\nwas unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n"Congress and the Obama administration need to partner with Puerto Rico by\nproviding real support and tools so that Puerto Rico can do the hard work\nit will take to get on a path toward stability and prosperity," Clinton\nsaid in a statement provided to Reuters.\n\n\n\n"As a first step, Congress should provide Puerto Rico the same authority\nthat states already have to enable severely distressed government entities,\nincluding municipalities and public corporations, to restructure their\ndebts under Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code," Clinton added.\n\n\n\nThe White House said last week that there is "no one in the administration"\nthat is "contemplating a federal bailout of Puerto Rico" but that the U.S.\nCongress should "take a look at" whether Puerto Rico\'s government-owned\ncorporations should be able to access Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection.\n\n\n\nCongressional Republicans largely oppose such a step. Republican\npresidential candidate Jeb Bush said in April that he thinks Puerto Rico\'s\npublic agencies should have the ability to use U.S. bankruptcy laws.\n\n\n\n"We\'re not talking about a bailout, we\'re talking about a fair shot at\nsuccess," Clinton said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nClinton said in the statement that the "inconsistent and incoherent"\napplication of U.S. federal law to Puerto Rico contributed to its economic\nsituation, noting high utility rates and unemployment have led to an\neconomy that has shrunk for eight of the last nine years.\n\n\n\n"One troubling example of this treatment is the lack of equity in federal\nfunding for Puerto Rico under Medicaid and Medicare," Clinton said of\nhealth insurance programs sponsored by the U.S. government.\n\n\n\nClinton, also a former first lady, is the front runner for the Democratic\nnomination ahead of the general election in November 2016.\n\n\n\n*Meme says Hillary Clinton\'s top donors are banks and corporations, Bernie\nSanders\' are labor unions\n<http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/07/facebook-posts/meme-says-hillary-clintons-top-donors-are-banks-an/>\n// Politifact // Louis Jacobson \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nAs Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders gains ground on Democratic presidential\nfrontrunner Hillary Clinton, the two candidates\xe2\x80\x99 supporters have been\nsparring, including over campaign donations.\n\n\n\nRecently, a reader sent us a social media meme that paints Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s list\nof donors as dominated by corporate interests, whereas Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 top 10\ndonors come largely from labor unions -- a dichotomy that, to Democratic\nprimary voters, puts Sanders in a more favorable light.\n\n\n\n"Hillary: Top ten donor list. Representing banks, corporations and media,"\nthe meme reads, providing a top-10 list with dollar amounts. "Bernie: Top\nten donor list. Representing people." The meme is topped by each\ncandidate\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign logo. (See the meme below.)\n\n\n\nWe can\xe2\x80\x99t tell who produced this meme, but we thought it was worth a closer\nlook.\n\n\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll start by noting that reasonable people can disagree about whether\nlabor unions represent "people," as the meme says, as opposed to just\nunionized workers, who are a relatively small subset of the entire\npopulation. We\xe2\x80\x99ll also note that while this meme may appeal to union\nsupporters and critics of Wall Street and big corporations, it also could\nbe used as evidence that Sanders is just as reliant on one type of donor --\nlabor unions -- as Clinton is on big corporations.\n\n\n\nWe found that the data cited in the meme refers to cumulative donations\nover the course of each candidate\xe2\x80\x99s political career as calculated by the\nCenter for Responsive Politics, not just fundraising from the current\npresidential cycle. (Clinton and Sanders have announced their fundraising\nhauls for the second quarter of 2015, but have not yet released the full\ndata that is due at the Federal Election Commission by July 15; a more\ncomplete analysis of the data will be compiled by the Center for Responsive\nPolitics after that.)\n\n\n\nFor Clinton, we found a high degree of similarity with the meme when we\nchecked the database on July 6.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s top 10 cumulative donors between between 1999 and 2016 were, in\ndescending order, Citigroup ($782,327), Goldman Sachs ($711,490), DLA Piper\n($628,030), JPMorgan Chase ($620,919), EMILY\xe2\x80\x99s List ($605,174) Morgan\nStanley ($543,065), Time Warner ($411,296), Skadden Arps ($406,640), Lehman\nBrothers ($362,853) and Cablevision Systems ($336,288).\n\n\n\nThat list is quite close to what the meme says. It includes five\nfinancial-services companies, two law firms that do a lot of corporate\nwork, two media conglomerates and one group, EMILY\xe2\x80\x99s list, that supports\nabortion-rights Democratic candidates. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that Clinton was a\nsenator from New York, meaning that some of the donors on her list were not\nsimply Wall Street and corporate behemoths, but also constituents, based in\nNew York.\n\n\n\nThe database results for Sanders are also quite close to what\xe2\x80\x99s in the\nmeme. The data for Sanders goes back to 1989.\n\n\n\nHis top 10 are, in descending order, Machinists/Aerospace Workers union\n($105,000), Teamsters union ($93,700), National Education Association\n($84,350), United Auto Workers ($79,650), United Food & Commercial Workers\nunion ($72,500), Communications Workers of America ($68,000), Laborers\nUnion ($64,000), Carpenters & Joiners Union ($62,000), National Association\nof Letter Carriers ($61,000), and the American Association for Justice\n($60,500).\n\n\n\nIn the meme, the letter carriers\xe2\x80\x99 union makes the list, but the Center for\nResponsive Politics has the American Federation of State, County and\nMunicipal Employees cracking the top 10 instead. Either way, nine of the 10\nare unions, and the tenth is the national association representing\nplaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys. During his career, Sanders has received strong\nsupport from progressive Democrats, so this pattern of financial backing is\nnot surprising.\n\n\n\nSo the meme is pretty accurate for both candidates. However, we see a few\nthings worth pointing out.\n\n\n\nAs we noted, this data refers to their entire political careers back to the\n1990s. Once the full presidential data is released, those figures may show\ndifferent patterns. "That is not made clear" in the meme, said Anthony J.\nCorrado, a campaign-finance expert at Colby College. "Most people would\nassume that this is money raised so far in the 2016 presidential campaign."\n\n\n\nAlso, the "donors" listed are not the ones who gave the money, since that\nwould be against the law. Rather, it was their PACs, employees and those\nemployees\xe2\x80\x99 families. In fact, due to how the forms are filled out, the data\nis less likely to capture individual donations from union members than from\nemployers of companies. Most individual donations are listed by employer,\nand if, say, a union carpenter lists his affiliation as his company, the\nfact that he\xe2\x80\x99s a union member wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be recorded.\n\n\n\nFinally, lists such as this ignore that both candidates are collecting many\nsmall donations, too. According to the Clinton campaign, she raised roughly\n$50 million in contributions under $200 during her \'08 campaign. Data for\nthe 2016 cycle is not available yet.\n\n\n\nAll told, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to look at the top donors on the two lists and say\nboth candidates are captive to a particular set of interest groups, said\nKyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato\xe2\x80\x99s Crystal Ball at the University of\nVirginia Center for Politics. However, he added, "labor is a Democratic\nconstituency whose beliefs generally line up with Democratic policies, and\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a Democratic primary here. So all things being equal,\nSanders\xe2\x80\x99 donor list probably looks better, politically, than Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s."\n\n\n\nKondik added that, as the meme indicates, Clinton has a much larger\nreservoir of money than Sanders has. "The value of having a large financial\nadvantage over your competitors in a primary setting seems to be worth\noccasional questions about how the financial advantage was built," he said.\n\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\n\nSocial media memes say that Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s top 10 donors are mainly "banks,\ncorporations and media," while Bernie Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 top 10 donors are labor\nunions. This contention fits quite closely with campaign data from the\nCenter for Responsive Politics. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that this data\nrefers to cumulative donations as far back as the 1980s, rather than just\ndonations to their current presidential bids. The statement is accurate but\nneeds clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.\n\n\n\n*Clinton vows to make \xe2\x80\x98comprehensive\xe2\x80\x99 immigration reform cornerstone issue\n<http://www.radioiowa.com/2015/07/07/clinton-vows-to-make-comprehensive-immigration-reform-cornerstone-issue/>\n// Radio Iowa // Kay Henderson \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke to a packed room in\nthe Iowa City Public Library this afternoon, accusing Republicans of\nproposing a \xe2\x80\x9cU-turn\xe2\x80\x9d for the country and promising as president she would\npush for \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive\xe2\x80\x9d immigration reform.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of our people who are working hard here are people who have earned\nthe right to stay and we have to change our system to take advantage of\ntheir contributions,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n\n\n\nClinton said there\xe2\x80\x99s no way to deport up to 12 million undocumented\nimmigrants and Clinton used the word \xe2\x80\x9csad\xe2\x80\x9d to describe how Republican\npresidential candidates are addressing the issue.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve always prided ourselves on being a nation of immigrants\xe2\x80\xa6and then I\nhear, you know, the Republican candidates \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s not only, you know,\nthe ones that are most vitriolic \xe2\x80\x94 none of them support a path to\ncitizenship,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cAll of them would basically consign immigrants\nto second-class status.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton did not directly mention Republican presidential candidate Donald\nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s remarks about Mexicans which have caused controversy, but Clinton,\nin general, accused Republicans of engaging in a \xe2\x80\x9cdestructive\xe2\x80\x9d debate on\nimmigration.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd let\xe2\x80\x99s face the fact we need comprehensive immigration reform,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care how many people running for president on the Republican\nside try to demean immigrants, insult immigrants, cast aspersions on\nimmigrants.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDuring her speech to the crowd, Clinton mentioned the case of a popular\nIowa City pastor who was recently deported and someone in the crowd asked\nher about the case, too. Clinton pledged as president she would deport\ncriminals, but she\xe2\x80\x99d urge prosecutors to use discretion in similar cases.\n\n\n\nAbout 350 people made it into the library to see and hear Clinton, while\nabout 100 more gathered on the sidewalk outside waiting for the chance to\nshake Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s hand as she left. Clinton held a news conference inside the\nlibrary after the event, joking with her staff that they should remove the\n\xe2\x80\x9crope\xe2\x80\x9d behind which reporters and photographers were assembled. It was a\nreference to the image of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s press team using a rope to corral\nreporters following Clinton in a New Hampshire parade. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s staff\nremoved the barrier and the questioning began.\n\n\n\n*Clinton emails may revive environmental group\'s lawsuit\n<http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clinton-emails-may-revive-environmental-groups-lawsuit/article/2567701>\n// The Washington Examiner // Sarah Westwood \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nAn environmental group whose request for records related to the Keystone\nPipeline was reportedly hampered while Hillary Clinton served as secretary\nof state is considering taking the case to court for the second time.\n\n\n\nBen Schreiber, climate and energy program director at Friends of the Earth,\nsaid his group has weighed the option of relitigation in the weeks since\nlearning that Clinton\'s chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, had interfered in the\nagency\'s handling of Freedom of Information Act requests for Keystone\ndocuments.\n\n\n\nWhile Schreiber said Friends of the Earth received a number of emails\ninvolving Clinton\'s top aides when the original case settled during\nClinton\'s tenure, he noted the State Department did not then have any of\nthe secretary\'s emails to produce.\n\n\n\n"For us, this is very much a good governance thing," Schreiber said. "It\'s\npretty clear that at the highest levels of the State Department while\nHillary Clinton was secretary of state, the agency did everything in their\npower to undermine the integrity of the Freedom of Information Act, and\nthat for us is troubling."\n\n\n\nThe discovery that Clinton has now submitted thousands of emails to the\nagency that could prove responsive to Friends of the Earth\'s 2010 request\nmeans the group could potentially force a different outcome if it sued the\nState Department a second time.\n\n\n\nThe request sought any communications between State Department staff and\nPaul Elliott, a lobbyist for TransCanada and former Clinton campaign aide.\nTransCanada is the company that would build the Keystone Pipeline if the\nproject received the necessary government approval.\n\n\n\nSchreiber pointed to a Wall Street Journal article published in May that\nsuggested Mills began screening documents set for release under FOIA after\nFriends of the Earth obtained an email that illustrated the cozy\nrelationship between Elliott and State staffers.\n\n\n\n"The Keystone documents Ms. Mills objected to were all either held back or\nredacted," the Journal report said. "After Ms. Mills began scrutinizing\ndocuments, the State Department\'s disclosure of records related to Keystone\nfell off sharply, documents that include a court filing show."\n\n\n\nFriends of the Earth did obtain hundreds of emails sent between top State\nDepartment officials and Elliott in 2011 through the lawsuit, however.\n\n\n\nThose emails reveal Clinton\'s staff was indeed concerned about how the\nagency responded to FOIA requests.\n\n\n\nFor example Alexander Yuan, a State Department official, forwarded a news\narticle to staff that reported the agency\'s decision to comply with the\nFriends of the Earth FOIA request for records concerning Elliott.\n\n\n\n"Interesting how we at State learn about these decisions," Yuan wrote of\nthe Feb. 18, 2011 article. Yuan also suggested sending a state official to\nspeak with the FOIA office in person.\n\n\n\nThe exchange suggests State Department staff may have felt they had sway\nover how the agency responded to FOIA requests.\n\n\n\nIn another email exchange from May 2011, a different State official raised\nconcerns that the agency had received more inquiries about "the Secretary\'s\nrelationship with TransCanada lobbyist Paul Elliott and the FOIA."\n\n\n\nAides circulated "press guidance" about how to deal with questions about\nElliott\'s ties to Clinton and the high-profile project he was advocating.\n\n\n\nSchreiber noted the decision to revisit the lawsuit was still a matter of\ndiscussion, citing the cost of litigation as a concern, but said the new\ninformation about Mills\' meddling with FOIA requests prompted Friends of\nthe Earth to begin considering reopening the case.\n\n\n\n*Hillary On San Francisco Illegal Immigrant Murder: \xe2\x80\x98The City Made A\nMistake\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://dailycaller.com/2015/07/07/hillary-on-san-francisco-illegal-immigrant-murder-the-city-made-a-mistake-video/>\n// The Daily Caller // Al Weaver \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nIn her first national television interview,  Hillary Clinton said that San\nFrancisco \xe2\x80\x9cmade a mistake\xe2\x80\x9d by not deporting Francisco Sanchez, the illegal\nimmigrant that murdered Kate Steinle last week and had been deported five\ntimes.\n\n\n\nClinton told CNN\xe2\x80\x99s Brianna Keilar that she has \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely no support for a\ncity\xe2\x80\x9d that does not act when they disregard evidence \xe2\x80\x9cthat should be acted\nupon,\xe2\x80\x9d though she did not respond to Keilar\xe2\x80\x99s point that she supported\nsanctuary cities during her initial presidential run in 2008.\n\n\n\nBRIANNA KEILAR: Last week an undocumented immigrant who had been deported\nfive times killed a 32-year-old, Kate Steinle, in San Francisco \xe2\x80\x94 a\nsanctuary city where local law enforcement does not enforce federal\nimmigration laws. When you last ran for president, you supported sanctuary\ncities. In light of this terrible incident, does that change anything about\nyour view on this?\n\n\n\nHILLARY CLINTON: Well, what should be done is any city should listen to the\nDepartment of Homeland Security, which as I understand it, urged them to\ndeport this man again after he got out of prison another time. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a\ncase where we\xe2\x80\x99ve deported, we\xe2\x80\x99ve deported, we\xe2\x80\x99ve deported, he ends back up\nin our country, and I think the city made a mistake. The city made a\nmistake not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt\nshould be deported. So I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores\nthe strong evidence that should be acted on. However, there are \xe2\x80\x94 if it\nwere the first time traffic citation many, if it were something minor \xe2\x80\x94 a\nmisdemeanor, that\xe2\x80\x99s entirely different.

CNN\'s Brianna\nKeilar, who will do the interview, has asked for suggestions on what she\nmight ask. Here are three questions for the former secretary of state:\n\n\n\n1) In March, you said, \'I \xe2\x80\xa6 provided all my emails that could possibly be\nwork-related\' to the State Department. Now, State says there are some\nemails you didn\'t turn over. Did you tell the truth in March?\n\n\n\n2) After turning over some of your emails to the State Department, you\ndestroyed everything: all emails, all backups. Why?\n\n\n\n3) On Aug. 16, 2012, Ambassador Chris Stevens warned State of dangerous\nsecurity problems in Benghazi, Libya, saying U.S. facilities there could\nnot survive a \'coordinated attack.\' Top administration officials Leon\nPanetta and Martin Dempsey testified that they knew about the Stevens\nwarning.

Clinton election a quarter century after her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\nfirst presidential election is a coincidence in an America in which\n\xe2\x80\x9canybody can run for president.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nCNN\xe2\x80\x99s Brianna Keilar also asked Clinton about Republican candidate Donald\nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s recent comments equating Mexican immigrants to \xe2\x80\x9crapists.\xe2\x80\x9d Keilar\nnoted that Trump had previously donated to the Clinton Foundation but that\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t stop Clinton from railing against Trump, saying \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very\ndisappointed in those comments and I feel very bad and very disappointed\nwith him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut Clinton was quick to pivot from Trump to the entire Republican field,\ntelling Keilar that she was also disappointed \xe2\x80\x9cwith the Republican Party\nfor not responding immediately and saying enough, stop it. But they are all\nin the, you know, in the same general area on immigration,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\nrange across a spectrum of being either grudgingly welcome or hostile\ntowards immigrants.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton singled out Jeb Bush specifically, noting, \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in a\npath to citizenship. If he did at one time, he no longer does.\xe2\x80\x9d And\ndistinguishing herself from the GOP field, Clinton said, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cI am 100% behind\ncomprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut not all Republican candidates oppose comprehensive immigration reform\nthat includes a pathway to citizenship. South Carolina Senator Lindsey\nGraham, a long shot hopeful, was quick to remind CNN\xe2\x80\x99s Maeve Reston that\nhe, in fact, has been a long time supporter of a pathway to citizenship.\n\n\n\nAnd as for those pesky emails? Clinton dismissed the affair as the latest\nin a long saga of Republican investigations into the Clintons. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\nbeing blown up with no basis in law or in fact. That\xe2\x80\x99s fine, I get it \xe2\x80\x94\nthis is being, in effect, used by the Republicans in the Congress. OK,\xe2\x80\x9d\nClinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I want people to understand what the truth is, and the\ntruth is, everything I did was permitted and I went above and beyond what\nwas expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nKeilar delved into other areas of controversy for Clinton, asking if she\nwould consider shutting down the Clinton Foundation if she were to win the\nWhite House. Clinton defended the nonprofit\xe2\x80\x99s work as \xe2\x80\x9ccritical,\xe2\x80\x9d saying,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no plans to say or do anything about the Clinton foundation other\nthan to say I am proud of it and I think for the good of the world, its\nwork should continue.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton surmised much of the foundation\xe2\x80\x99s success stemmed from the work of\nher husband, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cmaybe it\xe2\x80\x99s because it\xe2\x80\x99s because my husband knows so\nmany people in the world and he is so creative and he is so smart but he\nwas able to put together solutions to problems wether it was HIV/AIDS or\nchildhood obesity in our country or expanding farm productivity in Africa\nthat was hard for other to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd Clinton, who supported so-called \xe2\x80\x9csanctuary cities\xe2\x80\x9d during her last\npresidential run, was forceful in her criticism of San Francisco for\nignoring immigration detention requests from the federal government. An\nundocumented immigrant who had been deported multiple times was arrested in\nthe recent killing of a young woman, and Donald Trump has used the murder\nto bolster his argument that Mexican immigrants are criminals. \xe2\x80\x9cThe city\nmade a mistake not to deport someone that the federal government thought\nshould be deported \xe2\x80\xa6 I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores\nthe strong evidence that should be acted on,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said, but she made\nclear that such scrutiny would not be required for minor or misdemeanor\ncharges.\n\n\n\nClinton also weighed in on the debate over adding a woman to the 10 dollar\nbill, saying \xe2\x80\x9cit may be more appropriate to look at the 20 than the 10.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton: GOP on \'Spectrum of Hostility\' Towards Immigrants\n<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/hillary-clinton-gop-spectrum-hostility-towards-immigrants-n388236>\n// NBC News // Carrie Dann \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton on Tuesday said that the GOP 2016 field is on "a spectrum\nof hostility" towards immigrants, accusing Republicans of failing to\ncondemn Donald Trump immediately for his controversial comments about\nMexicans.\n\n\n\nClinton told CNN in an interview that she is "very disappointed" in Trump\'s\nremarks, adding that the Republicans seeking the White House are "all in\nthe same general area on immigration."\n\n\n\n"They range across a spectrum of being either grudgingly welcome or hostile\ntowards immigrants," she said, adding that none - including Jeb Bush - back\na pathway to citizenship for the undocumented population.\n\n\n\n"If he did at one time, he no longer does," she said of the former Florida\ngovernor\'s stance on creating such a pathway.\n\n\n\nThe 2016 Democratic frontrunner emphasized that she is "100% behind\ncomprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship."\n\n\n\n"I think that we know we\'re not going to deport 11 or 12 million people,"\nshe added. "We shouldn\'t be breaking up families. We shouldn\'t be stopping\npeople from having the opportunity to be fully integrated legally within\nour country."\n\n\n\nThe interview was Clinton\'s first sit-down with a national television\nnetwork since declaring her candidacy. More of the interview is slated to\nair this afternoon on CNN.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton on Her \'Last Rodeo\'\n<http://www.nationaljournal.com/2016-elections/hillary-clinton-on-her-last-rodeo-20150707>\n// The National Journal // Emma Roller \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nBefore Hillary Clinton spoke to a crowd of roughly 250 supporters in the\nIowa City Public Library on Tuesday, a young female campaign staffer had a\nfew requests for the attendees. First, she asked those in attendance to\npull out their smartphones and "like" Clinton\'s local Facebook page for\nIowa and Johnson County. Then, she rattled off a phone number for the\nsupporters to text in exchange for "updates" (aka donation pleas) from the\ncampaign, which announced that it added 20 field organizers to its already\nlarge Iowa staff Tuesday.\n\n\n\nBut the actual content of Clinton\'s speech was refreshingly free of\ncampaign artifice. Yes, she began with her routine spiel about income\ninequality, health care, and her excitement at becoming a grandmother, but\nher remarks felt more off-the-cuff than usual. Perhaps in an attempt to\nembrace her inner nerd, Clinton recalled spending hours in her local\nlibrary during summer vacations while growing up.\n\n\n\nOne anecdote from her career as secretary of State in particular stood out\nas something new not only to the attendees, but to the reporters who\nobsessively cover the Clinton campaign as well. She told a story about the\n2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nClinton and President Obama were trying to negotiate terms with India and\nChina\xe2\x80\x94two of the fastest-developing countries in the world\xe2\x80\x94for a climate\nchange agreement.\n\n\n\nThe problem: China and India\'s leaders were nowhere to be found. Clinton\nsaid she and Obama "sent out scouts," who found that the leaders were\nmeeting in a clandestine conference room. Clinton and Obama marched to the\nroom, she said, and pushed past Chinese security guards to confront the\nheads of state. As a result, the assembled countries signed an accord\noutlining emissions pledges and other goals for energy use, though much of\nthe text was nonbinding.\n\n\n\n"We would not be in as strong a position if the president had not pursued\neverything from auto emissions to utility controls," Clinton added on\nTuesday.\n\n\n\nAside from climate change, Clinton gradually began filling in some of the\ndetails of her economic and social agenda. And she opened up a little more\non Democratic politics and her own future.\n\n\n\nThe economy and immigration:\n\n\n\nClinton blamed Republican presidents for the recent economic crises in the\nU.S., and said that trickle-down economics needs to be "buried six feet\nunder."\n\n\n\n"There seems to be a pattern here, and we cannot afford to go back to the\nfailed economic policies of the past," she said. "We have to be committed\nto electing a Democrat who will build on what works with actual evidence\n... so that we build shared prosperity that everybody benefits from."\n\n\n\nOn income inequality and immigration reform, there is a yawning chasm\nbetween Republicans and Democrats, especially in Iowa. A recent Quinnipiac\nUniversity poll found that 70 percent of likely Republican caucus voters\nsay the government should not pursue policies to reduce income inequality,\nwhile 91 percent of their Democratic counterparts said the government\nshould pursue such policies.\n\n\n\nThe same poll found that 46 percent of Iowa Republicans say undocumented\nimmigrants living in the U.S. should be required to leave, while 83 percent\nof Democrats said the immigrants should be given a path to citizenship.\n\n\n\nClinton called the Republican discourse on immigration a "very stale,\ndestructive debate."\n\n\n\n"I don\'t care how many people running for president on the Republican side\ntry to demean immigrants, insult immigrants, cast aspersions on\nimmigrants," Clinton said. "We are not going to deport 11 or 12 million\npeople."\n\n\n\nAfter calling out her Republican opponents for opposing a path to\ncitizenship\xe2\x80\x94some of them in fits and starts\xe2\x80\x94Clinton said some illegal\nimmigrants "have earned the right to stay." She mentioned one such\nimmigrant by name: Max Villatoro, an Iowa pastor who was deported in March.\n\n\n\nClinton said that, if elected president, she would start by returning to\nthe bipartisan immigration bill that passed the Senate in 2010 but stalled\nout in the House.\n\n\n\n"That would be my starting point. You voted for it once. Let\'s vote for it\nagain."\n\n\n\nEducation:\n\n\n\nClinton stressed public education, especially the need to improve the\ngovernment\'s Head Start early childhood program and to implement universal\npre-kindergarten.\n\n\n\n"If we do not have early childhood education, we will never get the results\nfor the vast majority of our children as we could," she said. "If we don\'t\ntackle 0 to 5, we\'re going to lose out."\n\n\n\nHealth care:\n\n\n\nShe asked the crowd if they were "thrilled" about the Supreme Court\nupholding the Affordable Care Act, but warned that the liberal success\ncould easily unravel come 2017.\n\n\n\n"If a Republican is elected president, that will be the end of the\nAffordable Care Act," she said. "We have to succeed President Obama with a\nDemocrat, to protect, defend, and fix the Affordable Care Act."\n\n\n\nContraception:\n\n\n\n"If we provide family planning services, more young women have a chance to\nfinish their education before they become parents," she said.\n\n\n\nAbortion:\n\n\n\n"I will always defend a woman\'s right to choose," she said. "That is\nsomething that should no longer be debatable."\n\n\n\nCampaign finance:\n\n\n\nClinton called the Supreme Court\'s Citizens United decision "one of the\nworst ever made," adding, "we\'ve got to get dark, unaccountable money out\nof politics once and for all."\n\n\n\nGun control:\n\n\n\n"I think it\'s pretty clear that a majority of Americans and a majority of\ngun owners agree with universal background checks" to keep guns away from\ndomestic abusers, the mentally unstable, "and even terrorists," Clinton\nsaid.\n\n\n\n"Let\'s not be afraid of the gun lobby, which does not represent the real\nmajority of gun owners in America," she added.\n\n\n\nOn Democratic losses in the 2014 midterm elections, and what she hopes to\nleave behind:\n\n\n\nRepublicans, Clinton said, have shown an advantage during midterm elections\nthat Democrats need to reckon with. "They know the importance of midterm\nelections because they show up, and we don\'t," she said.\n\n\n\nClinton stressed that she wants more young people getting involved in\ngovernment. "This is my last rodeo.

The literal corralling\nspurred heaps of criticism, both of Clinton\'s campaign for being too\ncontrolling and the press corps for being too subservient.\n\n\n\nThe incident also prompted a larger question for newsrooms grappling with\nso many candidates to cover and so much information to sift through this\nelection cycle: Is sending a reporter to a typical Fourth of July parade\nworth the hassle?\n\n\n\nDaily Beast executive editor Noah Shachtman, who criticized the Clinton\ncampaign\xe2\x80\x99s heavy-handed tactics, said the incident affirmed his site\xe2\x80\x99s\ntactical approach to the crowded field. "We have a small staff, so we\xe2\x80\x99re\nnot going to cover every burp and gaffe of all 900 people running for\npresident," said Shachtman, who did not send a reporter to the parade.\n\n\n\nHe suggested reporters\' time is better spent digging through documents and\nspeaking to people impacted by political leaders\' decisions, rather than\nflocking to stage-managed events. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do chock-a-block\ncommodity news," he added, "and so, frankly, these events like parades are\nmost of the time so newsless they\xe2\x80\x99re not even worth covering.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut it\'s the possibility of news being made that helps other editors\njustify dispatching reporters to the front lines of flag-strewn parade\nroutes or meet-and-greets at the local diner. A candidate sticking to\ntalking points at one event may open up at the next to a voter, or critic,\nthus offering a unique glimpse into his or her candidacy.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe travel with candidates to see them in action, to see them interact with\nvoters, to see who (and how many people) turn out for their events and to\ngather voters\' impressions,\xe2\x80\x9d Carolyn Ryan, Washington bureau chief for The\nNew York Times, said in an email.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll these moments are revealing, in their own way: You never know when a\ncollege student is going to press Jeb Bush about Iraq or when Martin\nO\'Malley is going to have to talk directly to people upset about the\nviolence in Baltimore,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ryan. She also singled out Okie Howe, a\n98-year-old Army veteran quoted in the paper\xe2\x80\x99s round-up of July 4 campaign\nevents around New Hampshire, who spoke about being a Democrat who was "sick\nof Hillary Clinton" but would likely vote for her anyway.\n\n\n\nThe goal, in essence, is to ensure that you\'re present when a\nnon-manufactured campaign event takes place, even if it means suffering the\noccasional humiliation of a human corralling.\n\n\n\nBuzzFeed political editor Katherine Miller said that while covering 2016\ncandidates, especially Clinton, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of unpredictable\nmoments or situations where you see them interact with a lot of unknowns.\xe2\x80\x9d\nClinton, she noted, was only at the July 4 parade \xe2\x80\x9cfor 20 minutes and a ton\nof stuff happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe resulting dispatch, from reporter Ruby Cramer, \xe2\x80\x9cshowed what it looks\nlike in a controlled environment when Clinton is speaking versus a very\nuncontrolled environment and what it says about her, what it says about the\ncampaign," Miller said.\n\n\n\nThat report doesn\'t focus on policy. But for the past three months, much of\nthe story surrounding Clinton has been process-themed -- from her handling\nof emails while secretary of State and the company she keeps to the\ncombustible relationship she has with the press corps.\n\n\n\nClinton, the Democratic front-runner long before she officially jumped in\nthe race in April, essentially has a mini-White House press corps along for\nthe ride. Candidates trying to bolster their name recognition would kill\nfor such attention, but the Clinton team, managing the movements of one of\nthe most famous people in the world, is more likely to bristle at\nreporters\xe2\x80\x99 desire for increased access to the candidate.\n\n\n\nBut so far, disputes over access haven\xe2\x80\x99t led news organizations to stop\ncovering Clinton\'s every move. And neither The New York Times nor BuzzFeed,\npart of a 14-member traveling press pool covering Clinton, is altering\ntheir game plan for dispatching reporters in light of Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s debacle.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the rope line was bad optics but a bit overblown on Twitter,\xe2\x80\x9d Ryan\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI do wish Mrs. Clinton had taken some time to answer more reporters\'\nquestions before or after the parade.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton: \xe2\x80\x98People Should and Do Trust Me\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/07/politics/hillary-clinton-iowa-first-interview/>\n// CNN // Eric Bradner \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015*\n\n\n\nIn Hillary Clinton\'s first national interview of the 2016 race, she\nattacked her Republican rivals on immigration and dismissed the suggestion\nthat the American people have a problem trusting her.\n\n\n\n"People should and do trust me," she told CNN\'s Brianna Keilar.\n\n\n\nShe blamed the "barrage of attacks that are largely fomented by and coming\nfrom the right" for fueling a perception that trust is an area of\nvulnerability for her.\n\n\n\nClinton displayed little hesitation about attacking Republicans herself,\nsaying that she is "very disappointed" in Donald Trump for his comments\nabout immigrants and in the Republican Party for not condemning his remarks\nmore quickly.\n\n\n\nShe then pivoted to skewering the entire GOP field for their immigration\nstance, saying, "They\'re on a spectrum of hostility, which I think is\nreally regrettable in a nation of immigrants like ours."\n\n\n\nThe interview foreshadowed the Clinton that will hit the campaign trail in\nthe coming months as election season heats up. She was occasionally\ndefensive, especially when pressed on whether she has any responsibility\nfor the public\'s mistrust in her. But she had no problem with going on the\noffense against her Republican challengers.\n\n\n\nClinton took direct aim at GOP rival Jeb Bush.\n\n\n\n"He doesn\'t believe in a path to citizenship. If he did at one time, he no\nlonger does," she said.\n\n\n\nThe Bush campaign rebuffed Clinton\'s criticism and instead accused her of\nflip-flopping on immigration.\n\n\n\n"Hillary Clinton will say anything to get elected and her numerous\nflip-flops on immigration prove it," said Emily Benavides, a Bush campaign\nspokeswoman, in a statement.\n\n\n\n"As he outlined in his book on this issue, Gov. Bush believes in a\nconservative legislative solution to fix our broken immigration system that\nincludes earned legal status for those currently in the country after they\npay fines and taxes, learn English and commit no substantial crimes while\nsecuring our border," she said.\n\n\n\nClinton also blamed the city of San Francisco for mishandling the case of\nan undocumented immigrant who had been deported five times before killing a\nwoman there -- in a sanctuary city where local law enforcement do not\nenforce federal immigration laws.\n\n\n\n"The city made a mistake, not to deport someone that the federal government\nstrongly felt should be deported," she said. "I have absolutely no support\nfor a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on."\n\n\n\nThe full interview aired Tuesday on "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer"\nand will re-air at 8 p.m. on "Anderson Cooper 360."\n\n\n\nPressed on why the public has a hard time trusting her, Clinton maintained\nshe faced "the same kind of onslaught" in her two New York Senate campaigns\nand her confirmation as secretary of state, and said Republicans have\nsought to turn controversies like her use of a private email address and\nthe Clinton Foundation\'s actions against her.\n\n\n\nAnd that, Clinton said, is why national polls and swing-state surveys have\nfound that a majority of voters say they don\'t see her as honest and\ntrustworthy.\n\n\n\nA Quinnipiac University Swing State poll found that by margins of 8 to 14\npercentage points voters in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania are skeptical of\nClinton\'s trustworthiness.\n\n\n\nIn Florida, 51% of voters hold the negative view of Clinton, compared to\n43% who feel she is trustworthy. In Ohio, 53% of voters find Clinton not\ntrustworthy, compared to 40% who do. And in Pennsylvania, 54% of voters\ndon\'t find her honest, while 40% do.\n\n\n\n"I think it\'s understandable that when questions are raised, people maybe\nare thinking about them and wondering about them," Clinton said.\n\n\n\n"But I have every confidence that during the course of this campaign,\npeople are going to know who will fight for them, who will be there when\nthey need them, and that\'s the kind of person I am and that\'s what I will\ndo, not only in a campaign but as president," she said.\n\n\n\nAsked whether she played a role in the sentiment reflected in polls that\nshe\'s not trustworthy, Clinton said: "This has been a theme that has been\nused against me and my husband for many, many years. And at the end of the\nday, I think voters sort it all out."\n\n\n\nShe similarly dismissed questions about her use of a personal email address\non a private server while serving as secretary of state.\n\n\n\nClinton said she turned over all the emails -- including some which show\nher using a secured fax machine, or asking for iced tea during meetings --\nthat had anything to do with public business, and that she broke no laws in\nsticking with one device because she\'s not technically savvy.\n\n\n\n"This is being blown up with no basis in law or in fact. That\'s fine, I get\nit -- this is being, in effect, used by the Republicans in the Congress.\nOK," Clinton said. "But I want people to understand what the truth is, and\nthe truth is, everything I did was permitted and I went above and beyond\nwhat was expected."\n\n\n\nIf elected president, Clinton said she doesn\'t have any plans to push for\nthe closure of the Clinton Foundation -- which has faced criticism for\naccepting foreign contributions during her tenure as America\'s top diplomat\n-- if she\'s elected president.\n\n\n\n"I have no plans to say or do anything about the Clinton foundation other\nthan to say I am proud of it and I think for the good of the world, its\nwork should continue," she said.\n\n\n\nThe interview spanned a broad range of topics -- among them a discussion of\nadding a woman to the $10 bill. Clinton declined to select a favorite woman\nfor the honor, but suggested a woman should instead go on a $20.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t like the idea that as a compromise you would basically have two\npeople on the same bill. One would be a woman. That sounds pretty second\nclass to me," Clinton said. "So I think a woman should have her own bill."\n\n\n\nNor would she pick which Saturday Night Live actress, Amy Poehler or Kate\nMcKinnon, plays the best Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\n"Amy\'s a friend of mine and Kate\'s doing a great job. You\'re not going to\nget me to pick one or the other," she said. "I think I\'m the best Hillary\nClinton."\n\n\n\n*Top 8 takeaways from Hillary Clinton\'s first big interview\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/07/politics/hillary-clinton-cnn-interview/> //\nCNN // Eric Bradner - July 7, 2015*\n\n\n\nIowa City, Iowa - Hillary Clinton was keenly aware of how long she\'d gone\nas a presidential candidate without sitting down for a nationally televised\ninterview.\n\n\n\n"Ninety days on Sunday," she told CNN\'s Brianna Keilar on Tuesday in the\nfirst of what will be a series of national interviews.\n\n\n\nAs Bernie Sanders rises in the polls among liberals and Republicans\ncontinue to make Clinton the subject of a barrage of attacks, her answers\noffered some insight into the Democratic frontrunner\'s thinking at this\nstage of the campaign.\n\n\n\nHere are eight of Clinton\'s key statements -- and why they matter for 2016:\n\n\n\n1. "This has been a theme that has been used against me and my husband for\nmany, many years."\n\n\n\nThree decades in the limelight have meant both Bill and Hillary Clinton\nhave weathered intense scrutiny and criticism. Clinton acknowledged that\npolls show a majority of Americans don\'t view her as honest and trustworthy\n-- but true to her long-standing posture declined to take any\nresponsibility for the sentiment.\n\n\n\nThe latest round of public incredulity focuses on her use of a private\nemail address while serving as secretary of state, and her family\nfoundation\'s acceptance of foreign contributions during that tenure.\n\n\n\nClinton sees those as the latest in a long line of unfair attacks from\nRepublicans, rather than legitimate lines of inquiry. And she claims she\'s\nnot sweating the "trust" problem.\n\n\n\n"At the end of the day, I think voters sort it all out," Clinton said.\n\n\n\n2. "They\'re on a spectrum of hostility, which I think it\'s really\nregrettable in a nation of immigrants like ours."\n\n\n\nIt was a direct assault on the entire Republican presidential field -- and\nJeb Bush, in particular.\n\n\n\nClinton used a question about Donald Trump\'s controversial remarks about\nMexican immigrants to hammer her GOP opponents, saying that they don\'t\nsupport providing undocumented immigrants with pathways to gaining U.S.\ncitizenship. By painting Bush, Trump and the rest of the Republican field\nwith the same brush, Clinton hopes to hurt the entire party in a general\nelection with Latino voters.\n\n\n\n"I\'m very disappointed in those comments and I feel very bad and very\ndisappointed with him and with the Republican Party for not responding\nimmediately and saying, \'Enough, stop it,\'" Clinton said.\n\n\n\nBush -- and other Republicans -- eventually criticized Trump\'s comments,\nbut only after several days had passed.\n\n\n\n3. "The city made a mistake not to deport someone that the federal\ngovernment strongly felt should be deported."\n\n\n\nClinton still senses some danger on the issue of illegal immigration,\ncriticizing San Francisco for failing to deport a man who\'d been sent back\nto Mexico five times before -- and has admitted killing a woman after\nreturning again.\n\n\n\nThe man was released from police custody in April after drug charges were\ndropped, and he wasn\'t deported because San Francisco is a "sanctuary city"\nfor undocumented immigrants, despite the Department of Homeland Security\nweighing in.\n\n\n\nShe\'s said she supports going further than President Barack Obama has on\nundocumented immigrants -- but only for those who obey the law.\n\n\n\n"I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence\nthat should be acted on," she said.\n\n\n\n4. "I am happy to have a chance to get out and run my campaign as I see fit\nand let other candidates do exactly the same."\n\n\n\nIn other words: I\'m not going to talk about Bernie Sanders.\n\n\n\nRecent polls show Sanders climbing closer to Clinton in New Hampshire and\nIowa, two key early voting states. But Clinton isn\'t yet ready to directly\nengage Sanders, training her fire instead on Republicans.\n\n\n\nThat\'s in part because her campaign wants to see whether Sanders has\nstaying power, and in part because by attacking him, she risks elevating\nhis already growing stature.\n\n\n\n5. "One of the things I learned last time is organize, organize, organize."\n\n\n\nClinton is trying to atone for the sins of her 2008 campaign among Iowa\nDemocratic caucus voters by taking the process seriously.\n\n\n\nIt\'s why she was in Iowa City -- in the heart of eastern Iowa, which went\nheavily for Barack Obama in the 2008 caucuses.\n\n\n\nClinton has shown she\'s able to learn from her mistakes: Those who followed\nher 2008 Iowa campaign say they see a looser, more comfortable candidate;\nand she\'s ejected many of the most divisive figures from that previous bid.\n\n\n\nNow, she\'s touting having signed up a volunteer to work the caucus process\nfor her in all of Iowa\'s more than 1,600 precincts.\n\n\n\n"You\'ve got to get people committed, and then they will bring more people\nthrough," Clinton said.\n\n\n\n6. "I\'m not running my campaign for the press. I\'m running it for the\nvoters."\n\n\n\nThroughout her nascent campaign, Clinton has been criticized for rarely\ntaking questions from the press. That criticism was thrust to the forefront\nagain over the Fourth of July holiday when photos of reporters being held\nback by a moving rope line at a parade were published.\n\n\n\nInstead, Clinton said she\'s preferred small group events that have allowed\nher to reconnect with average Americans after more than six years out of\ndomestic politics. She\'s also been a tireless fundraiser, attending house\nparty after house party to raise $45 million in the campaign\'s first three\nmonths.\n\n\n\nStill, Clinton said she\'s ready to shift gears: The CNN interview, she\nsaid, was the first of what will be a number of sit-downs with national\noutlets.\n\n\n\n7. "A secure fax machine, which is harder to work than the regular."\n\n\n\nA tense exchange about Clinton\'s use of a personal email address on a\nprivate server while at the State Department turned light, when Clinton\ncracked jokes and once again sought to send the message: Nothing to see\nhere, let\'s move along.\n\n\n\n"Now, I didn\'t have to turn over anything," Clinton said. "I chose to turn\nover 55,000 pages because I wanted to go above and beyond what was expected\nof me because I knew the vast majority of everything that was official\nalready was in the State Department system."\n\n\n\nThen, she added: "Now I think it\'s kind of fun. People get to see a\nreal-time, behind-the-scenes look at what I was emailing about and what I\nwas communicating about."\n\n\n\nKeilar highlighted the emails that showed Clinton messaging now-top aide\nJohn Podesta about wearing socks to bed, and an exchange depicting an epic\nstruggle by Clinton to operate a fax machine.\n\n\n\nOn the latter, Clinton couldn\'t help but offer a defense.\n\n\n\n"Yes, a secure fax machine, which is harder to work than the regular," she\nsaid.\n\n\n\n8. "I think I\'m the best Hillary Clinton."\n\n\n\nAsked by Keilar which "Saturday Night Live" actress best satirizes her on\nthe NBC program, Clinton demurred, but offered praise for both Amy Poehler,\nwho impersonated her in 2008, and Kate McKinnon, who has done the job so\nfar in this campaign cycle.\n\n\n\n"Amy\'s a friend of mine and Kate\'s doing a great job. You\'re not going to\nget me to pick one or the other," she said. "I think I\'m the best Hillary\nClinton, to be honest."\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton Tweets & Deletes This Photo Of Her Shaking Hands With A\nWhite Man With A "White" Tattoo\n<http://www.bustle.com/articles/95687-hillary-clinton-tweets-deletes-this-photo-of-her-shaking-hands-with-a-white-man-with>\n// Bustle // Melissah Yang \xe2\x80\x93 July 8, 2015*\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton is making the rounds in every corner of the good ol\xe2\x80\x99 U.S.\nof A., and one of her most recent stops was at Lebanon, New Hampshire,\nwhere she encountered all sorts of characters during her campaign trip. One\nunidentified fellow stirred up some deep rumblings online after her\nofficial Twitter account on Tuesday tweeted and then deleted a photo of\nClinton shaking hands with a white man whose forearm sported a very visible\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhite\xe2\x80\x9d tattoo. Now, we don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily know what the \xe2\x80\x9cwhite\xe2\x80\x9d tattoo\nactually stands for, but I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure the guy\xe2\x80\x99s tat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have\nto do with his undying love for Breaking Bad\xe2\x80\x99s Walter White.\n\n\n\nThe now deleted photo was captioned with, \xe2\x80\x9cI think we are a nation that\nreally believes in a helping hand, in the generosity of connecting with\nfriends, neighbors, and strangers to give them chance they might not\notherwise have.\xe2\x80\x9d The Hillary quote came from a speech Clinton gave at\nDartmouth College over the Fourth of July weekend, during which the\npresidential candidate detailed her mother\xe2\x80\x99s struggles growing up.\n\n\n\nBut let\xe2\x80\x99s not take the photo at face value. Clinton was shaking lots of\nhands that day, and this unfortunately became the snapshot her campaign\nchose to represent the \xe2\x80\x9cevery American\xe2\x80\x9d candidate meeting with normal folks\noutside a Dairy Twirl. According to BuzzFeed, the Clinton camp said the\ntweet and photo were \xe2\x80\x9cremoved out of caution after people pointed out the\ntattoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOK, so let\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledge that Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter isn\xe2\x80\x99t solo-managed by her.\nShe obviously has a team of people running the Twitter machine on her\nbehalf. But that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes the mistake that much more ridiculous. You\ncan bet someone got fired for this. Or at least, a fierce tongue lashing.\n\n\n\nOnce again hawk-eyed Twittizens, thank you for capturing and saving every\n\xe2\x80\x9coops\xe2\x80\x9d moment coming out of this election circuit circus.\n\n\n\nHow Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign fakes grassroots love // NY Post // Philip\nRucker - July 8, 2015\n\n\n\nOne day in May, operatives from a Washington-based super PAC gathered New\nHampshire mayors, state representatives and local politicos at St. Anselm\nCollege for a day of training.\n\n\n\nThey rehearsed their personal tales of how they met Hillary Rodham Clinton\nand why they support her for president. They sharpened their defenses of\nher record as secretary of state.\n\n\n\nThey scripted their arguments for why the Democratic front-runner has been\n\xe2\x80\x9ca lifetime champion of income opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d And they polished their\non-camera presentations in a series of mock interviews.\n\n\n\nThe objective of the sessions: To nurture a seemingly grass-roots echo\nchamber of Clinton supporters reading from the same script in communities\nacross New Hampshire, a critical state that hosts the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first\npresidential primary.\n\n\n\nThe super PAC, called Correct the Record, convened similar talking-point\ntutorials and media-training classes in May and June in three other early\nvoting states \xe2\x80\x94 Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada \xe2\x80\x94 as well as sessions\nearlier this spring in California.\n\n\n\nPresidential campaigns have for decades fed talking points to surrogates\nwho appear on national TV or introduce candidates on the stump.\n\n\n\nBut the effort to script and train local supporters is unusually ambitious\nand illustrates the extent to which the Clinton campaign and its web of\nsanctioned, allied super PACs are leaving nothing to chance.\n\n\n\nWhen, say, a Londonderry Times reporter calls a Rockingham County\nDemocratic Committee member for comment on Clinton, he or she will parrot\nCorrect the Record\xe2\x80\x99s talking points about Clinton having been a fighter for\nthe middle class \xe2\x80\x94 from improving rural health care as first lady of\nArkansas to raising the minimum wage as a New York senator.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are holding sessions with top communicators across the country where we\ntalk about the best ways to discuss Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s strong record of\naccomplishments, how to articulate Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s positions most\neffectively and how to correct Republican operatives\xe2\x80\x99 distortions of the\nfacts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrienne Watson, communications director at Correct the Record.\n\n\n\nCorrect the Record \xe2\x80\x94 one of several super PACs run by Clinton ally David\nBrock \xe2\x80\x94 coordinates some of its activities with Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, but\nofficials said the campaign played no role in the training sessions.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign has its own surrogate operation that distributes talking\npoints to supporters to ensure their messages in local and national media\nare consistent.\n\n\n\nThe super PAC\xe2\x80\x99s on-camera media training was conducted by the Franklin\nForum and led by the group\xe2\x80\x99s president, John Neffinger, a Democratic\nstrategist who specializes in coaching people for television interviews.\n\n\n\nCorrect the Record held a series of similar media sessions in the spring of\n2014 to prepare Clinton backers for interviews surrounding her national\nbook tour for \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices,\xe2\x80\x9d the memoir from her State Department years.\n\n\n\nTo supporters like Eleni Kounalakis, who served as ambassador to Hungary in\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s State Department, the program is welcome news.\n\n\n\nIn March, she participated with about 20 other supporters in a Correct the\nRecord session in San Francisco and said it helped her and other Clinton\nfans refine the case they make for Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy in public.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany people who are very vocal in supporting Secretary Clinton are very\ncomfortable talking about why among their friends and in small groups \xe2\x80\x94 but\nwhen it comes to talking to the media, that can be very intimidating,\xe2\x80\x9d\nKounalakis said. \xe2\x80\x9cSome people feel like, I know Hillary has been there for\nthe working person in her life, in her career, but I want someone to help\nme prepare those arguments so that I have that confidence to speak in a\nbroader context.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNick Sottile, 21, president of the College Democrats of South Carolina,\nsaid he felt \xe2\x80\x9clucky\xe2\x80\x9d to attend a May 7 Correct the Record session in\nColumbia, SC.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt got right to the heart of things \xe2\x80\x94 how to cut through the noise and\ntalk about Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s record,\xe2\x80\x9d Sottile said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd not just what to\nsay, but how to talk about her as a young person in South Carolina. It was\ngood training in how to be an effective talker.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton Thinks Email Scandal Is Annoying, Says Everything She Did\nWas Legal, So Back Off\n<http://www.bustle.com/articles/95454-hillary-clinton-thinks-email-scandal-is-annoying-says-everything-she-did-was-legal-so-back-off>\n// Bustle // Chris Tognotti \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nTuesday was a huge day for Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary\nClinton, owing to the occasion of her first major press interview \xe2\x80\x94 she sat\ndown to speak with CNN\xe2\x80\x99s Briana Keilar, and the pair covered a number of\ntopics. Including one area of conversation that\xe2\x80\x99s been dogging her for\nmonths now, one which she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t offered much comment on since a press\nconference in March \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s right, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about that private email\ncontroversy. Hillary Clinton talked about the emails in her CNN interview,\nand her response was that everything was legal and proper.\n\n\n\nWhile the email story had somewhat faded from the headlines since March, it\nwas stirred up again last week when the State Department released a\nselection of 3,000 messages sent from her private email account \xe2\x80\x94 that she\nhad a private account at all has raised criticism, thanks to the\never-present threat of hacking and cyber-warfare in this day and age.\n\n\n\nIt probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come as much surprise that Clinton didn\xe2\x80\x99t dive into\nthe issue with so much scrutiny as to reinflame any criticism \xe2\x80\x94 from her\nperch as the frontrunner in the Democratic field, outpacing the\nstill-distant second-place challenger Bernie Sanders of Vermont, it could\nbe a conscious political strategy to not dive into certain sensitive topics\nwhen she can avoid it. But to Keilar\xe2\x80\x99s credit, the issue was raised in the\nhigh-profile interview, giving us all a chance to see how Clinton responded\nin an on-the-record setting.\n\n\n\nAs Keilar asked her to explain her mindset in deleting tens of thousands of\nemails from her private server after her tenure as Secretary of State,\nClinton made her disdain for the issue obvious.\n\n\n\nEverything i did was permitted. There was no law, there was no regulation,\nthere was nothing that did not give me full authority to decide how to\ncommunicate. Previous Secretaries of State have said they did the same\nthing, and people across the government knew that I used one device. Maybe\nit was because I\xe2\x80\x99m not the most technically capable person, and wanted to\nmake it as simple as possible.\n\n\n\nKeilar didn\xe2\x80\x99t let the issue lie, however \xe2\x80\x94 she pressed further, invoking a\nsubpoena over Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s emails, something the former Secretary disputed\nimmediately.\n\n\n\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re starting with so many assumptions, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a subpoena. Let\xe2\x80\x99s\ntake a deep breath here. Everything i did was permitted by law and\nregulation. \xe2\x80\xa6 I chose to turn over 55,000 pages because I wanted to go\nabove and beyond what was expected of me, because i knew everything that\nwas official was already in the state department system.\n\nObviously, this was but one small, isolated part of a far rangier\ninterview, and to be fair to Clinton, the email criticism has always been\nless about her qualifications and viability as a candidate and a potential\npresident than her transparency.\n\n\n\nBut considering how the full scope of the interview, transparency issues\nseem like they could get pretty crucial for her. Keilar also questioned\nClinton about her flagging trustworthiness ratings, asking whether she bore\nany responsibility for the situation, and Clinton didn\xe2\x80\x99t cede much ground \xe2\x80\x94\nshe instead blamed Republican narratives and attacks.\n\n\n\nClinton has drawn some fire over the last week for her campaign\xe2\x80\x99s treatment\nof the press, and while it\xe2\x80\x99s still too early to say whether the more\ncontrolled, reserved approach will help or hurt her, this much seems clear:\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s trying not to extend herself unnecessarily, unless a real threat were\nto emerge from the Democratic field. The more you have to duke it out in\nthe primaries, laying out concrete policy positions (Sanders will surely\nchallenge Clinton from the left), the harder it can be to recalibrate your\nimage for a general election\xe2\x80\x99s national audience.\n\n\n\nAnd all candidates do attempt that kind of recalibration, even if they\nnever say it. That was essentially what Romney campaign adviser Eric\nFehrnstrom meant with his infamous \xe2\x80\x9cetch-a-sketch\xe2\x80\x9d remark in 2012, which\nbrought a lot of derision and criticism on the campaign.\n\n\n\nThis could potentially be a risky strategy, sure, although there aren\xe2\x80\x99t any\nSenator Barack Obamas out there anymore. Whatever you think of Bernie\nSanders, who\xe2\x80\x99s well-loved by many in the party\xe2\x80\x99s left-wing, he\xe2\x80\x99s not quite\nthe charismatic rhetorical force that Obama was in 2008.\n\n\n\nBut obviously, Clinton has to submit to questions from the press every now\nand then, and Keilar was first-up to secure that opportunity. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nexplanation on the email controversy will surely not be enough for her\ncritics, and maybe even some of her supporters, but it remains to be seen\nwhether this is something that voters will truly care about when the early\nprimaries roll around.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton on Bernie Sanders: It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be \xe2\x80\x98competitive\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-its-going-be-competitive>\n// MSNBC // Alex Seitz-Wald \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton said Tuesday that she was not surprised by Democratic\nchallenger Bernie Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 recent surge in polls, adding that running for\npresident should not easy.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is going to be competitive. It should be competitive,\xe2\x80\x9d she told\nreporters in Iowa ahead of the first national television interview of her\nsecond presidential campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cThe more the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSanders, a senator from Vermont, has been attracting large crowds as he\ntravels to early voting states and liberal cities across the country.\nClinton, the Democratic front-runner, has so far declined to engage\ndirectly with her challenger, saying she\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it up to the voters.\n\n\n\nClinton spoke at the Iowa City Public Library in Iowa City, a Democratic\nstronghold that she hopes to win in the state\xe2\x80\x99s critical caucuses in\nFebruary 2016. She also took questions from the audience after facing\ncriticism in recent days for limiting public and press access to her.\n\n\n\nAfter facing criticism for keeping reporters behind a rope line during a\nJuly 4 parade, Clinton cracked a joke about the incident. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that the\nequivalent of a rope we have up there? I think it should come down. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nwant anybody to stress,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, instructing an aide to take down the\nbarrier between her and the press.\n\n\n\nGetting a bit reflective, Clinton called the 2016 campaign \xe2\x80\x9cmy last rodeo\xe2\x80\x9d\nand vowed to work to build the Democratic Party in Washington and across\nthe country to outlive her time in public office. Clinton marveled when she\nrealized that, if her presidential run were successful and she won\nre-election, she would not retire until 2025. \xe2\x80\x9cGolly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said as she\nworked the math out in her head.\n\n\n\nClinton seemed to acknowledge that Democrats lack a deep pool of national\ntalent, a fact some have blamed on her freezing out competition in the\nDemocratic primary. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe that we can leave the country in good shape\nfor the future and we can get a deep bench,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nAnd she vowed to whip Democrats into shape for midterm elections, which\ntend to favor the GOP thanks to higher Republican voter turnout. \xe2\x80\x9cThey know\nthe importance of midterm elections because they show up, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said of Democrats.\n\n\n\nDuring her remarks, Clinton took the opportunity to discuss immigration\nreform, an issue that she has so far discussed mainly in front of Latino\naudiences. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to make this a big issue in the campaign. I\xe2\x80\x99m going\nto talk about it like I talked about it here, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about it\neverywhere, because I want people who vote for me to know they\xe2\x80\x99re voting\nfor comprehensive immigration reform,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nMany of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Republican opponents, she continued, are trying to\n\xe2\x80\x9cdemean immigrants, insult immigrants, cast aspersion on immigrants.\xe2\x80\x9d And\ntheir plans for immigration reform would relegate migrants to \xe2\x80\x9csecond-class\nstatus,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton added.\n\n\n\nClinton also weighed in on the debt crisis in Greece, calling the issue \xe2\x80\x9ca\ntragedy.\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said she hoped for a resolution that \xe2\x80\x9ckeeps Greece in the\neurozone and keeps Europe united.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe declined to take a stance on the marathon negotiations with Iran over\nits nuclear program, however, saying it would be inappropriate to comment\nwhile the talks continue. She reiterated that any deal \xe2\x80\x9cneeds to be full\ntransparency, disclosure and verifiable inspections going forward.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton also warned that the fight over Obamacare is not over, despite the\nrecent Supreme Court ruling upholding a key pillar of the law. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a\nRepublican is elected president, that will be the end of the Affordable\nCare Act,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\n*Grassley Probing Clinton Aide\xe2\x80\x99s Dual Role at State, Clinton Foundation\n<http://freebeacon.com/issues/grassley-probing-clinton-aides-dual-role-at-state-clinton-foundation/>\n// Free Beacon // Alana Goodman \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) called on the\nState Department to turn over documents related to Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s top\naide Cheryl Mills\xe2\x80\x99 special employment status at the agency in a letter to\nSecretary John Kerry on Monday.\n\nGrassley also demanded to know why the State Department omitted Mills from\na list of \xe2\x80\x9cspecial government employees,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cSGEs,\xe2\x80\x9d for 2009 that it\nturned over to the Senate Judiciary Committee last year.\n\n\n\nThe State Department told the Washington Free Beacon last month that Mills\nwas an \xe2\x80\x9cSGE\xe2\x80\x9d in 2009, which freed her from some ethics rules restrictions\nand allowed her to hold outside employment and serve on the Clinton\nFoundation board.\n\n\n\nGrassley said this disclosure \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly contradicts the information that\nthe State Department provided to this Committee.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGrassley\xe2\x80\x99s letter was prompted by a Free Beacon article last month that\nreported long-time Clinton aide Cheryl Mills had simultaneously worked as\nState Department chief of staff and as New York University\xe2\x80\x99s general\ncounsel from January to May 2009.\n\n\n\nMills also continued to serve on the board of the Clinton Foundation for\nover a month after joining the State Department. During this time she was\ninvolved in discussions about vetting Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s paid speeches for\npotential conflicts of interest, according to internal agency emails.\n\n\n\nGrassley said in the letter that Mills\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9csimultaneous relationship with the\nState Department, Clinton Foundation and her actions on behalf of President\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s paid speaking engagements raise important questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe also noted that \xe2\x80\x9cfederal law prohibits SGEs and full time employees from\nparticipating personally and substantially in matters that have a direct\nand predictable effect on their financial interests or financial interests\nof others with whom they have certain relationships.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGrassley called on Kerry to explain why Mills\xe2\x80\x99 special employment status\nwas not disclosed to the committee, whether any steps were taken to prevent\nethics law violations, and whether she was recused from any matters while\nworking as an SGE.\n\nThe senator also asked why she was designated as an SGE, whether it had an\nimpact on her security clearance, and whether she disclosed her\nrelationship with the Clinton Foundation to the State Department.

It is, for me, not enough,"\nClinton said. "It doesn\'t go far enough to try to have better coordination\nbetween the public and private sector."\n\n\n\nClinton listed "cumbersome procurement and bureaucratic obstacles within\nthe federal government" as other obstacles inhibiting cybersecurity,\nreferencing the rocky roll-out of HealthCare.gov in 2013 as evidence that\ngovernment is in need of a technological overhaul that includes a more\nstreamlined process for working with IT contractors.\n\n\n\nClinton did not clarify which specific info-sharing legislation she was\nreferring to, however\xe2\x80\x94or whether it alone would be a useful step forward.\nTwo similar info-sharing bills easily passed the House earlier this year,\nand a Senate version, known as the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act,\nhas stalled after clearing the Senate Intelligence Committee on a 14-1\nvote. A plan by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to attach CISA as an\namendment to a defensive authorization bill backfired last month because\nDemocrats refused to support it due to procedural concerns.\n\n\n\nPrivacy advocates and many computer experts have warned that expanding\ninformation-sharing would not do much to prevent or minimize cyberattacks,\nand that such legislation could actually embolden government surveillance\nby handing more data over to the National Security Agency.\n\n\n\nGovernment officials have privately pointed to China as the culprit behind\na massive data breach of personnel files at the Office of Personnel\nManagement, a hack that has affected millions of current and former federal\nemployees. Some lawmakers have also said China is to blame, although the\nObama administration continues to resist accusing Beijing publicly.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s comments are her most detailed about cybersecurity since\nofficially declaring her White House bid nearly three months ago. She said\nTuesday that her concerns about foreign nations hacking the U.S. date back\nto her tenure as secretary of State.\n\n\n\n"It started with the grave concerns that a lot of American businesses had,\nthat their most confidential information was being vacuumed up through\nintrusive hacking," Clinton said.

He urged changes to US bankruptcy laws that\ncurrently exclude Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\nLike US states, Puerto Rico cannot file for bankruptcy protection.

I have\ngreat confidence. I trust the American voter. So I trust the American voter\n100 percent, because I think the American voter will weigh these kinds of\naccusations."\n\n\n\nClinton\'s honest and trustworthy ratings have taken a hit in recent months.\nIn the most recent CNN poll, nearly 6 in 10 Americans said they didn\'t\nbelieve she was honest and trustworthy. Democrats still maintain a positive\nview of her, but Republicans believe it will weaken her in a general\nelection.\n\n\n\nSome of that skepticism has been fueled by her use of a private email\nserver while at the State Department. Clinton defended that decision,\nsaying she has been transparent in calling for over thousands of emails to\nbe released, the first of which came out last week.\n\n\n\n"Let\'s take a deep breath here," Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, said\nin the interview. "Everything I did was permitted by law and regulation. I\nhad one device. When I mailed anybody in the government, it would go into\nthe government system. Now, I didn\'t have to turn over anything. I chose to\nturn over 55,000 pages, because I wanted to go above and beyond what was\nexpected of me because I knew the vast majority of everything that was\nofficial already was in the State Department system."\n\n\n\nThat echoed much of what Clinton said earlier this year before she got into\nthe presidential campaign.\n\n\n\n"This is being blown up with no basis in law or in fact," Clinton\ncontinued. "That\'s fine. I get it. This is being, in effect, used by the\nRepublicans in the Congress."\n\n\n\nClinton also defended the Clinton foundation, which has faced questions\nabout foreign donations accepted while she was secretary of state. Clinton\nsaid the work of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and daughter,\nChelsea, should keep going if she wins the presidency.\n\n\n\n"I have no plans to say or do anything about the Clinton foundation," she\nsaid, "other than to say how proud I am of it and that I think for the good\nof the world, its work should continue."\n\n\n\nOf her chief rival, Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton\ndownplayed concern about his rising position in the polls and the record\ncrowds he\'s been drawing.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, her communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, acknowledged\nthat the campaign was somewhat "worried" about Sanders.\n\n\n\n"First of all, I always thought this would be a competitive race," Clinton\nsaid. "So I am happy to have a chance to get out and run my campaign as I\nsee fit and let other candidates do exactly the same."\n\n\n\nFor those who see shades of her 2008 collapse, Clinton said she\'s learned a\nthing or two from that campaign.\n\n\n\n"I feel very good about where we are in Iowa," she said of the state where\nshe placed a disappointing third in 2008. "And one of the things that I\nlearned last time is, it\'s, \'Organize, organize, organize.\' And you\'ve got\nto get people committed. And then they will follow through and then you\nbring more people."\n\n\n\nClinton also declined to answer whether her economic plan would raise\ntaxes, like Sanders has proposed.\n\n\n\n"I\'m going to put out my policies, and I\'ll let other people speak to their\npolicies," she said, "because I think we have to both grow the economy\nfaster and fairer so we have to do what will actually work in the short\nterm, the medium term and the long term. I will be making a speech about my\neconomic proposals on Monday. And then I look forward to the debate about\nthem."\n\n\n\nOf her potential Republican rivals \xe2\x80\x94 and the possibility of another Bush\nversus Clinton contest \xe2\x80\x94 Clinton demurred, emphasizing that the field is\nwide open.\n\n\n\n"Well, we\'ll see," she said when asked about running against former Florida\nGov. Jeb Bush. "That\'s up to, first, the Republicans on his side, the\nDemocrats on my side. What\'s great about America is anybody can run for\npresident. That is literally true. And you have to go out and you have to\ndo what everybody else does. You have to make your case. You have to have\nyour agenda. You have to raise the money. You have to work really hard."\n\n\n\nShe did take a swipe at Bush over immigration, even though he has been hit\nwithin the GOP over his openness to reform.\n\n\n\n"Well, he doesn\'t believe in a path to citizenship," Clinton noted. "If he\ndid at one time, he no longer does. And so pretty much they\'re \xe2\x80\x94 as I said,\nthey\'re on a spectrum of, you know, hostility, which I think is really\nregrettable in a nation of immigrants like ours, all the way to kind of\ngrudging acceptance but refusal to go with a pathway to citizenship."\n\n\n\nAnd of businessman Donald Trump \xe2\x80\x94 who has gotten considerable blowback for\nhis derogatory comments about Mexicans \xe2\x80\x94 Clinton criticized her onetime\ndonor.\n\n\n\n"I\'m very disappointed in those comments," Clinton said, "and I feel very\nbad and very disappointed with him and with the Republican Party for not\nresponding immediately and saying, \'Enough. Stop it.\' "\n\n\n\nShe continued, trying to paint the GOP with a broad brush against\nimmigrants.\n\n\n\n"They are all in the same general area on immigration," Clinton charged.\n"They don\'t want to provide a path to citizenship. They range across a\nspectrum of being either grudgingly welcome or hostile toward immigrants.\nAnd I\'m going to talk about comprehensive immigration reform. I\'m going to\ntalk about all of the good, law-abiding, productive members of the\nimmigrant community that I personally know, that I\'ve met over the course\nof my life, that I would like to see have a path to citizenship."\n\n\n\nOf her own dust-up with the press this weekend after her campaign roped off\nreporters trying to cover her in a July 4 parade, Clinton defended the\ndecision.\n\n\n\n"I just have a different rhythm to my campaign," Clinton said. "I\'m not\nrunning my campaign for the press. I\'m running it for voters. I totally\nrespect the press and what the press has to do. But I wanted \xe2\x80\x94 and was\ndetermined \xe2\x80\x94 to have the time that I needed to actually meet and listen to\npeople."\n\n\n\n*Hillary Blames GOP for Negative Press, Insists People \xe2\x80\x98Can and Do\xe2\x80\x99 Trust\nHer\n<http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/07/hillary-blames-gop-insists-people-trust-her.html>\n// NY Mag // Margaret Hartmann \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nSince launching her campaign in April, Hillary Clinton has mostly ignored\nthe national press, and her campaign\'s decision to keep reporters in a rope\npen last weekend did not improve their historically dicey relationship. On\nTuesday night she tried to smooth things over in her first televised\ninterview as a 2016 candidate. As New York\'s Annie Lowrey explained when\nEmailgate first broke, the controversy is likely the result of Clinton\ntrying to avoid bad press: "You loathe the idea of your personal\ncorrespondence getting out to a press you consider pathological, so you\njury-rig a private email account and end up in the midst of a massive media\ncluster anyway." But in her interview with CNN\'s Brianna Keilar, Clinton\ntried to shift the blame from the media (and herself), pointing instead to\nher old foe "the vast right-wing conspiracy."\n\n\n\nWhen asked to clarify why she decided to conduct State Department business\nusing her private emails, and delete the emails her staff deemed personal,\nClinton said she actually "went above and beyond what anybody could have\nexpected" by turning over more than 55,000 pages to the State Department.\n"Everything I did was permitted, there was no law, there was no regulation,\nthere was nothing that did not give me the full authority to decide how I\nwas going to communicate," Clinton said. She also alluded to her previous\nclaim that she only wanted to carry one device, saying, "Maybe it was\nbecause I am not the most technically capable person and wanted to make it\nas simple as possible."\n\n\n\nClinton also defended her family\'s charity, while claiming she played "only\na small role" during the "year and a half" she was there (though the name\nwas changed to the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation). "It\nproduced results," Clinton said. "I have no plans to say or do anything\nabout the Clinton foundation other than to say how proud I am of it. I\nthink for the good of the world its work should continue."\n\n\n\nIt\'s true, as Clinton noted, that congressional Republicans are running\nwith the scandal accusations, but she painted questions about her\ntrustworthiness as a total fabrication by the right. "I think when you are\nsubjected to the kind of constant barrage of attacks that are largely\nfomented by and coming from the right \xe2\x80\xa6 I think it\'s understandable that\nwhen questions are raised, people maybe are thinking about them and\nwondering about them," Clinton said. "This has been a theme that has been\nused against me and my husband for many, many years."\n\n\n\nThroughout the interview she was careful to point out that while questions\nabout her credibility are "unfounded," she knows journalists are just doing\ntheir job. Recent polls have shown that a majority of Americans do not\nconsider Clinton trustworthy, but when pressed on the issue she said,\n"Well, people should and do trust me and I have every confidence that that\nwill be the outcome of this election."\n\n\n\nClinton dodged on a question about Senator Bernie Sanders\' rising\npopularity among Democrats. "First of all, I always thought this would be a\ncompetitive race," Clinton said. "So I am happy to have a chance to get out\nand run my campaign as I see fit and let other candidates do exactly the\nsame." However, she was willing to call out some of her potential GOP\nrivals. She said she was "very disappointed" by Donald Trump\'s remarks on\nMexican immigrants, adding,  "I feel very bad and very disappointed with\nhim \xe2\x80\x94 and with the Republican party for not responding immediately and\nsaying, \'Enough, stop it.\'"\n\n\n\nThen she pivoted to attacking the entire GOP field on immigration reform,\nsaying, "They\'re on a spectrum of hostility, which I think is really\nregrettable in a nation of immigrants like ours." When asked about Jeb Bush\nspecifically, she said, "He doesn\'t believe in a path to citizenship. If he\ndid at one time, he no longer does."\n\n\n\n"Hillary Clinton will say anything to get elected and her numerous\nflip-flops on immigration prove it," Bush campaign spokeswoman Emily\nBenavides responded. "As he outlined in his book on this issue, Gov. Bush\nbelieves in a conservative legislative solution to fix our broken\nimmigration system that includes earned legal status for those currently in\nthe country after they pay fines and taxes, learn English and commit no\nsubstantial crimes while securing our border."\n\n\n\nBut as the Miami Herald explains, "citizenship" and "earned legal status"\nare not the same thing:\n\n\n\nBush has favored citizenship in the past. But in his book Immigration Wars,\nand recently on the campaign trail, he has instead backed legal status\nwithout citizenship, suggesting that might be a more achievable goal given\ncontentious immigration politics.\n\nSo Clinton was actually correct, despite what the Bush camp says.\nObviously, the GOP isn\'t solely responsible for persistent questions about\nthe Clintons\' ethics, but Hillary does have a point.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton blames trust issues on GOP\n<http://www.bostonherald.com/news_opinion/us_politics/2015/07/hillary_clinton_blames_trust_issues_on_gop>\n// Boston Herald // Hillary Chabot \xe2\x80\x93 July 8, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton blamed Republicans last night for the trustworthiness\nproblem plaguing her, blasting the GOP\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconstant barrage of attacks\xe2\x80\x9d for\nnegative poll numbers and sidestepping questions about underdog U.S. Sen.\nBernie Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 growing popularity.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis has been a theme that has been used against me and my husband for\nmany, many years,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said on CNN during her first national interview,\nadding that the attacks are \xe2\x80\x9clargely fomented and coming from the right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton, who was asked about polling showing Americans question her\nhonesty, said she followed the rules when it came to using a private\nInternet server at her home during her time as secretary of state.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything I did was permitted,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pointing again to the fact that\nshe handed over 55,000 pages of emails.

The case has\ngained widespread attention from immigration-reform advocates, who say\nVillatoro, 41, was an upstanding member of the community unjustly ripped\naway from his family.\n\n\n\nClinton agreed with a Villatoro supporter, who said federal authorities\nshould have used their discretion not to deport him. She noted that the\ndeportation was based on a misdemeanor charge from the 1990s. "He was from\nall accounts, everything I\'ve read and heard, a contributing member of the\ncommunity. And for the life of me, I don\'t understand why he was deported,"\nshe said. "And I would think we would have to take a hard look at cases\nlike that and exercise more discretion."\n\n\n\nShe credited the Obama administration with making progress on the issue,\nbut said she would push for more movement toward reforming the country\'s\nbroken immigration system. "I still think we should deport dangerous\npeople, dangerous criminals \xe2\x80\x94 they should be gone," she said. "But for\npeople who have maybe one small blemish on their record, and they\'ve proven\nover the years since that they are contributing citizens, I think we should\nshow them understanding and permit them and their families to stay\ntogether."\n\n\n\nFederal authorities have defended Villatoro\'s deportation, saying it was a\nlegitimate part of a sweep of unauthorized immigrants who\'d committed\ncrimes. His lawyer has said the charge stemmed from an attempt to gain a\ndriver\'s license.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s remarks on the case came in response to a question from Aliese\nGingerich, 22, of Iowa City. Gingerich said afterward that she has been\nworking on immigration advocacy in Iowa and when she went to college in\nPennsylvania.\n\n\n\nShe was glad to hear Clinton address the issue. "I think it\'s heartening\nthat she is saying that she wants to pass comprehensive immigration reform\nand work hard with bipartisan efforts that she cited, and things she\'s done\nin the past. I would really like to hear a little bit more specifically\nwhat she wants to pass exactly."\n\n\n\nThe Iowa City stop was one of two Clinton scheduled in Iowa Tuesday on her\nfourth trip to the state since she announced her candidacy in April. It was\nonly the second event so far that was open to the general public, and it\nwas the first one at which she took questions from unscreened voters.\n\n\n\nThe audience questions focused on issues such as the use of military force,\nhow to expand and protect the Affordable Care Act and how to improve\neducation. On the education question, Clinton stressed that she wants the\ncountry to get away from over-reliance on standardized tests and uniform\ninstruction methods. "We have a broad range of kids. We can\'t teach them\nall the same way," she said.\n\n\n\nMore than 350 people got into Clinton\'s event Tuesday at the Iowa City\npublic library, but scores more failed to get in because of a lack of space.\n\n\n\nIowa City is known as the most liberal spot in Iowa. That could make it\nprime territory for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a populist who is mounting\na surprisingly strong Democratic challenge on Clinton\'s left flank. He has\nbeen rising in the polls and drawing crowds in the thousands in Iowa and\nother states.\n\n\n\nClinton told reporters after her event Tuesday that she was not surprised\nto see Sanders have some success.\n\n\n\n"This is going to be competitive, and it should be competitive," she said.\n"It\'s only the presidency of the United States we\'re talking about. So, you\nknow, the more the better. Let\'s get everybody out there, let\'s get\neverybody working hard, running their own campaigns and then we\'ll leave it\nup to Iowa to decide what happens."\n\n\n\nSeveral voters who came to Clinton\'s Iowa City event said they like what\nSanders says, especially on the issue of income inequality. But they also\nare skeptical of his ability to win the general election.\n\n\n\n"In a perfect world, yes, I would support him, but I\'m not going to throw\nmy vote away," said Tom Braverman, 51, of Iowa City, who is a\nspecial-education teacher. He said that if Democrats nominated Sanders,\nthey would be making the same kind of mistake Republicans will make if they\nnominate a far-right candidate.\n\n\n\nThe library meeting room the campaign chose for the event only held a few\nhundred people. Far more than that came to the library Tuesday morning,\nhoping to see Clinton. At one point, the line outside stretched more than\ntwo blocks.\n\n\n\nUndecided voter Shawn Harmsen, 42, of Iowa City, said he had hoped to ask\nClinton a question in person. He stood about two hours in line, but was\nmore than a third of the way back. "For the people who get in, it\'ll be\ngreat," he said of the relatively small venue. "But for those who don\'t get\nin \xe2\x80\x94 will they come back next time?"\n\n\n\nPeg Voelker, 53, of Iowa City, stood about two-thirds of the way back in\nline. About a half hour before the event started, she said she realized she\nprobably wouldn\'t get in to see Clinton. "But we\'re glad to stand in line\nto show our support," she said. Even if she didn\'t get in this time, she\nsaid, she would be back for future Clinton events and would volunteer for\nthe candidate.\n\n\n\nVoelker, who is self-employed, said she supported Democratic rival John\nEdwards when Clinton ran for the nomination in 2008. She was afraid then\nthat Clinton would be unable to withstand relentless personal attacks by\nopponents. But she now believes the attacks have allowed Clinton to show\nher true colors. "She has a proven track record of standing up and being\nproductive no matter what they throw at her," said Voelker.\n\n\n\nAfter the Iowa City event, Clinton headed to Ottumwa for a private "house\nparty" with supporters.\n\n\n\n*Clinton campaign adds 20 paid Iowa staffers\n<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/07/07/clinton-adds-paid-iowa-staffers/29814329/>\n// The Des Moines Reigister // Jennifer Jacobs \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton has hired 20 more field organizers to campaign for her in\nIowa, and they started work Tuesday, a spokeswoman told the Des Moines\nRegister.\n\n\n\n"A top flight organizing staff is critical to winning the caucus and we\'re\nexcited to add to the team that has been on the ground for nearly three\nmonths," Clinton\'s Iowa director, Matt Paul, told the Register in a\nstatement.\n\n\n\nClinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, is in Iowa Tuesday for her\nfourth visit to the first-in-the-nation voting state since she formally\nannounced her candidacy April 12. She was scheduled to do events in Iowa\nCity and Ottumwa.\n\n\n\nLily Adams, the campaign\'s Iowa spokeswoman, declined to reveal the total\nnumber of Iowa staff, which includes a team of strategists based in Des\nMoines, but said the 20 hires join the existing team of 21 field organizers\nand six regional organizing directors on the ground since April.\n\n\n\nAll 47 are paid, Adams said.\n\n\n\nThe field staffers are focused on organizing down to the precinct level,\ndoing one-on-one meetings with activists, county chairs and Iowans who have\nnever caucused before, as well as organize house parties and attend local\nDemocratic events. They use commitment cards to secure pledges to caucus\nfor Clinton on Feb. 1.\n\n\n\nThe Clinton campaign also has more than 100 unpaid "organizing fellows."\nAides said they got more than 1,000 applications for the summertime Iowa\nOrganizing Fellowship program, meant to teach the full-time volunteers\norganizing strategies and help Clinton bring voters into the fold.\n\n\n\nLate last month, a woman chosen to be a fellow in the state of Nevada\npublicly criticized Clinton for not paying her interns.\n\n\n\n"Forget arguments about raising the minimum wage. I can\'t even get a wage,"\nCarolyn Osorio wrote in an opinion piece published by USA Today.\n\n\n\n"Finding out that Hillary perpetuates the exploitation known as unpaid\ninternships was like discovering that Santa wasn\'t real," Osorio wrote. In\nresponse, the Clinton team said campaigns in both parties have used\nvolunteer interns in the past.\n\n\n\nEight of the 20 additional Iowa hires already had unpaid jobs with the\ncampaign, Adams said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe Clinton team has been completing the process of hiring the 20\norganizers since early June, Adams said. Their first day on the job was\nTuesday, when they began two days of training in Des Moines. They will then\nbe deployed across Iowa this weekend, she said.\n\n\n\nPaul said the the campaign has been preparing for competition in the Iowa\ncaucuses since Clinton announced her candidacy in April.\n\n\n\n"As we\'ve said from the beginning," Paul said, "we are taking nothing for\ngranted in the caucus and these organizers will increase our campaign\'s\nability to work with supporters in every neighborhood and precinct to get\nthe word out about Hillary Clinton\'s campaign to fight for everyday\nAmericans."\n\n\n\n*The Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 headache is back: First brother Roger was paid $100,000 to\ninfluence Bill and ex-president bought him house despite IRS demand for his\nproperty\n<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3152624/The-Clintons-headache-brother-Roger-paid-100-000-influence-Bill.html#ixzz3fGr3RiOz>\n// The Daily Mail // Francesca Chambers \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nBill Clinton\'s half brother Roger, nicknamed \'headache\' by the Secret\nService during Clinton\'s presidency, has tried to keep a low-profile as his\nsister-in-law Hillary positions her family to move back into the White\nHouse.\n\n\n\nBut now it is revealed today that he used his brother-in-law\'s name to win\na $100,000 consulting contract with a company looking to build houses in\nHaiti.\n\nAnd it is also disclosed that he is living in a home that was partly - if\nnot fully - paid for by Bill through a limited liability company registered\nto the Clintons\' family home in Chappaqua, New York.\n\n\n\nThe use of such a device was described as having the potential to \'raise\neyebrows\' with the IRS. It was never disclosed by Hillary during her time\nin office that address was linked to the limited liability company.\n\n\n\nNow it is revealed today that Roger, pictured here in 2013, used his\nbrother-in-law\'s name to win a $100,000 consulting contract with a company\nlooking to build houses in Haiti\n\n\n\nRoger Clinton\'s antics in the \'90s were a constant source of embarrassment\nfor the first family, culminating in a 2001 congressional investigation\nover his attempts to \'cash in\' on his connections to the White House.\n\n\n\nThe wannabee rock star, who went to prison in 1985 for cocaine abuse and\nfor a time played in a band called Politics, was found to have engaged in\n\'serious and reckless misconduct\' the review panel.\n\n\n\nHe has resurfaced just as Hillary tries to put a troubled start to her\ncampaign for presidency behind her with her first television interview of\nher candidacy.\n\n\n\nRoger currently lives in Los Angeles, California, on an $857,000 property\nhe told the New York Times that he co-owns \'50-50\' with Bill, whom he calls\n\'Big Brother.\'Roger\n\n\'I put 50 percent of the money into it,\' Roger, 58, told the publication\nduring an interview, conducted at his home.\n\n\n\nAs the Times points out, if true, that could prove legally problematic for\nthe younger Clinton because he owed the California and federal governments\nmore than $100,000 in unpaid taxes and the IRS was to acquire any \'property\nnow owned or later acquired\' by him.\n\n\n\nThe house was purchased in 2009. It says the liens were removed in 2010 and\n2011. If Roger did help purchase the property, that would constitute tax\nevasion.\n\n\n\n\'If I was still working at the I.R.S. and someone came to me with this, it\nwould raise eyebrows and trigger me to dig further to find out what exactly\nwas going on,\' David Holtz, a former IRS litigator who lives in Los\nAngeles, told the Times.\n\n\n\nA source familiar with the situation told the publication, however, that\nBill Clinton purchased the property through a LLC so that his brother and\nhis teenage nephew would have a place to live but he would not be\npersonally responsible for the home as he would not be living in it.\n\n\n\nIt\'s possible that Roger Clinton could have contributed to the purchase of\nthe home but it is not clear how he would have done that given that the\nTimes found no sustained record of income for him since, other than the\n$5,000-a-month deal with Living Modular, the company seeking to build\nlow-cost homes in Haiti.\n\n\n\nThat deal itself raised questions as the man behind it suggested Roger\nClinton promised to deliver a contract with his brother\'s foundation.\n\n\n\n\'I paid Roger $100,000,\' businessman Wayne Coleman said. \'Basically, he\npromised to get us a contract through the Clinton Foundation for a project\nover there. What he was really trying to do was sell the influence of his\nbrother.\'\n\n\n\nRoger was successful in getting the companies\' model included in an expo\nthat Bill Clinton attended on behalf of The Clinton Foundation.\n\n\n\nHis brother did not choose to invest in the company\'s product, though - a\ndecision Roger talked up to \'lawyers and advisers\' rather than his brother,\nwhom he said \'loved\' the effort.\n\n\n\n\'You had all this government grant money, and all this money Bill was\nraising from around the world for reconstruction,\' he told the Times. \'But\nwe just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it happen. It\xe2\x80\x99s like, come on, man, can\xe2\x80\x99t you just\nthrow me a bone?\'\n\n\n\nRoger Clinton said that \'seven out of 10 times\' being related to Bill and\nHillary worked against him when trying to win major contracts because it\nwould be interpreted as nepotism.\n\n\n\n\'I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a choice of being first brother,\' Clinton lamented. \'It\xe2\x80\x99s not\nlike I\xe2\x80\x99ve been given the option of doing it and I could turn it down. There\nare times when it\xe2\x80\x99s hard.\'\n\n\n\nSources who spoke to the Times said that Roger and his family have long\nbenefited from his big brother\'s monetary success in other ways, though.\n\n\n\nBill Clinton reportedly paid for Roger\'s grown-up daughter to attend\ncosmetology school.\n\n\n\nAnd, after leaving the White House, when he worked at investment firm\nYucaipa, Bill Clinton is said by a former employee to have regularly\nwritten his brother checks.\n\nOn another occasion, Roger\'s lawyer floated paying out a settlement over a\ndomestic dispute involving two women on Clinton\'s property with Bill\'s\nmoney.\n\n\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton\'s siblings have been accused on numerous occasions\nof trying to profit off of their relationships with the political power\ncouple, and usually inappropriately.\n\n\n\nHillary\'s older brother Hugh pocketed $400,000 from a Democratic Party\ndonor - that he was later forced to give back - after he successfully\nlobbied Bill to commute the federal prison sentence of the donor\'s\ndrug-dealing son.\n\n\n\nHer younger brother, Tony Rodham, also convinced Bill to grant a\npresidential pardon that he said he wasn\'t paid to lobby for but a\ncongressional investigation later found that he was.\n\n\n\nHe\'s continued to ride the coattails of his brother-in-law, using The\nClinton Foundation as a means to an ends of his own contracts in Haiti.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton to pay \'summer fellows\' after reports of interns working\nfor free\n<http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/07/hillary-clinton-unpaid-interns-full-time-staff>\n// The Guardian // Ben Jacobs \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015*\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton has hired eight \xe2\x80\x9csummer fellows\xe2\x80\x9d as full-time paid\nstaffers, just weeks after the Guardian revealed that the presidential\nfrontrunner\xe2\x80\x99s campaign was using experienced political operatives as unpaid\ninterns.\n\n\n\nThe Clinton campaign is adding 20 full-time field organizers in Iowa,\nseeking to increase her presence and rally Democrats in the crucial caucus\nstate, which she visited on Tuesday as her team acknowledged fears of a\nbetter-than-expected showing from the independent challenger Bernie Sanders.\n\n\n\nAs first reported by the Des Moines Register, eight of those new hires had\npreviously served as full-time \xe2\x80\x9corganizing fellows\xe2\x80\x9d. In that capacity,\nfellows performed almost identical duties to field organizers, who do the\nmost basic work on a campaign: recruiting volunteers and endorsements,\ngoing door-to-door and calling voters, often outside the confines of a\n9-to-5 day job.\n\n\n\nNow, those people will be paid, the Clinton campaign confirmed to the\nGuardian on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nClinton already had a sizeable footprint on the ground in Iowa and launched\nher campaign with roughly 40 staffers in the state, but the new wave of\nhires represents a decisive step by Clinton to build up her organizing\nefforts in the state.\n\n\n\nThe former secretary of state returned to Iowa on Tuesday for the first\ntime since the opening week of her campaign, speaking to supporters and\norganizers in Iowa City ahead of her first sit-down interview since\nannouncing her second run for the White House.\n\n\n\nThe push to woo ardent Iowa Democrats comes amid a surge of progressive\nappeal from Sanders, the Vermont senator who has been surging in recent\npolls and more than doubled his support among Democrats in the state\nbetween May and June, according to a Quinnipiac University\xe2\x80\x99s survey.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are worried about him,\xe2\x80\x9d the Clinton communications director, Jennifer\nPalmieri, said of Sanders on MSNBC on Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will be a serious force\nfor the campaign, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that will diminish.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Iowa hires, however, represent the continuation of a trend in\nClintonland that new staffers \xe2\x80\x93 no matter how much political experience\nthey may bring from previous campaigns \xe2\x80\x93 initially must work for free\nbefore getting on the Clinton payroll.\n\n\n\nMany high-ranking staffers worked for free as \xe2\x80\x9cvolunteers\xe2\x80\x9d on the Clinton\ncampaign in the weeks before she formally launched her campaign in early\nApril. Political watchers told the Guardian last month it represented an\nattempt to wiggle around federal campaign-finance rules that ban an\nundeclared campaign from paying staff.\n\n\n\nWhen Federal Election Commission reports are released next week, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\ndonations are expected to far exceed any other Democratic candidate.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s competitors have already taken jabs at her use of the unpaid\nfellows: Lis Smith, the deputy campaign manager for former Maryland\ngovernor Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, tweeted over the Independence Day weekend that\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe all know she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pay young staff\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\n\nStill, Clinton has been polling well above 50% in the state where she\nfinished third in the 2008 Democratic caucus.\n\n\n\n*Clinton Still Far Outpaces Her Democratic Rivals\n<http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2016/clinton_still_far_outpaces_her_democratic_rivals>\n// Rasmussen Reports \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nDespite the increasing media coverage going to some of her rivals for the\n2016 Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton remains hugely\nahead as far as the party\xe2\x80\x99s voters are concerned.\n\n\n\nNinety-three percent (93%) of Likely Democratic Voters believe Clinton is\nlikely to end up being their party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee next year, according to a new\nRasmussen Reports national telephone survey.

Oil, coal, and gas\ncompanies, Henn continues, \xe2\x80\x9chave consistently misled the public about the\ndangers associated with their product, and this time it\xe2\x80\x99s the whole planet\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s at stake. You can\xe2\x80\x99t be serious about addressing climate change and\nstill accept checks from ExxonMobil.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFossil fuel companies, of course, exercise quite a bit of influence over\npolitics through their ability to lob money into campaigns. Though coal\ncompanies\xe2\x80\x99 profits have been suffering, oil companies are going strong, and\nboth still put a lot of money into politics. The oil and gas industry\npoured $76 million into federal campaigns in 2012, according to the Center\nfor Responsive Politics. Of the amount that was donated to individual\ncandidates\xe2\x80\x99 campaigns, 89 percent went to Republicans and 11 percent to\nDemocrats. The coal mining industry gave another $15 million in 2012, and\nmost of the candidates it supported were Republicans too.\n\n\n\nSo The Nation\xe2\x80\x99s editors issued a challenge to candidates in an editorial\nyesterday:\n\n\n\nTo break the carbon barons\xe2\x80\x99 grip over America\xe2\x80\x99s response to this crisis,\nThe Nation calls upon all 2016 presidential and congressional candidates to\nmake and honor the following pledge: In the name of protecting our country\nand the world from the growing dangers of climate change, I will neither\nsolicit nor accept campaign contributions from any oil, gas, or coal\ncompany.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting experiment, and how candidates choose to respond to it\nsays a lot about their priorities. \xe2\x80\x9cSome candidates for president are\nalready signing up,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Henn, \xe2\x80\x9cand we expect more to do so as campaigns\nlike divestment continue to stigmatize the fossil fuel industry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDemocrat Bernie Sanders and the Green Party\xe2\x80\x99s Jill Stein have said they\xe2\x80\x99re\nin \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99ll take the pledge.

All but one of the Republicans\ndeny that human-made climate change is a real threat that should be taken\nseriously by our next president. The one outlier, Sen. Lindsey Graham\n(S.C.), has said he\xe2\x80\x99s in favor of addressing \xe2\x80\x9cclimate change [and] CO2\nemissions in a business-friendly way,\xe2\x80\x9d but he\xe2\x80\x99s a long-shot candidate. And,\nwell, it honestly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem too likely that Republicans, whose party has\nembraced the \xe2\x80\x9cmoney is speech\xe2\x80\x9d-type decisions from the Supreme Court that\npaved the way for the current explosion in campaign spending, would say no\non principle to money from a big industry \xe2\x80\x94 especially when the donor\nindustry in question so clearly favors Republicans over their Democratic\nopponents.\n\n\n\nThat puts the pressure from The Nation and 350 Action\xe2\x80\x99s challenge on\nHillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nClinton, who has yet to respond to the challenge, has acknowledged that\nclimate change is a potent threat. Were she to win, she\xe2\x80\x99d be following\nanother Democratic president who, at least on the demand side of things,\nhas pushed to green America\xe2\x80\x99s energy economy, and who has worked\ninternationally to encourage other large polluting countries to do the\nsame. Climate change is an issue she\xe2\x80\x99ll have to engage with continually\nthrough the election cycle, and oil and coal companies\xe2\x80\x99 objectives are,\npresumably, at odds with those of a candidate who has called for \xe2\x80\x9cdecisive\xe2\x80\x9d\naction to \xe2\x80\x9chead off the most catastrophic consequences\xe2\x80\x9d of climate change.\n\n\n\nSo will Clinton heed this latest effort to push her to the left? Her\ncampaign has started to see Sanders as a real threat, and it\xe2\x80\x99s attempting\nto emulate his campaign by courting small donors. Choosing to turn down\nmoney from companies with a vested interest in stopping climate action is\none easy way Clinton could show her commitment to the liberal base.\n\n\n\nThe Nation and 350 Action plan to keep up the pressure, on Clinton and the\nother candidates who haven\xe2\x80\x99t pledged yet. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, candidates can change\ntheir minds,\xe2\x80\x9d the Nation editors write, \xe2\x80\x9cespecially when enough public\npressure is brought to bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Judicial Watch: Federal Judge Orders State Department to Release Documents\nRegarding Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s iPhone and iPad Use\n<http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-federal-judge-orders-state-department-to-release-documents-regarding-hillary-clintons-iphone-and-ipad-use/>\n// Judicial Watch \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nJudicial Watch announced today that a federal judge has ordered the State\nDepartment to begin releasing documents by August 2015 regarding former\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s requests for use of an iPad and\niPhone.  The order comes in response to a Judicial Watch lawsuit (Judicial\nWatch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00646)) seeking\ndocuments related to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s use of an iPhone and iPad to conduct\nofficial business while secretary of state.\n\n\n\nIn her ruling, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly required the State Department\nto produce the first round of relevant documents by August 20, 2015, and\nheld that Judicial Watch and the State Department will be responsible for\nfiling a joint status report by September 1, 2015, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6proposing a schedule\nfor further productions and indicating the volume and scope of responsive\ndocuments.\xe2\x80\x9d  Beginning August 20, the State Department will also be\nrequired to release new documents every six weeks.\n\n\n\nThough the State Department did not object to producing records beginning\nin August, Judge Kollar-Kotelly denied the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s request to\nset January 2016 as the final document production date, holding:\n\n\n\nThe Court will not set a final deadline for all productions until after it\nhas had an opportunity to consider that Joint Status Report\xe2\x80\x94in order to\nleave open the possibility that the production of documents can be\ncompleted more expeditiously than the January 2016 deadline proposed by the\nDefendant.\n\n\n\nIn the most recent report to the court, Judicial Watch opposed the State\nDepartment\xe2\x80\x99s request to extend final production through January 2016.\n\n\n\nJudicial Watch filed the lawsuit after the Department of State failed to\ncomply with Judicial Watch\xe2\x80\x99s March 10, 2015, Freedom of Information Act\n(FOIA) request seeking release of the following:\n\n\n\nAny and all records of requests by former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham\nClinton or her staff to the State Department Office Security Technology\nseeking approval for the use of an iPad or iPhone for official government\nbusiness; and\n\n\n\nAny and all communications within or between the Office of the Secretary of\nState, the Executive Secretariat, and the Office of the Secretary and the\nOffice of Security Technology concerning, regarding, or related to the use\nof unauthorized electronic devices for official government business.\n\n\n\nOn March 31, 2015, The Associated Press reported that Clinton, while\nsecretary of state, had used an iPad to email members of her staff,\ncontradicting her statements that she had used a secret email account so\nthat she could conveniently conduct official business on one electronic\ndevice alone.  Reports of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s use of both a secret email server based\nat her residence and of an iPad to conduct government business have also\nraised concerns about the security of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s communications.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe federal courts are doing a significant service to the American people\nby ordering the State Department to release documents regarding Mrs.\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s iPhone and iPad use,\xe2\x80\x9d said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather than admitting that it unlawfully, obstructed the public\xe2\x80\x99s right to\nknow for years and start producing records, the Obama administration has\nstonewalled and fought Judicial Watch in court.

And college affordability was a\nleading priority for O\xe2\x80\x99Malley during his tenure as Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s governor.\n\n\n\nThe issue is one being talked about a lot these days by Democrats,\nincluding the party\xe2\x80\x99s other White House candidates, as more and more\nstudents enter the workforce with hefty debt loads.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley, who plans to detail his plan during a morning event in New\nHampshire, will call on states to freeze tuition rates at public colleges\nand universities  -- as Maryland did for four years -- and propose other\nmeasures that would help those carrying debt.\n\n\n\nUnder O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s plan, a copy of which was shared with The Washington Post,\nstudents and parents would be able to refinance their debt at lower\ninterest rates. And O\xe2\x80\x99Malley would base the repayment terms for student\nborrowers on their income upon graduation.\n\n\n\nFor the long term, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley says he would set a goal of limiting college\ntuition to 10 percent of a state\xe2\x80\x99s median income at four-year institutions\nand 5 percent at two-year institutions. Federal matching grants would help\nstates that participate in reaching the goal.\n\n\n\nUnder his plan, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley would also increase Pell Grants and revamp federal\nwork-study programs to help cover non-tuition costs, such as room and board.\n\n\n\nAides declined to spell out the cost of O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s initiatives but\nsuggested they could be paid for by measures such as closing corporate tax\nloopholes and taxing capital gains at the same rate as earned income.\n\n\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who\xe2\x80\x99s emerged as the leading alternative for\nthe Democratic nomination to Hillary Rodham Clinton, has proposed a grander\nidea: making four-year public colleges and universities free. His plan,\nwhich he estimates would cost $70 billion a year, would be paid for in part\nby a tax on Wall Street transactions by investments houses, hedge funds and\nother speculators.\n\n\n\nClinton is also expected to detail college affordability plans in coming\nmonths.\n\n\n\nIn recent years, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s daughter Grace, 24, graduated from Georgetown\nUniversity, and another daughter, Tara, 23, graduated from College of\nCharleston. Aides said O\xe2\x80\x99Malley and his wife, a district court judge in\nBaltimore, have taken out nine loans totaling $339,200 to help pay for the\neducation of their oldest two children. The interest rates range from just\nover 6 percent to 8.5 percent, an aide said.\n\n\n\nWhile some provisions in O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s plan would not affect private\nuniversities, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley aides said those schools would have an incentive to\nkeep costs down as public colleges and universities become more affordable.\n\n\n\nIn an e-mail sent to O\xe2\x80\x99Malley supporters on Tuesday, Grace O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, now a\npublic school teacher in Baltimore, relayed her college-tuition story and\nurged others to do so on a Web page set up by her father\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had to make a tough choice: do I go to the college we can afford or do I\ntake out loans to go to the college of my dreams?\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the age\nof 18, I made the decision to follow my dreams.

The former Maryland governor also will propose\nincome-based repayment options for borrowers who have private student loans.\n\n\n\nO\'Malley will unveil his higher education plans during an event Wednesday\nmorning in Manchester, New Hampshire. He will seek to cut tuition "to no\nmore than 10 percent of state median income at four-year public\nuniversities," and encourage "competency-based education strategies" that\nallow students to graduate quicker, according to campaign briefing\ndocuments. To cut non-tuition costs, O\'Malley will propose expanding Pell\ngrants and tripling the work-study program so that at least 2 million\nstudents can participate.\n\n\n\nDebt-free college has already become a major issue in the Democratic\npresidential race, with endorsements of the idea from Sen. Bernie Sanders\n(I-Vt.) and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The issue has\nsnowballed, thanks in part to a push by progressive activists, as student\ndebt tops $1.2 trillion.\n\n\n\nThe idea was outlined in a white paper by the left-leaning think tank\nProgressive Change Campaign Committee, and has steadily gained steam among\nDemocrats.\n\n\n\nDebt-free college "should be one of the top issues talked about on the\ncampaign trail, in debates, in TV ads, and at the doors with voters of all\nages," said Adam Green, Progressive Change Campaign Committee co-founder,\ninsisting that such a plan would be a boon for the economy.\n\n\n\nO\'Malley\'s plan builds on his previous statements and follows Sen.\nElizabeth Warren\'s (D-Mass.) framework for debt-free college.\n\n\n\nO\'Malley\'s daughter, Grace O\'Malley, sent an email to campaign supporters\nTuesday mentioning that her family chose to take out student loans to\nfinance college. O\'Malley\'s family has $339,200 worth of Parent Plus loans\nfor their two daughters\' college educations, campaign aides said.\n\n\n\nNew Hampshire has consistently ranked near the top for states with the most\nstudent debt.\n\n\n\nTo address current debt, O\'Malley will propose allowing borrowers with\nprivate student loans to enroll in income-based repayment plans. Details\naren\'t yet being released, but aides said borrowers would enroll in a\nprogram that would essentially have them paying the government rather than\nbanks.\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration has rolled out programs for federal student loans\nthat tie payments to borrowers\' income. But no similar benefit exists for\nprivate loans. As a result, private student loan borrowers\' monthly\npaymentscan top $1,000, and there\'s no loan forgiveness programs. Private\nstudent loans make up about one-eighth of all national education debt.\n\n\n\nO\'Malley will call on states to freeze tuition at state colleges and\nuniversities and to restore funding to higher education, which has been\nslashed for decades. He wants to encourage higher education funding with\nfederal grants in a process still being worked out.\n\n\n\n"The cost would vary depending on states\' levels of funding, but we have to\ntake the burden off students and their families and go back to historical\nlevels of investment in our public institutions of higher ed," campaign\nspokesman Sean Savett said Tuesday. "Governor O\'Malley is considering a\nnumber of possible ways to cover the cost including closing the trust fund\nand carried interest loopholes, taxing capital gains at the same rate as\nearned income, and closing tax loopholes for corporations that ship jobs\noverseas."\n\n\n\n*O\'Malley to Lay Out Plan for Debt-Free College\n<http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/07/08/us/politics/ap-us-dem-2016-omalley.html>\n// AP // July 8, 2015*\n\n\n\nCONCORD, N.H. \xe2\x80\x94 Democrat Martin O\'Malley is calling the high cost of\ncollege a "crisis" as he lays out a goal of debt-free tuition for all\nstudents at public colleges and universities within five years if elected\npresident.\n\n\n\nO\'Malley, a former governor of Maryland, will outline his plan Wednesday at\nan event in the early-voting state of New Hampshire. O\'Malley is struggling\nto catch fire with Democratic voters who are preoccupied with rivals\nHillary Rodham Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\n\n\nFocusing on college costs could help him make inroads with younger voters\nin New Hampshire, where the average student loan debt burden is the highest\nin the nation. But he\'s not alone in addressing the problem. Sanders is\ncalling for free college tuition and has introduced legislation in the\nSenate to tax financial transactions to pay for it. Clinton has emphasized\nthe need to lower college costs but has yet to be specific on policy.\n\n\n\nRoughly a dozen voters will share their struggles with student debt in a\ndiscussion with O\'Malley before he outlines his debt-free college plan.\n\n\n\nO\'Malley\'s plan relies in part on using federal matching dollars to\nencourage states to pursue some of his more ambitious goals, such as\nfreezing tuition rates and eventually reducing tuition at four-year public\nschools to 10 percent of states\' median incomes.\n\n\n\nThe plan calls on states to invest more money in higher education and\nmaintain those levels even as tuition goes down. New Hampshire invests\nminimally in its public colleges and universities, and state aid for higher\neducation is often on the chopping block in tight state budgets.\n\n\n\nO\'Malley\'s plan includes familiar policy ideas, such as allowing students\nto refinance their loans and automatically enrolling people in income-based\nrepayment plans.\n\n\n\nHe is also proposing an increase in Pell Grants and a tripling of the\nnumber of work-study jobs to help students cover college costs beyond\ntuition, such as room and board.\n\n\n\n*Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley Has the Right Solution for Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s Debt Crisis\n<http://www.thenation.com/article/martin-omalley-has-the-right-solution-for-puerto-ricos-debt-crisis/>\n// The Nation // John Nichols \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nPuerto Rico is not Greece.\n\n\n\nBut the United States commonwealth is confronted with a debt crisis. It\nfaces the threat of a brutal round of austerity cuts, which could make a\nbad circumstance dramatically worse. If ever there was a moment that called\nfor enlightened leadership that recognizes both the economic and social\nchallenges facing the Puerto Rico, this is it.\n\n\n\nFormer Maryland governor Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley heard that call as the crisis\nbegan to come into focus last month and declared, \xe2\x80\x9cAs a nation we must help\nour fellow US citizens not only because it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do, but\nbecause our region\xe2\x80\x99s economic stability depends on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nUrging the Obama administration and Congress to act \xe2\x80\x9cto avoid Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s\neconomic collapse,\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Malley said:\n\n\n\nFirst, Puerto Rico should be able to negotiate with its creditors just as\nstates can under the U.S. Bankruptcy code. Congress should approve Resident\nCommissioner Pedro Pierluisi\xe2\x80\x99s legislation that would allow for this to\nhappen.\n\n\n\nSecond, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve stated before, the Department of Health and Human Services\nmust end the inequitable treatment of Puerto Rico under Medicare, Medicaid\nand the Affordable Care Act. High costs and low reimbursement rates are a\nhuge burden to Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s budget and millions of U.S. citizens are at\nrisk of losing care.\n\n\n\nThese are two steps we can take today, but I urge the Administration and\nCongress to work with Puerto Rico on a path forward that both provides\nimmediate relief, and builds a foundation for sustainable, long-term\neconomic stability.\n\n\n\nRepublican Jeb Bush, a longtime advocate for Puerto Rican statehood, has\nspoken out for some time about the need to provide the commonwealth with\ngreater flexibility. Give Bush credit for that, especially as it is likely\nto put him at odds with many in his own party.\n\n\n\nWhat distinguishes O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s early and steady focus on Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x94and\nmore broadly on the Caribbean\xe2\x80\x94has been the precision he has brought to it\nas a former mayor and governor. That\xe2\x80\x99s earned him significant attention\nfrom Puerto Rican media and media in the United States that bothered to pay\nattention to the crisis.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a nation we must help our fellow U.S. citizens not only because it\xe2\x80\x99s\nthe right thing to do, but because our region\xe2\x80\x99s economic stability depends\non it.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\n\nNow, the crisis is back in the news.\n\n\n\nAfter lawyers for Puerto Rico failed on Tuesday to get the US Court of\nAppeals in Boston to reinstate a local law to help the commonwealth\nrestructure a crushing $72 billion debt burden, other candidates picked up\non the call, and they deserve credit for this.\n\n\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe people of Puerto Rico\nare hurting right now under a weak economy that has been struggling for\nyears.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton, who had expressed concern about Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s circumstance\nearlier, provided more details, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAs a first step, Congress should\nprovide Puerto Rico the same authority that states already have to enable\nseverely distressed government entities, including municipalities and\npublic corporations, to restructure their debts under Chapter 9 of the\nBankruptcy Code.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nLater in the day, Senator Bernie Sanders said, \xe2\x80\x9cI strongly believe Puerto\nRico should be afforded the same bankruptcy protections that exist for\nmunicipalities across the United States. We need to do everything we can to\nallow Puerto Rico to restructure its debt in a rational way that does not\nharm its people, ordinary investors or pension funds in the United States.\nChapter 9 protections would be a good first step.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSanders added that \xe2\x80\x9cwe also should recognize that the reason Puerto Rico\nhas such unsustainable debt has everything to do with the policies of\nausterity and the greed of large financial institutions. Puerto Rico has\nbeen in a severe recession for almost a decade. Today, more than 45 percent\nof the people in Puerto Rico are living in poverty, the childhood poverty\nrate is greater than 56 percent and real unemployment is much too high. Our\ngoal must be not only to give Puerto Rico the flexibility it needs to\nrestructure its debt, but to make sure that it can rebuild its economy,\ncreate good-paying jobs and expand its tax base.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe right things are being said now. The volume is being amplified.\n\n\n\nWhen the call for a reasonable response was faint, however, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley was\nthe one who stepped up. And he framed a message that was humane and\nresponsible.\n\n\n\nThis is worth noting, because Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s challenge is both fiscal and\npolitical. Political players in Washington have to be pushed to pay more\nattention to the island that is part of the United States but not a state.\nAs a commonwealth, Puerto Rico has a unique relationship with the United\nStates that creates both benefits and challenges. This has been especially\nevident as Puerto Rican officials have looked for options to restructure a\ndebt-repayment burden so overwhelming that it threatens to empty the\ncommonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s treasury, to cause profound hardship for island residents,\nand to leave officials with few options for renewing a battered economy.\n\n\n\nWhile states and mainland cities have the varying degrees of flexibility to\nrestructure debt burdens of the sort that Puerto Rico is facing, the island\nlacks them.

He deserves\ncredit for that, and encouragement to keep it up.\n\n\n\n*Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley: A Strong Foreign Policy Starts With a Global Middle Class\n<http://time.com/3947720/martin-omalley-foreign-policy-middle-class/> //\nTIME // Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nI believe America\xe2\x80\x99s role in the world is to advance the cause of a global\nmiddle class.\n\n\n\nAfter more than 12 years on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, and\nafter a global financial crisis that decimated our middle class, it is\nunderstandable that many Americans would like to disengage from the world.\nBut our country\xe2\x80\x99s security and prosperity demand that we be more engaged in\nthe world, not less.\n\n\n\nThe first and foremost responsibility of the next Commander in Chief will\nbe to keep America safe from 21st-century threats: violent extremism;\nnuclear proliferation; pandemics; cyberattacks; rising inequality; failed\nstates; the mega-droughts, famines and floods caused by climate change; and\nmore refugees than at any time since World War II.\n\n\n\nWe may have the most sophisticated military in history, but we do not have\na silver bullet for these problems. So we must pursue a more collaborative,\nproactive, and farsighted foreign policy. We need new international\npartnerships to confront climate change and regional challenges, from the\nSouth China Sea to the sea lanes of the Middle East. We must create a new\nNational Security Act to develop a broader framework for our\nnational-security strategy. We must continue to adapt our military\xe2\x80\x99s force\nstructure and spending to meet today\xe2\x80\x99s threats. And we must establish a\ncybersecurity unit in every state\xe2\x80\x99s National Guard to better protect\nAmericans\xe2\x80\x99 personal data and critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\nMy vision for U.S. foreign policy focuses on the rise of a global middle\nclass, which is a moral, economic, and national-security imperative.\nEliminating the scourge of extreme poverty is a reflection of our most\ndeeply held values. Supporting economic development will help us build the\nnext generation of American political and economic partnerships. And\nprotecting the dignity of human lives in fragile states will reduce the\nthreat of being drawn into costly future conflicts.\n\n\n\nWe must also understand that comprehensive immigration reform is an\neconomic and national-security interest. And we must forge a New Alliance\nfor Progress based on shared interests in our own hemisphere, which we have\nneglected for too long. An early task should be to address the root causes\nof violence and instability in places like El Salvador and Honduras,\nheading off growing crises before they reach our borders.\n\n\n\nWe must listen to U.S. military leaders who have long recognized that\nclimate change is a national security threat. Tackling the climate\nchallenge will provide our nation the greatest business opportunity in 100\nyears. I strongly support an American Green Jobs Agenda. If we can put a\nman on the moon in a decade, we can power America with 100% renewable\nenergy by 2050. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the technology that\xe2\x80\x99s lacking. It\xe2\x80\x99s the political\nwill.\n\n\n\nAll of this is within our reach. But it will require new leadership.\nTwitter and Facebook are no substitute for personal relationships and human\nintelligence. We must recruit a new generation of Americans to exercise our\nglobal economic, diplomatic, military, and healing power in ways consistent\nwith our values. And we must give them the tools to engage a new generation\nof leaders abroad, often in hostile environments where we lack historic\nties.\n\n\n\nThe cornerstone of American strength in the world is economic strength at\nhome. Maintaining our security in the long run will require an economy that\nworks for all Americans. No fighter jet or troop battalion will protect us\nas much as a vibrant economy. A stronger middle class is the first garrison\nagainst any threat we might face.\n\n\n\nThe greatest power we possess as Americans is not military might, but the\npower of our own example. We must lead the world by strengthening the\nAmerican middle class and supporting the rise of a global middle class \xe2\x80\x94\nfree from want, and free from fear.\n\n\n\nThat will make us more prosperous and secure. That will give our children a\nbetter future with more opportunity. And that will make our planet\nhealthier, more peaceful, and more just.\n\n\n\nThese are the foreign policy and national security goals worthy of a truly\ngreat people.\n\n\n\n*O\'Malley Denounces Super PACs As One Supporting Him Goes After Sanders\n<http://nhpr.org/post/omalley-denounces-super-pacs-one-supporting-him-goes-after-sanders>\n// NHPR // Rachael Brindley \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O\'Malley says he\'d prefer there were no super\nPACs, but stopped short of calling on one supporting him to stop airing\nnegative attack ads against Democratic rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\n\n\n"I would hope that we would keep this debate a debate about the issues and\nI would prefer, not that I\'m able to tell a super PAC what to do, I would\nprefer that we didn\'t have any super PACs, frankly," he said.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with NHPR\'s Morning Edition, O\'Malley was responding to\nattack ads being aired by the Generation Forward PAC, which has been\ncritical of Sanders for not being progressive enough when it comes to gun\ncontrol.\n\n\n\nO\'Malley didn\'t say whether he supported or denounced the ads, only that he\ndisagreed with the Citizens United decision, saying that once you\'re a\ncandidate, "you\'re in a bit of a straight jacket. There are all sorts of\nrules and limitations, but super PACs have none."\n\n\n\nO\'Malley is scheduled to return to New Hampshire this week, as polls show\nhe\'s got a lot of ground to make up to catch Sanders and former Secretary\nof State Hillary Clinton. A recent poll showed O\'Malley with just 2 percent\nof support among Democratic voters.\n\n\n\nO\'Malley has acknowledged Sanders\' recent surge in the polls, but\nattributes that to him being a "protest candidate." When asked what he\nmeant by that, O\'Malley said," History has shown usually the candidates\nthat are surging in the summer are not the candidates who are surging in\nthe primary."\n\n\n\n"I\'m running for President of the United States, and I have 15 years of\nexecutive experience, getting things done," he said. "I have to offer\nprogressive values as well as an ability to actually deliver on the goals\nset, whether it\'s affordable college, reducing violent crime, increasing\njob creation, or defending the highest median income in the country through\na recession."\n\n\n\n*SANDERS*\n\n\n\n*Can Bernie Sanders Beat Hillary Clinton? Reporter\xe2\x80\x99s Notebook\n<http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2015/07/07/can-bernie-sanders-beat-hillary-clinton-reporters-notebook/>\n// NYT // Pat Leary \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nDeep down, does Bernie Sanders actually believe he can beat Hillary Rodham\nClinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination?\n\n\n\nAfter watching and interviewing him over the last several weeks, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear\nthat the Vermont senator thinks he could win, yet also knows that it will\ntake the political equivalent of lightning in a bottle.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one thing for people to say that the country is going in the wrong\ndirection, that we need to change directions,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sanders told me\nrecently. \xe2\x80\x9cBut is there the energy to get seriously involved in the\ncampaign? Can the thousands of people coming to our events be turned into a\nreal political organization? Will the people showing up this summer also\nshow up to vote for our message next winter in the primaries?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPeople may be surprised to learn that Mr. Sanders isn\xe2\x80\x99t some starry-eyed\npolitical fantasist, despite his socialist leanings and visions of moving\nAmerica closer to a welfare-state system like those of Denmark and Sweden,\nwhich he praises as models of fair-minded government on the campaign trail.\n\n\n\nAfter more than 30 years as an elected official, he is shrewd enough to\nknow that the huge crowds he is drawing (including 7,000 people in\nPortland, Me., on Monday night) won\xe2\x80\x99t mean much if they don\xe2\x80\x99t support his\ncandidacy in the way that matters, by rallying support from friends and\nacquaintances, and, of course, voting for him when the time comes.\n\n\n\nOne of the problems for Mr. Sanders is that his political organization is\nstill relatively tiny (a few dozen paid staff members at this point,\ncompared to hundreds for Mrs. Clinton) and can only grow so fast. And it is\nnot growing as fast as the crowds showing up at his campaign events.\n\n\n\nWhy does that matter? Like another presidential candidate from Vermont,\nHoward Dean, in 2003, Mr. Sanders is using the summer before the primaries\nto build political momentum by holding events in reliably liberal enclaves\nwhere thousands of voters are flocking to his message, and the news media\nis spotlighting the big turnout.\n\n\n\nBut Mr. Sanders doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have big teams of campaign staff on the ground in\nPortland, Madison, Wis., Minneapolis and elsewhere who can perform\nlabor-intensive follow-up with virtually every voter who attended his\nrallies. That kind of outreach is a specialty of Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s army of\norganizers and volunteers.\n\n\n\nGive us time, say Sanders advisers, who are at this point focusing manpower\nand money on the two early-voting states, Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have an incredibly great message, and a messenger that people are\nexcited about,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pete D\xe2\x80\x99Alessandro, who is overseeing the Sanders\ncampaign in Iowa. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the key is the extent to which we can turn a\ngrass-roots campaign into a winning campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFor Mr. Sanders to win the Iowa caucuses, which some Clinton allies and\nadvisers now see as a real possibility, his organization and the savvy,\nexperienced operatives running it will have to scale up substantially.\n\n\n\nIn the end, of course, there remains the threshold question: Do Americans\nhunger for radical change intensely enough, and in big enough numbers, to\ndefeat a popular, well-financed Democrat who is widely considered more\nmainstream and electable than Mr. Sanders?\n\n\n\n*Why we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just call Bernie Sanders a \xe2\x80\x98liberal\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/07/07/why-we-shouldnt-call-bernie-sanders-a-liberal/>\n// WaPo // Hunter Schwartz \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015*\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is some progressives\'\ngreat hope to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016. But to say he\'s a\ndown-the-line liberal would be to misread a political career the includes\nplenty of nuance.\n\n\n\nOver the weekend, Sanders spoke on gun control and the tax-exempt status of\nchurches, and if you were hearing him for the first time, you might think\nhe was a Republican. He defended gun owners on CNN\'s "State of the Union,"\nsaying 99.9 percent of them obey the law and that gun manufacturers\nshouldn\'t be held responsible for murderers "any more than you would hold a\nhammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a\nhammer."\n\n\n\nOn removing the tax-exempt status for churches that don\'t recognize\nsame-sex marriage, he said he didn\'t know that he\'d "go there" and that he\nrespected "people who have different points of view."\n\n\n\nOf course, neither of these positions necessarily run counter to the\nDemocratic Party\'s principles -- Hillary Clinton isn\'t going after\nlaw-abiding gun owners, and Martin O\'Malley isn\'t campaigning on taking\naway churches\' tax-exempt status -- and Sanders\'s comments came in the\ncontext of his liberal bona fides, which he also mentioned. For example, he\nhas voted to ban semiautomatic assault weapons and create instant\nbackground checks, and he voted against the Defense of Marriage Act, which\nwas signed into law in 1996 by Democratic President Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\nBut there are certain things that might complicate Sanders for those on the\nleft -- and it wasn\'t just this weekend, either. In 1993, as a member of\nthe House, he voted against the Brady bill, which required federal\nbackground checks for most gun purchases. He also voted to allow people to\ntransport guns on Amtrak, and he previously said he didn\'t think stricter\ngun control would end mass shootings. (Sanders\'s home state of Vermont,\nwhile generally quite liberal, is also very pro-gun rights.)\n\n\n\nHis history with immigration reform is similar, with a mixed record of\nsupporting things like the Dream Act and the 2013 bill, but in 2007 helping\nto kill that comprehensive immigration reform deal by teaming with\nconservative Republican Sen. Charles Grassley (Iowa) on so-called "poison\npill" amendments. Other Democrats opposed the final bill, as Sanders did,\nbut almost all who did so came from the more moderate wing of the party.\n\n\n\nSanders might just become some GOP-leaning voters\' favorite 2016 Democrat\n-- and not just because he\'s giving Hillary Clinton a tough time. It\'s not\nhard to see some of his positions appealing to more libertarian voters like\nformer Ron Paul fans who prefer Sanders over Rand Paul. His arguments for a\nmiddle ground on some of our most controversial social issues also could\nappeal to voters frustrated by hyper-partisan politics.\n\n\n\nHe has surprised even himself with the turnout he\'s getting at some early\ncampaign events. The more than 2,500 people who showed up to a Friday rally\nin Iowa were part of the largest crowd for any candidate in Iowa this\ncycle. But he\'s not just spending all his time in Iowa or New Hampshire.\nSanders has had rallies in Colorado and Wisconsin, and he told The Nation\nthat he believes candidates should have a 50-state campaign strategy,\nrattling off red states he thinks Democrats, as "the party of working\npeople," should campaign in, including Mississippi, South Carolina and\nAlabama. On Monday, he drew 7,500 people closer to home in Portland, Maine.\n\n\n\nSanders is a socialist who championed progressive issues before they became\nmore mainstream, but it\'s also clear that he\'s an independent and not a\nDemocrat for a reason. He\'s beloved by liberal Democrats who feel Clinton\nis too moderate, but as his vision for a 50-state campaign and gun and\ntax-exempt comments show, he\'s making a play for people who might not\ndescribe themselves as "very liberal."\n\n\n\n*The issue on which Bernie Sanders aims for \xe2\x80\x98the middle\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-issue-which-bernie-sanders-aims-the-middle>\n// MSNBC // Steve Benen \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest political stories of the summer is the reception Sen.\nBernie Sanders is receiving on the presidential campaign trail. In a 2016\nfield filled with high-profile candidates, it\xe2\x80\x99s the Vermont Independent\nwho\xe2\x80\x99s drawing the largest crowds.\n\nThis was evident yesterday in Maine, which came on the heels of similarly\nsuccessful events in Iowa and Wisconsin last week. As Rachel noted on the\nshow last night, Sanders is \xe2\x80\x9chaving way more retail success on the campaign\ntrail than anyone else in either party \xe2\x80\x93 anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSanders\xe2\x80\x99 early success seems baffling to much of the political world, but\nlet this be a lesson to observers: there are plenty of unapologetic\nliberals out there who are eager to celebrate Sanders and his vision.\n\nBut just away from the spotlight, there\xe2\x80\x99s still just one potential trouble\narea for the Vermonter. A few readers flagged this Facebook item yesterday\nfrom the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pleased with comments\nSanders made in an interview on Sunday with CNN\xe2\x80\x99s Jake Tapper:\n\n\n\nU.S. Senator Bernie Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 characterization here of the National Rifle\nAssociation-drafted \xe2\x80\x9cProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act\xe2\x80\x9d that he\nvoted for in 2005 is an utter fabrication. The bill has nothing to do with\nprotecting upstanding gun manufacturers and dealers. Instead, it gives\nNEGLIGENT manufacturers and dealers blanket immunity from civil lawsuits.\nThis law is THE REASON why two parents who lost their daughter in the\nAurora shooting had their suit thrown out and are now being ordered to pay\nmore than $200,000 in legal fees to gun companies that armed James Holmes.\n\nIt is an immoral law that denies victims and survivors their day in court \xe2\x80\x93\na fundamental democratic right \xe2\x80\x93 and Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 position is totally\nunacceptable. A big thanks to Jake Tapper for holding him accountable.\n\n\n\nSanders hasn\xe2\x80\x99t taken much heat from the left since launching his campaign,\nso it\xe2\x80\x99s worth pausing to appreciate what this is all about.\n\nIn the CNN interview, Tapper asked Sanders, \xe2\x80\x9cEarlier this year, the parents\nof one of the 12 innocent people killed during the Aurora movie theater\nshooting, they saw their lawsuit to hold ammunition sellers liable for the\nattack, they saw that dismissed. And one of the reasons was a law that you\nvoted for which protects manufacturers of firearms and ammunition from\nbeing sued. Why did you vote that way?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSanders stressed that the NRA is not a fan of his \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99s voted, for\nexample, to close the gun-show loophole and in support of instant\nbackground checks \xe2\x80\x93 before explaining:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, the issues that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about is, if somebody has a gun and it\nfalls into the hands of a murderer, and that murderer kills somebody with\nthe gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible? Not anymore than you\nwould hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beat somebody over the\nhead with a hammer. That is not what a lawsuit should be about.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is part, by the way, I may say, of \xe2\x80\x93 you know, folks who do not\nlike guns is fine, but we have millions of people who are gun owners in\nthis country; 99.9 percent of those people obey the law. I want to see real\nserious debate and action on guns. But it is not going to take place if we\nsimply have extreme positions on both sides. I think I can bring us to the\nmiddle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt was this response that did not go over well with the Coalition to Stop\nGun Violence. The litigation strategy against gun manufacturers is an\nimportant idea for many gun-safety advocates, and Sanders seemed to dismiss\nthe idea as ridiculous.\n\nOverall, I\xe2\x80\x99m generally skeptical that gun policy represents a real threat\nto Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 support from the left. The senator\xe2\x80\x99s platform largely focuses\non economics, not social issues, and my hunch is that if someone were to\ntell the thousands of voters showing up for Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 events that he\xe2\x80\x99s a\nmoderate on guns, the vast majority wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care.\n\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s nevertheless a rare instance in which Sanders breaks with\nprogressive orthodoxy, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an issue on which Hillary Clinton is\nsquarely to the senator\xe2\x80\x99s left \xe2\x80\x93 a detail that Democratic voters may be\nhearing more about in the coming months.\n\n* Update: In the statement from the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, the\ngroup notes that two parents who lost their daughter in the Aurora shooting\n\xe2\x80\x9care now being ordered to pay more than $200,000 in legal fees to gun\ncompanies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA colleague reminds me, however, that this is not entirely correct \xe2\x80\x93 the\nparents have been ordered to pay \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d damages, and the $200,000\nfigure is the one the company has requested. The judge, however, has not\nyet set the actual amount, and as of now, the parents in the case haven\xe2\x80\x99t\nbeen ordered to pay anything.\n\n\n\n*Bernie Sanders is no Ron Paul: What the press gets all wrong about the\nVermont senator\n<http://www.salon.com/2015/07/08/bernie_sanders_is_no_ron_paul_what_even_the_left_gets_wrong_about_the_vermont_senator_partner/>*\n\n*He\'ll always be an underdog, but Sanders is a more viable candidate than\neven the left-wing media will acknowledge*\n<http://www.salon.com/2015/07/08/bernie_sanders_is_no_ron_paul_what_even_the_left_gets_wrong_about_the_vermont_senator_partner/>*\n// Salon // Zaid Jilani \xe2\x80\x93 July 8, 2015*\n\n\n\nAlterNet Monday night, Bernie Sanders drew 7,500 people in the town of\nPortland, Maine, a locale that only has a population of 66,000. The\nPortland rally was the latest in a series of high turnouts, as Sanders is\ndrawing more Americans to his events than any other candidate in either\nparty.\n\n\n\nIn response to the high turnouts at Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s events, many in the media\nhave sought to downplay his momentum by comparing him to former GOP\npresidential candidate Ron Paul, who also inspired an enthusiastic\nfollowing:\n\n\n\nThe message these outlets are promoting is that Sanders, like Paul, will be\nable to get an enthusiastic base but will ultimately fail in his quest for\nthe presidency and will only make only a minor impact on the debate. The\nimplication seems to be that Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 views are on the fringe, like Ron\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s. But are they? Or is it just that he is the only one articulating\nthe need to address extreme inequality and expanding social security, which\nmillions of Americans support?\n\n\n\nThe media message seems to rely on the idea that the two men are similar\nbecause they spark genuine enthusiasm among their supporters \xe2\x80\x93 which is\nperhaps a sad commentary on American politics that there are so few\ncandidates who can do this that when they do they are instantly compared.\n\n\n\nBut the analogy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really hold beyond that. In 2008, when Paul first\nran for the presidency, he had 130,000 donors through the fourth quarter\n(January 2008). Recall that this was a campaign that began very early, with\nPaul entering the race on an official basis in March 2007 after forming his\npresidential exploration committee in January of that year.\n\n\n\nSanders, on the other hand, has already collected 250,000 donors after\naround two months of campaigning. This means that the Vermont Senator is\ncollecting donors at nearly 8 times the rate that Paul did in his first run\nfor the presidency.\n\n\n\nThe biggest difference between the two is the ceiling of support they were\nable to hit. Paul, despite his enthusiastic and genuinely creative\nvolunteer and donor base, has advocated ideas like completely eliminating\nMedicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. Even among the GOP base, these\nideas are extremely unpopular.\n\n\n\nSanders, on the other hand, has since his time as Burlington, Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s\nmayor, promoted ideas that are mainstream and popular. Even in the House of\nRepresentatives between 1994 and 2006, one of the most right-wing\nlegislative bodies in American history, it was Sanders who passed the most\namendments of any member of Congress.\n\n\n\nThere is no doubt that he\xe2\x80\x99s an underdog, but Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s ideas are popular\nand he is gaining traction at a far quicker rate than Ron Paul did. It\xe2\x80\x99s\ntrue that both Paul and Sanders were insurgent candidates who drew\nenthusiastic supporters. The similarities end there.\n\n\n\n*Bernie Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 Plan To Make Solar Power More Accessible\n<http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/07/07/3677745/bernie-sanders-introduces-solar-legislation/>\n// Think Progress // Ari Phillips \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015*\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Vermont Senator and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate\nBernie Sanders introduced legislation aimed at making it easier for\nlow-income families to take advantage of solar power. The bill, called the\n\xe2\x80\x9cLow Income Solar Act,\xe2\x80\x9d came the same day that the Obama Administration\nannounced a similar program aimed at installing 300 megawatts of renewable\nenergy in federally subsidized housing by 2020.\n\n\n\nThe Sanders bill would aid in this effort by providing $200 million in\nDepartment of Energy loans and grants to help offset the upfront costs\nassociated with installing solar panels on community facilities, public\nhousing and low-income family homes, according to a press release. The\nprojects would also have to prioritize loans for female- and minority-owned\nbusinesses, as well as target specific regions including Appalachia, Indian\ntribal lands, and Alaskan native communities.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe scientific community tells us very clearly if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to reverse\nclimate change and the great dangers it poses for the planet we must move\naggressively to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to\nsustainable energy,\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can achieve this\ngoal, save families money and protect the planet for future generations.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAccording to the bill summary, homeowners with suitable roofs would receive\ngrants to help them afford solar panel installation while renters or others\nwithout appropriate siting options would get connected through alternative\nmeans such as community solar gardens. Solar gardens are designed for those\nwithout rooftop access as a way to connect to a shared solar system that\nguarantees their electricity comes from solar power.\n\nUsually these community solar gardens are one or two megawatts in size and\noperated by third-party solar providers and local utilities.\n\n\n\nEnvironmentalists are pleased that Sanders is running for president, as he\nis one of the climate change action leaders in the Senate.\n\n\n\nEnvironmental activist and founder of 350.org Bill McKibben recently\npraised Sanders as \xe2\x80\x9cthe ultimate what-you-see-is-what-you-get politician.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBernie\xe2\x80\x99s been in the forefront of all the crucial environmental fights of\nrecent years, always willing to knuckle down and do the hard work of\nfighting the big corporations,\xe2\x80\x9d McKibben told the Burlington Free Press.\n\n\n\nAs ThinkProgress previously reported, after the 2014 election that put the\nGOP in charge of the Senate, Sanders pushed the chamber to go on the record\nas to whether climate change is happening, caused by human activity, and\nresulting in \xe2\x80\x9cdevastating problems in the United States and around the\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn 2015 he attended the People\xe2\x80\x99s Climate March in New York City and told\nDemocracy Now! that climate change is \xe2\x80\x9ca huge issue.

Fresh off news that\nSanders is now virtually tied with Hillary in New Hampshire, Claire\nMcCaskill went on Morning Joe on June 25 to declare that \xe2\x80\x9cthe media is\ngiving Bernie a pass \xe2\x80\xa6 they\xe2\x80\x99re not giving the same scrutiny to Bernie that\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re certainly giving to Hillary.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe irony here is thick. In 2006, McCaskill said on Meet the Press that\nwhile Bill Clinton was a great president, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want my daughter near\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d Upon hearing the news, according to John Heilemann and Mark\nHalperin\xe2\x80\x99s book Game Change, Hillary exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cFuck her,\xe2\x80\x9d and cancelled a\nfundraiser for the Missouri senator. McCaskill later apologized to Bill\nClinton, and was wooed intensely by Hillary during the 2008 primaries. But\nshe infuriated the Clintons again by endorsing Barack Obama. In their book\nHRC, Aimee Parnes and Jonathan Allen write that, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Hate\xe2\x80\x99 is too weak a word\nto describe the feelings that Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s core loyalists still have for\nMcCaskill.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMcCaskill, in other words, is a great surrogate: someone eager enough to\nregain the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 affection that she\xe2\x80\x99ll not only praise Hillary, but\nalso slam their opponents. On Morning Joe, she had two talking points.\nFirst, journalists are giving Sanders a pass. Second, Sanders is a\nsocialist, and thus can\xe2\x80\x99t win. Asked about Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 large crowds, McCaskill\ncompared him to Ron Paul and Pat Buchanan, other candidates who sparked\nenthusiasm among their supporters but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t win a general election\nbecause of their \xe2\x80\x9cextreme message.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn point number one, McCaskill is undeniably correct: Media coverage of\nSanders has been fawning, partly because many journalists harbor sympathy\nfor his anti-corporate message but mostly because they\xe2\x80\x99re desperate for a\ncontested primary. Given Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s strong poll numbers, the media would\neventually have gotten around to tearing down the man they pumped up. But\nTeam Clinton clearly wants to accelerate this process before Sanders gets\nany more momentum.\n\n\n\nMore intriguing is point number two. Sanders probably would be a\nproblematic general-election candidate. But the liberals flocking to his\nside don\xe2\x80\x99t much care. Nor are the Clintonites likely to scare off many\nliberals by reminding them that Sanders is a socialist. Most of them\nalready know. And far from hiding it, Sanders is quite effective when\nchallenged on this point. Right after he jumped in the race, George\nStephanopoulos gave Sanders exactly the treatment McCaskill is calling for\nnow. First, he reminded Sanders he was a socialist. Then, when Sanders\npointed to Scandinavia as his socialist model, Stephanopoulos snarked that,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can hear the Republican attack ad right now: He wants America to be look\nmore like Scandinavia.\xe2\x80\x9d But Sanders was not cowed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right. That\xe2\x80\x99s\nright,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with that? What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong when you have\nmore income and wealth equality? What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong when they have a stronger\nmiddle class in many ways than we do?\xe2\x80\x9d It was the kind of performance more\nlikely to leave liberals inspired than alienated.\n\n\n\nMcCaskill grew even less effective when Mark Halperin did something TV\ninterviewers too rarely do: He demanded substance. Give \xe2\x80\x9cthree specific\npositions\xe2\x80\x9d of Sanders that \xe2\x80\x9care too far left,\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not here\nto be critical of my colleague Senator Sanders,\xe2\x80\x9d McCaskill responded,\nabsurdly. But Halperin caught her, noting that, \xe2\x80\x9cWith all due respect, you\nalready were: You said he was socialist and not electable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThen things got interesting. The specifics McCaskill offered were that\nSanders \xe2\x80\x9cwould like to see Medicare for all in this country, have everybody\nhave a government-insurance policy,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9che would like to see expansion\nof entitlement,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9che is someone who is frankly against trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIf Hillary actually goes after Sanders on these specifics, the Democratic\nrace will get very interesting very fast. A debate about Obamacare versus\nsingle-payer health insurance, about expanding Social Security versus\nrestraining its growth, and about the merits of free trade would be\nfascinating. But I doubt it\xe2\x80\x99s a debate Hillary wants to have. She is, after\nall, running a campaign based on generating enthusiasm among the party\xe2\x80\x99s\nliberal core. By taking bold, left-leaning positions on immigration,\ncriminal justice, and campaign-finance reform, she\xe2\x80\x99s trying (and so far\nsucceeding) to erase her reputation from 2008 as a timid triangulator\nunwilling to offer big change. Yet the more Hillary emphasizes her\nopposition to single-payer health care, her opposition to expanding Social\nSecurity, and her support for free trade, the more she undermines her own\nstrategy. By taking on Sanders on these issues, Hillary also implicitly\ntakes on Elizabeth Warren, who has made expanding Social Security and\nopposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership two of her recent crusades.\n\n\n\nThe irony is that in 2008, when Hillary was trying to distinguish herself\nfrom her party\xe2\x80\x99s left base in order to appeal to general-election\nmoderates, an opponent like Bernie Sanders might have seemed like a\nblessing. In 2016, by contrast, when Hillary is running to the left,\nattacking him as too far left is dangerous.\n\n\n\nNo wonder McCaskill wants journalists to bury the curmudgeonly Vermonter.\nThe Hillary campaign knows how tricky it will be to bury him themselves.\n\n\n\n*This Could Be Bernie Sanders\' Biggest General Election Challenge\n<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/could-be-bernie-sanders-biggest-general-election-challenge-n388071>\n// NBC News // Mark Murray \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nIt\'s been the Summer of Bernie Sanders.\n\n\n\nThousands are turning out at his campaign events, his poll numbers are\nskyrocketing and the New York Times is now raising the question: What if\nBernie Sanders wins Iowa?\n\n\n\nBut here\'s a different question: Can he win a general election?\n\n\n\nWhile no national poll has yet to test Sanders in a trial heat against the\nRepublican field, a June 2015 Gallup poll found that being a self-described\nsocialist -- as Sanders is -- is more unpopular for a presidential\ncandidate than being an evangelical Christian, Muslim or atheist.\n\n\n\nAccording to the poll, 50 percent said they wouldn\'t vote for a socialist,\ncompared with 40 percent who wouldn\'t vote for an atheist, 38 percent for a\nMuslim and 25 percent for an evangelical Christian.\n\n\n\n\n\n"Bernie is too liberal to gather enough votes in this country to become\npresident," Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said last month on MSNBC\'s\n"Morning Joe."\n\n\n\nWhen CNN asked Sanders about McCaskill\'s remarks, he responded that what\nvoters truly care about are the issues. "I think people are coming out to\nour meetings because they want to hear some straight talk. They want to\nhear some truth about what\'s going on in America today."\n\n\n\nThere is one other factor to consider: Iowa Democratic caucus-goers have\nbeen much more pragmatic than their GOP counterparts have been in recent\nyears.\n\n\n\nWhile the last two Republican winners in Iowa (Mike Huckabee and Rick\nSantorum) ultimately didn\'t win the GOP presidential nomination, the last\nthree Democratic winners of Iowa (Al Gore, John Kerry and Barack Obama) did\nwin their party\'s nomination.\n\n\n\n*Rep.

I did serve with him\non the then-Banking Committee and we actually came up with, initially, with\nthe National Housing Trust Fund, worked together on that, and so I\xe2\x80\x99ve\nworked with him on many, many issues and he\xe2\x80\x99s a friend,\xe2\x80\x9d Lee said on the\nJeff Santos Show.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think what he is doing really is galvanizing progressives to really\ndevelop a strong progressive agenda that deals with all of the issues, that\nthe majority of Americans want to deal with,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think by\nthe turnout and by what the response of the people around the country, we\nsee that his message is resonating and so I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing that\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s out there,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nLast week Sanders supporters filled the 10,000 seat Veterans Memorial\nColiseum in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m supporting the progressive agenda, Mayor DeBlasio, myself, and\nprobably 8 to 10 members of Congress signed on to a progressive agenda that\nwe are putting forward, that addresses many of the issues that Senator\nClinton and Bernie Sanders are raising\xe2\x80\x94excuse me Secretary of State Clinton\nand Senator Sanders are raising.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so income inequality, when you look at a living wage, when you look at\nclimate change, there are many, many issues on that that progressive agenda\nthat both Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie are really addressing and I think\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a very exciting time that he is doing this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Bernie Sanders Hits a Triumphant Note As His Crowds Grow\n<http://time.com/3947693/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-crowds/> // TIME //\nSam Frizell \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders, tan and slightly hoarse after six weeks of campaigning for\npresident, began a stump speech on Monday night with a humble brag of epic\nproportions. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes, media people ask me, \xe2\x80\x98Well, Bernie, why are so\nmany people coming out to your events?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders said to a crowd of 7,500\npeople in Portland, Maine.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell the answer is, I think, pretty obvious,\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders continued, flashing\na grin to cheers before getting stern again. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom Maine to California\xe2\x80\x94we\nhave friends in Alaska and Hawaii as well\xe2\x80\x94the American people understand\nthat establishment politics and establishment economics is not working for\nthe middle class!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe audiences are growing, he says, mostly because things in America are so\nbad. It\xe2\x80\x99s a note of encouragement in the midst of Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 famously\njaundiced speeches, a nod to the tide of hope and discontent that his\ncampaign is riding. \xe2\x80\x9cAll over America, people are becoming involved in this\ncampaign because they want change,\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders said. \xe2\x80\x9cReal change! And that is\nwhat this campaign is about.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn a campaign by numbers, Sanders has taken a surprisingly strong grasp of\nthe Democratic base. He drew crowds of thousands at several rallies in the\nlast week, a notable feat 16 months before a general election. His poll\nnumbers in the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire show he is just a\nfew paces behind Hillary Clinton, climbing within ten points of the\npresumptive Democratic nominee in one recent poll. And more than 250,000\npeople have donated to his campaign.\n\n\n\nThey are surprising metrics of success for a politician who for decades has\nseen himself as an outsider.\n\n\n\nSanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, has done it armed with\nthe promise of revolution. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only way that change takes place is when we\ndevelop that strong grassroots movement, make that political revolution,\nstand together,\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders said on Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then we bring about change.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSanders had originally planned his Monday night rally in this seaside city\nof 66,000 people at a small venue on the water, but after thousands of\nRSVPs came back online, he was forced to reschedule the speech in a large\narena usually reserved for big musical acts and hockey games. Nearly 8,000\npeople showed up, flooding the standing room with Mainers touting an\neclectic mix of tribal tattoos, floral prints, polo shirts and New Balance\nsneakers.\n\n\n\nSanders\xe2\x80\x99 supporters found in Portland a candidate invigorated by the last\nmonths of success. With his left hand gripping the podium and his right\nhand dancing in the air as if holding a marionette, Sanders framed the\nrecent liberal groundswell as part of a long legacy of activism. He pointed\nto the labor movement of the early 20th century, the women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage\nactivists and the civil rights movement as models for changing the country.\nHe called for equal pay, paid family leave, a higher minimum wage, breaking\nup the big banks, and a massive infrastructure rebuilding program, a la the\nNew Deal.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing, nothing, nothing that we cannot accomplish!\xe2\x80\x9d said\nSanders.\n\n\n\nThe crowds have taken note of Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s sanguine outlook and call to action.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s telling us that the people\xe2\x80\x99s movements\xe2\x80\x94the grassroots movements\xe2\x80\x94have\nsucceeded when people got off their asses and they went out and marched,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid James Murdoch, a self-employed designer and builder who attended the\nrally. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re now getting to the point where people are getting involved\nand getting active again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPortland was just one leg on Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 packed schedule: after a Madison,\nWisconsin rally on Wednesday that drew some 9,500 people, Sanders spent\nthree days in western Iowa corn country, where in Council Bluffs, 2,500\npeople attended a rally, according to the campaign\xe2\x80\x94more than any other Iowa\nrally so far. (In Iowa he is trailing Clinton by 52-33.) He flew back to\nBurlington, and then drove with his wife and an aide the 250-odd miles to\nPortland.\n\n\n\nDespite some of the change in tone, Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 speeches are still largely\njeremiads on the perennial problems. Wall Street and the greed of the 1%\nare destroying America, Sanders says, climate change is wreaking drought\nand deadly heat waves, and misguided trade agreements are sending millions\nof jobs overseas to countries like China. There\xe2\x80\x99s only a short window of\nopportunity to stop global warming, and the middle class is in grave danger.\n\n\n\nAmong his fans, there\xe2\x80\x99s a new hint of faith that the gravity of the\ncampaign may have jolted something awake. People in the audience said\nafterward that Sanders had struck a chord, particularly for those\ndisappointed by the Obama years and cautious of the hope brand that\ndominated the 2008 campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s saying the things that need to be said,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Fran Falcone, a mental health counselor, of Sanders. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to start\nreally looking at what\xe2\x80\x99s going in our country that\xe2\x80\x99s turned it into a place\na lot of us don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAfter the speech, Sanders dined at a Spanish-inspired restaurant a few\nblocks away on Portland\xe2\x80\x99s Congress Street. Word got around town he was\nthere, and a small crowd gathered to seem him before he went to bed and\nmade for Washington D.C. the next day for Senate duties.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, two buddies drank beers on the upstairs terrace of an Irish pub\none block from the rally arena. They discussed the\nreality-check-and-momentum phenomenon. \xe2\x80\x9cCampaigns have cycles,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPortland resident Doug Hall about Sanders, speaking over the house music.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the wake-the-f***-up cycle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPaul Drinan, who runs a non-profit and also lives in town, agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cAt this\npoint in the game that\xe2\x80\x99s the appeal: there\xe2\x80\x99s no fluff in the message. He\xe2\x80\x99s\ntelling it like it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Drinan. \xe2\x80\x9cBernie\xe2\x80\x99s riding the wave.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*As Labor Grapples With Candidate Endorsements, Transit Union Head Applauds\nBernie Sanders\n<http://www.ibtimes.com/election-2016-labor-grapples-candidate-endorsements-transit-union-head-applauds-1996900>\n// IB Times // Cole Stangler \xe2\x80\x93July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., says he wants to fight the \xe2\x80\x9cbillionaire class,"\nthe signature phrase of a presidential campaign that\'s thrived by pitting\nbeleaguered American workers against the rich and powerful. And as the\nself-described socialist continues his steady rise in the polls against\nDemocratic primary opponent and presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton,\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s winning support from the American underdogs par excellence: trade\nunionists.\n\n\n\nNo major unions have made White House endorsements, and the national\nAFL-CIO has yet to formally back a candidate. Still, a couple of state\nlabor federations have passed resolutions backing Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 bid (even though\nthey were rebuked in an AFL-CIO memo for breaching the federation\xe2\x80\x99s\nendorsement process); thousands of rank-and-file union members have signed\nup with the grassroots Labor for Bernie network; and last week, the\nrecently retired head of one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest unions joined Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s\ncampaign team as a volunteer.\n\n\n\nIn a recent interview with International Business Times -- before the\nAFL-CIO fired off its warning memo last week -- the head of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s\nlargest transit union cheered Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cwillingness to get outside the\nbubble.\xe2\x80\x9d The Amalgamated Transit Union\xe2\x80\x99s Larry Hanley did not endorse the\nsenator, and the union, which represents some 200,000 people, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\ndecided whom to back yet. But the ATU\'s Hanley credited Sanders for raising\nthe sorts of problems, beyond bread-and-butter labor ones, that he says\nhurt American workers: things like unnecessary military spending,\nenvironmental degradation and prohibitively costly college tuition. Hanley\nbecomes the first president of a major union to weigh in publicly -- and\ncandidly -- about the Democratic primary matchup.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis model doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work,\xe2\x80\x9d said the outspoken labor leader in a\nwide-ranging conversation about national politics and the 2016 campaign.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not working for our unions, it\xe2\x80\x99s not working for our members, it\xe2\x80\x99s\nnot working for our people and we have to change the model. It\xe2\x80\x99s not enough\nfor us to just put our logo up on some candidate who\xe2\x80\x99s gonna stand up for\nthe status quo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are at a critical point in our history because our economy is\ninevitably going to be crippled by this ridiculous war spending, and our\nenvironment is teetering on the brink of disaster every day, and these are\nissues that have been neglected or made worse by the policies of the\nneocons, which obviously, includes people on both sides of the political\naisle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn particular, Hanley praised Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 support for free education at\nfour-year public universities -- a plan that Clinton has not endorsed.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody running for president should just check that box; it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nbe a hard one, but I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting to see if they will,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly\nanybody who\xe2\x80\x99s running in the party that claims to represent average working\npeople ought to be saying, \xe2\x80\x98Yeah, you know what? There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why we\nhave to burden our kids with debt, why we have to make them come out of\ncollege with something comparable to a mortgage to pay before they get a\njob.\xe2\x80\x99 I mean, come on, this stuff is obvious.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe live in a bubble of false discussion, and both sides, Democrats and\nRepublicans, refuse to break out of that bubble,\xe2\x80\x9d Hanley continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nthink Bernie has shown more of a willingness to get outside the bubble,\noutside the box and have those discussions. As a consequence of that, I\nthink he\xe2\x80\x99s a very good addition to the race. I think hopefully that he will\nencourage people in the Democratic Party to remember where they came from\nand remember their roots.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Hanley offered some praise for Clinton. A former bus\ndriver from the New York City borough of Staten Island, Hanley rose through\nthe ranks of the transit union before his election to the top office in\n2010. As he was serving as president of his New York City local, in 2000,\nhe supported the then-first lady\xe2\x80\x99s successful Senate campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a\nlong history of fond affection for Hillary Clinton -- she has stood up and\ndone many things in her lifetime of a historic nature,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nNevertheless, Hanley added -- with a flair of ambiguity -- \xe2\x80\x9cthe truth as I\nknow it is much more frequently expressed by Bernie, and even more than\nBernie, by Elizabeth Warren.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut unions are in a pickle: Is it worth getting behind the underdog or does\nit make more sense to accept conventional wisdom and plan accordingly?\nAfter all, \xe2\x80\x9cif the election\xe2\x80\x99s between Hillary and just about any one of the\nRepublicans that have come forward,\xe2\x80\x9d Hanley said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s gonna look like\nheaven and hell.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to confess to being conflicted, and I think as a matter of fact,\nthe whole labor movement is conflicted over this,\xe2\x80\x9d Hanley said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile we\nsee Bernie being a champion for many of our issues, we\xe2\x80\x99re anguished waiting\non Hillary to take the lead on that, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn the ATU at least, Hanley said, leaders are expressing more frustration\nwith the general political climate than during the last open Democratic\npresidential primary. (Exasperation, in general, jibes more with Sanders\xe2\x80\x99\ncalls for \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical revolution\xe2\x80\x9d than Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s mild-mannered liberalism.)\nIn 2007, a few years before Hanley took over the reins, the union endorsed\nHillary Clinton for president, eventually spending more than $70,000 on her\nfailed primary campaign.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople are united in the notion that we can\xe2\x80\x99t accept the status quo, that\nthe Democratic Party no longer is the party of Franklin Delano Roosevelt,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s more like the party of Nelson Rockefeller and the Republicans are more\nlike the party of the Ku Klux Klan. That\xe2\x80\x99s kinda the way America\xe2\x80\x99s\nshifted,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a boil going on right under the surface in\nAmerica and the advantage Bernie has, by being willing to talk about this\nkind of stuff, is that he may just make that pot boil over.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Coons: "Not Confident" In Bernie Sanders\' Qualifications\n<https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-07/coons-not-confident-in-bernie-sanders-qualifications>\n// Bloomberg // Kendall Breitman \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nSenator Chris Coons is "not confident" that his colleague Senator Bernie\nSanders is presidential material.\n\n\n\n"I am not confident that he\'s got all the qualifications that the American\npublic will look for in its next commander-in-chief," Coons said Tuesday on\nBloomberg Politics\' "With All Due Respect," adding that the ultimate\njudgment will be left up to the electorate.\n\n\n\nCoons comments came after the Democrat was pressed on previous remarks from\nSenator Claire McCaskill - a Clinton ally - who on June 25 told MSNBC that\nSanders is a "socialist" who "is too liberal to gather enough votes in this\ncountry to become president."\n\n\n\n"I, quite frankly, am hoping for someone with more seasoning."\n\n\n\nCoons, who has a close relationship with his fellow Delaware politician and\npotential 2016 candidate Vice President Joe Biden, has yet to endorse any\nspecific candidate so far. Although he said believes Sanders has a\n"terrific record" on advocating for issues involving veterans, middle class\neconomics and social and economic justice, Coons made it plain that the\nindependent from Vermont, who caucuses with Senate Democrats, is not a\ncontender for his nod.\n\n\n\n"I, quite frankly, am hoping for someone with more seasoning, more\nexperience, who served both in the executive branch and the legislative\nbranch," Coons said. "I do think that the sort of experience that I think\nwe will see in the likely Democratic nominee - whether that ends up being\nJoe Biden or Hillary Clinton - would span both the congressional and\nexecutive branches and I think that\'s the sort of experience we should look\nfor in our commander in chief."\n\n\n\n*Fox News\xe2\x80\x99 big Bernie Sanders lie: The right\xe2\x80\x99s laughably lame effort to\nlink Donald Trump and Sanders\n<http://www.salon.com/2015/07/07/fox_news_big_bernie_sanders_lie_the_rights_laughably_lame_effort_to_link_donald_trump_and_sanders/>\n// Salon // Sean Illing \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nThe media cannot help comparing Donald Trump to Bernie Sanders. And the\ncomparison is not altogether wrong. Both candidates appeal to their\nrespective bases. Both are challenging their party\xe2\x80\x99s establishment choices.\nAnd both are drawing massive crowds while surging in national polls.\n\n\n\nThe left (understandably) cringes at such comparisons. Bernie Sanders,\nwhatever you think of him, is a serious person with real ideas. He\xe2\x80\x99s been a\npublic servant since 1981, when he was elected mayor of Burlington,\nVermont. He\xe2\x80\x99s now the longest-serving independent in the history of\nCongress. And his bid for the presidency, while a long shot, is clearly\nearnest.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump, on the other hand, is a clown \xe2\x80\x93 a pompous, spray-tanned\nclown. More important, he\xe2\x80\x99s not actually running for president. His\ncandidacy is a piece of performance art, a self-promoting circus. No one\npaying attention believes he wants to be president \xe2\x80\x93 I suspect he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nrun at all if this were a real possibility. Trump is campaigning because he\ncan, because it bolsters his brand, and because people are dumb enough to\nlisten to him talk about things he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand. If anything, Trump\xe2\x80\x99s\ncampaign, much like Sarah Palin\xe2\x80\x99s, is a reminder of just how broken and\nstupid our political system has become.\n\n\n\nHowever wrong it feels, Democrats ought to embrace the juxtaposition of\nTrump and Sanders for at least two reasons. First, it\xe2\x80\x99s accurate. Both\ncandidates are indeed authentic representations of their party\xe2\x80\x99s base.\nTrump is a near-perfect distillation of the modern American right: The\nbravado, the bigotry, the raging idiocy, the false confidence, and the lack\nof ideas \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s all there in one gloriously manicured body.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not simply that Trump has bad ideas; it\xe2\x80\x99s that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any\nideas at all. And he\xe2\x80\x99s quite explicit about this. His announcement speech\nwas essentially a stream-of-consciousness rant, totally bereft of anything\nresembling a policy proposal. His entire platform consists of him telling\nyou a) how rich and smart he is and b) how stupid and broke everyone else\nis. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. If Trump were laughed out of conservative town halls, that\xe2\x80\x99d\nbe one thing. But he\xe2\x80\x99s not. He\xe2\x80\x99s embraced. According to this recent CNN\npoll, Trump is second only to Jeb Bush among national conservatives. This\nmeans Trump\xe2\x80\x99s fevered ramblings are resonating with the Republican base,\neven if Trump himself doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually believe anything he says.\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders may well represent the \xe2\x80\x9cextreme\xe2\x80\x9d left of the Democratic\nParty, but he has real ideas; arguments can be made against them, of\ncourse, but the point is that he offers something substantive against which\nto argue. Unlike Trump, he has an actual platform, spelling out what he\nwants to do and how he intends to do it. From infrastructural decay to\nclimate change to tax reform to higher education, Sanders is proposing\nsolutions. Conservatives may not like those solutions, but they at least\nhave to be reckoned with. This is a fundamental distinction between Trump\nand Sanders, one the GOP would prefer to ignore. Which leads me to the\nsecond reason why liberals should embrace Trump-Sanders comparisons.\n\n\n\nTo the extent that Trump and Sanders reflect the views of the right and\nleft wings of their parties, they vividly clarify just how different the\ntwo parties are. It says something significant about the Republican Party\nthat there\xe2\x80\x99s space for someone like Trump or Sarah Palin or even Herman\nCain in it. These people aren\xe2\x80\x99t credible candidates; they\xe2\x80\x99re\nproduct-pushing brands looking to capitalize on conservative credulity. I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe the same can be said of Democratic candidates, no matter how\nwrong-headed you find their policy ideas.\n\n\n\nRepublican operatives know all of this to be true, which is why they\xe2\x80\x99ll do\neverything they can to equate Sanders and Trump. But they\xe2\x80\x99ll spin a false\nnarrative. They\xe2\x80\x99ll argue, as John Gibson on FoxNews.com does, that\nDemocrats should be \xe2\x80\x9cembarrassed\xe2\x80\x9d by Sanders for the same reasons\nRepublicans should be embarrassed by Trump. Nobody, especially Democrats,\nshould fall for this.\n\n\n\nThere are crucial differences between Trump and Sanders, some of which are\ncited above. But the most important difference here is between the two\nparties. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s circus act isn\xe2\x80\x99t possible in the Democratic Party. There\nare no celebrity candidates on the left \xe2\x80\x93 and certainly none capable of\npolling at the level Trump does. Democrats have had their share of bad\ncandidates over the years, but they\xe2\x80\x99re bad for different (and less\noffensive) reasons than GOP candidates. They\xe2\x80\x99re bad for reasons related to\ntheir ideas or campaign platform or something politically relevant.\n\n\n\nOnly in the Republican Party do unserious candidates emerge as contenders.\nOnly in the Republican Party are half-baked celebrities allowed to hijack\nthe process to promote their private careers. Only among conservative\nRepublicans are hucksters like Trump embraced. Democrats can\xe2\x80\x99t point these\ntruths out enough.\n\n\n\nThe Republican Party created the Frankenstein that is Donald Trump. They\xe2\x80\x99ve\ncultivated the idiocy he represents in their ranks for years. If Trump\nappeals to their base \xe2\x80\x93 and he obviously does \xe2\x80\x93 that tells you everything\nyou need to know about who they are and what they stand for.\n\n\n\nIt also tells you how little respect the GOP has for the political process.\nThere ought to be no place for Trump at this level of politics \xe2\x80\x93 in either\nparty. But there is, and it\xe2\x80\x99s telling that it\xe2\x80\x99s permitted only in one party.\n\n\n\n*UNDECLARED*\n\n\n\n*OTHER*\n\n\n\n*How durable is the Democratic advantage among Latinos?\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/07/how-durable-is-the-democratic-advantage-among-latinos/>\n// WaPo // Greg Sargent \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nIs the overwhelming advantage that Democrats appear to be building among\nLatinos durable? Or could it prove far more ephemeral than it appears?\n\n\n\nPut another way, can Democrats count on the 2016 GOP presidential ticket\nre-running Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s historically bad performance among Latino voters?\nOr could a Jeb Bush (or, less likely in my view, Marco Rubio) general\nelection candidacy whittle away at the Dem edge among those voters and\nreverse gains that had seemed to be hardening? Folks with long memories\nwill recall that George W. Bush successfully pulled that reversal off in\n2000. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t that happen again?\n\n\n\nThis is one of the big questions of 2016, and its answer could be key to\nthe campaign\xe2\x80\x99s outcome. Right now, there are plenty of reasons for\nDemocrats to be optimistic about it. But it\xe2\x80\x99s worth entertaining the\nalternate scenario.\n\n\n\nThe case for Dem optimism has been fortified by Donald Trump, who in recent\ndays has been spraying inflammatory quotes about immigrants around like a\ngarden sprinkler. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that a number of GOP candidates have condemned\nhis remarks. But as Michael Gerson details, Republicans still appear locked\nin a debate over the fundamental underlying question of whether their route\nto the White House lies in pumping up the white vote in the Rust Belt (a\nstrategy perhaps foreshadowed by Scott Walker\xe2\x80\x99s move to the right on\nimmigration) or in broadening their appeal beyond their demographic comfort\nzone (a strategy that Jeb Bush has urged on the party).\n\n\n\nAn additional reason for Dem optimism: Some Republicans are reportedly\nskeptical that the party should bother focusing its energy on nominating a\ncandidate who might appeal to Latinos, on the grounds that those voters\nagree with Democrats on many issues, so being pro-immigration reform (as\nJeb is) won\xe2\x80\x99t be enough anyway.\n\n\n\nBut some Democrats think their party should devote more time to worrying\nabout the possibility that someone like Bush could win over enough Latino\nvoters to make a decisive difference.\n\n\n\nSimon Rosenberg, the president of the NDN think tank, floats the\npossibility of a GOP ticket that includes Bush and Nevada governor Brian\nSandoval as vice president. Sandoval won a third of the Latino vote in his\n2010 race, despite striking a hard-ish line on immigration, from which he\nhas since backed off. Sandoval is relatively young. A Bush-Sandoval ticket\nwould be led by a man with a Mexican wife and Latino-American children, and\nbacked up by a man of Mexican descent \xe2\x80\x94 representing a bet that the GOP can\ncontest Florida and western states with large Latino populations by\nimproving its cultural appeal among those voters. Remember, Republicans\nonly need to marginally reduce their historically large 2012 deficit among\nLatinos to improve their chances in such states.\n\n\n\nSo Rosenberg thinks Dems should invest more now in using the Trump\noutbursts to do more damage to the GOP brand among Latinos, as a kind of\ninsurance policy against outcomes such as a Bush-Sandoval ticket. Rosenberg\nemails me:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile the Democratic advantage today is significant, what we don\xe2\x80\x99t know is\nwhat happens with an historically Hispanic and Spanish friendly GOP ticket\nof, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, Bush and Sandoval. One Bush already used a smart Hispanic\nstrategy to get to the White House. Given that, Democrats should be\nanything but confident and complacent right now. They need to be doing\nmore, now, to make it harder for any GOP ticket to dig out of the hole\nTrump and others have dug for the GOP.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nTo be sure, there are big differences between the current moment and the\nrun-up to the 2000 election. Dems are far more united behind immigration\nreform today than in the late 1990s, reflecting a changing Democratic Party\nincreasingly reliant on Latinos. Buzzfeed reports that the Hillary Clinton\ncampaign is developing a very comprehensive and aggressive plan for\nnational Latino outreach. She has already pledged to go farther than Obama\ndid on his executive actions on deportations. And today she renewed her\nsupport for comprehensive reform and attacked the GOP as backward on the\nissue. All of these things are signs of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to the party\xe2\x80\x99s\nnew demographic realities.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, House Republicans have steadily moved rightward on immigration,\npassing on a historic chance to act on the Senate reform bill and voting\nrepeatedly to roll back Obama\xe2\x80\x99s deportation actions. That has many Dems\nconfident \xe2\x80\x94 to a point.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe damage may be too great to the GOP brand,\xe2\x80\x9d one senior aide to a\nprominent Latino House Democrat says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may take more than Bush-Sandoval\nto rehabilitate this huge mistake Republicans have been making. But we\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know that. Personality, charisma, language, and the individual\ncandidates mean a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSo, yes, perhaps Republicans have moved so far to the right on immigration\nthat the party can\xe2\x80\x99t conceivably re-run the 2000 Bush immigration strategy,\nor perhaps even reconstituting that strategy wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be enough to reverse\nGOP losses among Latinos at this point. But Democrats can\xe2\x80\x99t count on those\noutcomes.\n\n\n\n*Here\'s what Clinton, O\'Malley and Sanders told America\'s biggest teachers\nunion\n<http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/hillary-dems-court-americas-biggest-teachers-union/article/2567749>\n// The Washington Examiner // Jason Russell \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nDemocratic candidates for president didn\'t miss their chance to address\nover 7,000 members of the National Education Association, which will be a\npowerful player in the Democratic primary process. Hillary Clinton, Martin\nO\'Malley and Bernie Sanders all sent video messages to the teachers, who\nwere gathered at the NEA\'s Representative Assembly.\n\n\n\nIn her address, Clinton used a theme of teachers unlocking potential in\nstudents. She talked about how teachers had encouraged her and her mother\nat a young age. "Every semester, in schools across the country, you\nmultiply my mother\'s story by millions," Clinton told the teachers. "When\nwe invest in our children, we do invest in our country\'s future, and we\nneed to do more of that." Clinton promised high quality preschool, a\ndoubling of spending on the federal Head Start program, and making college\naffordable for every single person.\n\n\n\nSanders struck a more ideological tone. "We need some fundamental changes\nin our national priorities," Sanders said. "Instead of giving tax breaks to\nbillionaires, maybe we invest in our children, maybe we invest in\neducation." He promised to make progress on fixing No Child Left Behind, on\nuniversal pre-K and on free college tuition. He also called teachers the\nreal heroes and heroines of the country.\n\n\n\nO\'Malley tried to strike an optimistic note. "I believe, like you, that\nAmerica\'s best days can still be in front of us," O\'Malley said. He didn\'t\nmake any specific promises about what he would do as president, but\nO\'Malley touted the pro-union reforms he implemented in Maryland while\nserving as governor. For example, spending more on public education and\nmaking college more affordable. "This is what we do as Americans, to do\nmore in every generation, to give our children a future with more\nopportunity, rather than less."\n\n\n\nNEA President Lily Eskelsen Garcia was glad the three candidates took the\ntime to address the union\'s members. "Recommending a candidate for\npresident of the United States is a civic responsibility that educators\ntake very seriously," said Eskelsen Garcia. "Going through the process to\npick the right candidate that represents our values and sets the right\npriorities is critically important." Eskelsen Garcia has met privately with\nClinton, O\'Malley and Sanders as part of the NEA\'s endorsement process for\nthe 2016 presidential election.\n\n\n\nThe NEA is the nation\'s largest teachers union, with 3 million members.\n\n\n\n*GOP*\n\n\n\n*DECLARED*\n\n\n\n*BUSH*\n\n\n\n*Florida\xe2\x80\x99s Economic Leap Under Jeb Bush Helped By Housing Bubble,\nEconomists Say\n<http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/07/07/floridas-economic-leap-under-jeb-bush-helped-by-housing-bubble-economists-say/>\n// WSJ // Bob Davis \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush says he can deliver 4% annual economic growth\nas president \xe2\x80\x93 about twice as fast as the U.S. has been growing recently.\nWhy is he so confident? During his 1999-2007 tenure as governor, Florida\ngrew 4.4%, his campaign boasts.\n\n\n\nToday it even unveiled a cute graphic illustrating the claim.\n\n\n\nThe trouble is, say some economists, Gov. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Florida growth record was\nbased in large part on a housing bubble \xe2\x80\x93 national in scope but\nparticularly frothy in Florida \xe2\x80\x94 that exploded the year he left office in\n2007. Wells Fargo economist Mark Vitner, who has studied the Florida\neconomy since the 1980s, estimates that the housing bubble accounted for\nabout one-fourth of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s growth during Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s tenure.\n\n\n\nSubtract that out and you are left with 3.3% annual growth, somewhat faster\nthan the 3% at which the U.S. economy grew annually during that period. (To\nbe sure, the U.S. growth record overall back then was also affected by the\nhousing bubble, though not as severely as Florida was.)\n\n\n\nMr. Vitner said that Mr. Bush deserves credit as governor for trying to\ndiversify the state\xe2\x80\x99s economy, particularly by luring biotech companies to\nthe state. He also says the U.S. could grow faster and maybe even at the 4%\nlevel that Mr. Bush has set as his target. But his Florida growth record\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t proof of that.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour percent growth was helped along by the housing boom,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Bush said that  18%  of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s job growth during\nGov. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s two terms was in the housing or construction fields. \xe2\x80\x9cHis\noverall economic record is impressive,\xe2\x80\x9d spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said in\nan emailed response. That record  includes balancing the state\xe2\x80\x99s budget,\ncutting taxes and fast job growth, she said.\n\n\n\nMoody\xe2\x80\x99s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi, a housing expert, says\nFlorida\xe2\x80\x99s economy in the early 2000s isn\xe2\x80\x99t a model for U.S. growth over the\ncoming years.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe growth in Florida wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sustainable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was something\ntemporary\xe2\x80\x9d due to the housing bubble.\n\n\n\nMoreover, Florida isn\xe2\x80\x99t representative of the U.S., he said, because its\npopulation grows more rapidly than the U.S. as a whole, giving it an\nexpanding pool of workers. That in itself can add to growth.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlorida isn\xe2\x80\x99t a useful analogy because of its unique demographic\nsituation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important for leaders to be aggressive [on the\neconomy] and set a higher bar,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Zandi said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut 4% is a stretch.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn an article in the Wall Street Journal last month, Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s top\neconomic advisers, Columbia University Business School Dean Glenn Hubbard\nand former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, argued that 4% growth was\nattainable with the right set of policies.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSetting a goal of 4% growth  invites meaningful policy contributions from\nthose who would be our leaders,\xe2\x80\x9d they wrote.\n\n\n\n*Did Jeb Bush cut taxes each year as Florida governor?\n<http://www.baynews9.com/content/news/baynews9/news/article.html/content/news/articles/cfn/2015/6/25/politifact_did_jeb_b.html>\n// Politifact \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nOn the campaign trail, a recurring theme among Republican candidates is how\nthey have cut taxes and reduced the size of government. For former Florida\nGov. Jeb Bush, that message is a core part of his presentation.\n\n\n\nOn June 2 at Gov. Rick Scott\'s Economic Growth Summit in Orlando, Bush\nnoted how he cut taxes for Floridians. Bush said the following:\n\n\n\n"In Florida, for eight years we cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion."\n\n\n\nPolitiFact Florida looked into Bush\'s record to see if his claim was\naccurate and reporter Joshua Gillin says Bush gets a HALF TRUE rating.\nGillin says there are tax cuts that Bush can take credit for and others\nwhere he cannot.\n\n\n\n"We took the detailed analysis provided by his campaign and showed it to\nseveral economists," Gillin said. "They responded that the methodology that\nthey used to get to the $19 billion figure was pretty clear.  We do have to\npoint out that the $19 billion is in 2007, and it has been adjusted up to\ncover the time he was in office. The $19 billion includes tax cuts, but\nthat\'s not the only thing in there.  Adjustments to fees are in there, as\nwell, as well as appropriations and the way that things were appropriated."\n\n\n\nGillin said, though, that some things included in the analysis were items\nthat Bush had no control over.\n\n\n\n"There were two big items in Bush\'s list," Gillin said. "One was the\nintangibles tax. This is the amount that you pay on investments and stocks.\nThe other was the federal estate tax. This one is the amount that your\nestate pays in taxes to the government when you die.  In both of those\ncases, Bush didn\'t have any control over those, so our experts questioned\nwhether or not he could take credit for those."\n\n\n\nBecause Bush provided the detailed analysis to back up his claim, it gave\nPolitiFact a good overview of his claim.  However, the analysis showed that\nthere were things included that were outside of Bush\'s control while he was\nFlorida governor, earning this claim a HALF TRUE.\n\n\n\n*Jeb Bush\'s Aggressive July Fundraising Schedule\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-07/bush-s-aggressive-july-fundraising-schedule>\n// Bloomberg // Michael Bender \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, who says he\'s never taken more\nthan a week of vacation at a time, is going to be hitting a couple of\nresorts next week. But it\'s not about fun. It\'s about funds.\n\n\n\nThe two-day event for top donors at the Bush family compound in\nKennebunkport, Maine, on Thursday and Friday, followed by a luncheon on\nSaturday at Martha\'s Vineyard, are part of the aggressive fundraising\neffort that\'s been a hallmark of the former Florida governor\'s campaign so\nfar. He held 14 fundraisers in the first 18 days after kicking off his\ncampaign. Another dozen are on tap for the rest of July, according to a\nschedule obtained by Bloomberg.\n\n\n\nNext week, Bush heads west next week for four fundraisers in California:\n\n\n\nJuly 14:  Los Angeles.\n\nJuly 15: breakfast Pasadena, followed by lunch in Santa Barbara.\n\nJuly 16: event in Silicon Valley.\n\n\n\nBush then returns to the East Coast to raise money in the backyard of rival\nRepublican presidential candidate Chris Christie, New Jersey\'s governor.\nBush will headline two fundraisers on July 23 in New Jersey (Middleton and\nShort Hills) and an evening event on July 25 in East Hampton, New York.\n\n\n\nThe final two finance events right now on Bush\'s July schedule: a July 26\nreception in Philadelphia and a July 31 fundraiser in Fort Lauderdale,\nFlorida.\n\n\n\nThe fundraising push for his presidential campaign comes after Bush spent\nthe first six months tapping the family\'s donor network and his own in\nFlorida to raise money for the Right to Rise super PAC. Bush\'s team was\naiming to raise $100 million in the first three months of the year. Bush\nhas sought to spread some cash around to fellow Republicans, and told\ndonors that he\'d raised record-breaking amounts of early money. Top Bush\nally Mike Murphy told super PAC donors that fundraising totals were going\nto give opponents "heart attacks," according to a BuzzFeed report.\n\n\n\nThe group\'s fundraising total will be public for the first time on July 30.\n\n\n\n*Jeb Bush: No Leniency for Edward Snowden\n<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeb-bush-no-leniency-for-edward-snowden/> //\nCBS News // Rebecca Kaplan \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nIf Jeb Bush becomes president, his administration will not be making any\ndeals that allows Edward Snowden to avoid punishment for leaking classified\ninformation from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013.\n\n\n\nSnowden broke the law, recklessly endangered nat\'l security, & fled to\nChina/Russia.

As to whether that meant it was possible Snowden might\nreturn to the U.S. from Russia, where he was granted asylum after fleeing\nthe U.S., Holder said, "I certainly think there could be a basis for a\nresolution that everybody could ultimately be satisfied with.

Jeb Bush won two gubernatorial terms, in 1998 and 2002,\nserving eight years as Florida\'s chief executive.\n\n\n\nBush hired campaign staff in Iowa earlier this year but did not officially\nbecome a candidate until June 15.

Those\nleaks, however, made Snowden a hero to many because they revealed the vast\nsurveillance program involving the collection of bulk phone data, which\nCongress scaled back just weeks ago.\n\n\n\nFormer Attorney General Eric Holder said on Monday that the U.S. may have\nbenefitted from Snowden stealing approximately 1.7 million documents from\nthe National Security Agency Net and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence\nCommunication System.\n\n\n\n"We are in a different place as a result of the Snowden disclosures,"\nHolder said. "His actions spurred a necessary debate. I certainly think\nthere could be a basis for a resolution that everybody could ultimately be\nsatisfied with \xe2\x80\x94 I think the possibility exists."\n\n\n\nHowever, some, such as former NSA and CIA director Michael Hayden, oppose\nthe idea of a plea deal.\n\n\n\nSnowden\'s act "was the greatest hemorrhaging of legitimate American secrets\nin the history of the republic, no question about it," Hayden said,\naccording to the Free Beacon. "I\'m quite stunned that we would be\nconsidering any return of Snowden to this country other than to meet a jury\nof his peers, period."\n\n\n\nSnowden\'s attorney, Ben Wizner, said Holder\'s comments were the closest\nthings to acknowledging that Snowden\'s actions may have had a positive\nimpact on the U.S., Yahoo Politics reported.\n\n\n\n"The former attorney general\'s recognition that Snowden\'s actions led to\nmeaningful changes is welcome," said Wizner. "This is significant ...

But when it came to education policy, some of\npresidential candidate\xe2\x80\x99s proposals had a familiar ring to them.\n\n\n\nMr. Rubio, the Republican from Florida, called for overhauling the college\naccreditation system, creating a pay scale for student loan repayment and\nexpanding investment in vocational training.\n\n\n\nMany of the details from those ideas sounded strikingly similar to policies\nthat President Obama has called for during his time in office.\n\n\n\nMr. Rubio called for creating \xe2\x80\x9ca new accreditation process that welcomes\nlow-cost, innovative providers\xe2\x80\x9d that would allow new competitors into the\neducation marketplace. In 2013, Mr. Obama proposed establishing \xe2\x80\x9ca new,\nalternative system of accreditation that would provide pathways for higher\neducation models and colleges to receive federal student aid based on\nperformance and results.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Rubio proposed a progressive scale for student loan\nrepayments to ease burdens on people who take lower wage jobs when they\ngraduate. \xe2\x80\x9cThe more they make, the faster they pay back their loans; and\nthe less they make, the less strain their loans cause,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nLast summer, Mr. Obama made a similar appeal, devising a \xe2\x80\x9cpay as you earn\xe2\x80\x9d\nplan that give Americans who were repaying loans the chance to cap those\npayments at 10 percent of their incomes.\n\n\n\nThe senator also said that if he is elected president he would expand\napprenticeship programs and make vocational training more easily\naccessible. While the idea came without specifics of how this would be\nachieved, it did echo a proposal that Mr. Obama put forward at the end of\nhis first term that to ramp up spending on vocational training at the high\nschool and college level.\n\n\n\nWhile Mr. Rubio has worked with Democrats on education legislation in the\npast, not all of his ideas are popular with the opposing party. Critics\nargue that his plan to create \xe2\x80\x9cstudent investment plans\xe2\x80\x9d could make college\nmore expensive for some people, and the suggestion that he might eliminate\nthe Department of Education is likely a non-starter with liberals.\n\n\n\nHolly Shulman, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, also\nnoted that Mr. Rubio blocked a bill that would allow students to refinance\ntheir student loans, and opposed the president\xe2\x80\x99s plan to make community\ncollege debt-free to anyone who works.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarco Rubio has yet to articulate any new ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Shulman said.\n\n\n\n*Marco Rubio Attacks Higher Education \xe2\x80\x98Cartel\xe2\x80\x99 and Jabs Rivals\n<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/07/07/marco-rubio-attacks-higher-education-cartel-and-jabs-rivals/>\n// NYT // Jeremy Peters \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, laying out an economic blueprint that will be central\nto his campaign for president, called Tuesday for dismantling the \xe2\x80\x9ccartel\nof existing colleges and universities\xe2\x80\x9d that he said left too many students\nwithout viable career paths and burdened by tens of thousands of dollars in\ndebt.\n\n\n\nIn a speech that was part history lesson, part policy prescription, and\npunctuated with barbs at Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Rubio spoke to a crowd\nof several dozen people at a technology center and put forward his vision\nfor the American economy if it is to thrive into the next century. He also\ntook veiled swipes at the Bush family.\n\n\n\nMr. Rubio, a Florida Republican, dismissed the idea of a minimum-wage\nincrease as \xe2\x80\x9cthinking small.\xe2\x80\x9d He said that big government had rigged taxes\nand regulations in favor of powerful interests. And he proposed an overhaul\nof higher education that would change the way colleges are accredited and\nstudent loans are repaid.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not need timid tweaks to the old system; we need a holistic\noverhaul,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Rubio said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to change how we provide degrees, how\nthose degrees are accessed, how much that access costs, how those costs are\npaid and even how those payments are determined.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAs part of his higher education plan, Mr. Rubio has proposed two\ninnovations that are aimed at making student loans more affordable. First,\nhe said, he would put in effect an income-based payment system to allow\ngraduates earning lower salaries to repay creditors on a timetable that he\nsaid would cause \xe2\x80\x9cless strain.\xe2\x80\x9d Those who earn more would have to repay\ntheir loans at a faster rate.\n\n\n\nA form of income-based repayment plans for student loans already exists.\n\n\n\nMr. Rubio would also allow students to partner with investors who would\ncover the students\xe2\x80\x99 tuition in exchange for a percentage of their earnings\nfor a few years after graduation.\n\n\n\nThe speech mostly contained ideas that he had put forward before. But it\nwas a return to the campaign trail after almost two full months in which he\nwas on a coast-to-coast fund-raising tour.\n\n\n\nHe used his time in Chicago to take swipes at his opponents, some overt and\nothers more subtle. He referred three times to Mrs. Clinton, who is running\nher second campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. \xe2\x80\x9cThe race\nfor the future will never be won by going backward,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will\nnever be won by hopping in Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s time machine to yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOther slights appeared aimed just as much at some of Mr. Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s Republican\nopponents, like former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. Mr. Rubio said the ideas\noffered by Mrs. Clinton \xe2\x80\x9cand other outdated leaders are narrow and\nshortsighted.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have learned, painfully, that the old ways no longer work,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat Washington cannot pretend the world is the same as it was in the\n\xe2\x80\x9980s, it cannot raise taxes like it did in the \xe2\x80\x9990s, and it cannot grow\ngovernment like it did in the 2000s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThose last two references \xe2\x80\x94 to raising taxes in the 1990s and expanding\ngovernment in the 2000s \xe2\x80\x94 were not coincidental. Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s father,\nPresident George Bush, famously approved a tax increase in 1990 after\npromising to block any. And his older brother, President George W. Bush,\noversaw a significant expansion of the federal government after the Sept.\n11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\n\n\n*Five takeaways from Marco Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s speech on the innovation economy\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/07/07/five-takeaways-from-marco-rubios-speech-on-the-innovation-economy/>\n// WaPo // Steven Overly \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio is pushing a series of changes to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s tax, immigration\nand education systems that the Republican presidential candidate contends\nwill better prepare Americans for an economy driven by rapid technological\ninnovation.\n\n\n\nThe ideas outlined by the Florida senator in a speech on Tuesday, which was\ndelivered at a co-working space for tech start-ups in Chicago, come as\nother presidential candidates are also trying to court the tech community\xe2\x80\x99s\nvote. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton have all met\nwith technology executives and enthusiasts in Silicon Valley in recent\nmonths, hoping to mine the wealthy sector for potential donors and voices\nof support.\n\n\n\nWith that audience in mind, Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s speech focused largely on policy issues\nthat are front of mind in tech circles, such as finding ways to get more\nhighly skilled immigrants into the country and overhauling the tax code.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x99s Technological Revolution carries extraordinary opportunities \xe2\x80\x93\neven more, I believe, than the Industrial Revolution ever did. But we have\nnot yet seized these opportunities, nor is it guaranteed that we will,\xe2\x80\x9d\nRubio said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhether we do or do not will depend on the actions we take,\nthe leaders we choose, and the reforms we adopt.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhat follows are five takeaways from the policy pitch Rubio delivered on\nTuesday.\n\n\n\nImmigration\n\n\n\nRubio did not outline a comprehensive plan to address existing undocumented\nimmigrants, but said the system should prioritize those immigrants who\npossess the skills and education that many American employers desire.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis requires reforming our legal immigration system to make it skill- and\nmerit-based rather than family-based, which will protect American workers\nand attract more talent to grow our economy and create jobs,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio said.\n\n\n\nThat position should be well received among technology companies, which\nhave long pushed for visas to be made more readily available to immigrants\nwith science, technology, engineering and math degrees. Companies contend\nthere aren\xe2\x80\x99t enough American workers who possess those skills, and existing\nlaws make it expensive and difficult to recruit talent from overseas.\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nRubio also set his political sights on the U.S. higher education system,\nwhich he said is \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled by what amounts to a cartel of existing\ncolleges and universities, which use their power over the accreditation\nprocess to block innovative, low-cost competitors from entering the market.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe vowed to establish a new accreditation process within his first 100 days\nin office that would be more welcoming to new players. Rubio also\nreiterated support for the \xe2\x80\x9cStudent Right to Know Before You Go Act,\xe2\x80\x9d which\nwould inform students how much money they can expect to earn from a given\ndegree prior taking out student loans.\n\n\n\nStudent Loans\n\n\n\nThe cloud of debt that follows many students after college prevents many\nfrom pursuing a higher education, Rubio told the audience. That\xe2\x80\x99s\nespecially true for low-income individuals and single parents, who most\nstand to benefit from a degree.\n\n\n\nRubio said he plans to implement income-based repayment of student loans,\nmeaning those who earn more money are expected to repay their loans faster.\nHe also called for the creation of Student Investment Plans that would\nallow wealthy individuals to invest in a young person\xe2\x80\x99s education in\nexchange for a cut of their future salary.\n\n\n\nFinally, he called for an expansion of vocational training and\napprenticeship programs so that students who don\xe2\x80\x99t pursue a college\neducation at least graduate from high school with certifications for\ntechnical jobs, such as as mechanics, electricians or welders.\n\n\n\nTaxes\n\n\n\nRubio criticized the country\xe2\x80\x99s current tax system for being unfavorable to\nlarge corporations and small businesses alike, a factor that he said\ncontributes to companies shifting their employees and headquarters overseas.\n\n\n\nHe pledged, if elected president, to make the corporate tax rate\n\xe2\x80\x9ccompetitive\xe2\x80\x9d with the 25 percent average found in other developed\ncountries. He also proposed eliminating tax rules that allow the United\nStates to levy taxes on money that companies earned overseas.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a tax code that punishes American companies for competing in the\nglobal economy, and a regulatory system that prevents small businesses \xe2\x80\x93\nthe primary engines of innovation and job creation \xe2\x80\x93 from competing against\nestablished players,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\n\n\n\nRubio\xe2\x80\x99s speech wasn\xe2\x80\x99t devoid of politics. Amid the policy proposals were\nseveral jabs at Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, whom Rubio\nrepeatedly referred to as a sort of political relic who is too entrenched\nin the old ways of  Washington.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe race for the future will never be won by going backward. It will never\nbe won by hopping in Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s time machine to yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cShe seems to believe pumping more of today\xe2\x80\x99s money into yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s\nprograms will bring prosperity tomorrow. It will not.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n*Marco Rubio Outlines Economic Initiatives\n<http://www.wsj.com/articles/marco-rubio-outlines-economic-initiatives-1436289833>\n// WSJ // Patrick O\xe2\x80\x99Connor \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nFlorida Sen.

Mr. Rubio is using his\nbackground as the son of a bartender and hotel maid to align himself with\npeople who haven\xe2\x80\x99t enjoyed the benefits of the economic recovery.\n\n\n\nSome candidates and their advisers believe the eventual nominee will be the\ncandidate who offers the best recipe to address these concerns.\n\n\n\nCapital Journal is WSJ.com\xe2\x80\x99s home for politics, policy and national\nsecurity news.\n\n\n\nMost of the remedies Mr. Rubio proposed are staples of his economic-policy\nplatform, including plans to reduce corporate tax rates to 25%, curb\nfederal regulations by putting a cap on how much they cost, and allow\ncompanies to bring overseas revenue back to the U.S. without an additional\ntax hit. He also would cut taxes on business investments and give the\npublic more access to the digital spectrum controlled by the federal\ngovernment.\n\n\n\nMr. Rubio, who authored a tax plan with Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), would\nleave the top individual tax rate at 35%, unlike some of his GOP rivals.\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\xe2\x80\x99s top tax rate would be 28%. Kentucky Sen.\nRand Paul has called for scrapping the current tax code and replacing it\nwith a 14.5% flat tax on all income, regardless of how much money a person\nmakes.\n\n\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz, meanwhile, has pledged to abolish the Internal Revenue\nService entirely.\n\n\n\nMany candidates haven\'t yet offered detailed plans, including former\nFlorida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the\nclear favorite for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\n\nA number of prominent conservatives have criticized Mr. Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s tax\nproposals, saying they would add to the deficit unless they were paired\nwith other policy changes to cut federal spending. Others disagree with his\ncalls to expand the child-tax credit, expressing doubt about whether his\n$2,500 credit would spur economic growth.\n\n\n\nOne cornerstone of the speech\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s campaign\xe2\x80\x94was his vow to\nrevamp the higher-education system by expanding access to trade schools and\nfor-profit colleges and making it easier for students to secure federally\nprotected loans.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, he promised to \xe2\x80\x9cbust\xe2\x80\x9d the higher-education \xe2\x80\x9ccartel\xe2\x80\x9d dominated\nby \xe2\x80\x9cexisting colleges and universities.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Florida senator also wants to let companies pay for employees\xe2\x80\x99\neducation, invest more in vocational training starting in high school, and\nrequire schools to tell prospective students how much they can expect to\nearn after graduation, depending on the degrees they pursue.\n\n\n\nMr. Rubio took shots at Mrs. Clinton and made veiled swipes at Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s\nfather and brother. The government shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t raise taxes as it did under\nPresidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, he said, or \xe2\x80\x9cgrow government\xe2\x80\x9d\nlike it did under Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s brother, President George W.

Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican presidential\ncandidate, called for lower corporate tax rates, looser Internet regulation\nand broader college accreditation in an economic policy speech Tuesday.\n\n\n\nRubio jabbed at fellow Republicans, primarily for letting government grow\nso much in the 2000s, and Democrats, for policies that he said stifle job\ngrowth and "snuff out innovation" -- namely, their push for a higher\nminimum wage and for tax increases on the wealthy.\n\n\n\n"We need in this country a new president for a new age," the Florida\nsenator said from the downtown Chicago offices of a digital startup. The\nnation would be better served, Rubio said, by embracing the "technological\nrevolution."\n\n\n\nThe forward-looking theme of Rubio\'s address mirrors his campaign, which\naims to distinguish him from leading competitors in both parties --\nincluding Republican Jeb Bush and Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose\nfamilies have been mainstays in American politics for decades.\n\n\n\nHe repeatedly criticized Clinton, the former secretary of state who is\nseeking the Democratic nomination.\n\n\n\n"The race for the future will never be won by going backward," Rubio said.\n"It will never be won by hopping in Hillary Clinton\'s time machine to\nyesterday."\n\n\n\nAnd while not naming Bush, a former Florida governor, Rubio lashed out at\nthe policies enacted when Bush\'s father and brother served in the White\nHouse.\n\n\n\n"We have learned, painfully, that the old ways no longer work -- that\nWashington cannot pretend the world is the same as it was in the 1980s, it\ncannot raise taxes like it did in the \'90s, and it cannot grow government\nlike it did in the 2000s," he said.\n\n\n\nWhile his campaign billed the Chicago speech as a major address, most of\nthe "innovation agenda" he outlined represents policies he has proposed\npreviously.\n\n\n\nRubio called for changes to the tax code that would lower the corporate tax\nrate, establish a "territorial tax system" and allow "immediate, 100\npercent expensing," which would permit businesses to take deductions on\ncapital investments all at once.\n\n\n\nHe previously released a detailed tax plan that would reduce all corporate\ntaxes to 25 percent and cut taxes on business investment.\n\n\n\nRubio also promoted a plan to modernize the national laboratory system in\nline with a proposal he introduced with Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., earlier\nin the year. And he reiterated his opposition to so-called Net neutrality,\nwhich aims to prevent Internet service providers from setting different\ndownload speeds for different types of content.\n\n\n\nAnd as he often does, Rubio said an immigration overhaul is necessary "to\nprotect American workers and attract more talent to grow our economy and\ncreate jobs."\n\n\n\nOn higher education, Rubio vowed to "bust the cartel" of existing colleges\nand universities by creating a new accreditation process. His campaign said\nRubio would allow lower-cost alternative education providers, such as\nonline academies, to earn accreditation.\n\n\n\nDemocratic National Committee spokesman Holly Shulman said Rubio "continues\nto peddle the same failed Republican policies that cripple the economy and\nsqueeze the middle class."\n\n\n\nRubio, 44, is among more than a dozen candidates seeking the 2016\nRepublican presidential nomination. He is also one of the youngest\ncandidates in the race.\n\n\n\nHe appeared in Chicago hours before he was to begin his first extended\ncampaign swing through an early voting state. He was scheduled to campaign\nin Iowa, the first-in-the-nation caucus state, through Thursday.\n\n\n\n*Marco Rubio Economy: \xe2\x80\x98The old ways no longer work\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://bigstory.ap.org/article/129f5e07bbef4b1db8d0bbc3bf895837/rubio-economy-old-ways-no-longer-work>\n// AP // Steve Peoples \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nWith an eye on the future, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is laying out his plans\nfor an "innovative economy" and "revolutionized higher education system" in\nhis first major domestic policy speech as a presidential candidate.\n\n\n\nThe Republican White House hopeful will outline his policies at a Tuesday\nmorning speech in Chicago before an extended campaign swing through Iowa.\n\n\n\n"We need a new president for a new age \xe2\x80\x94 one with original ideas to unlock\nthe two great doors to the future: the doors of innovation and education,"\nRubio says in prepared remarks. "I come before you today to discuss my\nideas to spur American innovation onward, to ensure the rise of the\nmachines will not be the fall of the worker, and to create a new American\nCentury."\n\n\n\nThe forward-looking theme of Rubio\'s address mirrors that of his entire\ncampaign, which helps distinguish himself from leading competitors in both\nparties whose families have been mainstays in American politics for\ndecades. The 44-year-old Rubio does not name Republican former Florida Gov.\nJeb Bush or Democrat Hillary Clinton in excerpts of his remarks released to\nThe Associated Press, yet he cites the years that the Bushes and Clintons\ngoverned.\n\n\n\n"We have learned, painfully, that the old ways no longer work \xe2\x80\x94 that\nWashington cannot pretend the world is the same as it was in the \'80s, it\ncannot raise taxes like it did in the \'90s, and it cannot grow government\nlike it did in the 2000s," Rubio says.\n\n\n\nWhile he has yet to release specifics, an aide said Rubio would detail an\n"innovation agenda" focused on tax reform that includes a lower corporate\ntax rate, the establishment of a "territorial tax system" and allowing\n"immediate 100 percent expensing for businesses," which allows businesses\nto take deductions for capital investments all at once.\n\n\n\nHe will also promote a plan to modernize the national lab system.\n\n\n\nThe aide spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to publicly pre-empt\nRubio\'s address.\n\n\n\nRubio will also address his opposition to so-called "net neutrality," which\nwould prevent Internet service providers from setting different download\nspeeds for different types of content.\n\n\n\nOn higher education, the aide said Rubio would call for an overhaul of the\naccreditation process, among other reforms.\n\n\n\n"Today\'s Technological Revolution carries extraordinary opportunities -\neven more, I believe, than the Industrial Revolution ever did," Rubio says.\n"The race for the future will never be won by going backward."\n\n\n\n*Marco Rubio slams Hillary Clinton, higher ed \xe2\x80\x98cartel\xe2\x80\x99 in policy speech\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/marco-rubio-economic-plan-policy-speech-119808.html#ixzz3fGrmtKys>\n// Politico // Eli Stokols \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nPicking up on the generational themes of his announcement speech three\nmonths ago, Marco Rubio laid out an economic plan Tuesday that sought to\ndistinguish himself as \xe2\x80\x9ca new president for a new age.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPromising to usher in a \xe2\x80\x9cnew American century\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 his campaign\xe2\x80\x99s\nforward-looking slogan \xe2\x80\x94 Rubio painted a picture of himself as a candidate\nin step with a new era and a fast-changing economy, promising to reform the\nTax Code and modernize higher education to better align with how the\n21st-century economy now works.\n\n\n\nThe much-publicized policy speech, before an audience of more than 200\nlocal entrepreneurs, included direct attacks on Hillary Clinton as an\n\xe2\x80\x9coutdated\xe2\x80\x9d representative and implicitly dismissed one of his main GOP\nrivals, Jeb Bush, as a candidate of the past.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNew opportunities cannot be seized by old ideas, and the future must be\nembraced with enthusiasm and vision,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio said.\n\n\n\nBy framing himself as the more youthful, future-oriented candidate against\nthe 60-somethings, the first-term Florida senator sought to define Clinton\nand Bush as his main rivals while laying out his case against them \xe2\x80\x94 that,\nat 44 years old, he\xe2\x80\x99s the one armed with new ideas and a deeper\nunderstanding of the challenges of modern college students and young\nentrepreneurs.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the first 15 \xc2\xbd years of this century, Washington has looked to the\npast,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio said. \xe2\x80\x9cOur economy has changed, but our economic policies have\nnot. And we have learned, painfully, that the old ways no longer work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBalancing a gloomy characterization of an uncertain future with his own\noptimistic promise to help lay \xe2\x80\x9cthe cornerstone for a new American\ncentury,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio packaged a modest mix of policy proposals in lofty,\nsometimes forceful rhetoric.\n\n\n\nBut the ideas outlined in the speech weren\xe2\x80\x99t new for Rubio, who has already\nlaid out some of the proposals outlined Tuesday, including a proposal to\ndramatically lower the U.S. tax on companies\xe2\x80\x99 foreign earnings.\n\n\n\nRubio used the speech as an opportunity to criticize Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s economic\npolicies, offering to bust regulations that \xe2\x80\x9care the result of an alliance\nbetween Big Business and Big Government\xe2\x80\x9d in order to jump-start the economy.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton argues the economy is rigged in favor of wealthy interests\n\xe2\x80\x94 but what she won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you is that Big Government is doing the rigging,\xe2\x80\x9d\nRubio said. \xe2\x80\x9cA massive regulatory apparatus inevitably becomes the\ninstrument of those with the lawyers and lobbyists necessary to influence\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAt almost every point in his speech, Rubio sought to contrast his vision\nagainst Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe race for the future will never be won by going backward,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\nwill never be won by hopping in Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s time machine to\nyesterday. She seems to believe pumping more of today\xe2\x80\x99s money into\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s programs will bring prosperity tomorrow. It will not. Nor will\nthinking small. Hiking the minimum wage by a few dollars will not save the\nAmerican Dream; it will accelerate automation and outsourcing. Increasing\ntaxes and regulations will not promote fairness or opportunity; it will\nsnuff out innovation and crush small business.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhen he turned to higher education, Rubio again slammed Clinton and her\nideas as \xe2\x80\x9coutdated\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cshortsighted,\xe2\x80\x9d and he called for breaking up the\nhigher ed \xe2\x80\x9ccartel\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 he promised a \xe2\x80\x9cholistic overhaul\xe2\x80\x9d of how colleges and\nuniversities control tuition and financial aid, offer instruction and\nprovide degrees.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur higher education system is controlled by what amounts to a cartel of\nexisting colleges and universities, which use their power over the\naccreditation process to block innovative, low-cost competitors from\nentering the market,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithin my first 100 days, I will bust this cartel by establishing a new\naccreditation process that welcomes low-cost, innovative providers. This\nwould expose higher education to the market forces of choice and\ncompetition, which would prompt a revolution driven by the needs of\nstudents \xe2\x80\x94 just as the needs of consumers drive the progress of every other\nindustry in our economy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRubio, however, has come under fire for supporting a segment of the higher\neducation system that some see as predatory \xe2\x80\x94 for-profit colleges. Last\nyear, Rubio asked the Department of Education to show leniency to\nCorinthian Colleges, a for-profit college company that was forced to close\ndown its campuses after the Obama administration accused it of lying about\njob placement rates.\n\n\n\nIn a question and answer session following the speech, which took place at\n1871, a digital startup incubator inside the city\xe2\x80\x99s old Merchandise Mart,\nRubio explained that the old measures of economic stability such as the\nunemployment rate are no longer as indicative of the true state of the\nworkforce because so many people are underemployed and others who have jobs\ncontinue to struggle with the skyrocketing cost of child care.\n\n\n\nHe also lamented that so many young people have graduated from college with\nstudent loan debt only to find that their degrees are misaligned with the\nkinds of jobs a rapidly changing economy is creating.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the things we once told people they needed to do to succeed no longer\nwork,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one has explained why the old ways no longer work\nand what the new ways should be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Marco Rubio is about to give a major economic speech that he hopes will\nkick-start his campaign\n<http://www.businessinsider.com/r-republican-white-house-contender-rubio-to-deliver-economic-speech-2015-7#ixzz3fGu6OY65>\n// Reuters // James Oliphant \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nPresidential candidate Marco Rubio will deliver an economic speech in\nChicago on Tuesday with the goal of separating himself from the packed\nfield of Republican candidates and kick-starting his campaign into a more\nactive, visible phase.\n\n\n\nRubio, a senator from Florida, has spent much of the last several weeks\neither bogged down in a U.S. Senate preoccupied with a Pacific Rim trade\ndeal or out of the public eye raising money.\n\n\n\nBut after his Chicago speech, Rubio will visit Iowa and then Nevada, both\nof which hold key nominating contests early next year. His campaign says to\nexpect further travel, likely to New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nWith his Cuban-American background, youth and compelling biography, Rubio,\n44, has long been viewed by campaign analysts as one candidate in the\never-growing field of 14 who could break out from the pack.\n\n\n\nAs yet, however, there is little sign of that. State polls in early primary\nstates, save for his home state of Florida, have typically shown Rubio\nstruggling to crack double-digits. A Reuters Ipsos poll showed Rubio\ndrawing support from 9.6 percent of likely Republican primary voters\nnationally - behind former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the nominal\nfront-runner, and reality show star Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nRubio is expected to use his speech in Chicago to defend his tax-reform\nplan, which has been criticized in conservative circles, and touch upon\nthemes that some economists say sound unusual coming from a Republican\npresidential hopeful.\n\n\n\nRubio has used previous campaign events to discuss the plight of working\nmothers, middle-class families and college students, wading into topics\nthat Democrats often emphasize. He has questioned whether a traditional\ncollege education provides a good bargain for some students who he says\nwould benefit more from skills-based training.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly through an innovative economy can we translate new technologies into\nnew middle-class jobs,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio will say Tuesday, according to excerpts of\nhis speech released ahead of time, \xe2\x80\x9cand only through a revolutionized\nhigher education system can we equip all our people to fill those jobs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nJames Pethokoukis, a scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise\nInstitute, said Rubio deserved credit for trying to develop an agenda that\ngoes beyond criticizing President Barack Obama and the leading Democratic\ncontender, Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nBut Pethokoukis, like several conservatives, was critical of Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s tax\nplan, which would simplify the federal tax code and offer new tax credits\nto families with children. Unlike some plans floated by Rubio\'s rivals, his\nplan would not significantly lower the top-tier income tax rates, though it\nwould cut the corporate tax rate.\n\n\n\n*Rubio: College \'cartels\' need busting in new economy\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/07/politics/rubio-higher-education-overhaul/>\n// CNN // Tom LoBianco \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nSen. Marco Rubio says that Americans need to train for a new economy with\nnew skills and that one of the first steps on that path requires busting\nthe university "cartel" that trains students for outdated jobs.\n\n\n\n"Our higher education system is controlled by what amounts to a cartel of\nexisting colleges and universities, which use their power over the\naccreditation process to block innovative, low-cost competitors from\nentering the market," Rubio said. He made his conservative populist pitch\nto technology leaders in Chicago on Tuesday morning, shortly before he\nheads off to Iowa for a three-day campaign swing.\n\n\n\nThe Florida Republican has crafted an image as a younger alternative to\nHillary Clinton -- which he continued Tuesday with jabs at "Clinton\'s time\nmachine to yesterday" -- but also implicitly contrasts himself with another\nfrontrunner, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\n\n\nRubio promised that he would change student-lending rules to allow private\ninvestors to pay for individual students to attend college and overhaul how\ncolleges are accredited.\n\n\n\nThe concept of having individual donors fund students is being pushed by\nformer Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. Daniels was appointed Purdue University\npresident in 2012 by his appointees to the college\'s board of trustees,\nfollowing an eight-year run in office.\n\n\n\nSince then he has lobbied for sweeping conservative changes in higher\neducation.\n\n\n\nDaniels told Congress in March that students would have to repay the\nprivate loan through a portion of their income, but said that federal\nlegislation would be needed.\n\n\n\nRubio co-sponsored the measure earlier this year which would establish the\nframework for the private donor concept and referenced it again Tuesday\nduring his 20-minute speech.\n\n\n\nCandidates from both parties have been highlighting student debt (and\ncollege costs) as a major problem, but have very different ideas for\ntackling the problem.\n\n\n\nRubio has had his own struggles with student debt, detailed at length in a\nNew York Times investigation of his finances. Rubio started his political\ncareer, after graduating law school, with $150,000 in student loan debt,\nthough he\'s since wiped that out.\n\n\n\n*Marco Rubio\'s \'New\' Plan For Creating Jobs Is Actually Old And Borrowed\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/07/marco-rubio-jobs_n_7744742.html>\n// HuffPo // Igor Bobic \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015*\n\n\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is casting himself as the youthful,\nforward-thinking presidential candidate of the future, a bold reformer\nawash with new ideas on how best to usher in a new American century.\n\n\n\nThe message is an overt criticism of Democratic presidential candidate\nHillary Clinton, who Rubio says offers nothing more than a "time machine to\nyesterday" with a vision he calls "narrow and shortsighted."\n\n\n\nYet many of the Florida Republican\'s own proposals, outlined in a speech he\ndelivered in Chicago on Tuesday, include ideas that Rubio and others have\nput forth before. That\'s not to say that the senator isn\'t bringing\nanything new to the table, but he is also touting his old proposals to draw\na contrast with Clinton and, more implicitly, Republican rival Jeb Bush,\nanother member of a political dynasty.\n\n\n\nRight off the bat, Rubio proposed to "cut our corporate tax rate to be\ncompetitive with the average of 25 percent for developed nations." He\npromised to "establish a territorial tax system," and to "allow immediate,\n100 percent expensing for businesses." And he said he would "put a ceiling\non the amount U.S. regulations" cost the economy through regulatory reform.\n\n\n\nThe proposals are standard fare among lawmakers who have been calling for\ntax reform for years. In 2012, GOP presidential candidates Newt Gingrich\nand Rick Santorum both supported the expensing of business capital.\nHowever, Rubio\'s tax plan, which he introduced with Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah)\nearlier this year, ran into opposition from an unexpected quarter -- other\nRepublicans. As New York Magazine\'s Jonathan Chait wrote in April, the tax\ncut Rubio proposed is "so gargantuan that nobody in the party actually\nbelieves it."\n\n\n\nThe senator also promised to reallocate more of the government\'s wireless\nspectrum for commercial use by forcing federal agencies to sell their\nfrequencies to the highest bidder. He introduced a bill to do this in the\nSenate last year, attracting some bipartisan support. Congress has debated\nhow to make more of the spectrum more widely available through incentives,\nbut Rubio does appear to be one of the only lawmakers who supports doing so\nforcibly.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rubio said he would reform the nation\'s legal immigration system\n"to make it skill- and merit-based rather than family-based." Immigration\nactivists worry such a focus would break up immigrant families. But the\nidea has roots in the sweeping, bipartisan immigration reform bill passed\nby the Senate that Rubio helped draft in 2013 -- and later renounced after\ntaking heat from conservatives who opposed the bill\'s proposed path to\ncitizenship for undocumented immigrants. The legislation would have created\na merit-based visa program that would score each applicant on criteria such\nas employment status, geographic location and family considerations. It\nwould have also increased the number of merit-based visas and green cards\nissued to keep the highest-skilled workers in the U.S.\n\n\n\nThe second half of Rubio\'s speech on job creation centered on ways to\nreform the country\'s education system. But most of the proposals rehashed\nhis 2014 plan for higher education. The senator promised to bust the higher\neducation "cartel" within his first 100 days in office by introducing\n"choice and competition" into the accreditation process. Rep. Paul Ryan\n(R-Wis.), a former Republican vice presidential nominee, proposed a similar\noverhaul in 2014. Like President Barack Obama, Rubio is also in favor of\nallowing students to get credentials outside of traditional universities\nand colleges.\n\n\n\nRubio said he would "make student loans more manageable by making\nIncome-Based Repayment automatic for all graduates, so the more they make,\nthe faster they pay back their loans; and the less they make, the less\nstrain their loans cause." Former Rep. Tom Petri (R-Wis.) advocated the\nidea of automatic income-based loan repayment as far back as 1983.\n\n\n\nThe Florida senator also said he would expand apprenticeship programs to\n"provide on-the-job training and help standardize skills by allowing\nstudents to learn methods from experienced workers and spread them\nthroughout the industry." Rubio already spoke about expanding apprentice\nprograms last year, and Hillary Clinton called for a tax credit to benefit\ncompanies that hire people as apprentices last month. In his State of the\nUnion address last year, Obama called for similar incentives to expand\napprenticeship programs, and there is currently a bipartisan effort in\nCongress to do so.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Rubio\'s proposal to require lending institutions to "tell\nstudents how much they can expect to earn with a given degree before they\ntake out the loans to pay for it" already made headlines when he introduced\na bill to do so alongside Sens. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) and Ron Wyden\n(D-Ore.) in 2013. Ditto for Rubio\'s "Student Investment Plan," which he\nunveiled last year and which would allow students to partner with corporate\ninvestors for tuition relief.\n\n\n\nThe new sheen fooled some news outlets, generating a wave of positive\ncoverage for the candidate on Tuesday. "Marco Rubio has a wild plan to have\ninvestors pay for college and make money off students\' future earnings,"\nread a headline on Business Insider. Such a tactic, if it continues to be\nrewarded, may be just what the candidate needs in order to distinguish\nhimself among a very crowded -- and more experienced -- Republican\npresidential field.\n\n\n\n*Rubio: Don\'t expect a Romney endorsement soon\n<http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/247076-rubio-dont-expect-a-romney-endorsement-soon>\n// The Hill // Jesse Byrnes \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nWhile Mitt Romney may have become the de facto standard bearer of the\nRepublican Party following his 2012 White House nomination, an endorsement\nfor any 2016 candidate is not on the horizon, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.)\nsaid Tuesday.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\'t think that\'s fair to say," Rubio said in interview Tuesday on\nFox Business Network when pressed whether Romney could be expected to\nendorse him.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t suspect Governor Romney will endorse anyone in this race. He\'s\nsomeone I admire. He\'s someone that I like very much," Rubio added.\n\nHost Neil Cavuto questioned Rubio about staying, along with his family, at\nRomney\'s New Hampshire home over the weekend. New Jersey Gov. Chris\nChristie, another 2016 GOP candidate, also stayed there with his family.\n\nWhen Romney ended a brief public flirtation with his own 2016 bid early\nthis year, he suggested that "one of our next generation of Republican\nleaders" would become the nominee, which many interpreted to be an implicit\nnod toward Rubio, now 44, the youngest candidate in the crowded GOP field\nled by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, 62.\n\nRomney and Bush reportedly met for lunch Monday with several members of\ntheir families in Maine, though Romney said last month he would likely not\nendorse a 2016 candidate until the Republican nominee is selected.\n\nRubio described conversations at the weekend sleepover as "pretty much\nnon-political" Tuesday, saying of Romney\'s clan, "I wouldn\'t read too much\ninto it. They\'re meeting with other people, and they\'ve been very gracious\nwith others as well."\n\nRomney, after helping many Republicans secure midterm victories last year,\nhas lately turned his attention to helping his party prepare for the\nlengthy 2016 presidential primary process and eventual general election.\n\nDuring an appearance on NBC\'s "Meet the Press" last month, Romney mentioned\nRubio, Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Ohio Gov. John Kasich by name,\nsaying about a half-dozen candidates could be president.\n\n\n\nWalker and Kasich have not entered the race officially yet, but both are\nexpected to do so soon.\n\nRomney also hosted Rubio, Walker and Kasich at a retreat in Park City,\nUtah, in June.\n\n\n\n*Marco Rubio 2016 Campaign: Nonprofit Backing GOP Candidate Rubio Raises\nAlmost $16 Million\n<http://www.latinpost.com/articles/64620/20150707/marco-rubio-2016-campaign-nonprofit-backing-gop-candidate-raises-16.htm>\n// Latin Post // Andre Puglie \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nA nonprofit backing Marco Rubio has raised almost $16 million, parts of\nwhich the group plans to invest in television advertisements for the\nRepublican Florida senator\'s 2016 White House bid,\n\n\n\nAccording to Politico, The Conservative Solutions Project, which operates\nseparately from Rubio\'s political-action committee, disclosed that it was\non track to reaching its overall fundraising goal of $25 million.\n\n\n\n"With more than $15.8 million raised already, Conservative Solutions\nProject is nearly two-thirds of the way to our overall fundraising goal,"\nthe nonprofit\'s president, Pat Shortridge, said in a statement.\n\nHe added, "These funds will allow us to continue the fight to restore our\nmilitary and our nation\'s role in the world, and given the recent news\nabout the nation\'s stagnant economy, advocate for conservative solutions to\nan inefficient tax code and education reform so all Americans have a chance\nto pursue their dreams."\n\n\n\nConservative Solutions, which has already spent $1 million on television\ncommercials, said on Monday it would boost its advertising campaign to a\ntotal of $3.3 million, according to CNN. Some of the group\'s early spots,\nthe advertisements focused on Rubio\'s attacks on the Obama administration\'s\nproposed nuclear deal with Iran, an issue The New York Times called\n"critical" for some of the most generous GOP donors.\n\nThe group\'s announcement reveals that Rubio is "the biggest beneficiary so\nfar of a new and largely untested means for moving unlimited cash into\npresidential primary campaigns," The New York Times noted.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Conservative Solutions Project is taking care of many\nactivities typically carried out by a formal presidential campaign, and\nthat includes what the paper called "extensive research on the Republican\nprimary electorate."\n\n\n\nSupporters of other contenders in the increasingly crowded field for the\nRepublican nomination -- including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry, Louisiana Gov.

That\'s why its advertising will be\nlargely "issue based."\n\n\n\nIn most cases, these "social welfare" nonprofits aren\'t required to name\ntheir donors. A spokesman for Conservative Solutions Project told the Times\nit is unlikely to publicly name its donors.\n\n\n\nThe secretive nature of these groups has created the potential for\ncorruption, several public advocacy groups and politicians have argued.\nWhile Congress hasn\'t done much about the rise of these "dark money"\ngroups, leaders at the state level -- both Democrats and Republicans -- are\ntrying to rein them in.\n\n\n\n*Marco Rubio: \xe2\x80\x9cWe need a new president for a new age\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/marco-rubio-we-need-a-new-president-for-a-new-age/>\n// CBS News // Sopan Deb \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio pitched himself as the presidential candidate of\nthe future in a speech Tuesday, arguing he\'s better equipped than his\nrivals to govern a rapidly transforming and innovating America.\n\n\n\nRubio\'s choice of venue for the speech - his first major domestic policy\naddress since he announced his presidential campaign - was no accident. He\nspoke at 1871, an incubator for digital start-ups in Chicago.\n\n\n\n187s is a hub of "digital innovation," Rubio said -- an organization at the\nforefront of what the senator referred to as today\'s "technological\nrevolution." Among the apps that have sprung from 1871: Spot Hero - an app\nthat helps you find parking right away and Options Away, which allows\npassengers to hold a flight at a certain price without actually booking it.\nOne of Rubio\'s GOP primary rivals, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, spoke at the\norganization in the spring.\n\n\n\nIn his speech, Rubio, the second-youngest candidate in the GOP field at 43\nyears old, framed himself as the human embodiment of 1871 -- the only\npresidential candidate in the field with the perspective needed to lead the\ncountry in the 21st century. Even the title of the speech -- "Jobs For A\nNew American Century" -- hinted at Rubio\'s forward-looking message.\n\n\n\n"For the first fifteen and a half years of this century, Washington has\nlooked to the past," Rubio said. "Our economy has changed, but our economic\npolicies have not. And we have learned, painfully, that the old ways no\nlonger work - that Washington cannot pretend the world is the same as it\nwas in the \'80s, it cannot raise taxes like it did in the \'90s, and it\ncannot grow government like it did in the 2000s."\n\n\n\n"We need a new president for a new age," he added. "One with original ideas\nto unlock the two great doors to the future: the doors of innovation and\neducation."\n\n\n\nMuch of the speech laid out his platform on the economy and education.\n\n\n\nRubio proposed cutting the corporate tax rate to make the U.S. "competitive\nwith the average of 25 percent for developed nations." He called for\nestablishing a "territorial tax system," which he said would bring money\nback to the economy held overseas by companies not wanting to be taxed on\nforeign income. Critics allege that territorial taxing would encourage\ncompanies to increase capital abroad, which would then lower wages back\nhome.\n\n\n\nRubio cited several specific technologies on the horizon - self-driving\ncars, virtual reality, robotics - but said that we have "quite nearly the\nexact opposite" of a business-friendly economy. He noted that U.S.\ncorporate taxes are the highest in the developed world -- a claim that\nfact-checking organization Politifact has rated mostly true. The U.S. has\nthe highest statutory tax rate and the second highest effective rate, among\nadvanced industrialized nations.\n\n\n\nAt one point, Rubio managed to get a laugh from the 100 or so attendees in\nthe audience (some sporting Marco Rubio t-shirts) by joking that\nself-driving cars would be great for him, considering recent news reports.\nIt was a clear nod to a recent New York Times piece that explored his\nfamily\'s checkered driving history.\n\n\n\nIn his single reference to immigration policy, Rubio called for a shift to\na system based on merit - designed to attract the world\'s best and\nbrightest workers - rather than a system based on familial relations. He\ndid not mention his past support for a comprehensive immigration bill that\nincludes a path to citizenship -- a stance that has earned plaudits from\nimmigrant and Latino groups but one that has put him at odds with most of\nthe rest of the Republican primary field.\n\n\n\nOn the subject of education, Rubio proposed tackling the growing problem of\nhigher education debt by making income-based repayment automatic for all\ngraduates. He wasn\'t clear on whether this would include only federal\nloans. He also raised the idea of Student Investment Plans, which would\nallow investors to pay the cost of tuition for students and then take a cut\nof the students\' salary after college.\n\n\n\nHe didn\'t target any of his Republican primary opponents by name, but\nfocused his criticism on Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\n"The race for the future will never be won by going backward," Rubio said.\n"It will never be won by hopping in Hillary Clinton\'s time machine to\nyesterday. She seems to believe pumping more of today\'s money into\nyesterday\'s programs will bring prosperity tomorrow."\n\n\n\nRubio called for expanding access to vocational schools as early as high\nschool -- a proposal on which he and Clinton might be able to find common\nground. Last year, at Arizona State University, Clinton called for the\ncountry to "get back to really respecting vocational and technical work."\n\n\n\nThe Senator raced off to Iowa after the speech for a busy couple days of\ncampaigning. The trip marks Rubio\'s third visit to Iowa, site of the\nnation\'s first presidential nominating contest, in 2015.\n\n\n\nOf his previous two trips, one occurred after he announced his candidacy\nand one came in February on a book tour. Rubio\'s first event in Iowa this\ntime will occur in Des Moines at the Exile Brewing Company. He\'ll hold a\nhappy hour with the Bull Moose Club, a forum for Iowa Republicans under the\nage of 40, and he\'s hoping he\'ll find a receptive audience for his message\nabout the generational divide.\n\n\n\nOf the GOP\'s 2016 candidates, only retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and\nformer Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum have addressed the group thus far\nthis cycle.\n\n\n\n*Marco Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s Economic Plan Calls For Students To Sell Themselves To\nPrivate Investors\n<http://thinkprogress.org/election/2015/07/07/3677543/marco-rubios-economic-plan-calls-students-sell-private-investors/>\n// Think Progress // Alice Ollstein \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nFlorida Senator and Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio described\nhis economic platform in a speech Tuesday in Chicago, touching on well-worn\nGOP priorities including slashing corporate taxes from 35 to 25 percent,\nfurther deregulating the private sector, restricting family immigration,\nand resisting calls to raise the minimum wage. Taking several specific\nshots at Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, Rubio said his plan would\navoid \xe2\x80\x9cpumping more of today\xe2\x80\x99s money into yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s programs,\xe2\x80\x9d and bring\nthe U.S. into the future.\n\n\n\nIn the speech, Rubio also called for a \xe2\x80\x9crevolutionized\xe2\x80\x9d higher education\nsystem. If elected president, he promised to \xe2\x80\x9cbust\xe2\x80\xa6the cartel of existing\ncolleges and universities\xe2\x80\x9d by loosening the rules for accreditation so that\n\xe2\x80\x9cinnovative, low-cost competitors\xe2\x80\x9d can court students. But critics say the\ngovernment accreditation process is already far too loose, allowing\npredatory for-profit chains like Corinthian Colleges to win federal\napproval and funding even as they mislead students into paying for\nessentially worthless degrees.\n\n\n\nHe also touted the \xe2\x80\x9cStudent Right to Know Before You Go Act\xe2\x80\x9d he\nco-sponsored with Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden \xe2\x80\x94 a plan extremely similar to\none President Obama pushed for last year that ranks colleges by how much\ntheir tuition costs and how much money their graduates make.\n\n\n\nLamenting the \xe2\x80\x9cshadow of debt hovering over millions of graduates,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio\nthen proposed a model already suggested by his rival Governor Chris\nChristie (R-NJ): allowing rich individuals or hedge funds to pay a students\ntuition and collect their investment back post-graduation.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may result in a profit for the investor or it may not \xe2\x80\x93 but unlike with\nloans, none of the risk lies with the student,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio said.\n\n\n\nHe expanded on this idea in a speech last year:\n\n\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s say you are a student who needs $10,000 to pay for your last year of\nschool. Instead of taking this money out in the form of a loan, you could\napply for a \xe2\x80\x9cStudent Investment Plan\xe2\x80\x9d from an approved and certified\nprivate investment group. In short, these investors would pay your $10,000\ntuition in return for a percentage of your income for a set period of time\nafter graduation \xe2\x80\x93 let\xe2\x80\x99s say, for example, 4% a year for 10 years.\n\n\n\nThis group would look at factors such as your major, the institution you\xe2\x80\x99re\nattending, your record in school \xe2\x80\x93 and use this to make a determination\nabout the likelihood of you finding a good job and paying them back.\n\n\n\nUnlike with loans, you would be under no legal obligation to pay back that\nentire $10,000. Your only obligation would be to pay that 4% of your income\nper year for 10 years, regardless of whether that ends up amounting to more\nor less than $10,000.\n\nBut these \xe2\x80\x9cStudent Investment Plans,\xe2\x80\x9d which also have the Orwellian name\n\xe2\x80\x9chuman capital contracts,\xe2\x80\x9d raise many serious concerns. For one, investors\nmay refuse to cover entire fields of students not likely to bring in the\nbig bucks after graduation, or would charge them a staggeringly high\npercentage of their income. For those backing this plan, such as the\nconservative think tank American Enterprise Institute (AEI), this poses no\nproblem.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t this \xe2\x80\x98unfair\xe2\x80\x99 to those wanting to be librarians, teachers, social\nworkers, etc., since they would have to forego more of their incomes to\nsatisfy the human capital contract? Not really,\xe2\x80\x9d writes AEI Adjunct Scholar\nRichard Vedder. \xe2\x80\x9cSociety puts a relatively low value on those jobs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAdditionally, following Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s math of 4 percent over 10 years, a graduate\nwould have to earn an extremely low salary for the investor not to make a\nprofit. Vedder and other advocates of the plan are less cautious, and have\nvoiced support for plans that take as high as 25 percent of a graduates\nsalary for multiple decades after they enter the workforce.\n\n\n\nThe National College Access Network and other groups have warned that such\na plan could cost students even more than high-interest federal loan\nprograms, diverting away money those graduates could have used to save for\nretirement or buy a house.\n\n\n\nRubio\xe2\x80\x99s proposal is similar to the \xe2\x80\x9cPay It Forward, Pay It Back\xe2\x80\x9d model\ncurrently being explored by the state of Oregon \xe2\x80\x94 with one crucial\ndifference. In Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s plan, the investor is the democratically-elected\nstate government, so when graduates repay their loans that money can go\nback into public education. Under Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s version, the money would go into\nthe pockets of investors.\n\n\n\n*Marco Rubio Outlines Domestic Policy Agenda, Jabs Clinton\n<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/marco-rubio-outlines-domestic-policy-agenda-jabs-clinton-n387996>\n// NBC News // Alex Jaffe \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nIn his first domestic policy-focused speech since announcing his bid for\npresident, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio on Tuesday outlined his vision for tax\nand higher education reform to usher in a "New American Century" marked by\ninnovation and prosperity.\n\n\n\nThe GOP presidential candidate told the audience at a digital startup\nco-working space in Chicago that while the future may look bleak today, his\nproposals would ensure America remains competitive globally.\n\n\n\nAnd he took direct aim at Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary\nClinton, framing her as a backward-looking foil to his forward-focused\nagenda.\n\n\n\n"The race for the future will never be won by going backward. It will never\nbe won by hopping in Hillary Clinton\'s time machine to yesterday," Rubio\ntold the crowd. "She seems to believe pumping more of today\'s money into\nyesterday\'s programs will bring prosperity tomorrow."\n\n\n\nThe Florida senator said technological innovation and globalization has\ncreated a situation in which "the path to the middle class is narrower\ntoday than it has been for generations, and the American Dream so many\nachieved in the last century is in peril."\n\n\n\nHigher-education "cartels" are a key inhibitor of upward mobility, he said,\npledging to overhaul the system in the first 100 days of his presidency by\n"establishing a new accreditation process that welcomes low-cost,\ninnovative providers."\n\n\n\nA President Rubio would also require schools to tell students how much they\ncan expect to earn from their degrees, and expand access to career and\nvocational schools as well as apprenticeship programs for training on the\njob.\n\n\n\nIn his remarks, he outlined a broad array of domestic reforms, from an\noverhaul of the business tax code to reforming the legal immigration system\nto bring in more high-skilled workers.\n\n\n\nHe argued in particular against raising the minimum wage, which he said\n"will accelerate automation and outsourcing" rather than improve the\nquality of life for Americans.\n\n\n\nInstead, Rubio proposes cutting the corporate tax rate to be competitive\nwith the average 25 percent rate for developed countries, creating a\n"territorial tax system" to prevent businesses from being taxed twice on\nprofits, and allowing businesses to take deductions on 100 percent of the\nfunds they invest back into business development and employee wages.\n\n\n\nHe also called for "reforming our legal immigration system to make it\nskill- and merit-based rather than family-based, which will protect\nAmerican workers and attract more talent to grow our economy and create\njobs."\n\n\n\nThe speech marked Rubio\'s reemergence on the campaign trail after weeks\nspent bogged down in Senate business on Capitol Hill and fundraising jaunts\nacross the nation. Rubio\'s campaign has yet to announce how much the\naggressive fundraising schedule earned his campaign, although a key outside\ngroup backing him announced Monday that it has raised $15.8 million to\ndate. In the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 14 percent of\nRepublican primary voters identified him as their first choice for the\nnomination, placing him behind rivals Jeb Bush and Scott Walker.\n\n\n\nBut the speech, along with his campaign swing through Iowa and Nevada in\nthe coming days, is meant to catapult him back into the race and again\nhighlight what Rubio\'s aides and allies see as his greatest asset -- his\nyouthful appeal and unique personal narrative, in a field of older GOP\ncandidates.\n\n\n\n*PAUL*\n\n\n\n*Rand Paul, dorm room philosopher: Why his \xe2\x80\x9cslavery\xe2\x80\x9d nonsense is so\noutrageous\n<http://www.salon.com/2015/07/07/rand_paul_dorm_room_philosopher_why_his_slavery_nonsense_is_so_outrageous/>\n// Salon // Simon Maloy \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015*\n\n\n\nPresidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul has a tax plan he\xe2\x80\x99d like to sell you\non. The plan, which would put in place a 14.5 percent flat tax, was crafted\nwith the input of some of the wrongest people in the conservative economic\npolicy world, and it would redistribute wealth up the economic ladder while\ntossing a bone or two to the people at the bottom. But Rand is proud of it\nnonetheless, mainly because he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s less slavery-like than your\naverage tax scheme.\n\n\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s what Paul said last week about taxation and \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom,\xe2\x80\x9d as reported\nby BuzzFeed:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you can have some government, we all need government,\xe2\x80\x9d the Kentucky\nsenator said while discussing Thomas Paine and the role of government at\nthe local public library. \xe2\x80\x9cThomas Paine said that government is a necessary\nevil. What did he mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPaul said he believes that \xe2\x80\x9cyou have to give up some of your liberty to\nhave government,\xe2\x80\x9d saying he was \xe2\x80\x9cfor some government.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m for paying some taxes,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Paul. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if we tax you at 100%\nthen you\xe2\x80\x99ve got zero percent liberty. If we tax you at 50% you are half\nslave, half free. I frankly would like to see you a little freer and a\nlittle more money remaining in your communities so you can create jobs.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a debate we need to have.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThat was his big pitch \xe2\x80\x93 The Rand Paul tax plan: Only 14.5 percent slavery!\n\n\n\nThis is a dumb argument. And it\xe2\x80\x99s upsetting to hear this dumb argument\ncoming from someone who is trying to be president, but will go back to\nwriting and approving legislation if/when that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work out. Taxation\nis not tantamount to slavery. The only thing that\xe2\x80\x99s comparable to slavery\nis actual slavery. You might not like it that a portion of your paycheck is\nsent to the feds and your state government, and you may disagree with how\nyour tax dollars are spent, but that is in no way comparable to being kept\nin bondage and having the fruits of your labor stolen from you.\n\n\n\nAny way you look at this argument, it\xe2\x80\x99s bad. When you\xe2\x80\x99ve staked out the\nposition that your effective tax rate is how you measure one\xe2\x80\x99s slave\nstatus, then you\xe2\x80\x99re arguing that a progressive tax structure means rich\npeople are less free than the lucky poor folks who would see a smaller\npercentage of their income go to the government. By this reading, a hedge\nfund billionaire who moves his assets offshore to avoid paying taxes is\nbasically Frederick Douglass. And when you refer to something as slavery,\nhow can you then make the case that there is an acceptable threshold for\nit? Why should 14.5 percent slavery be any more tolerable than 100 percent\nslavery?\n\n\n\nIt gets even worse when you remember that Rand Paul is trying to make\ninroads with black voters and repair his party\xe2\x80\x99s abysmally bad reputation\nwith African-Americans. Rand obviously understands at a certain level that\nslavery was a uniquely horrific crime, the memory of which still haunts our\npolitics. After the shootings in Charleston last month, Paul called for the\nConfederate flag to be removed from grounds of the South Carolina Capitol\nbecause \xe2\x80\x9cto every African-American in the country it\xe2\x80\x99s a symbolism of\nslavery to them and now it\xe2\x80\x99s a symbol of murder to this young man.\xe2\x80\x9d Here we\nare, just a couple of weeks later, and he\xe2\x80\x99s comparing the grotesque human\nrights violations represented by that flag to the banal act of filing your\nannual tax return.\n\n\n\nAnd this isn\xe2\x80\x99t Rand Paul\xe2\x80\x99s first foray into comparing policies he disagrees\nwith to slavery. In 2011, during a Senate hearing, he said that a \xe2\x80\x9cright to\nhealthcare\xe2\x80\x9d would, in effect, make slaves out of doctors such as himself:\n\n\n\nWith regard to the idea whether or not you have a right to health care you\nhave to realize what that implies. I am a physician. You have a right to\ncome to my house and conscript me. It means you believe in slavery. You are\ngoing to enslave not only me but the janitor at my hospital, the person who\ncleans my office, the assistants, the nurses. \xe2\x80\xa6 You are basically saying\nyou believe in slavery.\n\n\n\nOn the flip side of the \xe2\x80\x9cslavery\xe2\x80\x9d argument, Paul argued earlier this year\nthat the vaccination of children was \xe2\x80\x9can issue of freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d essentially\nsaying that parents should be free to have their kids be vectors for the\ncommunication of dangerous disease. (Before he was elected to the Senate,\nPaul went on Alex Jones\xe2\x80\x99 radio show and warned that mandatory vaccinations\nwere a precursor to martial law.)\n\n\n\nRand\xe2\x80\x99s been espousing this strain of dorm-room libertarianism for quite\nsome time, reducing complex policy issues to black-and-white questions of\n\xe2\x80\x9cfreedom\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cslavery.\xe2\x80\x9d He and others like him who carp on the slavery of\ntaxes and the tyranny of public health promotion are an obvious source of\nfrustration to other libertarians who would very much prefer that the\npublic faces of the \xe2\x80\x9cLibertarian Moment\xe2\x80\x9d stop making asses of themselves by\ncheapening the horror of America\xe2\x80\x99s slave past.\n\n\n\n*CRUZ*\n\n\n\n*Blogging Federal Judge Says Ted Cruz \xe2\x80\x98Not Fit to be President\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/07/07/blogging-federal-judge-says-ted-cruz-not-fit-to-be-president/>\n// WSJ // Jacob Gershman \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Ted Cruz raised eyebrows with his idea of\ngiving voters the power to oust Supreme Court justices from the bench.\n\n\n\nOne federal judge says he\xe2\x80\x99s so offended by the Texas senator\xe2\x80\x99s proposal\nthat he thinks it should disqualify him from the White House.\n\n\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the opinion of U.S. District Judge Richard Kopf of Nebraska, a\npart-time blogger who has attracted his own share of controversy.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Cruz seeks to sacrifice the Supreme Court upon the altar of an extreme\nright-wing ideology. That makes him unsuited to become President,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote\nJudge Kopf on his personal blog, \xe2\x80\x9cHercules and the Umpire.\xe2\x80\x9d He titled his\npost, \xe2\x80\x9cSenator Ted Cruz is not fit to be President.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe was responding to Mr. Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for a constitutional amendment\nthat would end life tenure for Supreme Court justices and force the\njustices to face periodic judicial-retention elections to keep their jobs.\nThe Harvard-educated Texas senator, who once clerked for Chief Justice\nWilliam Rehnquist, said the court\xe2\x80\x99s recent rulings on Obamacare and gay\nmarriage rulings were examples of lawless judicial activism that retention\nelections would help to cure.\n\n\n\nRick Tyler, a spokesman for Mr. Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, took issue with Judge\nKopf\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of the senator\xe2\x80\x99s ideology.  In a statement emailed\nto Law Blog on Tuesday, he said:\n\n\n\nSenator Cruz cares deeply about The Supreme Court\xe2\x80\xa6He respects and admires\nmany of the Justices, some are his friends. He did not come to his\nconclusion about retention elections lightly. Quite the opposite. He wrote\na thoughtful essay on why he believed it was necessary. He understands and\nrespects why some would disagree. But what evidence does the judge offer to\nback up his assertion of \xe2\x80\x9cextreme right-wing ideology\xe2\x80\x9d? Or is he accustomed\nto render his verdicts without substantiation.\n\n\n\nOver at Volokh Conspiracy, attorney and law professor Orin Kerr wonders\nwhether Judge Kopf crossed a line:\n\n\n\nWhatever one thinks of the substance of Kopf\xe2\x80\x99s argument \xe2\x80\x94 both as to the\nproposal and the candidate \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m more interested in the ethical questions\nit raises.

I remind you that I am not registered to\nvote, and I have not been registered to vote since I became a judge in\n1987. My comment on his legal fitness was inextricably intertwined with my\nright to speak publicy on legal matters and the administration of justice.\nThat said you are correct that I skated close to thin ice.\n\n\n\n*Blogging judge calls political candidate \xe2\x80\x9cunfit\xe2\x80\x9d for office\n<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/07/07/blogging-judge-calls-political-candidate-unfit-for-office/>\n// WSJ // Orin Kerr \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nU.S. District Judge Richard Kopf is no stranger to controversy. At his\npersonal blog, Hercules and the Umpire, Judge Kopf has over time shared his\nsomewhat intemperate criticism of the Supreme Court, other judges,\nCongress, and lawyers practicing before him. His posts have generated no\nshortage of national press attention.\n\n\n\nIn a recent post, Kopf may have added another controversial notch to his\nblogging belt by proclaiming a political candidate \xe2\x80\x9cnot fit\xe2\x80\x9d for office. In\nresponse to recent Supreme Court decisions, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) has\nproposed a constitutional amendment that would require Supreme Court\njustices to face periodic retention elections. Judge Kopf argues that\nCruz\xe2\x80\x99s attack on lifetime tenure reveals Cruz as \xe2\x80\x9ca right-wing ideologue\xe2\x80\x9d\nwho \xe2\x80\x9cis demonstrably unfit to become President.\xe2\x80\x9d In Kopf\xe2\x80\x99s view, it\xe2\x80\x99s\nobvious that lifetime tenure for federal judges is better than a system of\nretention elections. To argue otherwise would \xe2\x80\x9csacrifice the Supreme Court\nupon the altar of an extreme right-wing ideology.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[A]s a federal judge,\xe2\x80\x9d\nKopf writes, that gives him \xe2\x80\x9cthe right . . . and dare I say the duty, to\nrespond to the proposal.\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s proposal is so bad, Kopf reasons, that it\nmakes Cruz \xe2\x80\x9cunsuited to become President.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhatever one thinks of the substance of Kopf\xe2\x80\x99s argument \xe2\x80\x94 both as to the\nproposal and the candidate \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m more interested in the ethical questions\nit raises. Canon 5 of the Code of Conduct for Federal Judges states:\n\n\n\nA judge should not . . . publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public\noffice[.]\n\n\n\nDoes calling a candidate for public office \xe2\x80\x9cunfit\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrably\nunsuited\xe2\x80\x9d for that office amount to \xe2\x80\x9coppos[ing] a candidate for public\noffice\xe2\x80\x9d?\n\n\n\nIn response to commenter who raises this concern, Judge Kopf argues that he\ndid not violate Canon 5 because he was merely exercising his right to\ncomment on public matters:\n\n\n\nFor me, it is enough to state that I did not label Senator Cruz unfit to\nserve in order to oppose his candidacy for political or partisan purposes\nbut rather to demolish and protect us all from his intemperate legal\nattacks on the Supreme Court. I remind you that I am not registered to\nvote, and I have not been registered to vote since I became a judge in\n1987. My comment on his legal fitness was inextricably intertwined with my\nright to speak publicy on legal matters and the administration of justice.\nThat said you are correct that I skated close to thin ice.\n\n\n\nHe adds:\n\n\n\nIf Senator\xe2\x80\x99s Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s legal proposition was beyond the pale, and I have the\nright under the Code of Conduct to write on legal subjects, why is that I\nam prohibited from concluding that his legal assertions disqualify him from\npublic office? It seems to me that the two things are inextricably linked.\nI find it impossible to honestly separate the speaker from the speech in\nthis instance.\n\n\n\nAnd further:\n\n\n\nI might add that I stand by views after serving six years on the Judicial\nConference\xe2\x80\x99s Codes of Conduct Committee. That hardly makes me right, but it\ndoes reflect a serious study of the Code of the Conduct for United States\nJudges.\n\n\n\nHas Kopf skated close to thin ice, as he says, or has he skated over it and\nfallen through? Kopf was of course free to comment on the merits of Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s\nproposal. (For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, I agree that Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s proposal is a bad idea;\nI personally favor 18-year terms for Justices.) But I would think that the\nethical line is actually pretty clear. The ethics canons allow judges to\npublicly oppose a reform proposal but do not allow them to publicly oppose\na candidate for public office. The two may be related from the perspective\nof voters, as presumably they would want to vote against a candidate with\nbad ideas. Or at least they would weigh a bad idea against a candidate when\nthey decide who among the candidates in the race they should support. But I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think the two are intertwined for the judges who have to follow the\nethics canons.\n\n\n\nOr so it seems to me. I\xe2\x80\x99d be interested to know whether others agree or\ndisagree.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: Judge Kopf elaborates a bit on his position in the comment thread\nto his post:\n\n\n\n[W]hen a man of Senator Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s education and experience calls for a radical\nand fundamental attack on the Supreme Court he is not acting in political\nterms. If he is really serious about the amendment he is a threat to the\njudiciary that I love and respect and have devoted much of my life to\nserving. Therefore, his unfitness is a function of his threat to our\nConstitutional form of government\xe2\x80\x93it is in that sense that he is acting in\nan extra-political manner and that extra-political action entitles me to\ntake the public position that I have taken about his unfitness.\n\n\n\nThis reads like an explanation of why it\xe2\x80\x99s worth it to violate Canon 5\nrather than why it\xe2\x80\x99s not a violation in the first place.\n\n\n\nANOTHER UPDATE: In a new comment thread, Judge Kopf argues that he did not\nviolate Canon 5 at all. He writes, with emphasis in the original:\n\n\n\nI neither publicly endorsed nor publicly opposed Mr. Cruz for a public\noffice. Rather, I wrote that Senator Cruz \xe2\x80\x9cwas unfit.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOppose\xe2\x80\x9d is a verb.\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfit\xe2\x80\x9d is an adjective. While the words are similar, they are not in any\nsense the same.\n\n\n\nI appreciate the response, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t get this as an argument. First, I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think it takes a specific verb to oppose someone. Second, when you\nsay someone is \xe2\x80\x9cunfit for public office,\xe2\x80\x9d I have always understood that to\nmean \xe2\x80\x9cshould not be in public office.\xe2\x80\x9d I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you can say someone\nshould not be in public office without opposing them for that office.\nThird, in defending his position Kopf also wrote:\n\n\n\nIf Senator\xe2\x80\x99s Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s legal proposition was beyond the pale, and I have the\nright under the Code of Conduct to write on legal subjects, why is that I\nam prohibited from concluding that his legal assertions disqualify him from\npublic office? It seems to me that the two things are inextricably linked.\nI find it impossible to honestly separate the speaker from the speech in\nthis instance.\n\n\n\nI read that as Judge Kopf saying that Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s views \xe2\x80\x9cdisqualify him from\npublic office.\xe2\x80\x9d I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you can argue that a politician\xe2\x80\x99s views\n\xe2\x80\x9cdisqualify him from public office\xe2\x80\x9d without also opposing that politician\xe2\x80\x99s\nbid to the office.\n\n\n\n*Ted Cruz\'s angry allies\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/ted-cruzs-angry-allies-119827.html>\n// Politico // Katie Glueck \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nTed Cruz has methodically built a roster of state leaders to help him fire\nup social conservatives in the South. He may have gotten more than he\nbargained for.\n\n\n\nIn the last month alone, three of his state co-chairs have drawn fire over\ncomments related to everything from Sharia law to the victims of the\nAfrican-American church shooting in Charleston, S.C. That dynamic was\nthrown into sharp relief in recent weeks, as the debate in South Carolina\nunfolded over whether to take down the Confederate flag from the statehouse\ngrounds.\n\n\n\nOne state co-chair said the victims of the Charleston shooting \xe2\x80\x9cwaited\ntheir turn to be shot.\xe2\x80\x9d Another has emerged as the voice of the opposition\nto removing the rebel flag from the statehouse, likening that effort to a\n\xe2\x80\x9cStalinist purge.\xe2\x80\x9d Separately, in Tennessee, his state chairman had once\naccused a Muslim state appointee of being a \xe2\x80\x9cShariah compliant finance\nexpert,\xe2\x80\x9d a comment that sparked outrage in some corners when he was tapped\nfor the position with Cruz in early June.\n\n\n\nWhen asked about his surrogates\xe2\x80\x99 inflammatory comments, the Cruz campaign\nhad their backs.\n\n\n\nPro-confederate flag demonstrators Alice Horky (R) wears confederate flag\ncowboy boots as she protests atop the South Carolina State House steps in\nColumbia, South Carolina, June 27, 2015. There has been a growing clamor\nfor the flag \xe2\x80\x94 branded \'a reminder of systemic oppression and racist\nsubjugation\' by President Barack Obama on Friday \xe2\x80\x94 to be removed from the\ngrounds of the state house in Columbia. Once flown by the rebel army of the\nslave-owning South, the confederate flag is seen by some as a symbol of\nregional heritage, but by many more as an ugly reminder of racism\'s cruel\nlegacy.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are respected in their states, they are terrific organizers, they are\nworking hard to help win the nomination and we have every confidence they\nhave the ability to do that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler.\n\n\n\nTheir ability to hold their tongues is more in doubt.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, South Carolina state Sen. Lee Bright, the co-chair who is a\nleading opponent of taking down the flag, generated headlines and raised\neyebrows in South Carolina and beyond when he gave a vehement floor speech\nopposing the flag removal. In the address, he warned that \xe2\x80\x9cthe devil is\ntaking control of this land\xe2\x80\x9d and went on an anti-gay rights tangent,\ncalling the pro-gay rainbow symbol the \xe2\x80\x9cabomination colors.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n(Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s campaign has said he believes the flag is a state issue.)\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how that helps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chip Felkel, a prominent longtime\nRepublican operative who lives in Bright\xe2\x80\x99s district, of the implications of\nthe state senator\xe2\x80\x99s remarks for Cruz. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s guilt by association.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDespite Bright\xe2\x80\x99s efforts, the Senate voted this week, 36-3, to take the\nflag down. The state House of Representatives takes the bill up next. State\nRep. Bill Chumley, another Cruz co-chair who will be voting in the House,\nhas also indicated opposition to removing the flag. He was the one to\ncomment on the Charleston victims, a remark for which he has since\napologized.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese gentlemen \xe2\x80\x94 a term I\xe2\x80\x99d use loosely at this point \xe2\x80\x94 maybe they feel\nthey represent their constituents, but the train has left the station, it\xe2\x80\x99s\ntime to turn the page and they are not doing themselves or Sen. Cruz any\nfavors,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Felkel, who worked for George W. Bush but is currently\nunaffiliated in the presidential race. \xe2\x80\x9cThe longer this is drawn out, the\nuglier it gets, [with] national implications. Every one of these guys are\nlooking at who\xe2\x80\x99s on their team, who their supporters are and that\xe2\x80\x99s going\nto carry over to other states. I think it cannot be a positive based on how\nthis is playing out in the media.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe backlash was made more clear this week in the early-voting state of\nIowa. On Monday, GOP Chairman Jeff Kaufmann told Radio Iowa, while speaking\nabout a local incident involving the flag, that he \xe2\x80\x9cwill not tolerate\xe2\x80\x9d\nhaving it connected to the GOP.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are 17,000 young Iowa men that are laying in graves that fought\nagainst that very flag and everything it stood for,\xe2\x80\x9d Kaufmann said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s really not a lot of conversation to have about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman said that \xe2\x80\x9cof course\xe2\x80\x9d the campaign stands behind\nChumley and Bright, in addition to Kevin Kookogey, the Tennessee state\nchair.\n\n\n\nRegarding Bright, Tyler said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an elected official, a state senator,\nyou have to garner a certain amount of support to be an elected state\nsenator\xe2\x80\xa6he has agreed to do this on behalf of the senator and we are\ngrateful for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBright, who represents the conservative Upstate region, mounted an\nunsuccessful primary challenge to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) last cycle.\nIn 2012, he was former Rep. Michele Bachmann\xe2\x80\x99s South Carolina chair\n(Chumley also worked for her), and then switched his allegiances to Ron\nPaul after she dropped out.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would encourage presidential candidates to let us deal with this,\xe2\x80\x9d\nBright said of the flag issue in an interview with POLITICO last month.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s deeply rooted history for a lot of us. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to stand by and\nlet our ancestors\xe2\x80\x99 memories be besmirched. It\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to just take down\nthe flag. They want us to concede that the soldiers that fell for the\nConfederacy were a bunch of racists, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to concede that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhen South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Republican leadership first called for the flag to\ncome down late last month, following the Charleston shooting, Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s\ncampaign said the senator would leave the flag issue to the state. His\ncampaign maintained that position Tuesday following the Senate vote. That\nposition stands out in a GOP field where many other presidential contenders\nlauded the state officials\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to take it down.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a state issue, let them resolve it,\xe2\x80\x9d Tyler said. Bright \xe2\x80\x9cis a South\nCarolinian\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s completely appropriate he argues the point of view he has.\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it prevailed, but he argued it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nCruz is used to being out of step with the Republican establishment \xe2\x80\x94 his\n2013 spearheading of a government shutdown, and his support for a group\nthat primaried GOP incumbents in 2014, cemented that dynamic. And his\nposition on the Confederate flag in South Carolina, along with his alliance\nwith Bright, ensures that he\xe2\x80\x99s at odds with the GOP leadership of South\nCarolina, too, note some Palmetto State operatives.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of people Cruz has associated himself with are extraordinarily wrong\non the flag,\xe2\x80\x9d said a senior South Carolina Republican official. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6There\xe2\x80\x99s\nno depth he won\xe2\x80\x99t stoop to to pander. He\xe2\x80\x99s not well-liked by the Republican\nestablishment, and this is more confirmation of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOf course, Cruz isn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to win over the establishment. Plenty of his\ndeeply conservative supporters are energized by people, like Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s\nTennessee chair, who promise to take on Sharia law. And in South Carolina,\nthere remains a pocket of Republican voters who do not want to see the\nConfederate flag come down, though it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear how large that group is.\nOther Republican presidential candidates, who supported Gov. Nikki Haley in\nher call for the flag to come down, may have alienated those voters \xe2\x80\x94 but\nCruz hasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom his standpoint, it\xe2\x80\x99s not bad politics,\xe2\x80\x9d said someone working for a\nrival campaign. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6If you look at, how do you distinguish yourself in a\ncrowded field, in a state as important as South Carolina, that would be one\nway of doing it. As a long-term strategy, it may be short-sighted, but they\nare playing the short game.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just the establishment calling for the flag to come down, though.\nProminent Christian conservatives, including leading Southern Baptists,\nhave also taken that position.\n\n\n\nGlenn McCall, South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Republican National Committeeman and a\nsupporter of bringing the flag down, said he thinks that at on the national\nstage, the flag issue may blow over by the time of the primary. But at\nleast at a state level, he said, those who don\xe2\x80\x99t back bringing down the\nflag are losing a chance to embrace Christian unity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose supporting him will support him, those supporting other folks are\nnot going to change their opinion one way or another,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of Cruz. But\nat a state level, among those who oppose taking the flag down, \xe2\x80\x9cI just hate\nthat they\xe2\x80\x99re missing an opportunity \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re all missing an opportunity \xe2\x80\x94\nto stand with their brothers and sisters in the faith.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Ted Cruz partners with donor\xe2\x80\x99s \'psychographic\' firm\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/ted-cruz-donor-for-data-119813.html>\n// Politico // Kenneth Vogel & Tarini Parti \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nTed Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s presidential effort is working closely with a little-known\ncompany owned by one of his biggest donors that uses non-traditional\n\xe2\x80\x9cpsychographic\xe2\x80\x9d analyses of voters to try to win them over with narrowly\ntargeted micro-messages, POLITICO has learned.\n\n\n\nThe company, Cambridge Analytica, has sent staff to Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s campaign\nheadquarters in Houston to help set up an intensive data analysis operation.\n\n\n\nCambridge Analytica is connected to a British firm called SCL Group that\nprovides governments, political groups and companies around the world with\nservices ranging from military disinformation campaigns to social media\nbranding and voter targeting.\n\n\n\nSo far, SCL\xe2\x80\x99s political work has been mostly in the developing world \xe2\x80\x93\nwhere it has boasted of its ability to help foment coups. Cambridge\nAnalytica only entered the competitive U.S. political data market last year.\n\n\n\nCambridge Analytica is owned at least in part by the family of the press\nshy New York hedge fund manager Robert Mercer, multiple sources confirmed\nto POLITICO. The Mercers this year provided the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of the $37\nmillion raised by a quartet of unlimited money super PACs supporting Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s\ncampaign for the GOP presidential nomination. Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign\nhas contracted with Cambridge Analytica to provide data services, and the\ncompany has had talks with at least one of those super PACs, according to\nsources.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for political campaigns, parties and PACs to pay huge\ncontracts for data and other services to companies affiliated with their\nconsultants. But it\xe2\x80\x99s less common for such contracts to go to firms\naffiliated with the donors funding the whole enterprise.\n\n\n\nCruz spokesman Rick Tyler said the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s Director of Research and\nAnalytics Chris Wilson is using Cambridge Analytica to build models that\nidentify and sort persuadable voters in early primary states by six-key\npersonality types, which will be used to target the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s outreach.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen their product and its better than anything I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nTyler. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know what a Cruz supporter looks like demographically \xe2\x80\xa6 and this\nallows us to go into Iowa and match those traits with likely caucus goers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe group of super PACs supporting Cruz, Keep the Promise, did not respond\nto questions about their arrangements with Cambridge Analytica. The company\ndid not respond to interview requests, while a spokesman for the Mercer\nfamily declined to comment.\n\n\n\nIn recent years, the Mercer family \xe2\x80\x93 Robert Mercer, his wife Diana Mercer\nand their daughter Rebekah Mercer \xe2\x80\x93 have emerged as among the leading\nfinanciers of conservative causes and candidates.\n\n\n\nTheir quiet involvement in Cambridge Analytica \xe2\x80\x93 which is known in elite\nconservative finance circles but has yet to be reported \xe2\x80\x93 seems to mark a\ntransition from purely financing political campaigns to running their own\npolitical operation. It\xe2\x80\x99s a model that\xe2\x80\x99s been pursued to varying degrees by\nbillionaires ranging from the liberal hedge funder Tom Steyer to the\nconservative industrialists Charles and David Koch. It was made possible\npartly by the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2010 Citizens United decision that opened new\navenues for unlimited political spending.\n\n\n\nWith their investment in Cambridge Analytica \xe2\x80\x93 and the Cruz campaign\xe2\x80\x99s\nembrace of their product \xe2\x80\x93 the Mercers also have become competitors in an\nincreasingly cut-throat conservative political data race. Some of the\nright\xe2\x80\x99s most influential and well-funded players \xe2\x80\x94 including the Koch\nbrothers\xe2\x80\x99 operation and the Republican National Committee \xe2\x80\x94 are jockeying\nfor market share and 2016 prospects in a political sub-industry expected to\nconsume a huge portion of the billions spent in the campaign. The result of\nthe competition could go a long way towards determining the winner of the\nWhite House and the Republican Party\xe2\x80\x99s direction after the election.\n\n\n\nSo far, most of Cambridge Analytica\xe2\x80\x99s work appears to have come from\ncampaigns and committees funded in large part by the Mercers. And sources\nfamiliar with the Mercer\xe2\x80\x99s political efforts said that Rebekah Mercer, who\nhas steered the family\xe2\x80\x99s political expansion, has made introductions\nbetween Cambridge Analytica and the political committees the family\nsupports.\n\n\n\nFederal Election Commission filings show that nearly 93 percent of the $2.6\nmillion Cambridge Analytica has received in traceable federal payments have\ncome from committees to which the Mercers donated generously. The payments\n\xe2\x80\x93 which all came last year and were for polling, micro-targeting,\nadvertising and other services \xe2\x80\x93 came from Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s leadership PAC and a\nhandful of GOP-aligned big-money organizations, including Ending Spending\nAction Fund, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton\xe2\x80\x99s super PAC and a pop-up\nsuper PAC created to boost 2014 Republican Senate candidates.\n\n\n\nOther Cambridge Analytica clients included the campaigns of GOP Sens. Tom\nCotton of Arkansas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, as well as\nunsuccessful GOP House candidate Art Robinson of Oregon. The Mercers\ncombined to donate nearly $3.3 million to those groups in 2014, according\nto FEC filings.\n\n\n\nRepresentatives from most of the groups and campaigns did not respond to\nquestions about whether there was any connection between their support from\nthe Mercers and their payments to Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\n\nGarrett Marquis, a spokesman for Bolton\xe2\x80\x99s super PAC, said the $340,000 his\ngroup paid to Cambridge Analytica in 2014 was money well spent.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something that no one has done in politics.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has been one of Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s most vocal defenders\nin recent weeks, at least among the Republican presidential candidates, but\nof particular interest is how the Texas senator has made his argument.\nConsider, for example, what Cruz told NBC\xe2\x80\x99s Chuck Todd the other day on\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like Donald Trump. He\xe2\x80\x99s bold, he\xe2\x80\x99s brash. And I get it that it seems the\nfavorite sport of the Washington media is to encourage some Republicans to\nattack other Republicans. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not interested in\nRepublican-on-Republican violence. [\xe2\x80\xa6]\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has a colorful way of speaking. It is not the way I speak. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not\ngoing to engage in the media game of throwing rocks and attacking other\nRepublicans. I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDuring a Fox News interview yesterday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R)\nmade clear how unimpressed he was with Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric. \xe2\x80\x9cI find it ironic\nthat Ted Cruz is giving lectures on Republican-on-Republican violence,\xe2\x80\x9d the\ngovernor said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe guy who put together a group that was sponsoring\nprimary ads against Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) is giving us \xe2\x80\x93 the rest of\nus lectures on Republican on Republican violence. With all due respect, I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t need to be lectured by Ted Cruz.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe added, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s just not be hypocritical. Don\xe2\x80\x99t lecture as to Donald Trump\nbut then attack Lamar Alexander. All I want is a little consistency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nChristie raises a fair point. The Senate Conservatives Fund, which Cruz has\nsupported, is committed to electing the most far-right candidates possible\nto the Senate, and in some cases, that\xe2\x80\x99s meant backing primary challenges\nto incumbent GOP senators.\n\nIn fact, Christie\xe2\x80\x99s comments cast an important light on Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s posture. If\nthe Texas Republican simply had a blanket, no-exceptions policy against\ncriticizing all Republicans in all instances \xe2\x80\x93 deferring to Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c11th\nCommandment\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 his reluctance to criticize Trump\xe2\x80\x99s anti-Mexican rhetoric\nwould at least hold true to some kind of principle.\n\nBut Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s aversion to \xe2\x80\x9cRepublican-on-Republican violence\xe2\x80\x9d is surprisingly\nselective.\n\nCruz, for example, has been willing to criticize Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on\nmore than one occasion. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, literally just last week, we learned\nthat Cruz has written a new book in which he blasts Senate Majority Leader\nMitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and the rest of his own party\xe2\x80\x99s leadership on\nCapitol Hill in a direct and unapologetic way.\n\nWhat we have, in other words, is a GOP presidential candidate who\xe2\x80\x99s more\nthan happy to make use of \xe2\x80\x9cRepublican-on-Republican violence,\xe2\x80\x9d so long as\nit suits his purposes.\n\nAnd criticizing Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s racially charged rhetoric does not,\nevidently, suit Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s purposes.\n\nIf there\xe2\x80\x99s a pattern to Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s decision making, it seems to be in the\nideological direction \xe2\x80\x93 he will criticize Republicans for not being\nconservative enough, but he won\xe2\x80\x99t criticize Republicans for being too\nconservative. Those he finds to his left deserve his scorn, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll\nrefuse to \xe2\x80\x9cthrow rocks\xe2\x80\x9d at those he finds to his right.\n\n* Update: I heard this afternoon from the Senate Conservatives Fund, which\ntook issue with some of Christie\xe2\x80\x99s specific claims. The governor said Cruz\n\xe2\x80\x9cput together\xe2\x80\x9d the SCF, which isn\xe2\x80\x99t true \xe2\x80\x93 the group existed before Cruz\nwas elected \xe2\x80\x93 though Cruz has offered support to the group.\n\nThe Senate Conservatives Fund also disputes Christie\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that the\ngroup \xe2\x80\x9cattacked\xe2\x80\x9d Lamar Alexander during his primary. Rather, the SCF\nclaims, it ran ads about Alexander and the Affordable Care Act that the\nsenator probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t like, and which happened to coincide with the\nsenator\xe2\x80\x99s primary.

Bush,\nridiculed Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s plan as politically unachievable: \xe2\x80\x9cA constitutional\namendment to change Article III of the Constitution in this fashion has\nvirtually no chance of succeeding \xe2\x80\xa6 I would think that most graduates of\nthe Harvard Law School know that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in an email to the Washington\nPost.\n\n\n\nAfter arguing against him in Bush v. Gore, Olson famously joined\nprogressive David Boies in Hollingsworth v. Perry, the case affirming the\noverturning of California\xe2\x80\x99s ban on same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\nFor his part, Cruz, who as Olson points out is a graduate of Harvard Law\nSchool, served as a law clerk for Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist from\n1996 to 1997 before eventually going on to become solicitor general of\nTexas.\n\n\n\nDespite his Ivy League education, the freshmen senator also revealed a\nbasic lack of understanding of world religions when he recently predicted\nthat the Supreme Court ruling would result in the Justice Department\ntargeting \xe2\x80\x9cJewish churches\xe2\x80\x9d that refuse to perform same-sex marriages.\n\n\n\n*CHRISTIE*\n\n\n\n*NJ Voters Tepid on Chris Christie\xe2\x80\x99s Handling of State Pension System\n<http://www.wsj.com/articles/nj-voters-tepid-on-chris-christies-handling-of-state-pension-system-1436292431>\n// WSJ // Heather Haddon \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nNearly half of New Jersey voters have an unfavorable view of one of Gov.\nChris Christie\xe2\x80\x99s signature policy achievements, the overhaul of the state\xe2\x80\x99s\nunderfunded pension system, a new poll shows.\n\n\n\nThe survey by the Monmouth University Polling Institute found 47% of the\n503 New Jersey residents polled didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe the governor had made a\nmeaningful fix to the pension system. Of those polled, 11% viewed his\nhandling of the issue as a major success and 31% found it minor.\n\n\n\nThe poll, conducted June 30 and July 1 and released Tuesday, also found\ngrowing support for the Affordable Care Act, one of President Barack\nObama\xe2\x80\x99s biggest policy initiatives. Forty-nine percent had a favorable\nopinion of the health-insurance law, the highest level in nearly two years.\nSupport split along party lines.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe past couple of weeks have been good for the president, and that is\nreflected both in his job approval rating and an uptick in support for his\nsignature health-care policy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Patrick Murray, the institute\xe2\x80\x99s\ndirector.\n\n\n\nMajority of N.J. Voters Think Chris Christie Should Step Down: Pol l (July\n2, 2015)\n\nThe survey is one of the first to gauge public opinion on pensions since\nthe New Jersey Supreme Court ruled in June that Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s moves to\ntrim contributions to the retirement system for state workers were legally\nvalid.\n\n\n\nForty-two percent of those polled disapproved of Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s decision to\nscale back on a scheduled payment into the system, while 12% approved.\nNearly half had no opinion.\n\n\n\nMr. Christie has spoken about his administration\xe2\x80\x99s 2011 pension overhaul in\npolitical events leading up to his declaration last week that he is running\nfor president. He began cutting scheduled payments into the pension system\ndue to a budget shortfall last year.\n\n\n\nWhen asked, Mr. Christie has said he would put more money into the pension\nsystem if New Jersey could afford to do so. The Republican has refused to\nraise taxes in the state, arguing that would stymie job creation.\n\n\n\nThe governor has called for unions to return to the bargaining table to\nnegotiate additional cuts to make the pension system sustainable. Talks\nhave progressed little, people involved in the negotiations said.\n\n\n\nThe administration did score a victory on Monday in a vote by a state\nhealth panel that will enable savings on health benefits to workers. The\nstate expects about $100 million in savings.\n\n\n\nThe survey also weighed opinions on New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s state senators.\nThirty-seven percent of those surveyed said they approved of the work of\nU.S. Sen. Bob Menendez and 36% disapproved, a dip from earlier surveys\nbefore the Democrat was indicted on corruption charges in April. He has\npleaded not guilty.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, 44% approved of fellow Democrat U.S. Sen.

Chris Christie\xe2\x80\x99s plans to run for president.\n\n\n\nA pair of Democratic lawmakers, state Sens. Raymond Lesniak and Loretta\nWeinberg, are likely to cosponsor legislation that would require Christie\nand future New Jersey governors to resign from office if they want to run\nfor president, according to NJ.com.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not doing the state any good by spending the bulk of his time out of\nstate,\xe2\x80\x9d Lesniak said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd even when he\xe2\x80\x99s in-state, he\xe2\x80\x99s focusing on what\nhe has to do to get elected president \xe2\x80\x94 which often runs contrary to what\nhe ought to do for the state.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe plan comes in the wake of a Monmouth University poll released a week\nago that said that 76 percent of New Jersey voters think Christie is more\nfocused on his political future than he is on New Jersey. The poll also\nfound that 57 percent want him to resign since he\xe2\x80\x99s decided to run for\npresident.\n\n\n\nStill, the proposal isn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to become law. It would need to be signed\nby Christie or have the support of enough Republicans in the Legislature to\njoin with Democrats in overriding a veto by the governor. Lesniak\nacknowledged that a major step is getting Republicans on board.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe could do this in July,\xe2\x80\x9d Lesniak said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the bigger problem is\ngetting the handful of GOP senators that we\xe2\x80\x99d probably need to override\nhim, although I think it would send a good statement regardless. And who\nknows? Maybe some Republicans would vote for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIf Christie were to resign, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno would replace him and\nthere would be a special election in 2016.\n\n\n\nChristie\xe2\x80\x99s office brushed off the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 move.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to respond to every bit of silly nonsense that comes from\nthis legislature,\xe2\x80\x9d Christie spokesman Brian Murray said in a statement to\nPOLITICO. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Governor has been clear that he is never disconnected from\ndoing his job as governor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*N.J.

A veto override would\nrequire that enough Republicans in the legislature join with Democrats,\nsomething that has never happened during Christie\'s tenure.\n\n\n\n"It\'s impossible to respond to every bit of silly nonsense that comes from\nthis legislature," Christie deputy press secretary Brian Murray said in a\nstatement. "The Governor has been clear that he is never disconnected from\ndoing his job as governor."\n\n\n\nChristie\'s team also pointed on Tuesday to his work with Democrats in the\nstate House to provide a tax break for working families, suggesting that\nthe success of his earned income tax credit proposal shows that he\'s\nremained engaged with his home state -- and with the same Democrats\nprodding him to resign -- despite his frequent out-of-state travel.\n\n\n\nAsked by NBC\'s Matt Lauer last week if he would consider resigning his\noffice during his run for president, Christie replied "I can\'t imagine I\nwould, no."\n\n\n\nChristie is struggling with poor approval ratings at home. A Monmouth\nUniversity poll last week showed a majority - 57 percent - of New Jersey\nvoters say that he should resign now that he\'s made his White House bid\nofficial.\n\n\n\n*Webb: The real deal about Chris Christie\n<http://thehill.com/opinion/david-webb/247127-david-webb-the-real-deal-about-chris-christie>\n// The Hill // David Webb \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHe\'s announced. I\xe2\x80\x99m telling it like it is.\n\n\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie officially made his bid for the GOP\nnomination \xe2\x80\x94 and eventually the White House \xe2\x80\x94 in his hometown of\nLivingston, N.J., and then he went straight to New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nThe instant pundit debate over whether Christie can win primaries and win\nover the Republican base is interesting, but no different from the debate\nover other GOP candidates. They all have their challenges, their pros and\ncons.\n\n\n\nThe town hall format is a strength, and that matters to Christie\xe2\x80\x99s campaign\nin a state like New Hampshire, where retail politics and grassroots\nengagement \xe2\x80\x94 or lack of it \xe2\x80\x94 can make or break a candidate. Christie had\ncrisscrossed the state prior to his announcement and will likely spend half\nof his time or more initially there. New Hampshire, unlike many of the\nSouthern states, has a broader representation of the general electorate\nacross the country.\n\n\n\nThe debate over the spouse of a candidate aside, clearly his wife, Mary\nPat, is an asset on the campaign trail as well. She is intelligent, warm\nand approachable. To some extent she puts a softer side on display for the\noften-brash Christie.\n\n\n\nBut the governor has a New Jersey problem. There will be a attacks based on\nthe state\xe2\x80\x99s credit downgrades, and issues over the Second Amendment, even\nabout immigration in the growth of the illegal alien population. Christie\nwill have to mount a vigorous defense and explanation based on being a\nRepublican governor in a Democrat-controlled state. The bad legacy left by\nformer governors Jim McGreevey and Jon Corzine will only matter to the\nvoters who know this legacy. The more conservative base of the Republican\nParty has questioned before and will continue to question the governor\xe2\x80\x99s\nconservative credentials.\n\n\n\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t discount a win or top-three placement in the primary for Christie\nin South Carolina, however. Sen. Lindsey Graham is not really a factor even\nin his own home state, and straight-talking politicians have appeal in the\nPalmetto State. By the time the primary arrives, if Christie is in the top\nfive, he will make a serious effort to win South Carolina.\n\n\n\nIowa has a staunch Republican base, which will be tough for Christie to win\nover, and Iowa is not as red as it\xe2\x80\x99s often portrayed, especially in the\n\ngeneral election. The big-money donors and political action committees know\nthis. A decent placement in third, or at least in the top five, in the Iowa\nprimary would keep the New Jersey governor in contention.\n\n\n\nThe money matters. Money not only allows for media campaigns and travel \xe2\x80\x94\nit also grants the ability to put teams in place in key primary states.\nAfter all, politics, once the shouting has subsided and the differences are\nhighlighted, is about the ability to mount a consistent and effective\nground game. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a question of whether someone like businessman Ken\nLangone can bundle money for Christie. He is a well-known fundraiser with a\nsignificant network. Christie has raised a lot of money, the most of any\nhead of the Republican Governors Association. That gives him access to\nmonetary and political capital. Count on him calling in these favors.\n\n\n\nWho has to attack Christie? First, those who need to draw a stark contrast.\nThe more socially conservative candidates will do this. They will attack on\nthe basis of Christie being a Northern, moderate Republican. The pushback\nfrom Christie will be that he is a pro-life Catholic. So this may be a\nwash.\n\n\n\nThe second group includes the candidates whose position he threatens.\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Donald Trump will\nhave to contend for some of the same voting block: moderate Republican and\nindependent voters. One of the defenses Christie will have against this\nwill be the fact that he worked with a Democrat-controlled legislature that\nhas a union man as president of the state Senate. Constitutional\nconservatives like myself understand that a governor has to sign what he or\nshe cannot veto.\n\n\n\nThe dread and often dead winter months will be hard for every candidate.\nPolitical fatigue will set in for even the hard-core base and many\nAmericans will turn instead to Thanksgiving, Christmas and the new year\nahead. Politicians may want to hibernate and prepare for the 2016 relaunch.\n\n\n\nSuper Tuesday is a long way away, but if Christie survives the winter\npolitical doldrums, it will become a much more exciting day. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\npolitical pundits dream, and for journalists a feeding frenzy.\n\n\n\nThe cynic in me still believes that presidential elections should begin on\nJan. 1 of the election year. But then again, like politicians, I am allowed\nto dream.\n\n\n\n*Chris Christie Administration Whistleblower To Justice Department:\nBridgegate Prosecutor May Be Compromised\n<http://www.ibtimes.com/chris-christie-administration-whistleblower-justice-department-bridgegate-prosecutor-1997095>\n// IB Times // David Sirota & Andrew Perez \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nWhen Chris Christie\xe2\x80\x99s administration quashed a grand jury\xe2\x80\x99s 43 indictments\nagainst the Republican governor\'s supporters in 2010, local prosecutor\nBennett Barlyn objected. He was soon fired. Barlyn says the move to throw\nout the Hunterdon County indictments may have violated federal law -- and\nthat ties between New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman\xe2\x80\x99s office and Gov.\nChristie may have improperly prevented a probe from moving forward.\n\n\n\nBarlyn sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Monday,\nexpressing concern that \xe2\x80\x9capparent conflicts between Governor Christie\xe2\x80\x99s\nadministration and the U.S. Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office for the District of New\nJersey ... may be compromising the latter\xe2\x80\x99s independent role relating to\nthe enforcement of federal criminal law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn February, International Business Times reported that investigators from\nFishman\xe2\x80\x99s office interviewed Barlyn about the events surrounding the\nquashed grand jury indictments. ABC News confirmed the IBTimes report. But\nFishman\xe2\x80\x99s office abruptly issued a statement appearing to clear Christie\nand declaring that no investigation was underway. Former U.S. attorneys\ninterviewed by IBTimes said such a statement pre-emptively exonerating a\npublic official is extremely unusual.\n\n\n\nBarlyn says in the letter to Lynch that this public backtracking\n\xe2\x80\x9cimmediately confirmed my suspicion that the interview was not conducted as\npart of a genuine inquiry, but was instead intended to placate me and\nforestall my efforts\xe2\x80\x9d to have the quashed indictments investigated.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department and Fishman\xe2\x80\x99s office declined to answer IBTimes\xe2\x80\x99\nquestions about Barlyn\xe2\x80\x99s letter. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s office did not respond to\nIBTimes\' requests for comment.\n\n\n\nBarlyn first contacted Fishman\xe2\x80\x99s office last year with allegations -- made\nin the past by other former employees in the Hunterdon County prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s\noffice -- that the Christie administration had illegally thrown out grand\njury indictments against supporters, including the local county Sheriff\nDeborah Trout and Undersheriff Mike Russo. Barlyn has maintained he was\nfired after raising objections and has filed a wrongful termination lawsuit.\n\n\n\nBarlyn\xe2\x80\x99s case was assigned to investigator Thomas Mahoney, who was hired by\nChristie in 2006 when Christie was New Jersey\'s U.S. attorney.\n\n\n\nDespite his ties to Christie, Mahoney was permitted to not only be the\npoint person on Barlyn\xe2\x80\x99s case but also be a \xe2\x80\x9csupervisory criminal\ninvestigator\xe2\x80\x9d on the probe of lane closures at the George Washington Bridge\nby officials at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The\n"Bridgegate" investigation generated a guilty plea and two indictments of\nformer top Christie allies, but the governor was not implicated.\n\n\n\nDuring a Bridgegate press conference in May, Fishman was asked if his\noffice faced any challenges in remaining independent. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nobody who\nwas working on this case in my office -- no lawyers working on this case in\nmy office -- who was hired by Gov. Christie,\xe2\x80\x9d Fishman said.\n\n\n\nA representative for Fishman later clarified that Mahoney had worked on the\ncase but said that \xe2\x80\x9che is not a lawyer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn fact, according to records obtained by IBTimes, roughly 40 percent of\nthe current U.S. attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office is made up of personnel hired by\nChristie.\n\n\n\nBarlyn\xe2\x80\x99s letter to Lynch is the latest incident to raise questions about\nFishman\xe2\x80\x99s independence from the governor.\n\n\n\nIn diaries released in early 2014, Hoboken\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic mayor Dawn Zimmer\nsaid she feared bringing allegations of Christie administration misdeeds to\nFishman because \xe2\x80\x9cChristie has friends throughout [the U.S.] attorney\'s\noffice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn June, Fishman\xe2\x80\x99s office requested that a federal court bar the public\nrelease of 1.5 million pages of documents obtained from the Christie\nadministration in the Bridgegate investigation.\n\n\n\nLawyers for one defendant in the case, former Port Authority official Bill\nBaroni, said Fishman\xe2\x80\x99s move to conceal the documents was designed to\nprevent the release of information they say could absolve their client and\npotentially incriminate others in the Christie administration.\n\n\n\nThe attempt to bar disclosure of evidence, Baroni\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers said, in part\nillustrates that \xe2\x80\x9csomething is afoot besides a paternalistic desire to\nprotect members of the governor\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle, alumni of this U.S.\nattorney\xe2\x80\x99s office, high-ranking Port Authority employees and others.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Governor Chris Christie: Media Should Apologize to Me for Bridgegate\n<http://newsbusters.org/blogs/randy-hall/2015/07/07/governor-chris-christie-media-should-apologize-me-bridgegate#sthash.Tju2N97O.dpuf\n//> // Newsbusters // Randy hall \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nDuring a Monday morning appearance on the MSNBC\'s Morning Joe program, New\nJersey governor Chris Christie was asked by panelist Katty Kay about his\nrole in the possible \xe2\x80\x9ccreation of a culture\xe2\x80\x9d in his administration that led\nto the Bridgegate lane closure incident, which took place in early\nSeptember of 2013.\n\n\n\nThe 2016 GOP presidential candidate responded to the obnoxious question by\ninstead calling the incident \xe2\x80\x9can exception, not the rule,\xe2\x80\x9d and stating that\npeople in the media should have stood up and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\'re sorry, governor,\nfor having jumped to conclusions;\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnot only have accused you, but\nconvicted you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe segment began with Kay asking Christie a question she undoubtedly\nwouldn\'t put to Democratic presidential front-runner and scandal-plagued\nHillary Clinton:\n\n\n\nIf you were running against yourself, wouldn\'t you say: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is somebody\nwho surrounds himself with people to whom the subliminal message is: \'We\nwill do whatever it takes to make sure that we are in the right position\npolitically, even if that means shutting down bridges?\'\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\'t necessarily want to know about it. I\'m not going to talk about it,\nbut that you allowed a culture in your office that would allow that kind of\nthing to happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nChristie replied: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\'s where the people who accuse you of doing\nsomething wrong, when they\'re disappointed and find out that you didn\'t,\nthat\'s their refuge.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember in the beginning,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cit was: \'He did this. He\ndirected it. He\'s this kind of guy.\' Then all of a sudden, you\'re not. Then\nthey say: \'OK, now what do we do?\'\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo instead of just standing up and saying what they should say, which is\n\'We\'re sorry, governor, for having jumped to conclusions; we\'re sorry for\nhaving prejudged this; we\'re sorry for having not only accused you, but\nconvicted you,\' they say: \'Oh, well, all right; now it\'s a culture.\'\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe governor continued:\n\n\n\nIt wasn\'t a culture because if it was, Katty, there would have been a lot\nof these incidents. There wouldn\'t have been 100 Democrats, elected\nDemocrats, supporting me for re-election.\n\n\n\nI wouldn\'t have gotten over a third of the Republican vote and 51 percent\nof the Hispanic vote if this was a pattern. It\'s not.\n\n\n\n"Exceptions happen; accidents, mistakes happen,\xe2\x80\x9d he stated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou still have\nto be accountable for them, but it does not mean there was a culture\nbecause if there was, there would be more than just one person in the\ngovernor\'s office. That\'s called an exception, not the rule.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe problems began on Monday, Sept. 9, 2013, when two of three eastbound\ntoll lanes on the George Washington Bridge were closed to morning rush hour\ntraffic, which was forced to use crowded state and interstate expressways\nuntil the road was re-opened the following Friday.\n\n\n\nAs NewsBusters previously reported, NBC\'s evening newscast devoted four\nminutes and 55 seconds to the \xe2\x80\x9cscandal\xe2\x80\x9d when it broke on January 8.\n\n\n\nAccording to Scott Whitlock, a senior news analyst for the Media Research\nCenter (the parent company of the NewsBusters website):\n\n\n\nIn less than 48 hours, ABC, CBS and NBC deluged viewers with coverage of\nChris Christie\'s traffic jam scandal, devoting a staggering 88 minutes to\nthe story.\n\n\n\nIn comparison, these same news outlets over the last six months have\nallowed a scant two minutes for the latest on Barack Obama\'s Internal\nRevenue Service scandal. The disparity in less than two days is 44 to one.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Wednesday through Friday morning, the latest on Christie\'s\nTraffic-Gate led 11 out of 13 news programs,\xe2\x80\x9d Whitlock noted. \xe2\x80\x9cNBC produced\nthe heaviest coverage, over 34 minutes. CBS followed close behind with more\nthan 30 minutes. ABC came in third with just under 23 minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHowever, when the Republican governor was cleared of any wrongdoing in the\nmatter, \xe2\x80\x9cABC and CBS  punted on the story and didn\'t cover it in their\nThursday night newscasts,\xe2\x80\x9d MRC news analyst Curtis Houck reported.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNBC Nightly News did cover the story, however, but only in the form of a\nnews brief that lasted for 38 seconds,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in which then-anchor\nBrian Williams stated:\n\n\n\nA major headline this evening in the federal investigation into New Jersey\ngovernor Chris Christie and his administration.\n\n\n\nFederal officials tell NBC News that, after nine months, investigators have\nconcluded there is no evidence that governor Christie had advance knowledge\nof any politically motivated scheme to shut down lanes on the George\nWashington Bridge, which is the world\'s busiest span.\n\n\n\nIt wouldn\'t be wise for Christie to hold his breath while waiting for an\napology from the people who used the incident to attack his popularity or\nhoping the press would pose a similar question to Hillary Clinton. There\nisn\'t a shade of purple deep enough to match the color of his face if he\ntried.\n\n\n\n*Why Chris Christie may have an edge in GOP race\n<http://www.cnbc.com/id/102815333> // CNBC // Mark Macias \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nDonald Trump just might be the second best thing that happened to New\nJersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n\n\n\nChristie recently announced he\'s running for president in 2016. Much of\nAmerica might not know it yet, but if you live in New York or New Jersey\nand watch the local news, you know that Christie has an explosive\ntemperament. You either love his brutal honesty or hate his bullying\nnature, but regardless of where you sit on the political couch, Christie\'s\nmouth can make any ear blush.\n\n\n\nFor the past 6 years, Christie has owned the local political show as the\nonly governor in the Tri-State area to speak his mind without reverence for\ndiplomacy or political correctness. He called a Navy Seal an "idiot" when\nhe challenged the governor publicly. When a teacher asked him why he said\ntheir schools and teachers were failing, Christie responded: "Because they\nare... I am tired of you people." And when another teacher questioned why\nshe wasn\'t paid fairly, Christie was brutally honest: "Well you know what?\nThen you don\'t have to do it."\n\n\n\nBut now, there is a new controversial presidential candidate who is already\novershadowing Christie. With Trump in the race, Christie suddenly seems\nmore palatable.\n\n\n\nEven the "Bridgegate" scandal, which accused Christie\'s administration of\nclosing the George Washington Bridge in retaliation to a local mayor, seems\nlike a school yard tussle compared to Trump and his fight with Macy\'s,\nUnivision, NBC, Mexico, China, etc.\n\n\n\nBut will that palatable perception last? Or better yet, will voters in Iowa\nbuy it?\n\n\n\nIf I were consulting Christie, I would say, as long as he can bite his\ntongue and control his temper between now and New Hampshire, he just might\nhave the political chops and finesse to charm his way with voters. Christie\nknows that deep, down inside, he can\'t be constantly combative if he\'s\ngoing to convince voters he should be in control of the nuclear button.\nHe\'s also smart enough to know he has to be good and liked if he is going\nto win the nomination.\n\n\n\nChristie is off to a great start by surrounding himself with smart\nstrategists who understand how the media works. Immediately after his\npresidential announcement, Christie did an interview with NBC\'s Matt Lauer,\nwhere he repositioned his temper as passion.\n\n\n\n"I\'m angry about the fact that taxpayers were being ripped off in New\nJersey," Christie told Lauer. "I\'m angry about the fact that our urban kids\ncan\'t get a good education. I\'m angry about those things \xe2\x80\x94 you\'re darn\nright I am. And I think America wants someone who\'s willing to fight for\nthat."\n\n\n\nBrilliant PR move: The sooner you address your point of weakness, the less\npersuasive your opponents sound. The person who tells the story first is in\nbetter control of the narrative. Christie didn\'t avoid the tough\naccusations like other presidential candidates have done. Instead, he\naddressed it straight on and unabashedly.\n\n\n\nNow, whether conservative voters buy into Christie\'s more moderate\npositions is another issue. He faces the same challenge that Rudy Giuliani\nhad when he ran for president in 2008: He\'s a moderate on social issues\nthat are crucial to the conservative base.\n\n\n\nSo, if Trump is the second-best thing to happen to Christie, what\'s the\nfirst? All of the other 13 GOP contenders combined.\n\n\n\nPublicity is difficult in any crowded field because it\'s harder to stand\nout from the pack. When smart phones first hit the market, it was easy to\nget publicity for mobile apps because they were rare. Today, the market for\nmobile apps is saturated, making it more difficult to get your story told.\nIt\'s the same for the GOP candidates. Fiorina, Carson, Graham, Pataki,\nPaul, Perry \xe2\x80\x94 for the typical voter, those names run together like a\nJindal, I mean jingle. This is where Christie will shine.\n\n\n\nHe understands, like Trump, how to move the media needle. He has governed a\nbig state, like Jeb Bush and Rick Perry. He has big donors behind him, like\nMarco Rubio. But unlike those other candidates \xe2\x80\x94 Trump, Bush, Perry and\nRubio - Christie doesn\'t have their baggage. No one will question\nChristie\'s bravado and experience against Rubio. Christie seems less\nvolatile than Trump, who seems to threaten a new company every day on the\ncampaign trail. Sure, Perry was the longest-running governor of Texas and\nBush was governor of a swing state, but Christie was elected governor twice\nin a blue state.\n\n\n\nBut much of the minutiae will be lost in the crowded presidential debates.\nWhen you have 10 candidates on one stage trying to explain a position in\nunder 90 seconds, the only thing voters will remember is how the candidates\ncame across. And who can forget how Christie comes across.\n\n\n\nAs long as Christie can be direct and respectful, he just might have a\nwinning edge to the nomination, assuming he can win over the conservative\nbase.\n\n\n\n*GRAHAM*\n\n\n\n*Lindsey Graham Protests \'Brad Pitt\' Debate\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-07/lindsey-graham-protests-brad-pitt-debate>\n// Bloomberg // Ben Brody \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Lindsey Graham is launching a protest of\nthe "Brad Pitt" debate.\n\n\n\nIn an e-mail Tuesday, the South Carolina senator urged supporters to sign a\npetition protesting the terms of an Aug.  6 debate, the first scheduled\nfaceoff among the Republican presidential contenders.

Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) pressed Secretary of Defense\nAshton Carter to admit that the Obama administration is not committed to\ndeposing Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to Assad, what\xe2\x80\x99s more likely?\xe2\x80\x9d Graham mused. \xe2\x80\x9cPresident Obama leaves\noffice in 2017, or Assad goes first?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUh, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s certain that President Obama will leave then, so that\xe2\x80\x99s an\neasy question,\xe2\x80\x9d Carter said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt ends up turning on whether Assad will be\nin power then.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, well I know that,\xe2\x80\x9d Graham chuckled.\n\n\n\nThe senator repeated his question: \xe2\x80\x9cWho leaves first, Obama or Assad?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I certainly hope it\xe2\x80\x99s Assad,\xe2\x80\x9d Carter answered.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah I do, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so,\xe2\x80\x9d Graham said.\n\n\n\nThe exchange occurred during Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s hearing on U.S. involvement in the\nMiddle East before the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\n\n\nObama administration officials insisted as early as 2011 that Assad must\ngo, but have since done very little to effect a change of power in\nDamascus, even after the Syrian regime murdered thousands of its citizens\nwith weapons of mass destruction in 2013.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama repeated Monday that the Syrian civil war would only end if\nthere is \xe2\x80\x9ca new government without Bashar Assad,\xe2\x80\x9d but so far he has\nforbidden the U.S. military from targeting Syrian government forces in\nairstrikes as part of Operation Inherent Resolve.\n\n\n\nCarter told Graham that the United States is committed to finding \xe2\x80\x9ca\npolitical exit for Assad.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Syrian Civil War has killed more than 310,000 people in four years,\naccording to the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights.\n\n\n\n*Lindsey Graham campaign joins Fiorina in attacking Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s CNN\nInterview: Clinton has \xe2\x80\x98selective hearing and memory\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/07/lindsey-graham-campaign-joins-fiorina-in-attacking-clintons-cnn-interview-clinton-has-selective-hearing-and-memory/>\n// Breitbart // Alex Swoyer \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nGOP presidential candidate Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) campaign joined\nfellow GOP candidate Carly Fiorina in response to Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s long\nawaited formal sit down interview, which the Democratic frontrunner gave to\nCNN.\n\n\n\nThis was the first national broadcast interview Clinton has given since\nformally announcing her campaign.\n\n\n\nChristian Ferry, Graham\xe2\x80\x99s campaign manager, told Breitbart News, \xe2\x80\x9cHillary\nClinton clearly has selective hearing and memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFerry continued, \xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to recall that Sen. Lindsey Graham\n(R-SC)47%\n\nhas been fighting to secure our border and fix our broken immigration\nsystem for the last decade.  This is no surprise considering that she still\nbelieves the national security policy she helped implement with Barack\nObama has made the world and our country safer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFerry\xe2\x80\x99s statement mirrors the criticism Fiorina made when she posted on\nFacebook that CNN didn\xe2\x80\x99t question Clinton on her track record as Secretary\nof State.\n\n\n\n*HUCKABEE*\n\n\n\n*Huckabee blasts Obama, \xe2\x80\x98Still in denial about the threats we face\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/07/huckabee-blasts-obama-still-in-denial-about-the-threat-we-face/>\n// Breitbart // Alex Swoyer \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nGOP presidential candidate Gov. Mike Huckabee says President Obama is in\ndenial about ISIS following his statements on the terrorist organization.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresident Obama is still in denial about the threat we face from ISIS. The\nPresident admitted that ISIS is filling a \xe2\x80\x98void\xe2\x80\x99 in the region, but failed\nto mention why the void exists in the first place: The Obama Administration\nrefused to leave a residual force in Iraq and then dismissed ISIS as a\n\xe2\x80\x98jayvee team,\'\xe2\x80\x9d Huckabee stated.\n\n\n\nThe presidential candidate added Obama continues to call the terrorists\n\xe2\x80\x9cviolent extremists\xe2\x80\x9d and not identify them by their ideology \xe2\x80\x93 radical\nIslam.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is about as intellectually dishonest as it gets from Washington.\nJihadists are slaughtering civilians by the tens of thousands and would\nkill millions if they could,\xe2\x80\x9d Huckabee added.\n\n\n\nHe concluded:\n\n\n\nThere was nothing new in President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s glorified photo-op at the\nPentagon.  The Obama Administration promised to train 5,400 moderate rebels\nper year to fight ISIS.  Yet less than 100 are being trained.  What will it\ntake for President Obama to abandon his weak, incremental escalation in the\nMiddle East and finally take the fight to ISIS?\n\n\n\n*CARSON*\n\n\n\n*Ben Carson\'s godly riches\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/ben-carsons-godly-riches-119784.html>\n// Politico // Tarini Parti \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nBefore Ben Carson was vying for votes from members of Christian\norganizations, he was charging them tens of thousands of dollars \xe2\x80\x94 in some\ncases even more than he charged groups with no religious ties \xe2\x80\x94 for\nspeeches.\n\n\n\nCarson, now a GOP presidential candidate, brought in nearly $2 million\ndelivering inspirational speeches to faith-based groups like Christian high\nschools and pregnancy centers in 2014. Of his five most expensive speeches,\nfour of them were for Christian entities, a POLITICO analysis of his\nfinancial disclosure form shows.\n\n\n\nBilled by the Washington Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau as an \xe2\x80\x9cinspiring storyteller\xe2\x80\x9d who\nis \xe2\x80\x9csoft-spoken yet charismatic\xe2\x80\x9d and capable of \xe2\x80\x9ccommanding the stage,\xe2\x80\x9d\nCarson\xe2\x80\x99s speaking fees varied widely, from $12,320 to $48,500.\n\n\n\nLast August, Hope Pregnancy Center in College Station, Texas, was one of\nthe organizations that doled out $40,500 \xe2\x80\x94 close to Carson\xe2\x80\x99s highest\nspeaking fee \xe2\x80\x94 for the neurosurgeon-turned-author to speak at a fundraiser\nand attend a private, 45-minute reception with donors beforehand. The\nfaith-based, pro-life organization works with women with unplanned\npregnancies.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe called the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s bureau and we were told that number,\xe2\x80\x9d explained\nTracy Frank, executive director of the center. \xe2\x80\x9cWashington Speakers Bureau\ndictated the terms \xe2\x80\xa6 We\xe2\x80\x99re not that sophisticated and stuff. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\ncry if you\xe2\x80\x99re telling me he did others for a lot less.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nCarson gave 115 speeches for lower amounts in 2014 alone.\n\n\n\nFrank said she didn\xe2\x80\x99t negotiate with the Washington Speakers Bureau because\nof Carson\xe2\x80\x99s popularity. The fundraiser brought in a net profit of $150,000.\nFrank \xe2\x80\x94 along with other organizers of several other events \xe2\x80\x94 said Carson\nwas paid more than past speakers, but they were able to make a significant\nnet profit because they drew a bigger audience or were able to charge more\nfor tickets.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was probably higher than we\xe2\x80\x99ve paid before,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut then\nagain, we wanted Phil Robertson from \xe2\x80\x98Duck Dynasty,\xe2\x80\x99 and he was far more\nexpensive.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRon Wade, executive director of HopeWorks Inc. \xe2\x80\x93 a Tennessee-based\nChristian group that seeks to help the poor and homeless and paid Carson\n$24,500 for a fundraiser last year \xe2\x80\x94 said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if he was being\ncharged more or less than other organizations. But he said he was willing\nto pay the speaking fees without much negotiation because it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to find\nappropriate speakers who can draw a crowd.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so difficult to be popular and also meet the mission,\xe2\x80\x9d Wade said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe just go with what we can get. He did a really good job for us in\nbringing in people who may not have known about HopeWorks. It would be\ngreat if he and other speakers would say, \xe2\x80\x98HopeWorks is great, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll do\nit for free.\xe2\x80\x99 But most people don\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOverall, Carson reported earning $4 million in speaking fees in 2014. In\naddition to the fees, he earned between $1 million and $6 million in book\nroyalties in the same year, his disclosures show.\n\n\n\nThe Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau did not respond to requests for comment\non how the fees were determined. The bureau has taken down Carson\xe2\x80\x99s bio \xe2\x80\x94\nwhich said, \xe2\x80\x9cBen Carson\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable journey from tough, inner-city youth\nto history-making neurosurgeon celebrates and illustrates the power we all\nhave to excel and influence others\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 now that Carson is on the campaign\ntrail.\n\n\n\nCarson\xe2\x80\x99s campaign also declined to comment, saying that it had included\neverything that was legally required in the financial disclosures.\n\n\n\nCarson has written six best-selling books, including \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica the\nBeautiful: Rediscovering What Made This Nation Great\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cOne Nation: What We\nCan All Do to Save America\xe2\x80\x99s Future\xe2\x80\x9d; and \xe2\x80\x9cOne Vote: Make Your Voice\nHeard.\xe2\x80\x9d In speeches, he often draws from his books along with the TNT movie\n\xe2\x80\x9cGifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story,\xe2\x80\x9d which chronicles his life and stars\nOscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr.\n\n\n\nCarson\xe2\x80\x99s popularity among Christian crowds is part of how a doctor with no\npolitical experience has been able to gain more traction in Iowa than many\nbetter-credentialed contenders, such as former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee\nand former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who are vying for the same\nevangelical supporters.\n\n\n\nAlthough there was already a movement underway to draft Carson to run for\npresident, nonprofit leaders who hired him for speeches last year said he\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t overtly political and focused more on his life story and the \xe2\x80\x9cmoral\nclimate\xe2\x80\x9d of the country.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a call for our people to pray more and seek God\xe2\x80\x99s guidance for\nleadership for our country,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gary Moore, senior associate pastor for\nthe Second Baptist Church, of Carson\xe2\x80\x99s speech at the Houston church\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cIf\nMy People\xe2\x80\x9d conference.\n\n\n\nBut occasionally, based on some video clips and media reports of the\nspeeches, Carson commented on how conservatives have been silenced for\ntheir views on social issues. \xe2\x80\x9cI think political correctness is one of the\nworst things that we ever brought to America,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a speech for the\nFamily Foundation of Virginia. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here we are allowing it to be\nreintroduced through the back door as a good thing. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a good thing.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s an evil thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you believe in traditional marriage, then you\xe2\x80\x99re a homophobe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\nin the same speech, for which he was paid $32,000. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you believe in life,\nthen you\xe2\x80\x99re anti-woman. If you\xe2\x80\x99re white and you oppose a progressive black\nperson, you\xe2\x80\x99re a racist. If you\xe2\x80\x99re black and you oppose a progressive\nagenda, you\xe2\x80\x99re crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDuring another speech at the University of Cumberlands last April, Carson\nmore directly discussed his potential White House bid, according to a\nvideo: \xe2\x80\x9cI do realize that our country is in a lot of trouble. One of the\nbiggest challenges that our country faces is our national debt, which is\n$17.5 trillion. Most people cannot comprehend this amount. Hopefully\nsomeone will come along who really catches fire and really understands the\nConstitution and understands freedom \xe2\x80\xa6 If that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, I would have\nto give serious consideration to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut more than expressing his views on social and political issues, the paid\nspeeches were a chance for Carson to share his life story with large\naudiences ahead of his announcement, and pick up supporters who could\neasily connect to it, like HopeWorks\xe2\x80\x99 Wade, who brought Carson to Cordova,\nTennessee, for an event titled, \xe2\x80\x9cA Morning of Hope with Ben Carson.\xe2\x80\x9d The\nevent cost $60 per ticket.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s so authentic,\xe2\x80\x9d Wade said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe impressed me. If he is still in the\nRepublican primary when Tennessee votes, I would vote for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*A Movie Was Once Made About Ben Carson (And It May Be Helping Him)\n<http://dailycaller.com/2015/07/08/a-movie-was-once-made-about-ben-carson-and-it-may-be-helping-him/>\n// The Daily Caller // Alex Pappas \xe2\x80\x93 July 8, 2015 *\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s too much God in it,\xe2\x80\x9d Ben Carson remembers someone telling him.\n\n\n\nFilming had already started on the TNT movie about his life, \xe2\x80\x9cGifted Hands:\nThe Ben Carson Story,\xe2\x80\x9d when one of the major sponsors suggested toning down\nsome parts about his Christian faith. There were concerns about alienating\na general audience.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just said, \xe2\x80\x98No problem, you can take it out,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Carson recalled in a\nrecent interview with The Daily Caller. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But take me out too, because it\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be about me.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then they backed off.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBased on his 1996 autobiography with the same title, the uplifting TV movie\ntells the story of Carson\xe2\x80\x99s path from inner-city Detroit to the Johns\nHopkins operating table, where he first successfully separated twins\nconjoined at the head.\n\n\n\nThe 2009 movie has helped make Carson, now running as an outsider for the\nRepublican nomination for president, famous: it has played in schools,\nchurches and on the Black Entertainment Television network (BET). Hundreds\nof thousands of DVDs have been sold. It streams on Netflix.\n\n\n\nIt could also help explain in part why Carson, who has never run for\noffice, is polling in second-place in evangelical-heavy Iowa and in third\nplace nationally, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average.\n\n\n\nBefore the movie deal was inked, Carson said he talked with as many as 15\ndifferent production companies. He wanted to make sure the film stayed true\nto life and didn\xe2\x80\x99t take artistic liberties.\n\n\n\nCarson was finally satisfied: \xe2\x80\x9cTNT and Sony said they would do it\naccurately, and that they would consult with me in the process.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt turned out to be a two-edged sword, because they were always calling\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d Carson said with a laugh.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with TheDC, Dan Angel, the executive producer of Gifted\nHands, said he made a promise to Carson. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to tell your story\nfrom beginning to end and tell the truth. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to add anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nCarson was active during production: Angel said he visited the set in\nDetroit, spending time with actor Cuba Gooding Jr., who played him.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would be there every step of the way whenever we needed to talk to him\nabout reality checks,\xe2\x80\x9d Angel said of Carson. \xe2\x80\x9cWe would have Cuba Gooding\nJr. on the phone with him. And he gave complete access to his life, which\nis really important.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGooding, through agent Adam Schweitzer, declined to be interviewed.\n\n\n\nBut in a 2009 appearance on CBS, the actor praised Carson. \xe2\x80\x9cI always say\nabout men like this: they\xe2\x80\x99re like God\xe2\x80\x99s tool,\xe2\x80\x9d Gooding said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s really\ngiven him a gift and he\xe2\x80\x99s touched so many people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nCarson says he was satisfied with the finished product. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought they did\na spectacular job. Cuba came and spent a couple days with me. He got a\nchance to sort of see how I talk and how I act.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean the idea that this amazing mom growing up in Detroit could raise\ntwo boys in the worst of conditions of poverty \xe2\x80\x94 you can imagine what the\nconditions were in the poorest town in America \xe2\x80\x94 and you would have any\nshot at coming out successful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Angel, the executive producer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\nthe ultimate beating the odds story.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nCarson said his mother, Sonya Carson, also spoke with the filmmakers. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\nhad a number of conversations on the phone with Kimberly Elise, who plays\nher,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nHis mother remains in his life today, but her health has been declining.\n\n\n\nHours before Carson announced his entry into the presidential race this\nsummer, he got a call that his mom, who has Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s, was no longer\neating or drinking.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey basically just said, \xe2\x80\x98this is the end,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d a soft-spoken Carson said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake her home. And let her die there. That\xe2\x80\x99s news I got the day before the\nannouncement.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn what Carson thought might be their final goodbye, his family rushed to\nher bedside. His wife, Candy, played the violin while his kids were singing\nand reading verses from the Bible. Carson said supporters told him they\nwere praying for her.\n\n\n\nAnd to everyone\xe2\x80\x99s surprise, she got better.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe just all of a sudden bloomed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe blossomed. And she was\nback, and she was better than she was before.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAs for the film, Carson said his mother was satisfied with how it turned\nout, even as it showed difficult times for her, including her bouts with\ndepression.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, it takes a lot to make her happy,\xe2\x80\x9d Carson said with a\nlaugh. \xe2\x80\x9cIt says a lot for Kimberly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe film won a $100,000 Epiphany Prize for \xe2\x80\x9cmost inspiring movie of 2009,\xe2\x80\x9d\nbut not all the reviews were pretty.\n\n\n\n*Ben Carson signs \xe2\x80\x98no new tax\xe2\x80\x99 pledge, visits New Hampshire\n<http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/7/ben-carson-pledges-no-new-tax-visits-new-hampshire/>\n// The Washington Times // Seth McLaughlin \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nVowing to crack down on the free-spending ways of Washington, Ben Carson\nsigned a \xe2\x80\x9cno new tax\xe2\x80\x9d pledge here Tuesday as part a two-day swing through\nthe first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nBuoyed by solid fundraising and strong poll numbers, Mr. Carson is working\nto broaden his appeal beyond the grassroots activists that helped to compel\nthe retired neurosurgeon to run for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tax pledge is the least I can do,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Carson told The Washington\nTimes. \xe2\x80\x9cI would go much further than saying I am not going to raise taxes.\nI think we need to reform the system completely \xe2\x80\x94 make it truly fair, with\nliberty and justice for everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Carson called for a \xe2\x80\x9cproportional tax\xe2\x80\x9d of somewhere between 10 percent\nand 15 percent on individual and corporate income, and for the elimination\nof all tax deductions, including the cherished mortgage-interest and\ncharity-donation deductions.\n\n\n\nThe 63-year-old also came out against \xe2\x80\x9csanctuary cities\xe2\x80\x9d that refuse to\ncooperate with federal deportation efforts on immigration, following the\nslaying of a San Francisco woman, with which an illegal immigrant who had\nbeen deported five times has been charged.\n\n\n\nVoters in the early primary states are being pulled in various directions\nbecause of the sheer size of the GOP field.\n\n\n\nThat was a clear reminder of that Tuesday after Mr. Carson and former\nHewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina crossed paths on the streets of downtown\nPortsmouth. Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana also traveled through the state\non Tuesday.\n\n\n\nPolls show Mr. Carson, who has never held political office, is running\nthird nationally behind former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Gov. Scott Walker\nof Wisconsin. He is tied for second in Iowa, which kicks off the nomination\nrace, and is running in the middle of the pack in New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nThe Carson campaign announced earlier this month that it had pulled in $8.3\nmillion in its opening quarter and more than $10 million since he launched\nhis exploratory committee in early March.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have easily what we need to run our campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Carson said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\npundits early on said it would be impossible for us to mount a national\ncampaign since we weren\xe2\x80\x99t connected to the big money and we are doing just\nfine because they forgot about one very important thing \xe2\x80\x94 the people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Carson and his wife, Candy, celebrated his 40th wedding anniversary in\nnearby Nashua on Monday and followed that up Tuesday with five separate\nstops across the state.\n\n\n\nMr. Carson cast himself as an Washington outsider and drove home the idea\nthat he is taking the same fact-based approach to policy as he did in the\noperating room, where he became renowned for separating conjoined twins.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are a lot of people who have been in Washington for decades,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you would really want them to tie your shoe.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Carson said he opposed Obamacare, and said that he would push for\nhealth savings accounts, as well as the ability for people to purchase\ninsurance across state lines.\n\n\n\nAsked about Social Security, he advocated for gradually raising the\nretirement age over time and said that he would offer a tax credit in\nexchange for people choosing to opt out of the program.\n\n\n\nOn immigration, he said he would seal the border and provide guest-worker\npermits to illegal immigrants, as long as the paid back taxes.\n\n\n\nHe said Congress should pass laws protecting religious freedom in the wake\nof the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling in favor of same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\nGinny Hooker, 60, of Pittsfield, said she is open to voting for Mr. Carson.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would consider. It is still too early, but I think he will do well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms.\nHooker said, adding that she likes how he comes across as a genuine person.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople can relate to him. He feels like he is someone who is easy to\napproach.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBarry Heller, 66, of Merrimack, said Mr. Carson has good ideas, but comes\noff flat on the stump.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis biggest shortcoming is he is not as dynamic a speaker as a lot of the\nothers,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Heller said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe needs to be a better speaker to get the\nmessage across.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Ben Carson Has Sold More Copies Of His Book Than Every Other 2016\nRepublican Combined \xe2\x80\x94 By A Lot\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/ben-carson-has-sold-more-copies-of-his-book-than-every-other#.oq3pYnB3M>\n// Buzzfeed // McKay Coppins \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nThe Iowa caucuses are still months away, but one presidential hopeful has\nalready pulled far ahead in the 2016 conservative book sales primary: Dr.\nBen Carson.\n\nCarson\xe2\x80\x99s book, One Nation: What We Can All Do To Save America\xe2\x80\x99s Future, has\nsold a whopping 362,813 hardcover copies to date, according to Nielsen\nBookScan, a service that tracks most bookstore sales.\n\n\n\nTo compare: If you take the combined hardcover sales of every other book\nwritten by a current Republican presidential contender since 2010 and add\nthem together, you only get 252,177.\n\n\n\nCarson\xe2\x80\x99s dominance as an author has not necessarily translated to\nfrontrunner status in the GOP presidential primaries, where he generally\npolls among the top cluster of candidates \xe2\x80\x94 at around 10% \xe2\x80\x94 but has not\npulled away from the pack.\n\n\n\nThe book\xe2\x80\x99s success does, however, illustrate how Carson\xe2\x80\x99s specialized brand\nof charisma, emphasis on personal biography, and proud defiance of\npolitical correctness appeals to the book-buying masses of the Republican\nbase.\n\n\n\nIt also comes at a moment when the conservative publishing industry has\ngrown so large, and competitive, that many on the right fear it\xe2\x80\x99s\nunsustainable. BuzzFeed News explored this phenomenon last year, in part,\nby examining the quadrennial rush to put out campaign manifestos by\nprospective presidential candidates.

Others in the crowd\nat Geno\'s Chowder & Sandwich Shop in Portsmouth cracked the same joke.\n\n\n\nFiorina also teed up on it. \xe2\x80\x9cLadies and gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d she began her remarks,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to rope off the press.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign says the rope was necessary in order to allow people\nalong the route to meet and chat with the candidate.\n\n\n\nFiorina, who regularly criticizes Clinton and presents herself as the ideal\nRepublican to take Clinton on in the general election, said she remains\naccessible to the press and has answered more than 600 questions since her\nfailed bid for U.S. Senate in California in 2010.\n\n\n\nFiorina, the former chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard, is running\nas a Washington outsider. She is on a week-long campaign swing through New\nHampshire.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton cannot be President of these United States because she\xe2\x80\x99s\nnot trustworthy,\xe2\x80\x9d Fiorina said in Portsmouth. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not transparent.\nDespite her many titles, she lacks a track record of leadership, and the\npolicies she is pursuing are doubling down on every failed policy of the\nObama administration from the last seven years.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFiorina continued to take aim at the \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional political class.\xe2\x80\x9d She\nalso dismissed billionaire businessman Donald J. Trump for his comments on\nMexican illegal immigrants.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonald Trump is what he has always been -- a tireless self-promoter,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid in response to a reporter\xe2\x80\x99s question. \xe2\x80\x9cSo he\xe2\x80\x99s going to say lots of\noutrageous things as he always has. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t represent me and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nrepresent my party.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn speaking to the audience at Geno\xe2\x80\x99s, which opened early for the occasion,\nsaid immigration reform takes money, manpower and political will power. She\nsupports strengthening the nation\xe2\x80\x99s borders, but also said America must\nprioritize some basic steps, like fixing a broken employer verification\nsystem to ensure workers are legal.\n\n\n\nFiorina proposed cutting back on federal bureaucracy, rebuilding America\xe2\x80\x99s\nmilitary, and repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with a\nfree-market, states-based solution, in which states manage high-risk pools.\n\n\n\nOne man asked her how she was answer the press when questioned on how she\nwas \xe2\x80\x9cseparated\xe2\x80\x9d from Hewlett-Packard. \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98separated\xe2\x80\x99 from HP, ok, I\nwas fired,\xe2\x80\x9d Fiorina responded. She said she\xe2\x80\x99s proud of her record, and that\nshe was challenging the status quo at her former company during a time of\ngreat upheaval in the tech world. She said other leaders -- citing Steve\nJobs -- were fired for taking similar stands.\n\n\n\nFiorina said she has more endorsements in New Hampshire than any other\ncandidate and is working a grassroots campaign to boost her standing in the\nfirst-in-the-nation primary state. She said that her name recognition was\nless than 4 percent when she started the campaign. And since that \xe2\x80\x9cstanding\nstart\xe2\x80\x9d on May 4, she has raised $1.4 million toward the presidential\nprimary election.\n\n\n\nAsked if she is now a top-tier candidate, Fiorina said it depends on how\none defines it. But, she quickly added, she will be on the debate stage\nwhen Fox News and Facebook host the first televised GOP presidential debate\nAug. 6. In a critical move, Fox News will limit the entry criteria to the\ntop 10 candidates, based on five recent national public opinion polls.\n\n\n\n*JINDAL*\n\n\n\n*Bobby Jindal mocked for posing with gun at campaign stop\n<http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/bobby-jindal-mocked-for-posing-with-gun-at-campaign-stop/articleshow/47983579.cms>\n// The Economic Times \xe2\x80\x93 July 8, 2015 *\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal has been mocked on Twitter\nfor posting a photo of himself holding and admiring a weapon while at a\ncampaign stop in Iowa last week.\n\n\n\n"My kind of campaign stop; Capital Armament in Sibley," read the photo\ncaption of Louisiana\'s Indian-American governor, inviting mocking comments,\naccording to Atlanta Journal Constitution newspaper.\n\n\n\nThe company\'s Facebook page describes CapArms as a veteran-owned company\nthat manufactures ammunition firearms and smokeless gunpowder.\n\n\n\nA commentator accused Jindal, a strong supporter of gun ownership rights\nwho has signed several pro-gun rights bills into law in his state, of\npandering to constituents and calling him a poser.\n\n\n\nAnother called it Jindal\'s Dukakis moment, referencing the 1988 campaign\nphoto of Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis riding in a\ntank.\n\n\n\nPolitico, an influential Washington newssite, referred to that image as one\nof the "worst campaign backfires in history.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Bobby Jindal: Sanders and Clinton Would Both Turn Us Into Greece\n<http://time.com/3947747/bobby-jindal-greece-debt/> // TIME // Bobby Jindal\n\xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nGreece created democracy, and now the Greeks are showing us how to kill it.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s simple math to understand what is happening in Greece right now. When\nGreece joined the euro, it benefited from the financial support of its more\nfiscally responsible neighbors in the euro zone. Rather than taking the\nopportunity to enact the structural reforms that could have increased\ngrowth \xe2\x80\x94 reforms that it still has not undertaken \xe2\x80\x94 Greece instead went on\na spending spree funded by other people\xe2\x80\x99s money.\n\n\n\nGreece has been cooking the books with complicated financial instruments\nfor years. But the problems don\xe2\x80\x99t stop there. Greece\xe2\x80\x99s Rubik\xe2\x80\x99s Cube tax\ncode and rampant corruption make tax evasion widespread. Golden parachute\npublic pensions that allow public sector workers to retire as early as 45\ndrain dollars out of the government coffers while incentivizing a still\nhealthy and work-age workforce to live on the public dime. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to\nhave sufficient tax paying workers when about 75% of Greek public-sector\nemployees retire by the age 61.\n\n\n\nAfter taking office in January, the Alexis Tsipras administration reversed\npromised privatization of state-owned assets like the Port of Piraeus. In\n2011, the IMF predicted Greece could bring in 50 billion euros ($56\nbillion) from the sale of state assets, not to mention the savings from\nmoving those employees off the public wage and benefit system. To date, it\nhas raised about 3 billion euros.\n\n\n\nBusiness has no interest in creating jobs when crushed by government\nregulation. Tspiras promised to raise the minimum wage, despite the economy\nspiraling out of control. It\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising the March unemployment rate\nstood at 25.6%.\n\n\n\nThis is the European nightmare. The way of Greece is where Hillary Clinton\nand Bernie Sanders will take us. It\xe2\x80\x99s simple math: You can\xe2\x80\x99t spend more\nthan you take in. You can\xe2\x80\x99t make it impossible for business to thrive and\nexpect the economy to grow. No wonder the U.S. has had a disappointing\nabout 2% \xe2\x80\x9crecovery\xe2\x80\x9d growth. That\xe2\x80\x99s not an accident\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s the result of\nfailed policies.\n\n\n\nClinton and Sanders are math deniers, like most of the Democrats in D.C.\nThey want to grow the government economy instead of the real American\neconomy. Rather than pursuing tax reform to improve growth or entitlement\nchanges to reduce future expenditures, Clinton and Sanders are focused on\nspending trillions on Obamacare, giving free college to everyone, and\nraising the federal minimum wage.\n\n\n\nThis was all on plain view in New Hampshire this past weekend, where\nClinton spent the weekend promoting a third term of President Barack\nObama\xe2\x80\x99s failed policies. The irony is that her dishonesty and lack of\ntransparency is a windfall for Sanders.\n\n\n\nSanders is rising in the polls. Why? Because he\xe2\x80\x99s honest. He freely admits\nthat he believes in socialism, and Democrats are flocking to the only\nhonest candidate running on their side. Sanders should write Clinton a\nthank you note.\n\n\n\nSanders may be saying what Clinton will not say, but the reality is they\xe2\x80\x99re\nboth socialists. And if you want a peek into our future with Clinton or\nSanders, then look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Greece today. Sanders proudly\nsaid on Sunday that he wants to raise taxes.\n\n\n\nSanders and Clinton seem to believe prosperity lies in the hands of\ngovernment. We know it lies in the hands of our people.\n\n\n\nWe have to stop pretending. Greece pretended that debt didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter for\nyears. It pretended it could spend money it didn\xe2\x80\x99t have. It pretended that\nthere was some mythical pot of money in Athens that didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist. It\npretended that 1+1 didn\xe2\x80\x99t equal 2.\n\n\n\nThe politicians in Puerto Rico are no different. They are demanding that we\nchange U.S. laws so that they can file for bankruptcy. They are even\nthreatening to sway the presidential election in order to force candidates\nto agree with them. These are the same politicians that led the country to\nbankruptcy. Everyone knows exactly what is going on here \xe2\x80\x94 they are asking\nthe U.S. taxpayers to pay for a bailout. That\xe2\x80\x99s where this leads, and we\nshould be honest about it. I oppose this.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, we better admit that our politicians in Washington are\ntaking us down the exact same road that Puerto Rico is on, and that Greece\nhas gone down. The federal minimum wage has strangled economic growth in\nPuerto Rico. The Puerto Rican government tried to throw money at the\nproblem with incentive programs to lure business \xe2\x80\x94 but that just cost money\nand didn\xe2\x80\x99t fix the structural problem, so the economy continued to stall.\n\n\n\nI know because in Louisiana we reversed decades of outmigration, and we\ncreated more than 90,000 jobs by reducing regulations and cutting taxes.\nLouisiana\xe2\x80\x99s economy boomed. We can do the same for America\xe2\x80\x99s economy. If\nyou want more borrowing and spending, then vote for the Democrats. We know\nwhere that leads \xe2\x80\x94 Greece and Puerto Rico have shown us how quickly\nirresponsible spending can kill a democracy.\n\n\n\n*Jindal back to Iowa, will fundraise with Grassley\n<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/07/07/bobby-jindal-chuck-grassley-caucus-trips-cedar-rapids-marion/29822565/>\n// Des Moines Register // Linh Ta \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nLouisiana Gov.

Bobby Jindal\'s Super PAC, Believe Again, is spending more than\n$700,000 on round of commercials that will keep Jindal for president ads on\nthe air through August, the Washington Post reported.\n\n\n\nThe ads will air between July 13 and August 2, mostly in the major media\nmarkets of Des Moines, Sioux City and Cedar Rapids, the Post report said.\nThe buy includes commercials running online and on some cable networks in\nthe state.\n\n\n\nof the TV ads that have been running in Iowa have been a spot that uses a\nspeech where Jindal talks about how he doesn\'t like the use of terms he\ncalls "hyphenated Americans" such as Indian-American. He goes on to talk\nabout his views on immigration. The ad is titled "We Are All Americans."\n\n\n\nBefore that, an ad that aired in Iowa touted Jindal\'s support for religious\nfreedom.\n\n\n\n*Jindal: No break for Puerto Rico in debt crisis\n<http://www.unionleader.com/article/20150708/NEWS0605/150709381> // The\nUnion Leader // Dave Solomon \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nLouisiana governor and presidential candidate Bobby Jindal said on Tuesday\nthat he would oppose any legislation giving the U.S. territory of Puerto\nRico a way out of its debt crisis that would leave lenders holding the bag.\n\n\n\nHe criticized Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and fellow Republican\nJeb Bush, former governor of Florida, for endorsing changes in U.S.\nbankruptcy laws that would enable Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s public entities to\nrestructure some $72 billion in debt.\n\n\n\nLegislation has been introduced in Congress that would give the U.S.\nterritory the same options the 50 states have when it comes to\nrestructuring the debt of government-owned entities or municipalities.\n\n\n\nU.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Maryland Gov. Martin\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley, both Clinton rivals for the Democratic nomination, have also\nendorsed easing the bankruptcy laws for Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\nBush is so far the only Republican candidate to do so. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that Puerto\nRico ought to be treated as other states are treated as it relates to\nrestructuring,\xe2\x80\x9d he said during a visit to the island in late April.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe all know what\xe2\x80\x99s next,\xe2\x80\x9d Jindal said in an interview with New Hampshire\nUnion Leader editors and reporters. \xe2\x80\x9cThere will be appeals for U.S. tax\ndollars for a bailout. We can\xe2\x80\x99t do that. We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\nwhy Jeb Bush is calling for that change in the law. I hope he will\nreconsider his position.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nJindal linked Puerto Rico and Greece, both on the verge of a massive\ndefault, as examples of poor economic policies run amok, and said the\nUnited States has been heading in the same direction under President Obama.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe most important domestic issue we have is to rescue the American Dream\nfrom becoming the European nightmare \xe2\x80\x94 more taxes, more spending, more\nregulation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGreece will be our future if we aren\xe2\x80\x99t careful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMore than a ribbon-cutter\n\n\n\nThe 44-year-old Louisiana native, whose parents immigrated from India, is\nconsidered a long-shot for the GOP nomination. His approval rating in\nLouisiana has plummeted to around 30 percent, as the state Legislature in\nJune closed a $1.6 billion projected budget deficit, ending the state\xe2\x80\x99s\nbiggest budget crisis since the late 1980s.\n\n\n\nJindal pointed out that he was elected governor by wide margins, \xe2\x80\x9cand then\nwe actually did something after getting elected,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to be popular, cut ribbons and kiss babies,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve done\nsome things in our state and the state is better for it.\xe2\x80\x9d Those initiatives\nincluded a school-choice program and privatization of the state-run\nhospitals.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were coming out of Katrina,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople were worried about 25\nyears of out-migration. Now we\xe2\x80\x99ve had seven years of in-migration, credit\nupgrades and per-capita income is up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe son of immigrants, Jindal said the current immigration system is\nbroken. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have low walls and a narrow gate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we need high\nwalls and a broader gate, meaning we need to secure the border and after\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s done, make it easier to get here legally.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOnce through the gate, he said, immigrants need to assimilate.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey need to learn English, adopt our values, role up their shirtsleeves\nand learn to live here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m tired of hyphenated Americans. My\nparents love India, but they came here because they wanted their kids to\nbecome Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nJindal opposes subsidies for solar energy, popular in New Hampshire, and\nfor ethanol, popular in Iowa \xe2\x80\x94 both critical primary states.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs Republicans, we say we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be the party of big government,\nbut we can\xe2\x80\x99t be the party of big business either. We can\xe2\x80\x99t say we don\xe2\x80\x99t\nwant to pick winners and losers, so you can\xe2\x80\x99t give special treatment to\nsolar, but we want to give special treatment to oil, gas and the sources\nthat we favor. I am an all-of-the-above guy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA defining election\n\n\n\nA fiscal and social conservative, Jindal sees himself as a populist.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe left thinks we aren\xe2\x80\x99t smart enough to choose our own health insurance,\nto decide where our kids should go to school, how we exercise our Second\nAmendment rights, how many Big Gulps you should drink,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think\nthis election is about populism versus elitism.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nJindal said his Roman Catholic faith informs every aspect of his life,\nincluding his politics and decision-making. As a teenager, he at first hid\nhis interest in Christianity from his Hindu parents.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came to the Christian faith at 16,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt took me seven years. It\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t easy and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t immediate. I may have been the only teenager who\ntold his parents he was going to a party so he could go to church instead.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn his second visit to the Granite State so far in the campaign, Jindal\nsaid he appreciates the civility of the New Hampshire electorate. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of\nthe great things about New Hampshire and Iowa is that voters are\nrespectful, intelligent and considerate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are a lot of\npeople who come to town halls who disagree with me. They want to tell me\nhow wrong I am. They wait their turn, stand up and give you their piece,\nbut they are not rude.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAs regards his standing in the crowded GOP field, Jindal has faith in the\nbiblical admonition, \xe2\x80\x9cMany who are first will be last, and many who are\nlast will be first.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*TRUMP*\n\n\n\n*P.G.A. Moves Event From Donald Trump Golf Course\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/sports/golf/pga-moves-event-from-trump-golf-course.html>\n// NYT // Brendan Prunty \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nAbout five years ago, when golf was going through an economic downswing,\nDonald Trump took the opportunity to buy in, scooping up failed properties.\nHe already had courses emblazoned with his name around the world, but\ncredibility? That eluded him.\n\n\n\nSoon major golf tours came calling, bringing big-money, high-profile events\nto his courses. Major championships \xe2\x80\x94 the prized possessions of every club\n\xe2\x80\x94 came next. In short order, Trump had gone from outsider to having a seat\nin the club.\n\n\n\nNow he is wondering if he will get to keep it.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been very loyal to golf,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said Tuesday in a telephone\ninterview. \xe2\x80\x9cI own 17 clubs. They all do great. We will see whether or not\ngolf is loyal to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThat is the question after the P.G.A. of America on Tuesday became the\nfirst major golf organization to pull an event from one of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s\nproperties in response to Trump\xe2\x80\x99s racially insensitive remarks last month\nabout Mexican immigrants during a speech in which he announced his\ncandidacy for the Republican nomination for president.\n\n\n\nThe P.G.A. Grand Slam of Golf \xe2\x80\x94 a year-end exhibition among the winners of\nthe four men\xe2\x80\x99s major championships \xe2\x80\x94 was scheduled for October at Trump\nNational Golf Club in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nInstead, it will be moved to a yet-to-be-determined location.\n\n\n\nTrump said it was a mutually agreed upon move to protect his friends in the\norganization from dealing with potential backlash over his remarks, in\nwhich he said, referring to Mexican immigrants: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re bringing drugs.\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re bringing crime. They\xe2\x80\x99re rapists.\xe2\x80\x9d He later added, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd some, I\nassume, are good people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe P.G.A. and L.P.G.A. issued statements on Tuesday, with the P.G.A.\nsaying \xe2\x80\x9cwe understand and support\xe2\x80\x9d the decision. The L.P.G.A. said that the\nWomen\xe2\x80\x99s British Open at Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Turnberry Resort later this month would be\nstaged as scheduled, adding that \xe2\x80\x9ca change in venue for this prestigious\nmajor simply isn\xe2\x80\x99t feasible without significantly diminishing the event.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think those statements are unnecessary,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe voters of this\ncountry agree with me. All you have to do is look at the polls.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nTrump later told a Golf Channel reporter days after the June 16 speech that\nhe had \xe2\x80\x9ctremendous support from the golf world, because they all know I\xe2\x80\x99m\nright,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to his remarks about Mexican immigrants.\n\n\n\nThat led the U.S.G.A., P.G.A. Tour, L.P.G.A. Tour and the P.G.A. of America\nto issue a joint statement disputing Trump\xe2\x80\x99s claims.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Women\xe2\x80\x99s British Open at the Turnberry Resort, which\nTrump purchased last year, three other major championships will be held at\nhis courses by 2022: the 2017 United States Women\xe2\x80\x99s Open (at Trump National\nin Bedminster, N.J.), the 2017 Senior P.G.A. Championship (at Trump\nNational in Potomac Falls, Va.) and the 2022 P.G.A. Championship at his\nBedminster course.\n\n\n\nAnd as part of that deal last year with the P.G.A. of America, it moved the\nGrand Slam of Golf from its traditional home in Bermuda to Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Los\nAngeles course in a multiyear deal that runs through 2018. The P.G.A. of\nAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s statement about the move, however, noted that it was for this\nyear.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think a lot of people are surprised that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all or nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe former P.G.A. of America president Ted Bishop. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what kind\nof statement the P.G.A. of America makes by saying, \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do\nthis for one year, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go back for all these others.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBishop, who was ousted from the organization last year after he made public\ncomments that were widely seen as sexist, was part of the group that\nentered into a multi-event deal with Trump in 2014. He said that both he\nand the former P.G.A. of America chief executive Joe Steranka originally\nwanted nothing to do with Trump or his growing grip on the sport. But once\nPete Bevacqua took over for Steranka, he said, he pushed for the two sides\nto do more business.\n\n\n\nIn addition to his own original-design golf properties, Trump had\nincreasingly begun acquiring more pieces of the golf market. He purchased\nthe financially struggling properties in Colts Neck and Pine Hill, N.J. He\nbought the Doral Resort & Spa \xe2\x80\x94 and its famous Blue Monster course, which\nhosts the W.G.C.-Cadillac Championship \xe2\x80\x94 out of bankruptcy in 2012. When\nthe U.S.G.A. awarded him a United States Women\xe2\x80\x99s Open in 2012, the door had\nbeen opened for others to follow suit.\n\n\n\nAnd if, at the end of the day, golf is not loyal back?\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have wonderful alternatives,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a\nfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*GOP donors call for sidelining Donald Trump\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/republican-donors-donald-trump-debates-reaction-119798.html>\n// Politico // Nick Gass \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nAt least one top Republican donor wants the party to keep Donald Trump from\nthe debate stage.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomeone in the party ought to start some sort of petition saying, \xe2\x80\x98If\nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s going to be on the stage, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be on there with him,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\nRepublican donor John Jordan told The Associated Press on Monday, according\nto a report published Tuesday. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m toying with the idea of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something I feel strongly about as somebody who not only cares about\nthe Republican Party, but also Latinos,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\n\nThe comments come in the wake of a letter sent by Wyoming-based investor\nFoster Friess, another top GOP donor, calling for candidates to stay on the\n\xe2\x80\x9ccivility reservation,\xe2\x80\x9d according to AP.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur candidates will benefit if they all submit to Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s 11th\nCommandment, \xe2\x80\x98Thou shall not speak ill of a fellow Republican,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Friess\nwrote in a letter late last week to Republican National Committee Chairman\nReince Priebus, obtained by the AP.\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidates, from New Jersey Gov.

Ted Cruz, however, declined to condemn Trump\xe2\x80\x99s comments, telling\nNBC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press\xe2\x80\x9d that he was not going to be a party to\n\xe2\x80\x9cRepublican-on-Republican violence.\xe2\x80\x9d Christie responded to those remarks on\nFox News, calling it \xe2\x80\x9cironic\xe2\x80\x9d that the senator is giving \xe2\x80\x9clectures\xe2\x80\x9d on the\nissue after Christie accused Cruz of sponsoring ads against incumbent Sen.\nLamar Alexander of Tennessee in the 2014 election cycle.\n\nAccording to a copy of Mike Huckabee\xe2\x80\x99s response to Friess obtained by the\nAP, the former Arkansas governor said he \xe2\x80\x9chope[s] that we don\xe2\x80\x99t commit\nfratricide again as a party.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Workers Building Trump Hotel Present Different Immigrant Image\n<http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/workers-building-trump-hotel-present-different-immigrant-picture-n388281>\n// NBC News // Suzanne Gamboa \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nAgainst the political noise of Donald Trump\'s anti-Mexican, anti-immigrant\ndeclarations and the ensuing backlash, the clank of hammers, clunking of\nwood and the high-pitched whine of heavy machinery inside a Trump\nconstruction site in the nation\'s capital goes on.\n\n\n\nMany of the workers, though not all, are immigrants or Latino, or both, and\nhave been on site of the Old Post Office Pavilion on Pennsylvania Avenue \xe2\x80\x94\nabout midway between the Capitol and the White House \xe2\x80\x94 since early in the\nmorning and for many days.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, during breaks and while leaving at the end of their long day,\nthey wore their work on their clothing and on their skin \xe2\x80\x94 splattered\npaint, dust, the exhaustion of their labor under a tough sun.\n\n\n\nIn his presidential bid, Trump told his audience of supporters that Mexico\nwas sending to the U.S. people who weren\'t like them. Instead, Mexico was\nsending problems: rapists, criminals and drug runners, he said.\n\n\n\nFew of the workers at the construction site wanted to discuss Trump\'s\ncomments when asked about them a day after the Washington Post ran a\nfront-page story about the workers on the hotel development billed as a\n$200 million project.\n\n\n\nThe Post reported that several of the workers were immigrants and many were\ncitizens or working legally, but laborers also told the Post that many had\nfirst entered the U.S illegally.\n\n\n\nMany of the workers interviewed were from El Salvador or Honduras,\nreflective of the Washington, D.C., Latino population. Larger Mexican\nimmigrant populations are found in communities around the district.\n\n\n\nThose that did talk to reporters Tuesday said Trump was crazy or that he\nclearly didn\'t know that the people who work on his projects are decent\npeople.\n\n\n\n"They\'ve come here to work, to get ahead, not to do anything bad," one\nworker who would not divulge any personal information told NBC. "All the\nones I know, at least, are workers, not rapists."\n\n\n\nTheir stories as reported by the Post give a different view of immigration,\none that shows the complexity of the lives of people and their status in\nthe U.S. \xe2\x80\x94 here illegally, once here legally but now a citizen, a legal\nresident, here with temporary protected status.\n\n\n\nAlthough Trump has pegged them as problems, the workers\' toil away making a\nluxury hotel out of a historic building complex that houses the official\nBells of Congress gifted to the U.S. from Britain during the nation\'s\nbicentennial and a 315-foot clock tower dating to 1899.\n\n\n\nThere\'s no mistaking who is reaping at least some of the benefit of these\nlaborers\' work.\n\n\n\nThe blue banners atop fencing across the front of the construction site\nannounce the developer in large white letters: TRUMP.\n\n\n\nIt\'s a brand that Trump himself acknowledged is becoming increasingly\ntarnished. Often associated with success, wealth and excess, Trump\'s brand\nis increasingly being connected to racism and xenophobia.\n\n\n\nBusinesses have been severing ties with Trump, including NBC, Univision,\nMacy\'s and Serta Mattresses.\n\n\n\n"I didn\'t know it was going to be quite this severe," Trump said on "Fox &\nFriends" of the backlash since his statements.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the Professional Golfers Association pulled this year\'s Grand\nSlam of Golf from Trump National course in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n"I think Donald Trump knew he was going to be provocative and knew he was\ngoing to get pushback, but I believe he didn\'t think the pushback would\nactually come in the form of being dropped by sponsorships and contracts,"\nsaid political analyst Victoria Francesco de Soto.\n\n\n\n"Trump is losing out real money and his brand is being harmed," she said.\n"We all know Trump has that outrageous provocative brand, but it\'s going a\nbit deeper."\n\n\n\n*Take on Trump?

Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) on Tuesday dodged a question about Trump\xe2\x80\x99s\ncontroversial remarks.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m focused on fixing No Child Left Behind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, referring to the\npending education bill. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are plenty of candidates in the presidential\nrace who can deal with each other on those issues. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get\ninto it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said he disagrees with Trump\xe2\x80\x99s characterization,\nbut declined to condemn the remarks.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy state has been enriched by the Hispanic influence. We\xe2\x80\x99re a much better\nplace. We have a close and warm relationship across our southern border\nwith our Mexican friends, so, frankly, I just disagree,\xe2\x80\x9d said McCain, who\nis running for reelection in 2016.\n\n\n\nWhen asked if Trump\xe2\x80\x99s comments would hurt the party, McCain said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\nleave that to others to decide.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are serious issues involved, and they need to be treated seriously,\nand foremost we need to treat all the people involved with the dignity and\nrespect they deserve,\xe2\x80\x9d said Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn (Texas).\n\n\n\nHe declined to characterize Trump\xe2\x80\x99s comments as a mistake.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not running for president.

But Republican lawmakers aren\xe2\x80\x99t\nshowing an interest in going toe-to-toe with Trump.\n\n\n\nThe 2016 candidate is surging in the polls, attracting a lot of media\nattention, and he\xe2\x80\x99s shown he likes to fire back at Washington insiders.\n\n\n\nEstablishment Republicans are growing increasingly concerned that Trump\nwill be a huge distraction throughout the upcoming cycle.\n\n\n\nOne GOP donor floated the idea of barring Trump from presidential debates,\nand while some Republican strategists privately embrace the idea, lawmakers\nare keeping their distance.\n\n\n\nTrump is famously litigious and not afraid to use scorched-earth tactics to\nrespond to his critics. While his negative characterization of illegal\nMexican immigrants has caused corporate partners to recoil, they have\nhelped him gain traction with the Republican base.\n\n\n\nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s nationwide support has increased to 12 percent, according to a\nrecent CNN/ORC poll, putting him in second place, behind former Florida\nGov. Jeb Bush. He stood at 3 percent in the polls when he announced his\ncandidacy in mid-June.\n\n\n\nSome Republicans worry that if the party excludes Trump from the debates or\nattacks him personally, the strategy could backfire by provoking him to\nwage a third-party campaign in the general election.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Republican candidates who decide to take him on and attack him do so\nat their peril and the party\xe2\x80\x99s peril because the worst thing for\nRepublicans is for Trump to go through the primaries and make a third-party\nrun,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Ullyot, a GOP strategist and former senior Senate aide.\n\n\n\nThey fear a replay of H. Ross Perot, who at the very least hampered former\nPresident George H.W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s reelection chances in 1992. Perot won 19\npercent of the national vote, and Bill Clinton was elected as the country\xe2\x80\x99s\n42nd president.\n\n\n\nOver the last several weeks, corporate giants including Macy\xe2\x80\x99s, NBC and\nUnivision have cut ties with Trump. In Washington, prominent local\nrestaurateur Jos\xc3\xa9 Andr\xc3\xa9s has come under pressure to reconsider opening a\nnew restaurant at the Old Post Office, which Trump is converting into a\nluxury hotel.\n\n\n\nTrump has not backed down and pointed to the fatal shooting of a San\nFrancisco woman last week. Kathryn Steinle was shot allegedly by a man who\nhad a long criminal record and had been deported to Mexico five times.\n\n\n\nA spokeswoman for Trump said she had no comment for this article.\n\n\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said he thought Trump stumbled in his comments\nbut defended his right to speak his mind.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just don\xe2\x80\x99t think he has a lot of experience with presidential politics\neven though he\xe2\x80\x99s been there a few times. He\xe2\x80\x99s undoubtedly going to make\nsome mistakes, and I think that was one,\xe2\x80\x9d Hatch said.\n\n\n\nThe Finance Committee chairman argues that Trump\xe2\x80\x99s remarks will give other\nGOP candidates a chance to portray themselves in a more favorable light by\noffering a clear contrast.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it will give other Republicans a chance to shine,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe could play a very good role if he will. He\xe2\x80\x99s a smart guy, he\xe2\x80\x99s a very\nsuccessful guy. I know him personally. I like him personally, but he\xe2\x80\x99s a\nperson who says what he believes and what he thinks. That\xe2\x80\x99s something to be\nadmired, even if you disagree with him,\xe2\x80\x9d Hatch added.\n\n\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) said Trump could have expressed himself more\ndeftly but that he did not necessarily say anything inaccurate.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe the facts would show that some people, certainly not the\nmajority, if they get in trouble with the law in foreign countries, if they\ncan get to the United States, they can avoid going to jail,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nwe know a huge amount of our drugs are coming across our border.\n\n\n\nGOP strategists acknowledge that Trump is hurting their party\xe2\x80\x99s effort to\nreach out to Hispanic voters.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly it has hurt the Republican brand with Hispanics, but it will\nalso give us an opportunity as Republicans to have a conversation with\nHispanic voters about what it means to be an immigrant to this country and\nhow we should do this in a safe and orderly fashion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Patrick Davis, a\nGOP strategist and former political director of the National Republican\nSenatorial Committee.\n\n\n\nDemocrats have pounced on Trump\xe2\x80\x99s words to paint the broader Republican\nParty as hostile to immigrants.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton, the current Democratic presidential front-runner, told CNN\nin an interview Tuesday that she feels \xe2\x80\x9cvery bad and very disappointed with\nhim and with the Republican Party for not responding.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nUnlike other GOP presidential contenders, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has praised\nTrump for putting a national spotlight on the southwestern border.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI salute Donald Trump for focusing on the need to address illegal\nimmigration,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz told host Chuck Todd on NBC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMeet The Press.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI like\nDonald Trump. He is bold, he is brash.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has a colorful way of speaking, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not my way of speaking, but I\nsalute him,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz added.\n\n\n\n*Donald Trump Employees\xe2\x80\x99 401(k) Plans Come With a Huge Catch\n<http://time.com/money/3948049/donald-trump-401k/> // TIME // Susie Poppick\n\xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nIt turns out that Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x94the real estate mogul and Republican\npresidential hopeful who has promised to be \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest jobs president\nthat God ever created\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is a bit of a Scrooge when it comes to his\nemployees\xe2\x80\x99 retirement plans.\n\n\n\nWorkers who are eligible for Trump\xe2\x80\x99s company 401(k) cannot actually open an\naccount until they have been employed by the tycoon for a year, Bloomberg\nreports. And the employer match\xe2\x80\x94a generous-enough 4.5% for employees who\ninvest at least 6% of their earnings\xe2\x80\x94doesn\xe2\x80\x99t kick in for six years. (That\xe2\x80\x99s\nthe longest amount of time allowed by United States law).\n\n\n\nWhile these policies may simply signal how much Trump values loyalty, one\nother important 401(k) feature is lacking in the plan: automatic\nenrollment. Studies have shown that by automatically signing employees up\nfor savings, employers can greatly boost how much workers end up having for\nretirement.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the plan really wanted to facilitate employee savings, it would\ninstitute automatic enrollment, reduce or eliminate the eligibility\nrequirement, and vest employees in the employer match more quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d\nHarvard Kennedy School professor Brigitte Madrian told Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n*These GOP Candidates Are Standing Behind Donald Trump\n<http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/07/gop-candidates-defending-donald-trump>\n// Mother Jones // Allie Gross \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nFollowing Donald Trump\'s controversial comments suggesting that Mexican\nimmigrants are "rapists" who bring drugs and crime to America, his fellow\n2016 contenders have largely condemned his inflammatory remarks. But a\nhandful of Republican hopefuls have either defended the real estate mogul\nor, in one case, fled a question on the subject to avoid going on the\nrecord.\n\n\n\nRick Santorum, Ted Cruz, and Ben Carson are standing behind Trump. They\nhave defended (even applauded) the billionaire, in what might be attempts\nto appeal to conservatives opposed to immigration reform.\n\n\n\nDuring an appearance on Meet the Press on Sunday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas)\nsaid, "I salute Donald Trump for focusing on the need to address illegal\nimmigration." He chalked up Trump\'s divisive rhetoric as a "colorful way of\nspeaking." According to Cruz, the controversy is merely an attempt by the\nmedia to get Republicans to criticize each other, but he is "not interested\nin Republican-on-Republican violence" and therefore "ain\'t gonna do it."\n\n\n\nRick Santorum also came out on #teamtrump. The former senator told CBS\'\nFace the Nation on Sunday that he did not like Trump\'s "verbiage," but said\nthat Trump "focused on a very important issue for American workers, and\nparticularly legal immigrants in this country."\n\n\n\nReferring to the storm that followed Trump\'s remarks, Ben Carson contended\nthat political correctness was overshadowing the debate about immigration\nreform. "It\'s the P.C. police out in force," Carson told the Daily Caller.\n"They want to make very clear that this is a topic you\'re not supposed to\nbring up." Carson, a former neurosurgeon, said that "our illegal\nimmigration problem," not Trump, should be the focus of attention. His\nsolution? "Secure all our borders\xe2\x80\x94north, south, east and west," with\nelectronic surveillance devices, drones, or people.\n\n\n\nRand Paul isn\'t exactly on #teamtrump, but he has been conspicuously silent\non Trump\'s remarks. Last week, an Iowa voter posted a video to Twitter that\nshowed her asking Paul for his opinion on Trump\'s statement and being met\nwith no reply.\n\n\n\n*Donald Trump Taking Message To Hollywood For GOP Event Friday\n<http://deadline.com/2015/07/donald-trump-hollywood-friends-of-abe-event-1201471883/>\n// Deadline // Liosa de Morales \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nDonald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s coming to town. Trump people confirm he is speaking to the\ngroup of Hollywood conservatives who go by the name Friends of Abe. The\nevent is scheduled for 7:30 PM on Friday at the Luxe Sunset Blvd Hotel in\nBrentwood, the invite says.\n\n\n\nThe most controversial of the ever-expanding pack of GOP White House\nhopefuls is the latest paying a visit to the group. Other Republican\ncontenders already have paid a call, but, of course, Carly Fiorina, Rand\nPaul and Mike Huckabee have not made headlines saying Mexico is sending its\ndrug users and rapists across the border into the United States, so their\nvisits to Abe\xe2\x80\x99s pals went largely unnoticed.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are delighted to hear from Donald Trump as we are from all 2016\nRepublican candidates,\xe2\x80\x9d a member of the Tinseltown organization told\nDeadline. The invite sent to Friends of Abe members asks them to come for a\n\xe2\x80\x9cdinner and insightful discussion\xe2\x80\x9d with Trump. The ex-Celebrity Apprentice\nhost is called \xe2\x80\x9cthe very definition of American success\xe2\x80\x9d on the invite.\nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s camp confirmed he is scheduled to speak at the private event.\n\n\n\nFriends of Abe was founded by the likes of Gary Sinise, Jon Voight and\nKelsey Grammer several years ago as a discussion group for embattled\nHollywooders with conservative tendencies. Having grown now to more than\n2,200 members, the media-avoiding FoA has become a station on the notable\nGOP presidential and fundraising path as candidates and the Republican\nParty try to get their hands on Tinseltown cash via networking at the\ngroup\xe2\x80\x99s low-key events.\n\n\n\nWord of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s visit came as Hillary Clinton was clobbering him on CNN\nover his comments about Mexican immigration. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very disappointed in\nthose comments and I feel very bad, and very disappointed with him and with\nthe Republican party for not responding immediately and saying, \xe2\x80\x98Enough!\nStop It!\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton told CNN\xe2\x80\x99s senior political correspondent Brianna\nKeilar in Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s first nationally televised interview since officially\nannouncing her candidacy three months ago.\n\n\n\nTrump this week acknowledged the remark he made about illegal immigrants\ncoming across the border with Mexico in announcing his White House bid in\nmid-June, has cost him more business than he expected. Most notably, he has\nsued Univision for dumping plans to broadcast the Miss USA and Miss\nUniverse Pageants, which he co-owns with NBC, which also has bailed on the\nbeauty pageant broadcasts, and said it is getting out of business with him.\nIn LA today, pro golf\xe2\x80\x99s PGA backed out of October\xe2\x80\x99s PGA Grand Slam of Golf\ntourney that had been scheduled at Trump National golf course in Palos\nVerdes.\n\n\n\nClinton, however, said Trump is only in keeping with all of the GOP\npresidential candidates\xe2\x80\x99 immigration stances, which she described as a\n\xe2\x80\x9cspectrum\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9chostility\xe2\x80\x9d on immigration in which all of the Republican\nhopefuls are opposed to providing a path to citizenship for illegal\nimmigrants \xe2\x80\x94 by way of seguing to her \xe2\x80\x9ctalk about comprehensive immigration\nreform.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*How much money will running for president cost Donald Trump?\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/07/politics/donald-trump-losing-brands-money/>\n// CNN // MJ Lee \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nDonald Trump\'s foes want to hit him where it hurts: His wallet.\n\n\n\nA slew of corporations from Macy\'s to NBC to ESPN to NASCAR have abandoned\nbusiness deals with the Republican presidential candidate after he remarked\nthat some immigrants crossing into the U.S. from Mexico were "rapists." The\nPGA was one of the latest organizations to dump the bombastic businessman,\nannouncing on Tuesday that it would not hold its 2015 Grand Slam of Golf\ntournament at a Trump golf course in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nAll told, the loss of income could add up to millions of dollars. But until\nTrump files detailed financial disclosure forms, it is difficult to\nestimate just how hard his profits may take a hit. Trump\'s assets tied to\nthe Miss Universe, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants that he partially\nowns and were dropped by Univision and NBC are estimated to be around $15\nmillion.\n\n\n\nThat\'s a large sum of money but to a self-claimed multi-billionaire like\nTrump, it\'s small change. Trump says his net worth is close to $9 billion.\nAbout a third of that -- $3.3 billion -- is tied up in "real estate\nlicensing deals, brand and branded developments," according to a summary of\nTrump\'s net worth as of last year. The vast majority of the rest of Trump\'s\nassets are in residential and commercial properties, as well as real estate\ninvestments.\n\n\n\nSome experts say these assets would be largely shielded from the corporate\nbacklash. Dwight Hill, a retail expert, said he would expect any financial\nloss Trump experiences from the fallout of his comments to be just a "blip."\n\n\n\n"At the end of the day, his real wealth and holdings is obviously real\nestate," Hill said. "I\'m sure there will be some boycott of his hotels but\nI just don\'t see it as having a long term lasting affect on his brand."\n\n\n\nA Trump spokeswoman declined to answer several questions about the details\nof Trump\'s finances.\n\n\n\nIn his typical brash style, Trump has dismissed the flood of business deals\nhe\'s lost over the course of a few weeks.\n\n\n\n"The disassociation of ESPN and NASCAR with the Trump Organization was\ncovered by the press in headlines all over the world as though it was a\nmajor setback for me. Really? What were the losses?" Trump said in a\nstatement Tuesday.\n\n\n\nHe went on to boast that he will now turn a bigger profit in part by\nkeeping large portions of the deposits from ESPN and NASCAR.\n\n\n\nBut Trump\'s public statements seem to belie a recognition that the recent\nevents have put a serious dent in his brand.\n\n\n\nOne person in Trump\'s inner circle, who spoke anonymously to share Trump\'s\nprivate thoughts, said the businessman was genuinely stung by NBC\'s\ndecision to sever ties with him. Even after announcing his presidential\ncampaign, Trump had always expected to return to being host of "The\nApprentice" \xe2\x80\x94 a platform that has been central to creating an image of a\ntough boardroom CEO and experienced business leader.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t think it has anything to do with money. It has everything to do\nwith prestige," this person said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, his critics say they are determined to make the depth of their\nanger known.\n\n\n\nThe Hispanic business community, for one, is galvanizing around a boycott\nof Trump brands and properties. Spearheading that effort, the Hispanic\nChamber of Commerce announced that it would no longer consider Trump hotels\nas potential venues for two of its upcoming conventions. The Chamber\'s\npresident, Javier Palomarez, said Trump would have profited several million\ndollars if he had won the bid to host those gatherings.\n\n\n\nAnd Palomarez added that the consequence for Trump will be far\nwider-ranging than just that: many of the Chamber\'s sister organizations\nare joining the boycott, he said, in what Palomarez expects will be a\nsustained and nationwide anti-Trump campaign.\n\n\n\n"What you\'re seeing is the tip of the spear," Palomarez told CNN. "For\nevery brand that you hear that\'s leaving him there\'s probably 20 or 30 more\nbrands that have left him ... all the way down to families who were going\nto vacation at a Trump property -- it goes that far downstream."\n\n\n\nNew York\'s elected officials are also repudiating one of Manhattan\'s\nbest-known celebrities.\n\n\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced earlier this month that the\ncity will "review" its existing contracts with Trump, calling the GOP\ncandidate\'s comments about immigrants "disgusting" and "hateful." Trump\'s\ncompany operates the Trump Golf Links golf course in the Bronx that opened\nearlier this year, as well as an ice skating facility in Central Park.\n\n\n\n*Donald Trump defiant on business fallout amid fresh salvos on immigration\n<http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/08/donald-trump-defiant-on-business-fallout-amid-fresh-salvos-on-immigration>\n// The Guardian // Ben Jacobs \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nDonald Trump says \xe2\x80\x9cmaking America great is more important to me than my\ncompany\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\n\nIn a phone interview with Greta Van Susteren of Fox News, the controversial\nbillionaire took shots at critics, suggested Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s policy ideas were\n\xe2\x80\x9cbaby stuff\xe2\x80\x9d and accidentally pressed at least one button on his telephone\nwhile talking.\n\n\n\nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s business interests have suffered significant damage since his\nannouncement speech when he suggested that undocumented immigrants crossing\nthe border between the US and Mexico were \xe2\x80\x9cbringing drugs. They\xe2\x80\x99re bringing\ncrime. They\xe2\x80\x99re rapists.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe shot back at the latest round of companies to cancel contracts with his\nvenues he owns. In recent days, ESPN and Nascar have cancelled events at\nTrump-owned properties.\n\n\n\nTrump jibed that Nascar had simply rented a ballroom from him and lost a\nbig deposit as a result. He gleefully proclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll rent it to somebody\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d The former Celebrity Apprentice host also said ESPN was being forced\nto hold a golf tournament at \xe2\x80\x9ca course which isn\xe2\x80\x99t nearly as nice\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\n\nThe real estate mogul also took a far more extreme stance on immigration\nthan he had in the past. The Republican presidential hopeful claimed:\n\xe2\x80\x9cMexico sends many criminals back in\xe2\x80\x9d to the US and went on to say that an\nillegal immigrant who allegedly killed a woman in San Francisco this week\nwas \xe2\x80\x9cforced back in\xe2\x80\x9d to the US by Mexico.\n\n\n\nThe real estate mogul also engaged in plenty of hyperbole. Trump asserted\nthat he has been the only candidate \xe2\x80\x9cwho has brought up illegal\nimmigration\xe2\x80\x9d despite the fact that issue has been a subject of ferocious\ndebate in American politics for decades. He also cited an article in the\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuffington Post, which has me No 1.\xe2\x80\x9d The article Trump cited, by associate\neditor Igor Bobic, was more than a little tongue-in-cheek.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, Republican insiders worried about the rise of Trump in\nrecent polls do have at least one silver lining from his interview. Trump\ninsisted he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t planning on mounting a third party bid for the\npresidency and that \xe2\x80\x9cmy thinking was to run as a Republican\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\n\n*Obama\xe2\x80\x99s housing chief calls Trump \xe2\x80\x98de facto face\xe2\x80\x99 of GOP\n<https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/07/07/obama-housing-chief-calls-trump-facto-face-gop/HwjuOHq4ohkuZUBi55WgtL/story.html>\n// The Boston Globe // Jim O\xe2\x80\x99Sullivan \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nUS Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro on Tuesday warned\nRepublicans that permitting Donald Trump to serve as \xe2\x80\x9cthe de facto face of\nthe party\xe2\x80\x9d while he describes immigrants in inflammatory terms could cost\nthem the presidential election.\n\n\n\nCastro, a former San Antonio mayor widely considered a short-list candidate\nto be a 2016 running mate on the Democratic side, described his party\xe2\x80\x99s\nprimary as \xe2\x80\x9ca real race.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nVisiting Dorchester for a ribbon-cutting with Mayor Martin J.

He has one of the\nhighest name ID, he\xe2\x80\x99s on TV all the time, and if this is the platform the\nRepublican Party has for immigrants, then they can kiss the 2016 election\ngoodbye.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSeveral Republican presidential candidates have sought to distance\nthemselves from Trump and disassociate him from the party\xe2\x80\x99s mainstream. A\nstring of business partners have ended their partnerships with Trump.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re bringing drugs, they\xe2\x80\x99re bringing crime.

He told the Globe he had not spoken with the Democratic\nfront-runner, former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, since a\nCenter for American Progress event in March. Joining her on the 2016\nticket, if she wins the nomination, did not come up, he said.\n\n\n\nAsked about the Democratic field, where US Senator Bernie Sanders of\nVermont has picked up momentum against Clinton, Castro called it \xe2\x80\x9ca real\nrace.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good that we have an active field on both the Democratic side and the\nRepublican side,\xe2\x80\x9d Castro said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s good for democracy, and on the\nDemocratic side and the Republican side, it gives voters the opportunity to\nhear a variety of perspectives.

Scott Walker is poised to become the 15th Republican to\ndeclare his presidential bid, with at least one more candidate expected to\nenter soon after. But at this point, his campaign advisers said this week\nthat they see just two principal rivals for the GOP nomination: former\nFlorida governor Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.).\n\n\n\nWalker will make his intentions clear Monday with an announcement and rally\nin suburban Waukesha County, the heart of Republican territory in\nWisconsin. The venue will be the same place where he celebrated his victory\nin a 2012 recall election, one more indication that he intends to make his\nbattles with public employee unions in the state the centerpiece of his\nappeal to conservative activists.\n\n\n\nWalker has weathered repeated controversies as governor and rocky periods\nduring the past six months as he has prepared to formally join the race. He\njumped into the top tier in January with a fiery speech at a GOP gathering\nin Iowa, but was hurt by a series of missteps and statements. He has faced\nquestions about whether he has changed his positions or tone on\nimmigration, abortion and same-sex marriage. Other Republicans say the\nmomentum he once had has abated.\n\n\n\n\n\nNone of that appears to have unsettled Walker or his advisers. With a super\nPAC called \xe2\x80\x9cUnintimidated\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 named for the biographical book Walker\npublished about his battles in Wisconsin \xe2\x80\x94 the candidate and his advisers\nare confident as they look ahead to the campaign.\n\n\n\nThey consider Walker uniquely equipped among the candidates to appeal\nacross the spectrum of the Republican Party. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are three legs of the\nstool,\xe2\x80\x9d campaign manager Rick Wiley said in an interview. \xe2\x80\x9cWe play in all\nthree. Who else does?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSome of Walker\xe2\x80\x99s competitors will no doubt try to prove his team wrong in\nthat.\n\n\n\nTea party activists, Wiley said, like Walker\xe2\x80\x99s fighting style and that he\nwon multiple elections while under siege. His roots as the son of a Baptist\nminister and his faith give him a reach into the GOP\xe2\x80\x99s social conservative\nwing.\n\n\n\nBeyond that, advisers argued that \xe2\x80\x94 as a second-term governor who has\nraised more than $80 million for his Wisconsin campaigns \xe2\x80\x94 Walker has\nappeal in establishment circles, even if he can\xe2\x80\x99t match Bush\xe2\x80\x99s fundraising\nprowess.\n\n\n\nWalker\xe2\x80\x99s path to victory, as outlined by his closest advisers, is not\nsignificantly different from that of his rivals, but his team says the\ncalendar sets up well for him.\n\n\n\nIowa is the key: Walker is leading the polls there and, as a neighboring\ngovernor, he has easy access to the state. His advisers expect him to win\nthe Iowa caucuses early next year, and they say he can follow that with\ntop-three finishes in New Hampshire and South Carolina. They also think he\ncan score an early victory in Nevada\xe2\x80\x99s caucuses.\n\n\n\nWalker\xe2\x80\x99s advisers doubt that anyone who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t win one of the four early\nstates will move to the heavy schedule of contests in March. They also\ndoubt that anyone will have enough delegates to clinch the nomination by\nthe end of March, and they anticipate that the race will drag on into May\nbefore there is a winner.\n\n\n\nThe enthusiastic reaction to Walker\xe2\x80\x99s speech at the January GOP forum in\nIowa produced some obvious dividends. The sudden and positive attention\nhelped with fundraising and grass-roots organizing. But the scrutiny that\ncame with it, compounded by Walker\xe2\x80\x99s wobbly handling of various issues,\nbrought the team its first crisis.\n\n\n\nAt the time, Walker was just beginning to build his campaign. He lacked the\ninfrastructure to deal with the self-inflicted wounds. \xe2\x80\x9cNone of our senior\nstaff had even been to Madison,\xe2\x80\x9d Wiley said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s amazing we survived.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe small team stepped up its recruiting and brought on policy advisers who\ncould provide Walker with briefings to become more fluent in key issues. By\nthe end of March, the campaign decided to scale back. For the next month or\nso, Walker made few public appearances, concentrating on policy briefings\nand fundraising meetings.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had to slow it down,\xe2\x80\x9d Wiley said.\n\n\n\nWalker formed his first committee last winter, a \xe2\x80\x9c527\xe2\x80\x9d that allowed him to\nraise money but did not advocate directly for him as a candidate. The super\nPAC was formed in April. Walker has held at least 30 meetings with\nprospective donors since then, said longtime adviser Keith Gilkes, who\nheads the super PAC.\n\n\n\nThe combined take for the two committees during the first six months of the\nyear is expected to top $20 million when reports are issued later this\nmonth. The super PAC has commitments for an additional $5 million or so,\nGilkes said, and hopes to raise at least $20 million by the end of the\nyear, giving it $40 million to start with in 2016.\n\n\n\nWalker advisers said his past battles in Wisconsin have given him the kind\nof grass-roots foundation that no other candidate can match. He has a list\nof 300,000 or so donors, and his super PAC had more than 200 donors as of a\nfew weeks ago. Walker advisers said they think that is smaller than Bush\xe2\x80\x99s\nsuper PAC but larger than those of most of the other candidates.\n\n\n\nBeyond that, advisers said, Walker has a list of e-mail addresses that\nnumbers about 700,000. One adviser said that is substantially more than\nMitt Romney had by the time he had wrapped up the 2012 GOP nomination.\n\n\n\nWalker has come under fresh criticism recently for changing his position on\nimmigration \xe2\x80\x94 he once supported a path to citizenship for those here\nillegally \xe2\x80\x94 and for changing his tone, if not his position, on same-sex\nmarriage and abortion.\n\n\n\nGilkes said Walker has not changed his stance on those two issues, although\nhe suggested that the governor\xe2\x80\x99s priorities are more fiscal and economic\nthan social. \xe2\x80\x9cHis beliefs never change,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nAnother adviser said Walker\xe2\x80\x99s call for a constitutional amendment to give\nstates the right to define marriage would end up being a plus, saying Rubio\nand Bush probably hurt themselves among social conservatives by not\nreacting more vigorously to last month\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court decision that\nlegalized same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\nWalker advisers discount possible threats from others in the establishment\nwing such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Nor\ndo they see a major threat yet in Iowa from those competing hardest for the\nsocial and religious conservatives.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy feeling is every single one of the candidates is focused on Walker in\nIowa,\xe2\x80\x9d Gilkes said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s ever going to let up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWalker\xe2\x80\x99s team has conducted two focus groups in Iowa. It has concluded\nthat, although he is not well known, the governor has significant\nopportunities to expand his appeal. The focus group was shown various\nvideos about Walker and were receptive to the portrayal of his record in\nWisconsin. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have so much to work with,\xe2\x80\x9d Wiley said.\n\n\n\nFor months, Walker\xe2\x80\x99s team has been preparing for a race against Bush\xe2\x80\x99s\nmoney and Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s compelling personal story. Advisers said Walker\xe2\x80\x99s record\nas governor is more current than Bush\xe2\x80\x99s and draws a sharper contrast with\nPresident Obama. Rubio has attributes that Walker has spoken about\nfavorably in private conversations, but the governor\xe2\x80\x99s campaign advisers\nconsider the first-term senator far less tested.\n\n\n\nWalker\xe2\x80\x99s announcement tour will take him from Wisconsin to Nevada, South\nCarolina, New Hampshire and then back to Iowa for several days of\ncampaigning. In New Hampshire, he will hold one town hall meeting. He will\nreturn to that state later in the month for an event that includes a\nHarley-Davidson motorcycle ride.\n\n\n\nHis announcement speech will focus heavily on his record in Wisconsin,\nreprising his fights with unions. As for his promise to put forth \xe2\x80\x9cbig and\nbold\xe2\x80\x9d ideas, one adviser said not to expect that in the announcement. Any\nsuch policies will be introduced later in the year.\n\n\n\n*Tea partiers and liberals tell Gov. Scott Walker: \xe2\x80\x98No more games on Common\nCore\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2015/07/07/tea-partiers-and-liberals-tell-gov-scott-walker-no-more-games-on-common-core/>\n// WaPo // Valerie Strauss \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nGov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who is expected soon to announce his bid\nfor the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, has been inconsistent at\nbest on the Common Core State Standards, being for it before being against\nit. Now he is being called out on his Core position by an unusual coalition\nof groups and individuals \xe2\x80\x94 in an open letter titled \xe2\x80\x9cNo More Games on\nCommon Core\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that includes tea parties across Wisconsin as well as\nliberals and libertarians.\n\n\n\nThe group of signatories to the letter accuses the governor of pretending\nto be against Common Core but not taking the steps required to eliminate it\nin Wisconsin. A Walker spokesman says  the governor is acting to give\nWisconsin school districts the freedom to do what they want on the Core.\n(See full statement below.)\n\n\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s some Walker history regarding the Common Core:\n\n\n\nIn 2011, his first budget for Wisconsin called for creation of a test that\nwas aligned to the Core standards, which were in place in the state before\nhe became governor.  A reading task force he chaired issued a report in\nJanuary 2012 expressing support for the Core, and as the Milwaukee Journal\nSentinel reported here, Walker was seen as being \xe2\x80\x9con board\xe2\x80\x9d with the Core\nin the first half of 2013 by Alan J. Borsuk, an education fellow at\nMarquette University, in a Journal Sentinel commentary.\n\n\n\nBut things began to change in 2013, when his second budget, while not\nrescinding the standards, directed the state Department of Public\nInstruction to stop ordering districts to continue implementing the Core.\nIn January 2014, the Journal Sentinel reported, he said he was creating a\ncommission to take a new look at the standards, and in July of that year,\nhe called for the Core to be rescinded in Wisconsin. That seems pretty\nconcrete, but in early 2015, his message was that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want Wisconsin\ndistricts required to use the Core if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to, which is less\nthan an full-out repeal.\n\n\n\nIn his latest budget request, Walker has defunded the Common Core\nassessment developed by the multi-state, federally funded Smarter Balanced\nAssessment Consortium and now has the state looking for a new\n\xe2\x80\x9caccountability\xe2\x80\x9d test. But there are questions about what the state is\nlooking for in a new test and whether it can still be aligned to the Common\nCore. If the new state accountability exam is aligned to the Core,\ndistricts would have little choice but to choose to implement the Common\nCore standards, even if they were permitted not to.\n\n\n\nOpposition to the Common Core has been rising for years from across the\npolitical spectrum with concerns including problems with the content of the\nstandards and the developmental inappropriateness of those for the earliest\ngrades, the design of the new tests, how the new exams were written and by\nwhom, and the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s funding of new standardized tests\naligned to the Core. Some far-right wing conservatives have taken criticism\nof the Core to ridiculous extremes; Phyllis Schlafly, for example, says it\nactively promotes gay marriage and Glenn Beck has called the standards\ninitiative \xe2\x80\x9cevil\xe2\x80\x9d and an attempt to impose \xe2\x80\x9ccommunism\xe2\x80\x9d on America.  The\nFreedom Project, affiliated with the radical right John Birch Society, has\nsaid the Core is an \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute appropriation of Soviet ideology and\npropaganda.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut a coalition of groups \xe2\x80\x93 mostly tea parties and other hard-right\nconservatives \xe2\x80\x94 have just issued the letter calling for Walker to take a\ndefinitive stand on Common Core and Core testing in language that was\nsensible enough for some liberals and libertarians to sign on. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the\nletter, and following it is the full comment from a Walker spokesperson in\nMadison.\n\n\n\n*Scott Walker hoping new bundlers help vault him over fundraising hurdles\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/07/politics/scott-walker-campaign-fundraising-strategy/index.html>\n// CNN // Sara Murray \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nWhen you\'re up against a candidate who belongs to a political dynasty and\nhas a fundraising network that spans decades, there is perhaps only one\noption: Bring in new blood.\n\n\n\nAs Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker readies his likely presidential campaign,\none of his biggest near-term hurdles is building a war chest that will\nallow him to face off against well-funded opponents.\n\n\n\nTo do that his team said it is targeting a new generation of bundlers by\ntapping into the network of more than 350,000 potential donors who\nsupported the governor in his recall election and turning to entrepreneurs\nwho\'ve launched new businesses in the last five to 10 years.\n\n\n\n"Our donor is not the tried and true Republican donor in New York City\nthat\'s given to everybody since Reagan," said Anthony Scaramucci, who is\nthe founder of investment firm SkyBridge Capital and is raising money for\nWalker. "We don\'t have the mercenary donor that\'s paying for past political\nfavors."\n\n\n\nJon Hammes, founder of a health care consulting company in Wisconsin, will\nserve a national finance co-chairman for the campaign, along with Todd\nRicketts, co-owner of the Chicago Cubs, according to a source familiar with\nthe plans. The move combines a veteran campaign fundraiser -- Hammes has\nraised money previous Republican nominees, including Mitt Romney and\nArizona Sen. John McCain -- with a big dollar donor who is still relatively\nnew to the political fundraising scene. This will be Ricketts\' first role\nwithin a presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nTheir goal is to build an army of bundlers like Genevieve Hillis, a\n34-year-old lobbyist in Chicago for a health care equipment company. Hillis\nhelped Walker raise money for his gubernatorial campaign and grew that\nnetwork of supporters during his recall election. Now she\'s preparing to\ntake on her biggest role yet in a presidential campaign, helping to bring\nin new donors and introduce Walker to potential high-dollar supporters he\nmight not otherwise meet.\n\n\n\n"I haven\'t encountered anybody that was a supporter in the recall that\nisn\'t going to be a supporter in the presidential," Hillis said, although\nshe acknowledged fundraising for a candidate in a crowded presidential\nfield is a different battle than raising money for a recall race outside of\nthe normal campaign cycle.\n\n\n\nWalker\'s team isn\'t above courting the moneyed donors other campaigns are\nchasing either. Hillis often speaks to potential donors who are drawn to\nWalker and might be inclined to give hundreds of thousands of dollars, but\nthey are also being courted by the Bush campaign. Her pitch: Let me get you\non the phone with the governor.\n\n\n\n"Scott is willing to have very frank conversations," Hillis said. "He\'s\nwilling to be educated on a subject and open to changing his mind. He\'s a\nreasonable person."\n\n\n\nWalker\'s allies said they don\'t expect him to be among the most flush in\nthe field this quarter. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is expected to raise a\njaw-dropping sum for the quarter that ended June 30. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\nand the super PAC supporting him claim to have raise nearly $50 million\ncombined.\n\n\n\nWhile the first reporting period is significant, members of Walker\'s team\nsaid they are focused on building a team of bundlers who can steadily\nbroaden his financial base by pitching the governor\'s message to an\never-widening circle of new donors.\n\n\n\n"I\'m looking for the people, men or women, that are focused on being\ninvolved in the process aggressively," said Michael Morgan, 44 years old,\nwho is raising money for Walker. "If that means raising thousands of\ndollars at the start, I\'m happy with it. Hopefully that will graduate to\ntens of thousands of dollars."\n\n\n\nMorgan is no stranger to political fundraising. He organized the finance\noperations for Sen. Mark Kirk\'s House and Senate bids and remains a staunch\nsupporter of the Illinois Republican. But Morgan\'s upcoming stint as one of\nWalker\'s finance co-chairs in Illinois will be his most prominent role in a\npresident campaign.\n\n\n\nWalker\'s "testing-the-waters committee," a precursor to his official\ncampaign, is asking bundlers to raise $27,000 by July 12th. Morgan said it\ntook him just four days to surpass that goal. All of the early contributor\nwere under the age of 50.\n\n\n\n"It\'s been a good pace I would say," Morgan said of his fundraising efforts\nso far. "Now that the announcement is imminent there\'s a lot more interest."\n\n\n\n*Scott Walker plans post-announcement blitz, NH stops\n<http://www.unionleader.com/article/20150707/NEWS0605/150709414#sthash.JJvNbTY3.dpuf>\n// Union Leader // Dan Tuohy \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, following his announcement July 13 in his\nstate, will travel to Manchester and Portsmouth later that week, the Union\nLeader has learned.\n\n\n\nThe New Hampshire visit is part of an early state blitz.\n\n\n\nWalker is one of the few big names yet to announce a presidential campaign\nfor the Republican nomination. The likely candidate has telegraphed some of\nhis key focus, such as a pitch as a Republican reformer and fiscal and\nsocial conservative.\n\n\n\nWalker, who in mid-June created a "testing the waters" committee as a\nprecursor to a presidential campaign launch, visited New Hampshire in March\nand April. He addressed a GOP grassroots training session in Concord in\nMarch, and he was one of the potential presidential hopefuls addressing the\nstate GOP\'s "First in the Nation Leadership Summit" in Nashua in April.\n\n\n\nHe would become the 15th Republican candidate in the race. The other\nRepublican yet to announce is Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\n\n\n\n*Scott Walker\'s Home Crowd Disadvantage\n<http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/jamie-stiehm/2015/07/07/can-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-win-over-home-state-crowd-in-2016-bid>\n// US News // Jamie Stiehm \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nUnder the July sun, you may spot political squalls on the horizon of this\ngreen city\'s Lake Mendota. That\'s what you get when a Republican red\ngovernor runs for president in a state that usually breaks Democratic blue\non the electoral map.\n\n\n\nWhether that governor would actually carry his own state \xe2\x80\x93 with a fairly\nliberal, active electorate \xe2\x80\x93 in the general presidential election in 2016\nis quite the parlor game.\n\n\n\nWord\'s going door to door in this capital city that Gov. Scott Walker is\nofficially running for president, with a launch planned on July 13. All the\ntalk about him walking the walk to the White House is getting real now,\nhere in the state where the Republican Party itself was founded in the\n1850s: Wisconsin. This is also a state, by the way, where the Progressive\nParty has deep roots.\n\n\n\nWalker plans to make political hay out of being the only Midwesterner in\nthe Republican presidential field, now top-heavy with Southerners. "Midwest\n[is] key to Walker strategy," the Wisconsin State Journal noted. Riding his\nHarley-Davidson (the company is headquartered in Milwaukee) is part of the\nplain folks image. Of course, if Ohio Gov. John Kasich jumps into the pool\nof contenders, that could change the Walker formula that starts with a\nstrong early victory in next-door Iowa come the frigid chill of February.\n(Only a Midwesterner knows how bad it can be.)\n\n\n\nBut feelings about Walker are decidedly mixed here in the state capital,\nwith some bitter memories of a movement to recall him that failed. Walker\nsurvived the challenge to his approach on collective bargaining with public\nemployees. The victory made him a conservative media darling in the\nnational spotlight a few years back. It also attracted checks from the\nconservative Koch brothers. Walker was subsequently re-elected governor,\nbut his support in Wisconsin has been "waning" recently, according to the\nWisconsin State Journal.\n\n\n\nHere\'s the irony: The harder Walker runs to the right to cement his\nposition as a conservative front-runner for his party\'s primary nomination,\nthe less popular he is at home, even with Republican state lawmakers. A\nmove to clamp down on the state\'s open-records law just went awry.The\nacademic community of the University of Wisconsin is warily anticipating\nyet another showdown: Walker may (or may not) declare war on the\ntraditional tenure system. That\'s sure to win him debating points and\nvotes, but might hurt him here at home. Another weakness Walker will likely\nbe forced to face: His 2010 campaign promise to create a ton of new jobs is\nfalling flat in Wisconsin\'s sluggish economy.\n\n\n\nWalker is not a guy people feel neutral about, a stand-out even in a\npolarized era. Curiously, his political idol is Ronald Reagan, yet he has\nnone of the genial charm that helped Reagan voters cross political lines.\nAs my dad, a Wisconsinite, observed, most politicians like to be liked, but\nnot Walker. Indeed the governor seems to relish his unpopularity with the\nother side, refusing to moderate harsh opposition to reproductive rights\nand to same-sex marriage. And he\'s enraged University of Wisconsin\nsupporters by suggesting budget cuts for the renowned research institution,\nwhile proposing the Milwaukee Bucks receive millions of public funds for a\nnew professional basketball arena.\n\n\n\nHere in bookish Madison, anyway, it balances out well: Many in the liberal\nprofessoriate love to hate Walker, and, by some law of political physics,\nhe loves to be hated by them. The governor\'s mansion in Maple Bluff is on\nthe other side of Lake Mendota from the university\'s colorful Memorial\nUnion Terrace.\n\n\n\nLucky. But watch for squalls.\n\n\n\n*The magical, disappearing Scott Walker conversation\n<http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-magical-disappearing-scott-walker-conversation>\n// MSNBC // Steve Benen \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nThe chief economist at the Heritage Foundation is itself an awkward title \xe2\x80\x93\nthe Republican think tank has moved away from its pretense of rigorous\npolicy analysis \xe2\x80\x93 but the job belongs to Stephen Moore. Earlier this year,\nafter Moore published a bizarre piece criticizing the Affordable Care Act,\nPaul Krugman described the conservative as \xe2\x80\x9ca guy who has a troubled\nrelationship with facts.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKrugman added at the time, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that he\xe2\x80\x99s a slick dissembler; I\nmean that [Moore] seems more or less unable to publish an article without\nfilling it with howlers \xe2\x80\xa6 in a way that ends up doing his cause a\ndisservice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis assessment came to mind last night, reading this New York Times report\non a bizarre incident involving Moore and a leading Republican presidential\ncandidate.\n\nLast Wednesday, Stephen Moore, a scholar at the Heritage Foundation who is\nan outspoken supporter of an immigration overhaul, described a recent\ntelephone call with Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, in which he said Mr.\nWalker had assured him he had not completely renounced his earlier support\nfor a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not going nativist, I\xe2\x80\x99m pro-immigration,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Walker said,\naccording to Mr. Moore\xe2\x80\x99s account of the call to a reporter for The New York\nTimes.\n\nOn Sunday, after three days of pressure from Mr. Walker\xe2\x80\x99s aides, Mr. Moore\nsaid that he had \xe2\x80\x9cmisspoken\xe2\x80\x9d when recounting his call with Mr. Walker \xe2\x80\x93 and\nthat the call had never actually taken place.\n\nThis one\xe2\x80\x99s a doozy, so let\xe2\x80\x99s back up for a moment and consider how we got\nto this point.\n\nScott Walker\xe2\x80\x99s position on immigration has been a garbled mess for months.\nThe Republican governor used to be quite moderate on the issue, but as he\nmoved closer to a national campaign, he quickly shifted to the far-right,\neven going so far as to attack legal immigration.\n\nIn private, however, Walker has hedged on his new-found posture, and in\nMarch, the Wisconsin governor reportedly told a New Hampshire audience \xe2\x80\x93\nbehind closed doors \xe2\x80\x93 that he supports a pathway to citizenship for\nundocumented immigrants already in the United States.\n\nWalker and his team denied the reports, but added little clarity to his\nactual position.\n\nWith this in mind, Moore, a reform proponent, told the New York Times last\nweek that he had a recent phone conversation with Walker, and heard\ndirectly from the unannounced candidate that he was \xe2\x80\x9cnot going nativist\xe2\x80\x9d\nand does not oppose immigration.\n\nThis, of course, raised questions anew within the GOP \xe2\x80\x93 is Walker saying\none thing in private and something else in public? Is the governor simply\npandering, offering half-hearted promises to the right on a key issue?\nMoore\xe2\x80\x99s on-the-record comments naturally reinforced fears within the party.\n\nWhich led to yesterday, when Moore reversed course entirely. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that\nhe misunderstood Walker\xe2\x80\x99s comments, the Heritage Foundation economist said,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s that Moore now says he never even spoke to the governor about\nimmigration at all.\n\nWhich version of the story is true is now anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible\nTeam Walker pressured Moore to take this new line; it\xe2\x80\x99s possible Moore\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t have the conversation he claimed to have.\n\nThe GOP governor could help clear things up, at least a little, by taking a\nfirm position and sticking to it, but for now, that\xe2\x80\x99s apparently asking too\nmuch. From last night\xe2\x80\x99s New York Times report: \xe2\x80\x9cSo, what exactly is Mr.\nWalker\xe2\x80\x99s current position on immigration? Asked if he supported any path to\ncitizenship or legal status for illegal immigrants, Mr. Walker\xe2\x80\x99s\nspokeswoman, AshLee Strong, did not directly respond.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Busted!: Walker Admits Role in Failed Government Secrecy Rule\n<http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/walker-admits-role-open-records> //\nTPM // Tierney Sneed \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nAfter days of dodging questions about whether Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\n(R) was involved in a failed proposal to dismantle the state\'s open records\nlaw, the governor\'s office confirmed Tuesday that his office was involved\nin the measure.\n\n\n\n"Legislative leaders let us know that they were interested in making\nchanges to the open records law. In response, our staff provided input\nregarding these proposed changes," Laurel Patrick, the press secretary for\nthe governor, said in an email to TPM.\n\n\n\n"Our intent with these changes was to encourage a deliberative process with\nstate agencies in developing policy and legislation. This allows for robust\ndebate with state agencies and public employees over the merit of policies\nand proposed initiatives as they are being formed, while ensuring materials\nrelated to final proposals, as well as information related to external\nstakeholders seeking to influence public policy, would remain fully\ntransparent."\n\n\n\nThe admission came shortly after Republican legislative leaders said Walker\naides had been involved in writing the proposal, which would have removed\ncertain communications and other legislative documents from under the scope\nof the state\'s transparency laws and would have permitted lawmakers not to\ncomply with other kinds of public records requests.\n\n\n\nThe language was initially approved by a party-line vote in the\nlegislature\'s Joint Finance Committee late Thursday evening before the\nholiday weekend, as part of a larger budget package known as Motion 999. As\nbacklash began to mount, Walker, joined by top GOP state lawmakers,\nannounced Saturday that the provisions would be dropped from the package.\n\n\n\nScrutiny continued, however, as to whether Walker was behind the measure,\nas he faces a lawsuit for refusing to turn over certain documents in a\npublic records request.\n\n\n\nSome Republican lawmakers in the state have continued to defend the effort,\nand say they will try to move alterations to public records law forward as\nstandalone legislation that would go through the typical public review\nprocess, instead of attaching it to a budget bill.\n\n\n\n"Our focus remains on ensuring open and accountable government and we\nencourage public debate and discussion of any potential future changes to\nthe state\'s open records law," Patrick, the governor\'s spokeswoman, said in\nthe email\n\n\n\n*KASICH*\n\n\n\n*Kasich: Obama administration \xe2\x80\x98in love\xe2\x80\x99 with Iran deal\n<http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/07/kasich-obama-administration-in-love-with-iran-deal/>\n// Fox News \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nGov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, said on \xe2\x80\x9cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\xe2\x80\x9d Tuesday\nthat the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s push for a nuclear deal with Iran shows\n\xe2\x80\x9cit\'s very dangerous to fall in love with your own idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the administration has probably fallen in love with the fact that\nthey want to get an agreement, and when people are hyperventilating and\nunable to get one, sometimes they go and they sign something that they\nshouldn\'t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kasich, who is expected to announce his intention to run\nfor president in the upcoming weeks.\n\n\n\nNegotiators from Iran, Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the\nUnited States meeting in Vienna did not meet their self-imposed deadline on\nTuesday for an agreement on a deal to curb Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program. Sticking\npoints in reaching an agreement include Iranian demands for the lifting of\na U.N. arms embargo and ballistic missiles sanctions, a timeframe for U.S.\nand EU sanctions relief, and future Iranian nuclear research and\ndevelopment.\n\n\n\nKasich said that the Obama administration should be prepared to walk away\nfrom a bad deal, and cited the example of President Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s negotiations\nwith the Soviet Union.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust remember Reagan in Reykjavik where Gorbachev said, look, get rid of\nall nuclear weapons, and I remember Reagan getting back in the car and\nsaying \xe2\x80\x98no, we\'re not gonna do that,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Kasich said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, you have to have the strength to walk away. The problem, Bret, with\nall of this is just listen to our Arab friends who say, \'listen, if you\ngive the Iranians all this cash by lifting the sanctions, they\'re going to\nfund Hamas. They\'re going to fund Hezbollah\' who is the enemy to the Arab\nnations that we have things in common with,\xe2\x80\x9d Kasich said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, I don\'t think it\'s a good agreement, I would leave the sanctions in\nplace until I saw a determined change in what Iran is all about, so I\nthink, I\'m very concerned about this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*John Kasich Tries To Gin Up Interest In Presidential Bid\n<http://dailycaller.com/2015/07/07/john-kasich-tries-to-gin-up-interest-in-presidential-bid/>\n// The Daily Caller // Alex Pappas \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015*\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate this,\xe2\x80\x9d Ohio Gov. John Kasich said Tuesday afternoon to\nthe several dozen reporters waiting for him in the lobby of the Republican\nNational Committee headquarters. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it\xe2\x80\x99d be three people here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as you probably know, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have a big announcement on the\n21st,\xe2\x80\x9d Kasich said, teasing his expected entrance into the presidential\nrace in a few weeks. \xe2\x80\x9cAnybody coming?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt could be about my political career. Or it could be that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\nHollywood,\xe2\x80\x9d the former congressman cracked. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFor now, Kasich\xe2\x80\x99s biggest task is getting his poll numbers up.\n\n\n\nAs of this week, Kasich is polling at just one and two percent in most\nnational polls, putting him in 13th place, according to the Real Clear\nPolitics polling average. That\xe2\x80\x99s a problem for someone trying to position\nhimself as a top-tier alternative to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\n\n\nThe first nationally televised debate is set for next month in Ohio, but\nFox News \xe2\x80\x94 Kasich\xe2\x80\x99s former employer \xe2\x80\x94 says only the Republicans who poll in\nthe top 10 will be included in the showdown. (A b-team forum will be held\nfor the Republicans who don\xe2\x80\x99t poll in the top 10 the same day as the\ndebate).\n\n\n\nAsked about whether\xe2\x80\x99s he concerned Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s recent popularity with\nvoters will keep him off the debate stage, Kasich replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not really\nthinking about it. I got other issues I got to think about.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s not put carts before horses,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, we still have a\nmonth to go. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPressed on whether he thinks he will get his poll numbers up and make it\ninto the top-tier debate, he replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t make predictions. I left\nthat to Muhammad Ali years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAsked during the press conference by a reporter about Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s recent\ncomments about illegal immigrants from Mexico, Kasich said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, first of\nall, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really respond to anybody\xe2\x80\x99s comments.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut Kasich went on to say he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with Trump\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccharacterization\xe2\x80\x9d\nbecause he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ca believer that the country needs to be unified, not divided.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least for the next couple weeks, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to honor Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s 11th\ncommandment about attacking fellow Republicans,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\n\nAsked why he\xe2\x80\x99s getting in the race later than others, Kasich said he\xe2\x80\x99s been\nfocused on Ohio.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOhio is a big state,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated state. It\xe2\x80\x99s a microcosm\nof the country. So I needed to take care of Ohio and continue to take care\nof Ohio before I worry about any national prominence or anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA reporter asked Kasich about how he\xe2\x80\x99s been compared to Jon Huntsman, the\nformer Republican governor who entered the 2012 race with much buzz only to\nperform poorly.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never really studied his campaign, or frankly others,\xe2\x80\x9d Kasich said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not something I spend a lot of time on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got John Weaver working with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of Huntsman\xe2\x80\x99s former top\ncampaign aide. \xe2\x80\x9cI just talked to him a few minutes ago. He was actually a\nbig senior adviser to McCain. Last time I checked, he was the nominee a few\nelection cycles ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMaking his pitch, Kasich referenced his re-election in 2014. \xe2\x80\x9cI won 86 out\nof 88 counties, 63 percent of the women vote, 51 percent of union\nhouseholds in one of the largest victories in Ohio history. There must be\nsomething that I\xe2\x80\x99m doing right there in order to do that in what\xe2\x80\x99s one of\nthe most pivotal states.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nKasich also portrayed himself as someone who gets the struggles of regular\npeople.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m John Kasich,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not anybody else. I come from McKees\nRocks. My father carried mail on his back. I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived in a town where if\nthe wind blew the wrong way, people found themselves out of work. And I\nthink I understand the anxieties of people in this country, many of whom\nare middle class, who wonder if the American dream is over. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nbelieve that it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAdded Kasich: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of blessings in my life. The Lord\xe2\x80\x99s been good\nto me. And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do my best to lead and to improve people\xe2\x80\x99s lives\nwhether I sit in the White House or whether in the white house in Lanetta\nAvenue in Westerville Ohio in being governor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nKasich said he is in town visiting former colleagues and for a meeting of\nhis new steering committee of lawmakers and members of the business\ncommunity this evening.\n\n\n\nThe governor said he brought his twin daughters along for the Washington\ntrip too. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve learned an awful lot about Snapchat.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*OTHER*\n\n\n\n*Candidates Start Showing Their Cards\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-08/candidates-start-showing-their-cards>\n// Bloomberg // Joshua Gallu - July 8, 2015*\n\n\n\nKa-CHING! Some candidates and super-PACs just can\'t wait for the filing\ndeadlines to share their good new$.\n\n\n\nThe 2016 presidential money race is starting to take shape and early\nindications are that the road ahead will be lined with bullion.\n\n\n\nAmong the candidates who have shared fundraising numbers, ahead of filing\ndeadlines later this month at the Federal Election Commission, Hillary\nClinton, not surprisingly, leads the Democratic field with  her campaign\nand allied groups reporting a combined war chest of nearly $70 million.\nEven Bernie Sanders, who describes himself as an independent socialist,\nsays he has already lined up $15 million, from primarily smaller donations,\nto wage his campaign.\n\n\n\nIn typical form, candidates with good news have come out touting their\nnumbers ahead of the official July 15 reporting date. Ted Cruz, who critics\nsaid would have trouble finding well-heeled backers, is boasting  a $51.2\nmillion arsenal, most of which in super-PACs, which can accept unlimited\namounts of money but can\'t coordinate directly with the campaign. The chart\nbelow outlines numbers reported by the candidates themselves, super-PACs\nthat are explicitly allied with and validated by presidential campaigns and\nother groups, such as 501(c)4 organizations that raise money to help a\nfavored candidate.\n\n\n\nNow, all eyes are on Jeb Bush. According to Buzzfeed, Bush\'s Right to Rise\nsuper-PAC says it has already pulled in enough money to give his opponents\n"heart attacks.\'"\n\n\n\n*Inside the GOP\xe2\x80\x99s Effort to Close the Campaign-Science Gap With Democrats\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2015-07-08/inside-the-gop-s-effort-to-close-the-campaign-science-gap-with-democrats>\n// Bloomberg // Sasha Issenberg - July 8, 2015 *\n\n\n\nA Republican group aims to emulate President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s campaigns by bringing\nrigorous testing to campaign tactics. One problem: Not enough Republican\nscientists.\n\n\n\nThis spring, the Cato Institute identified 600 Americans who read more than\n20 books per year and made arrangements to send them each one more. The\nlibertarian think tank split these readers into three groups. One group\nreceived a free copy of Ayn Rand\xe2\x80\x99s Atlas Shrugged, one got longtime Cato\nexecutive David Boaz\xe2\x80\x99s The Libertarian Mind, and one a book that Cato\nscholars considered a useful placebo to free-market doctrine: the Bible.\nAfter three months, six months, and 12 months, members of all three groups\nwould be surveyed to see if the unsolicited books they had received could\nexplain differential response rates to one question: Do you consider\nyourself a libertarian?\n\n\n\nThe Cato researcher behind the project explained to other members of a\nbelow-the-radar Republican group known as the Center for Strategic\nInitiatives, or CSI, that the 600 books were just part of a pilot test. If\nthe design appeared to work properly, the experiment would be replicated on\na larger scale: 12,000 books this time. \xe2\x80\x9cPolitical books have never been\ntested,\xe2\x80\x9d says David Kirby, now a vice president and senior fellow at Cato.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink tanks think that books persuade people. Do they?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nVery few other members of the CSI circle had ever used books as tools for\nchanging minds. A range of political consultants and vendors, they tended\nto trade in more ephemeral modes of communication: television ads and\nrobocalls, direct mail, digital ads, and door knocks. But they were there\nfor the same reason that Kirby had been willing to entertain the perfidy of\nusing Cato resources to question whether reading Ayn Rand actually led\npeople to libertarianism\xe2\x80\x94a willingness to take everything they thought they\nknew about what works in politics and hold it up to empirical\ninvestigation.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were disappointed in 2012 with how much money we spent and how little\nwe had to show for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDavid Kirby, vice president and senior fellow, Cato Institute\n\nThe mere existence of the CSI field experiments seminar represents the\nright\xe2\x80\x99s most constructive engagement with the continued traumas of its loss\nin the 2012 Presidential race\xe2\x80\x94not just the fact that it had lost, but that\nit didn\xe2\x80\x99t know at the time it was losing, and even afterward was at a\nfurther loss to understand how or why it had done so. While many\nRepublicans responded by conceding catch-phrase-ready deficiencies\xe2\x80\x94a need\nto do more and better with Big Data or the Ground Game\xe2\x80\x94others were willing\nto acknowledge that the underlying problem was the lack of a culture within\nthe GOP to encourage innovation. For a small but significant share of the\nparty\xe2\x80\x99s electioneering class, however, any true reckoning with 2012 invites\na deeper epistemological crisis about how to run smarter campaigns in the\n21st century.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe should not assume anything. Absolutely every aspect of the campaign,\nfrom the best way to knock on doors to the best way to broadcast\ntelevision, should be tested,\xe2\x80\x9d says Blaise Hazelwood, a Republican\nvoter-contact specialist who founded CSI. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the way I did it on this\ncampaign that won, so this is the way we should do it on all campaigns,\xe2\x80\x9d\nHazelwood says, mocking the prevailing sentiment of entrenched political\nconsultants. \xe2\x80\x9cThe test for them is whether they win or lose on election\nday. That cannot be a valid test.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe conservative establishment has a long tradition of organized\ngatherings. First there were Paul Weyrich\xe2\x80\x99s weekly \xe2\x80\x9ccoalitions\xe2\x80\x9d lunches,\nheld on Wednesdays when Congress was in session. Anti-tax activist Grover\nNorquist later claimed the breakfast slot that day, his sessions focused\nmore on economic policy than social issues. Donors and journalists in New\nYork started meeting one Monday per month for an hour and a half; after\nrelocating to South Carolina, Monday Meeting founder Mallory Factor took\nthe concept south with him, launching the Charleston Meeting. All these\nwere devoted to ideological cohesion and legislative strategy, the matching\nof like-minded donors and politicians. They tended to reaffirm certainties,\nrather than challenge them.\n\n\n\nThe CSI circle has yet to fall into a reliable schedule, and its\ngatherings\xe2\x80\x94which now take place roughly every six weeks or so at Cato\xe2\x80\x99s\nWashington headquarters\xe2\x80\x94already mark a very different mode of\ncollaboration. There is not a politician in sight, or many brand-name\noperatives; few attendees appear to be over the age of 40. This sphere of\npolitical operatives and party hacks angling to remake Republican campaigns\nincludes strategists and tacticians for many of the party\xe2\x80\x99s top\npresidential candidates, along with staffers from the Republican National\nCommittee and consultants attached to various elements of the Koch\npolitical network.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sense it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the few places where the warring factions of the\nconservative side of the aisle play together in the same sandbox,\xe2\x80\x9d says\nColumbia University political scientist Don Green, who has advised the\ngroup since its launch. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have people who are close to the Tea Party and\npeople who are antagonistic towards the Tea Party, and they\xe2\x80\x99re all trying\nto learn from the same research method.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAbout 50 people responded to Hazelwood\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to gather at Cato in\nearly June and, arrayed before her that Thursday afternoon, at long tables\nin lecture-hall formation, the schisms of the Republican Party in the early\ndays of the presidential campaign were unmistakable. One of the people she\nhad invited to present research that day came from Deep Root Analytics,\nwhich former Florida Governor Jeb Bush\'s presidential campaign has hired to\nhelp target its television ads. Another presenter represented FLC Connect,\na phone vendor that has worked for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and has\nclose links to his campaign-in-waiting. A pair of analysts from 0ptimus\nconsulting, now advising Florida Senator Marco Rubio, sat in the back of\nthe room, not far from where the founders of Targeted Victory, the firm\nformer Texas Governor Rick Perry has hired to handle digital advertising\nand media analytics, found seats after arriving a few minutes after  the\nscheduled 3:30 start time. Hazelwood herself is a longtime advisor to\nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, through her firm Grassroots Consulting,\nand has since joined his allied super-PAC as a consultant. She began by\nreminding those in attendance of CSI\xe2\x80\x99s one rule: What they were about to\nhear was off the record. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk questions like you usually do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAttack our speakers, like sometimes happens.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHazelwood has been asking and answering some of the toughest questions in\nRepublican politics for years. Shortly after the 2012 elections, she faced\none from Sally Bradshaw: What did Republicans need to do to improve their\nelectoral mechanics? A longtime adviser to Bush, Bradshaw was one of five\nparty eminences who had been tapped by Republican National Committee\nChairman Reince Priebus to oversee the Growth and Opportunity Project, the\npostmortem report its authors were repeatedly instructed not to describe\npublicly as an \xe2\x80\x9cautopsy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nTwelve years earlier, Hazelwood had been in a similar position when, as the\nRNC\xe2\x80\x99s political director, she had organized what was known as the 72-Hour\nTask Force to fine-tune field operations that Karl Rove and other top\nadvisers to President George W. Bush blamed for his unexpectedly narrow\nvictory. Starting in 2001, Hazelwood deployed dozens of controlled tests in\nlow-profile elections, usually with the goal of convincing party officials\nand activists that it was worth investing in the infrastructure to support\nvolunteer-based voter contact. (Many of those tests were modeled on the\ntypes of field experiments conducted by social scientists, although not\nconducted to academic standards.)\n\n\n\nMany Republicans credited the findings of the 72-Hour Task Force with\nhelping Bush in his re-election, but after his victory, the culture that\nhad incubated them withered away. When one of Green\xe2\x80\x99s prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9s approached\nan official on the Indiana Republican Party\xe2\x80\x99s 2006 coordinated campaign\nasking if he could integrate experiments into the party\xe2\x80\x99s efforts, there\nwas only one question that mattered: Was the political scientist \xe2\x80\x9cin the\nfamily\xe2\x80\x9d? That described a very specific qualification\xe2\x80\x94having worked on one\nof the two Bush-Cheney campaigns\xe2\x80\x94and it was not on David Nickerson\xe2\x80\x99s CV.\nSoon, though, Nickerson had a Ph.D. from Yale, then an associate\nprofessorship at Notre Dame, and then, in 2012, a title that had never\nbefore existed in the history of presidential politics: director of\nexperiments at Obama for America.\n\n\n\nNickerson\xe2\x80\x99s trajectory confirmed the extent to which Obama-era Democratic\noperatives have scientized the project of electioneering. The party\xe2\x80\x99s\nascendant young operatives\xe2\x80\x94notably Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign\nmanager\xe2\x80\x94nearly all had formative experience working on voter contact\n(rather than strategizing communications or managing political\nrelationships) in a period of technical transformation. They were\nconditioned to see every aspect of citizen behavior as potentially\npredictable through statistical modeling, and everything a campaign did to\nshape it as a potentially testable hypothesis. Meanwhile, the fractured\nremnants of the Bush-era Republican Party did not indulge such curiosity\nwithin its ranks, and when it did emerge, did little to channel it\nproductively. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter 2004 the drive just left. It was no longer there\xe2\x80\x94we no\nlonger did the testing and we ended up where we ended up in 2012. We just\nkind of stopped,\xe2\x80\x9d Hazelwood says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was terribly frustrating after 2012\nto see what happened, and know we needed to get back to testing, and having\nthat housed in one place to help all conservatives.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHazelwood made the case to Bradshaw that the party should take the\ninitiative in spurring such a cultural shift, albeit with a different\nobjective than the one that had inspired the 72-Hour Task Force tests.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack then we framed it completely differently. It was, \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re getting back\nto grassroots and showing why grassroots works,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Hazelwood explains. \xe2\x80\x9cNow\nit\xe2\x80\x99s about tests, and getting to test return on investment and how you\nmeasure efficiency and effectiveness.\xe2\x80\x9d Hazelwood helped Bradshaw rewrite\nthe task force report\'s section on \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign mechanics\xe2\x80\x9d to offer its\nimprimatur for what had become her pet project. Republicans should\n\xe2\x80\x9cidentify a team of strategists and funders to build a data analytics\ninstitute that can capture and distill best practices for communication to\nand targeting of specific voters,\xe2\x80\x9d as the report put it. \xe2\x80\x9cUsing the GOP\xe2\x80\x99s\ndata, the data analytics institute would work to develop a specific set of\ntests for 2013 and 2014\xe2\x80\x94tests on voter registration, persuasion,\nGet-Out-The-Vote, and voter mobilization\xe2\x80\x94that will then be adopted into\nfuture programs to ensure that our voter contact and targeting dollars are\nspent on proven performance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe report cautiously avoided suggesting that the RNC incubate or host such\nan institute itself. The national party was a subject of more distrust\namong conservative activists than it had been during the early Bush years,\nand after Citizens United even more political spending was being driven by\ngroups that were legally forbidden from coordinating with the party or its\ncandidates. Hazelwood found a model for such a \xe2\x80\x9cdata analytics institute\xe2\x80\x9d\nin the organization that had paved Nickerson\xe2\x80\x99s way into Democratic\ncampaigns after he was turned away by Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s Republicans. In 2007,\nsimilarly driven to self-examination by their inability to dislodge an\nincumbent president they assumed was beatable, a group of lefty operatives\nlaunched the Analyst Institute, to serve as a \xe2\x80\x9cclearinghouse for\nevidence-based best practices in progressive voter contact.\xe2\x80\x9d To do so, they\nformalized a series of \xe2\x80\x9cgeek lunches,\xe2\x80\x9d held at the AFL-CIO, at which\nindividual operatives and researchers presented the scattered experiments\nthey had been running on their own, into a stand-alone entity. Since then,\nthe Analyst Institute\xe2\x80\x99s work has transformed the techniques of Democratic\ncampaigners in the Obama era, and eventually contracted to embed its\nanalysts in the president\xe2\x80\x99s re-election effort in 2012. Hazelwood decided\nto structure her project similarly, as a for-profit consulting firm that\ncould operate with little concern for ever turning a profit, a status that\nallows it to work with parties and campaigns as clients without being\nsubject to disclosure laws itself. Hazelwood was transparent in her debt to\nthe Analyst Institute, down to the unhelpfully abstract name.\n\n\n\nShe pitched her new effort to collaborators across the right, eager to take\nadvantage of the oddball calendar of off-year elections to begin running\ntests. There was one in Massachusetts, where the American Crossroads\nsuper-PAC  agreed to randomly assign its robocalls on behalf of Gabriel\nGomez, a first-time candidate challenging Representative Ed Markey to\nreplace John Kerry in the Senate. In Minneapolis\xe2\x80\x99s mayoral campaign that\nsame year, Hazelwood worked with the pro-business Minnesota Jobs Coalition\nto test what type of messaging works best to boost a conservative candidate\nin a officially non-partisan race with a large fragmented field.\n\n\n\nIn parallel, Kirby was also digging more deeply into experiments. He had\nspent 2012 working at FreedomWorks, the well-funded conservative grassroots\norganization that had invested heavily in field activity designed to help\nelect a Republican president and a more conservative Congress. Kirby\nemerged from the experience resentful of the the confidence political\nprofessionals brought to their decisions about tactical approaches. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\nwere disappointed in 2012 with how much money we spent and how little we\nhad to show for it,\xe2\x80\x9d Kirby says. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt integrity-bound to ask whether we\ncould do any better.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nKirby was drawn to the experimental method as a tool for resolving that\ncuriosity. He signed up for a brief summer course on randomized trials\ntaught by Green, the Columbia political scientist recognized as his\ndiscipline\xe2\x80\x99s most prominent evangelist for field experiments as the only\ntool capable of truly disentangling cause and effect in campaigns. (Green\xe2\x80\x99s\nwork recently gained broader attention when he was forced to retract a\npaper he had published in the journal Science, about the effectiveness of\nsending gay canvassers to advocate for same-sex marriage, amid accusations\nthat his co-author Michael LaCour had falsified survey data.) Green was\ninspired by Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm, and\xe2\x80\x94after years of finding growing interest\nin his methods from from labor unions, environmental advocates, and ACORN\n\xe2\x80\x94the opportunity to see if conservative targets responded differently to\npolitical communication than liberal ones. \xe2\x80\x9cAlmost all the research to date\nhas been on the left or center-left. Very little of it has been on the\ncenter-right or right,\xe2\x80\x9d Green says. \xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t a base of knowledge about\nthe message, the messenger, and the audience they care about.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nKirby was interested in starting with lawn signs. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the most elemental\npolitical tactic,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cAt FreedomWorks we spent probably at least a\nmillion dollars on that\xe2\x80\x94hundreds and thousands of yard signs.\xe2\x80\x9d Yard signs\nwere often held up as an example of wasteful and pointless campaign\nspending (\xe2\x80\x9cyard signs don\xe2\x80\x99t vote\xe2\x80\x9d is a frequent refrain of the bien pensant\npolitical class), although there was little empirical evidence to sustain\nthat skepticism. The limited research literature could be attributed partly\nto methodological complications\xe2\x80\x94it is not easy to control for the spillover\neffects of, say, voters who drive past signs in a precinct other than the\none in which they vote\xe2\x80\x94but some stemmed from a lack of obvious incentive\nfor political professionals to run an experiment. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the case of lawn\nsigns, what\xe2\x80\x99s odd is if you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with a person who is deeply\nskeptical, they\xe2\x80\x99re not interested enough to do a test,\xe2\x80\x9d says Green. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople\nworking in low-salience races see them as their one and only affordable\ntactic and don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take out a control group.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWorking with Green, Kirby ran an experiment in which Virginia precincts\nwere isolated and then randomly assigned to have signs placed at a certain\ndensity in road medians, each of them photographed and geotagged so it\nwould be possible to monitor whether they were removed by opponents or\nvandals. The signs had little impact on election results in those\nprecincts, they believe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmaybe a glimmer of an effect\xe2\x80\x9d on both turnout and\nvote share, according to Green\xe2\x80\x94but given how cheap signs are to print and\nplace, the experimenters thought that they might have demonstrated that\nsigns might not be a total waste after all.\n\n\n\nKirby became an enthusiastic booster of Hazelwood\xe2\x80\x99s project. After he went\nto work at the Cato Institute in early 2014, he offered one of the think\ntank\xe2\x80\x99s large conference rooms to host the right\xe2\x80\x99s version of the \xe2\x80\x9cgeek\nlunch.\xe2\x80\x9d The first CSI meeting, in late 2013, drew more than 100 people from\nacross conservative politics. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the right moment,\xe2\x80\x9d says Kirby.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople were curious.\xe2\x80\x9d Green led a three-hour introduction to the\nexperimental method, and encouraged attendees to think of it as a tool for\nassessing the effectiveness of their current tactics and auditioning new\nones. Many of the experiments that attendees concocted in response\xe2\x80\x94to test\ndirect mail and phone calls in relation to turnout\xe2\x80\x94addressed research\nquestions that some lefty groups felt they had settled through replication\nas much as a decade earlier. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t breaking any new ground,\xe2\x80\x9d Kirby\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cbut at least it was getting the muscles flexing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWithin the CSI circle, there is resignation that one cultural problem\nRepublicans face modernizing their campaigns remains beyond their immediate\ncontrol: Academic social scientists capable of designing, administering,\nand analyzing field experiments are overwhelmingly on the Democratic side.\nFor his part, Green\xe2\x80\x94with his politically catholic view toward\nexperimentation and promiscuous search for collaborators who will let him\ntest scientific theories in the real world\xe2\x80\x94remained something of a unicorn.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe left enjoys a lot of sympathetic academics and legions of\nideologically aligned grad students that we on the right just won\'t have\nthe same level of access to,\xe2\x80\x9d says Brian Stobie, a former official at the\nCharles Koch Institute who attempted to recruit academic collaborators to\ntest the Koch network\xe2\x80\x99s election-year operations before leaving to start\nhis own firm. (One political scientist approached for this article did not\nwant to acknowledge on the record any openness of graduate students to\npartner with conservative organizations on research projects, for fear of\ncausing the graduate students reputational damage.)\n\n\n\nThe emergence of the CSI circle has also unmasked a generational divide\nmore fundamental than the one between practitioners of online and offline\npoliticking that defines most press coverage of the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 technology\npredicament. There is a Web-savvy new guard that chafes against the\nold-line consultants who continue to profit from spending on television,\nphone, and mail. But these disputes\xe2\x80\x94about the percentage of a campaign\nbudget devoted to Web and mobile advertising, or whether a digital\nconsultant has a proverbial \xe2\x80\x9cseat at the table\xe2\x80\x9d on strategic decisions\xe2\x80\x94are\nlost on the CSI crowd, who have a scientific bent. Many there are eager to\ntake on the digital consultants and the grandiose claims some of the\ndigital people make, unchallenged, about their potential impact on\nelections. Those in the experimental set pronounce themselves agnostic\nabout tactics, interested only in those whose worth have been proven,\nempirically. What can be measured to deliver votes\xe2\x80\x94rather than just clicks\nor eyeballs\xe2\x80\x94and at what cost?\n\n\n\nLast May, strategist Dave Carney demonstrated for the CSI seminar what such\nskepticism could look like when put into practice. He and University of\nTexas political scientist Daron Shaw had come to present findings from a\ncomplicated series of experiments that Carney had invited Shaw to conduct\nwithin the gubernatorial campaign of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott.\n(The two had worked together on Perry\xe2\x80\x99s 2006 re-election, when Shaw and\nGreen served on a team of in-house experimenters that Carney named his\n\xe2\x80\x9ceggheads,\xe2\x80\x9d a collaboration that has produced more peer-reviewed papers\nthan any other campaign in history.) Shaw could have merely presented his\nfindings in the form of charts and graphs, but that would not have fully\nsatisfied Carney\xe2\x80\x99s preference for dramatic colloquy. He invited the\nconsultants and vendors whose services he had audited to be part of the\ndiscussion\xe2\x80\x94an equivalent of beauty-pageant contestants being forced to\nstand on stage while judges render a verdict on their presence and poise.\n\n\n\nShaw had randomized the delivery of $1.6 million worth of campaign\ncommunications\xe2\x80\x94across broadcast and cable television, a variety of digital\nformats, radio, and direct mail\xe2\x80\x94with effects measured at both individual\nand neighborhood units. Three entire media markets, including El Paso and\nAmarillo, were assigned to a control group that received no Abbott campaign\ncommunication over the course of that month. Unlike many studies, Carney\nhad begun by asking Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s consultants to devise plans at a budget that\nwould \xe2\x80\x9callow them to do what they needed to in order to produce an impact.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the most common criticisms one hears from practitioners about\npolitical science experiments is that the treatment is \xe2\x80\x98not what we\xe2\x80\x99d do in\na real campaign,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Shaw explained. \xe2\x80\x9cThe obvious solution is to give the\nprofessionals the resources and discretion to design and implement their\npreferred outreach within the context of the experiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nComparing polls conducted before and after the experiment, Shaw explained\nto the CSI seminar that three weeks of campaigning increased Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s\npopularity by nearly eight points among the voters he was trying to\npersuade, with targeted broadcast television buys doing so with the\ngreatest force. At the same time, voters in zip codes served Facebook and\nonline pre-roll video ads were less likely to support Abbott afterward, and\nturned out at the same rate as those who lived in areas that never received\nthe ads. (Shaw did find that, in some combinations, Internet advertising\ndid have a modestly positive impact on turnout, according to\nvoter-registration records updated after the primary.) Digital consultants\n\xe2\x80\x9cmight argue that the relatively modest effects associated with online\noutreach in our tests still constitute a more cost-effective investment\nthan broadcast television,\xe2\x80\x9d Shaw acknowledged in an article, which, as part\nof his deal with Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, he has submitted to political-science\njournals for publication.\n\n\n\nHis presentation of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Abbott Campaign Experiments: Persuasion and\nTurnout in Texas\xe2\x80\x9d wowed the CSI seminar, as much for its ambition and\naudacity as any specific finding. But to the disappointment of many\nattendees, few other consultants expressed an interest in mimicking\nCarney\xe2\x80\x99s adventurousness. \xe2\x80\x9cTesting, whether done on the right or left,\ntends to show that the majority of what you think \xe2\x80\x98works\xe2\x80\x99 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d says\nStobie, who after the 2012 election launched 0ptimus Consulting to conduct\nexperiments with the promise of helping clients to constrain their\nspending. \xe2\x80\x9cTo the majority of operatives and organizations, paying for the\nopportunity to find out much of what you are doing is ineffective is not an\nappealing investment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA few weeks ago, Hazelwood met Priebus for lunch at the Capitol Hill Club\nand handed over the results of an experimental study he had commissioned\nfrom her firm. Hazelwood\xe2\x80\x99s reputation had impressed Priebus long before the\ntwo first met, in 2009, back when he was a lawyer who oversaw field offices\nnear his Wisconsin home and had \xe2\x80\x9cdone every yard-sign job in the party you\ncan imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d Sharing a ticket with Bush in 2004 during a failed state\nSenate run, Priebus saw how, by \xe2\x80\x9cdividing states into turf, and measuring\noutcomes and metrics,\xe2\x80\x9d as he puts it, Hazelwood\xe2\x80\x99s internal reforms had\nmodernized the party\xe2\x80\x99s approach to field organizing. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve known her as the\nauthor of that concept,\xe2\x80\x9d Priebus says. \xe2\x80\x9cI really do understand the ground\ngame and what we need to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe 72-Hour Task Force had been established to convince local party\nactivists like Priebus that the ground game was not merely something one\ndid or didn\xe2\x80\x99t do\xe2\x80\x94that some tactical approaches to it were superior to\nothers. Hazelwood had isolated \xe2\x80\x9cprecinct organizing\xe2\x80\x9d (assigning a full-time\nfield staffer for a month), \xe2\x80\x9cGOP flushing\xe2\x80\x9d (indiscriminately turning out\nRepublican voters in the last two days before an election), and \xe2\x80\x9cvolunteer\ncalling\xe2\x80\x9d (compared to paid call centers) as three distinct activities, and\nsubjected each to separate tests. As a result of the impact\xe2\x80\x94two to three\npercentage points increase in turnout for each, they found\xe2\x80\x94the Task Force\nprescribed that Republican campaigns assign one person to be individually\nresponsible for every 40 to 100 voters. \xe2\x80\x9cBack to People Power,\xe2\x80\x9d an internal\nRNC presentation titled the recommendation at the time .\n\n\n\nAfter Bush\xe2\x80\x99s re-election, the party let much of that field infrastructure\nwither, along with the ethos behind and intellectual justification for it.\nDuring the years since, experiments have revealed a cognitive logic for\nunderstanding what mobilizes voters. Basic interactions immediately became\nmore potent when they were personalized in a way that introduced a sense of\nindividual responsibility around voting. Campaigns now frequently remind\ncitizens of their past history casting a ballot, and recruit them to sign\npledges to do so again. (One of Green\xe2\x80\x99s most famous tests, conducted with\nhis former Yale colleague Alan Gerber, sent voters a copy of their past\nregistration records with a threat to publicize a set after an election, so\nothers could see whether or not they voted. It proved the most effective\nget-out-the-vote technique ever measured.) The behavioral psychology behind\nsuch techniques gave new depth to campaigns\xe2\x80\x99 understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cpeople\npower.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHazelwood developed a hypothesis that people power could learn something\nfrom stalking. Campaigns have long thought of voter contact as part of a\nnarrative progression: a flight of six direct-mail pieces over which a\ncandidate\xe2\x80\x99s argument unfurls, or a \xe2\x80\x9clayered\xe2\x80\x9d approach in which phone calls\nand door-knocks are delivered in a deliberately choreographed sequence. But\ncampaigns rarely share these plans with voters, often preferring to let the\ninteractions speak for themselves and not draw undue attention to their\nvolume. Instead, Hazelwood thought it was time to mash up the various\ntactics that the 72-Hour Task Force had segregated into distinct programs.\nJust as the pledges and the vote-history techniques had, walking voters\nthrough the process as it was happening could produce a personal engagement\nwith the election.\n\n\n\nHazelwood was anxious that the party not let a busy midterm election year\npass without using every opportunity to hone tactics it could deploy in\nearnest in 2016. After San Diego announced a special mayoral election,\nscheduled for February 2014, Hazelwood convinced a friend managing\nRepublican Kevin Faulconer\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately succesful campaign to let CSI get\ninvolved. Hazelwood took command of some of the party\xe2\x80\x99s field programs\nthere, randomly assigning some areas to receive specialized attention from\nlocal precinct captains. When she was able to show that her tactics had\nincreased turnout by 8.5 percent among the party\xe2\x80\x99s so-called\n\xe2\x80\x9clow-propensity voters,\xe2\x80\x9d the party\xe2\x80\x99s chairman took notice.\n\n\n\nThat finding intersected neatly with what Priebus had identified as his\nparty\xe2\x80\x99s strategic challenge, and one of the areas the Growth and\nOpportunity Project had blamed for the party\xe2\x80\x99s inability to win the\npresidency or the Senate in 2012. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re a really good midterm party, but\nfor some reason presidential-year-only voters have been trouble for us,\xe2\x80\x9d\nPriebus says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we put people out in the field\xe2\x80\x94and we have a limited\namount of people and limited amount of time\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s the combination of\nthings we can do that have the best effect of turning out people who vote\nonly in presidential years?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOver the summer, Priebus signed off on Hazelwood\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to have CSI\nhelp answer that question. He was insistent that Hazelwood\xe2\x80\x99s experiments\nnot interfere with the party\xe2\x80\x99s plans to spend $105 million across key races\nin mitdterm battlegrounds. In three states, however, Hazelwood\xe2\x80\x99s firm was\npermitted to layer atop the party\xe2\x80\x99s extant organization an additional\nprecinct program that would target the type of low-propensity voters that\nRepublican strategists did not expect to necessarily vote in 2014, but knew\nthey needed to mobilize in 2016. After working with Hazelwood on how to\nstructure her study, Green directed her to enlist Oklahoma State University\nprofessor Brandon Lenoir, whom he had guided on another lawn-sign\nexperiment, for help implementing it. (There is such entrenched skepticism\nabout yard signs that Green has waited to publish until he has five\nexperiments, each conducted in distinct geographical and political\ncontexts, that can be assembled into a single paper with more comprehensive\nfindings than Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s alone.)\n\n\n\nIn nine counties across Colorado, Iowa, and Arkansas, Hazelwood\xe2\x80\x99s team\nworked with the state parties and the Republican Senate candidate to hire\ndedicated local organizers it called \xe2\x80\x9cprecinct captains.\xe2\x80\x9d Each was given a\nlist of voters who had cast a ballot in one or fewer of the past four major\nelections, with directions to visit each voter in mid-October for an\nintroductory conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cI was designated your Precinct Captain for the\nRepublican Party, for the duration of the election,\xe2\x80\x9d the canvassing script\ninstructed. Then, over the next few weeks, the precinct captain would make\ncontact four more times, in a specific order: again at the door, then by\nphone, followed by a postcard, and a then final door visit.  If the voter\nwas home each time, it meant a recurring interaction with an increasingly\nfamiliar neighborhood figure.\n\n\n\nIf the voter didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer the door or phone, however, the precinct captain\nwas instructed to make the missed encounter just as personally memorable.\nEach door hanger left behind should have a handwritten Post-it note\nattached to it, with a message that the \xe2\x80\x9cpersonalized note instructions\xe2\x80\x9d\nrecommended should say: \xe2\x80\x9cHi Mary, sorry I missed you today! \xe2\x80\xa6 I will be\nback in the neighborhood again next week and try to catch you then.\xe2\x80\x9d The\npostcard would pick up the theme: \xe2\x80\x9cI have stopped by your house a couple\ntimes and tried to call to make sure you have all the information you need\nto vote.\xe2\x80\x9d For a voter who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t home after two door visits and a phone\ncall, the next note would turn even more ominous: \xe2\x80\x9cI will keep checking the\nlist to see if you have voted and if not will drop by your house again to\nfollow up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOver the course of three weeks, Hazelwood\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstalker test\xe2\x80\x9d deployed some of\nthe most potent psychological tricks known to nudge a citizen into the act\nof voting\xe2\x80\x94along with some new ones\xe2\x80\x94all as part of a borderline-creepy\ncourtship that would be difficult to ignore. After the election, in which\nRepublicans won the Senate races in all three of those states, Green and\nLenoir found that it had a considerable impact, increasing turnout among\ntargets by between two and three percentage points. It had not been easy,\nthough, as stalking demanded attention, resources, and planning that\ncampaigns cannot always muster for their field programs (The report did not\ncalculate the cost of such contact, and it is certainly conceivable that at\na much lower price yard signs could prove more cost-effective\xe2\x80\x94if less\ntargetable\xe2\x80\x94than the elaborate program that required the same field staffer\nto be available for every interaction with an assigned voter.)\n\n\n\nWhen Hazelwood presented the analysis to Priebus at the Capitol Hill Club,\nshe put the paper that Green and Lenoir had written into a thick, glossy\nbrochure with far more elaborate graphics than are typically packaged with\nacademic articles. Priebus says the findings confirm what he had assumed\nabout the value of localized field programs that focus on sustained\npersonal contact, but now \xe2\x80\x9cI can take that information and go sell it to\nthe state parties, and go to into a boardroom to get people to cut a\ncheck.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe finding that most excited both Hazelwood and Priebus, however, grew out\nof an accident. In Colorado, canvassers were mistakenly assigned to go to\nsome of the party\xe2\x80\x99s reliable voters, who had cast ballots in all four of\nthe most recent elections. After being hounded by a precinct captain, they\nvoted at a lower rate than those who received no contact at all. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a\nproven fact now that we should stop calling these people,\xe2\x80\x9d Hazelwood says,\nwith comic impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cStop wasting time!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Republicans have won the battle over money in politics. Should anyone\ncelebrate?\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/07/republicans-have-won-the-battle-over-money-in-politics-should-anyone-celebrate/>\n// WaPo // Paul Waldman \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nAs the candidates for president have begun announcing their second-quarter\nfundraising hauls, a couple of things have become apparent. First, there is\na huge amount of money flowing into the campaign, even to some second-tier\ncandidates. And second, the campaign finance system is a joke.\n\n\n\nAs we now approach the anything-goes situation that Republicans have been\nadvocating for years, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to ask: Is this how we want things to work?\n\n\n\nRepublicans in particular should be asked that question, because they\xe2\x80\x99re\nthe ones who created this state of affairs and promised that it would be\ngood for everyone. Here are some of its characteristics: There will almost\ncertainly be more money spent in this election than ever before. A number\nof candidates have one billionaire benefactor promising to bankroll their\ncampaigns. The Federal Election Commission, deadlocked between its\nDemocratic and Republican members, has essentially stopped enforcing\ncampaign finance laws. The Internal Revenue Service has also all but given\nup enforcing the laws that govern tax-exempt nonprofits and their political\nactivities.\n\n\n\nThe campaigns are hauling in the cash. On Monday, Ted Cruz announced that\nhis campaign had $51 million dollars behind it, which included $37 million\nraised by pro-Cruz super PACs \xe2\x80\x94 so they\xe2\x80\x99re not even pretending that the\n\xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d groups are anything but an arm of the Cruz campaign. Hillary\nClinton has raised $45 million just since April, and we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting to hear\nwhether the Jeb Bush super PAC Right to Rise met its $100 million goal.\n\n\n\nThis is all enabled by the fact that although campaigns and super PACs are\nprohibited from \xe2\x80\x9ccoordinating\xe2\x80\x9d with each other, what counts as coordination\nhas become so limited that it\xe2\x80\x99s little more than a speed bump for campaigns\nand super PACs that are working together. They have nothing to fear from\nthe FEC, where Republicans always appoint commissioners who barely believe\nthere ought to be any regulation of campaign finance at all, and have\nsuccessfully ground enforcement to a halt. The agency has gone two years\nwithout anyone leading its legal office, and its own chairwoman says: \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nlikelihood of the laws being enforced is slim.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe situation at the IRS, which has jurisdiction over nonprofit groups and\ntheir involvement in politics, is virtually the same. Because of the\n\xe2\x80\x9cscandal\xe2\x80\x9d that came to light in 2013, which involved extra scrutiny given\nto political groups applying for tax-exempt status as 501(c)(4) \xe2\x80\x9csocial\nwelfare\xe2\x80\x9d organizations, the agency came under withering attack from\nRepublicans and has shrunk back from enforcing the law.  Despite a new wave\nof secret donations going to phony social welfare organizations established\nby candidates to boost their campaigns, the IRS has essentially\nsurrendered, as the New York Times reports:\n\n\n\nAs presidential candidates find new ways to exploit secret donations from\ntax-exempt groups, hobbled regulators at the Internal Revenue Service\nappear certain to delay trying to curb widespread abuses at nonprofits\nuntil after the 2016 election.\n\n\n\nWe should take a moment to remember what the IRS scandal was actually\nabout. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, as so many conservatives believe, a story of a nefarious\nWhite House-directed conspiracy to persecute Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s enemies. In\nreality, there were a bunch of inadequately trained IRS employees\nattempting to apply a vaguely-worded law in the face of a dramatic increase\nin the number of applications they had to process after the 2010 Citizens\nUnited decision threw open the doors of campaign finance.\n\n\n\nAnd the groups that suffered the horrific injury of having their 501(c)(4)\napplications take longer to process than they should have? Let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget\nthat they were, in fact, violating the spirit of the law. Without question.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s true of both the conservative and liberal groups who got extra\nscrutiny, which they absolutely deserved, because they were plainly\npolitical groups masquerading as social welfare organizations.\n\n\n\nBut now it\xe2\x80\x99s open season, and most of the presidential candidates have\nestablished 501(c)(4) organizations that are allowed to shield their\ndonors\xe2\x80\x99 identity from public scrutiny while operating as an arm of the\ncampaign. Marco Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s (c)(4), the Conservative Solutions Project, has\nalready raised $15.8 million for him.\n\n\n\nSo that\xe2\x80\x99s where we are \xe2\x80\x94 limitless donations from the wealthy and\ncorporations to super PACs and (c)(4)s that coordinate with campaigns,\nbillionaires buying more influence than ever, and crippled government\nagencies unable to enforce the frayed laws that still exist. To which\nRepublicans say, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s great!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhich isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising, given that this was the system they engineered.\nThey filed lawsuit after lawsuit in a (largely successful) attempt to get\nthe Supreme Court to gut the campaign finance laws that had been in place\nfor decades, opening up the system to more money \xe2\x80\x94 while they also files\nsuits challenging every attempt at public financing in any form that might\nlevel the playing field. They threw sand in the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s gears and bludgeoned\nthe IRS into submission. And they did it all on the assumption that the\nmore money that pours into campaigns and the less accountability there is,\nthe more partisan advantage they\xe2\x80\x99ll gain.\n\n\n\nWhich might or might not be true \xe2\x80\x94 after all, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t as though Democratic\npoliticians like Obama and Clinton have had too much trouble exploiting the\nsystem and raising spectacular amounts of money themselves. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve now\njust about reached the campaign finance nirvana Republicans had been\nworking toward for so long.\n\n\n\nSo how\xe2\x80\x99s it working out? Is there anyone who could argue that this is the\nbest of all possible systems? Is there someone who\xe2\x80\x99ll say that the American\npublic benefits when billionaires summon presidential candidates to grovel\nbefore them in attempt to secure their patronage? Is there a single person\nwho\xe2\x80\x99ll honestly say, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, this is exactly how campaigns ought to work\xe2\x80\x9d?\nCan anybody make the case that this will produce a more democratic system\nthat helps the government solve problems and secure progress for the public?\n\n\n\n*OTHER 2016 NEWS*\n\n\n\n*\xe2\x80\x98Super PACs\xe2\x80\x99 Take On New Role, Organizing Voters\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/us/politics/super-pacs-take-on-new-role-organizing-voters.html?_r=0>\n// NYT // Trip Gabriel \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nCollege students supporting Rand Paul for president were out in force going\ndoor to door in this university town recently, using their iPad Minis to\nhelp identify Republicans committed to voting for the Kentucky senator in\nnext year\xe2\x80\x99s Iowa caucuses.\n\n\n\nAnd when Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana visited the state the same week in\nJune for town hall-style meetings in Waukee, Council Bluffs and Sioux City,\nhis supporters collected voters\xe2\x80\x99 names and emails with an eye toward caucus\nday.\n\n\n\nBut the Paul and Jindal campaigns were not behind these time-honored\ngrass-roots organizing efforts. Instead, in a twist that shows how even\nretail politics is being transformed by a flood of loosely regulated big\nmoney, the two candidates\xe2\x80\x99 courtship of voters is being carried out by\n\xe2\x80\x9csuper PACs,\xe2\x80\x9d which are using their abundant war chests to move into the\nnuts and bolts of campaign operations.\n\n\n\nIn previous election cycles, super PACs \xe2\x80\x94 which can raise unlimited\ndonations from corporations and individuals alike \xe2\x80\x94 largely channeled money\nfrom wealthy donors into political advertising. But now they are branching\nout into what had seemed a fundamental function of a campaign committee:\norganizing voters one at a time.\n\n\n\nThe 2016 race could be the most expensive in history, in part because of\nspending by \xe2\x80\x9csuper PACs.\xe2\x80\x9d Legally, the groups cannot coordinate with\ncandidates, but there is plenty of wiggle room. By Aaron Byrd and Emily B.\nHager on Publish Date July 7, 2015.\n\nCandidates \xe2\x80\x9care pushing as much of the stuff as they can over to the super\nPACs because that\xe2\x80\x99s where the real money is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terry Giles, who\nrecently quit as campaign manager for Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon,\nto start a new super PAC that will support him.\n\n\n\nThe practice of having super PACS, which can be entirely financed by a\nsingle billionaire, take over such operations allows campaigns, which may\nraise only $2,700 from any one donor, to outsource the costly,\nlabor-intensive work of recruiting activists and building lists of\nsupporters.\n\n\n\nIt could also allow second-tier candidates to be more competitive,\nprolonging the nominating process. And in the general election, a\nRepublican nominee whose organizing is paid for by a super PAC might level\nthe playing field with Democrats, whose allies in labor have traditionally\ngiven the party an edge in mustering volunteers to help turn out voters.\n\n\n\nBut there are risks to outsourcing a field campaign. Candidates, who are\nlegally forbidden to coordinate with super PACs, are in danger of being cut\noff from their most ardent supporters as they head into caucus and primary\nelections.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a campaign, you have absolutely no idea\xe2\x80\x9d how you\xe2\x80\x99re doing, said Nick\nRyan, president of a super PAC supporting Mike Huckabee, the former\nArkansas governor. \xe2\x80\x9cThat would scare me to death. You\xe2\x80\x99d be disconnected\nfrom the very base of your campaign, the people who are most passionate\nabout you.\xe2\x80\x9d (Still, Mr. Ryan hesitated to rule out any grass-roots campaign\nwork aside from recruiting volunteers to support Mr. Huckabee.)\n\n\n\nTina Goff, who recruited leaders in all 99 Iowa counties on behalf of a\nsuper PAC supporting Ben Carson before he even declared his candidacy,\nturned down an offer of a job with his campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been great\nto travel around with Dr. Carson,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I felt like I had created\nan infrastructure here and I wanted to continue what I was doing.\xe2\x80\x9d She said\nshe was now hiring 25 people to knock on doors in Iowa after paying $40,000\nfor a list of Republican caucusgoers from the state party.\n\n\n\nEven for candidates who do not have fund-raising problems, relying on super\nPACs offers another way to manage expectations and perceptions.\n\n\n\nIn Iowa, where Jeb Bush faces stiff resistance from conservatives, a senior\nRepublican strategist said that before Mr. Bush announced his candidacy,\nhis team discussed leaving some of the field organizing to a super PAC\nestablished by his aides. That would spare Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s campaign some\nembarrassment should he perform badly in Iowa during the caucuses by giving\nhis campaign distance from the effort.\n\n\n\nSeveral campaigns have welcomed outside organizing efforts in Iowa, which\nwill hold the first nominating contest on Feb. 1. The farthest along are\nefforts for Mr. Paul, Carly Fiorina and Mr. Carson.\n\n\n\nAn outside group that supports Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who is\nexpected to announce his candidacy next week, collected cards at a recent\npolitical forum in Des Moines from voters pledging to caucus for the\ncandidate. A spokesman for the group, Our American Revival, said it would\ncontinue to organize on Mr. Walker\xe2\x80\x99s behalf in Iowa and other states.\n\n\n\nSo far, only super PACs supporting Republicans appear to be organizing the\ngrass roots, although outside groups that back Democrats, including labor\nunions and nonprofits, have long performed tasks like registering voters\nand canvassing neighborhoods. (A super PAC aimed at generating grass-roots\nsupport for Hillary Rodham Clinton, Ready for Hillary, closed up shop once\nMrs. Clinton formally entered the race.)\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that super PACs would at some point evolve into the\norganizational side of politics,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to\nMr. Paul. He called it a predictable outgrowth of an era that since 2002\nhas banned unlimited donations to party committees, and in which wealthy\ndonors have rechanneled support to outside groups, which are less\naccountable.\n\n\n\nMs. Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, may have turned\nover more traditional campaign tasks to a super PAC than any other\ncandidate: lining up endorsements, answering reporters\xe2\x80\x99 questions about her\nbusiness career and opening field offices in early primary states like\nSouth Carolina. The primary reason is her difficulty raising money for a\nfull-fledged campaign. She reported pulling in just $1.4 million in May and\nJune.\n\n\n\nThe super PAC, Carly for America, which said Monday that it had raised $3.4\nmillion, \xe2\x80\x9cis running a grass-roots organization focused on building support\nin early states,\xe2\x80\x9d said Katie Hughes, a spokeswoman.\n\n\n\nThe group organizing for Mr. Paul, Concerned American Voters, has pledges\nof \xe2\x80\x9cmultiple millions\xe2\x80\x9d from wealthy donors in Silicon Valley, said Jeff\nFrazee, its president. It has had 40 full-time field staffers in Iowa since\nJune 1, knocking on doors during the day and making phone calls at night.\n\n\n\nBut that effort illustrates the potential for duplication and clashing\nagendas between super PACs and campaigns. Mr. Paul already had a network of\nactivists in Iowa, many of whom supported campaigns by his father, Ron\nPaul. Asked about the super PAC, the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s state director, Steve\nGrubbs, said in a text message: \xe2\x80\x9cNot commenting on this. Wish I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThat was because the donors were talking among themselves about shifting\nsupport from TV advertising, the focus of America\xe2\x80\x99s Liberty PAC, to a\ngrass-roots campaign.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not convinced that TV ads are really as effective as they were,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nMr. Banister, an early investor in PayPal, adding that interactive\ncommunication with voters mattered more. \xe2\x80\x9cGrass roots is just kind of\nold-school interactive,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nMr. Frazee, the Paul backer, said he was inspired by Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s upset\nvictory over Mrs. Clinton in Iowa eight years ago. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was able to win with\na very organized ground game,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s been our strategy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn Iowa City, Ani DeGroot, a college student on summer break working for\nConcerned American Voters, approached Timothy Anderson, who was mowing his\nlawn.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you support Rand Paul?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked after he had shut down the mower.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI probably will,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFantastic,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. DeGroot said. \xe2\x80\x9cAre there any issues that are most\nimportant to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish we would just get out of all these wars and being policemen to the\nworld,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Anderson, a human resources manager.\n\n\n\nMs. DeGroot entered his responses into her iPad Mini supplied by the super\nPAC. At a future date, another Paul supporter might call on Mr. Anderson to\nurge him to volunteer, or even to speak for Mr. Paul at his precinct\ncaucus. The vote may be less than seven months away, but it is never too\nearly to begin organizing.\n\n\n\n*Puerto Rican debt crisis forces its way onto presidential political agenda\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/puerto-rican-debt-crisis-forces-its-way-onto-presidential-political-agenda/2015/07/07/40ea8aae-1ffe-11e5-aeb9-a411a84c9d55_story.html>\n// WaPo // Steven Mufson - July 8, 2015*\n\n\n\nQ: Which place has as many Republican delegates as New Hampshire, plus\nenough native sons and daughters living in Florida to swing the outcome of\nthat state\xe2\x80\x99s presidential primaries or even the general election?\n\n\n\nA: Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\nThat political reality has put the financially ailing U.S. territory on the\nmap of presidential hopefuls, who are being asked what, if anything, the\nfederal government should do to help engineer a rescue plan for the\ndebt-strapped island.\n\n\n\nPolitically, much is at stake. Puerto Rico has its own voice at nominating\nconventions, with more delegates at the Democratic Convention than 21\nstates. And 1 million Puerto Ricans live in Florida, enough to be the swing\nvote in one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most important swing states.\n\n\n\nAt the current pace of migration, triple the rate just a few years ago, the\nnumber of people of Puerto Rican origin in Florida could soon exceed the\nnumber of Cuban Americans in the state. Along Interstate 4 between Orlando\nand Tampa in central Florida, Puerto Rican Americans are everywhere,\ncomprising more than a quarter of the population of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s Osceola\nCounty.\n\n\n\nAs a result, presidential candidates are being pressed to voice support for\nPuerto Rico in its hour of economic need and back the use of bankruptcy law\nto help the territory, which is teetering on the edge of default, to reduce\nand manage its $73 billion in debt. While the bankruptcy code can be used\nby states for the orderly court-supervised reorganization of cities,\nmunicipalities, municipal utilities or school districts, Congress in 1984\naltered the law to bar the commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any of its\nutilities, towns or school districts from being able to turn to the\nbankruptcy code in a crisis.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose who want the support of Puerto Ricans must help Puerto Rico now. Not\nlater.\xe2\x80\x9d Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro Garc\xc3\xada Padilla said in an interview\nSunday on Telemundo. He added, \xe2\x80\x9cThey need to act now, not in a few months\nduring the elections.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGarc\xc3\xada Padilla said \xe2\x80\x9cthere are some people who have been a little passive,\nand they are the candidates for president of the United States. Both the\nDemocrats and the Republicans, especially in Florida, because as you know,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a battleground state and it\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd the Puerto Rican vote is up for grabs, both in Florida and the\nterritory. Six Americans of Puerto Rican descent have been elected to the\nFlorida state legislature \xe2\x80\x94 three Republicans and three Democrats. In\nPuerto Rico, the current governor, Garc\xc3\xada Padilla, who narrowly won\nelection, calls himself a friend of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s. The previous\ngovernor, Luis G. Fortu\xc3\xb1o, resembled a Reagan Republican.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring the last campaign, it was called the swing vote of the swing\nstate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeffrey Farrow, chairman of the Oliver Group, a public policy\ncommunications firm, and a former White House adviser on Puerto Rico under\nPresidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\nA poll by Latino Decisions, a firm that does polling and analysis of Latino\nvoters, showed that Puerto Rican voters in Florida went 72 percent to 28\npercent for Obama over Mitt Romney in 2012, while Cuban American voters in\nthe state chose Romney over Obama by 64 percent to 35 percent.\n\n\n\nYet Farrow said that while \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a perception that Puerto Ricans are\nDemocratic voters, that is not necessarily the case in Florida. The more\nrecent poll data shows they identify more with Democrats than Republicans,\nbut they are socially conservative. They voted for Jeb Bush for governor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring my race, I said I would slash government expenses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fortu\xc3\xb1o,\nnow a partner at Steptoe & Johnson, a Washington-based law firm. \xe2\x80\x9cOften on\nradio talk shows, people would say they have a daughter who needs a job,\nand I\xe2\x80\x99d say she would not have a job in government, and my advisers would\ngo nuts. And I won. So it\xe2\x80\x99s very doable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nJeb Bush has been courting the Puerto Rican vote for a long time. In 1980,\nhe spent more than two months organizing the campaign of his father, George\nH.W. Bush, who handily won the primary that year. Jeb Bush delivered\nspeeches in Spanish at more than 75 gatherings. When he campaigned to be\ngovernor of Florida, he went to Puerto Rican church fiestas.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think statehood is the best path, personally. I\xe2\x80\x99ve believed that for a\nlong, long while,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeb Bush said during a visit to the territory in April,\nrecalling his father\xe2\x80\x99s long-ago campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing makes me believe that\nthat position should change. To get the full benefits and responsibilities\nof citizenship, being a state is the only path to make that happen.\xe2\x80\x9d He\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cI think the next president, whoever that person is, should use their\ninfluence to make sure Congress acts on this and that this should be a\nquestion of self-determination. . . . That\xe2\x80\x99s just a question of principle\nand, you know, morality, I think. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a question of politics.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBush, while campaigning in Puerto Rico in April and again in South Carolina\nlast week, also came out in support of granting Puerto Rico the option of\nusing Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code to restructure its debts. \xe2\x80\x9cPuerto\nRico should be given the same rights as the states,\xe2\x80\x9d Bush said in Spanish\nbefore a small crowd at the Universidad Metropolitana in San Juan.\n\n\n\nBush\xe2\x80\x99s Republican rivals have been, by and large, more cautious for fear\nthat extending Chapter 9 to Puerto Rico could look like a bailout of the\nisland \xe2\x80\x94 even though bankruptcy extracts concessions from bondholders and\nrequires no federal money.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSenator [Marco] Rubio has been closely watching events in Puerto Rico and\nis concerned about the economic situation there,\xe2\x80\x9d spokeswoman Brooke Sammon\ntold The Washington Post by e-mail over the weekend. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s in the process\nof reviewing the legislation to make sure it is the right approach to begin\naddressing Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s debt crisis without having any negative impact on\nAmerican taxpayers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDonald Trump \xe2\x80\x94 whose heavily indebted corporate affiliates have used\nbankruptcy to reorganize four times \xe2\x80\x94 has a unique perspective on Puerto\nRico. He is also a partner with local construction tycoons Arturo and Jorge\nL. Diaz in the Trump International Golf Club, a resort east of San Juan\nthat boasts two 18-hole courses. The Trump campaign did not respond to a\nrequest for comment.\n\n\n\nIn a June 30 tweet, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham\nClinton did not address the bankruptcy issue but said that \xe2\x80\x9cPuerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s\ndebt crisis is not theirs alone. For PR\xe2\x80\x99s economy to grow & their people to\nthrive, they need real tools & real support.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut on Tuesday, Clinton said that Puerto Rican municipalities and\nstate-owned enterprises should be allowed to use bankruptcy protections to\noverhaul their finances. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about a bailout, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking\nabout a fair shot at success,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a statement.\n\n\n\nFormer Maryland governor Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley (D), by contrast, jumped on the\nissue last week. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very concerned about the impending financial\ncollapse of Puerto Rico,\xe2\x80\x9d said O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, who backed the use of the\nbankruptcy code and an equalization of Medicaid and Medicare benefits for\nthe island\xe2\x80\x99s residents. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must help our fellow U.S. citizens, not only\nbecause it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do, but because our region\xe2\x80\x99s economic\nstability depends on it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) joined the discussion on Tuesday, backing\nbankruptcy protections to enable Puerto Rico to \xe2\x80\x9crestructure its debt in a\nrational way that does not harm its people, ordinary investors or pension\nfunds in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d He blamed the island\xe2\x80\x99s debt crisis on \xe2\x80\x9cthe\npolicies of austerity and the greed of large financial institutions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe flow of Puerto Ricans to Florida has altered the calculus of politics\nthere. Whereas politicians once catered to the conservative, anti-Castro\nCuban opinion that dominated the Latino vote, now the Cuban American\nconsensus on Cuba has fractured and the Puerto Rican population has swelled.\n\n\n\nThat Puerto Rican electorate has its own concerns.\n\n\n\nAccording to polling data gathered last November by Latino Decisions,\nPuerto Ricans support expanding Medicaid and raising the minimum wage more\nstrongly than Cuban Americans do, although Cuban Americans also strongly\nendorse those policy proposals. Education also ranks higher as a concern\namong Puerto Ricans.\n\n\n\nYet despite Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s efforts, the Latino Decisions poll in November\nshowed that among Puerto Ricans in Florida, he was then getting a 42\npercent \xe2\x80\x9cvery unfavorable\xe2\x80\x9d rating and only 10 percent \xe2\x80\x9cvery favorable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNow the territory\xe2\x80\x99s economic plight might become a factor. And people in\nFlorida keep track through readily available media from the island as well\nas locally.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Puerto Ricans living here are very, very strongly connected to the\nisland,\xe2\x80\x9d said Betsy Franceschini, who is Florida regional director of the\nPuerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, an arm of the Puerto Rican\ngovernment. \xe2\x80\x9cThey do care even though they\xe2\x80\x99re here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFranceschini operates her agency in a modest house in Kissimmee with two\nflagpoles, one for the Puerto Rican flag and one for the American. The\nagency provides advice to Puerto Ricans moving from the island to the\nOrlando-Tampa area. The previous governor, Fortu\xc3\xb1o, had closed the office.\nGarc\xc3\xada Padilla, fulfilling a campaign promise he made during a visit to\nOrlando, reopened it.\n\n\n\nFranceschini said the key public-policy issues of concern to people who\ncome to the office for help are the island\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal crisis, its desire to\nuse the bankruptcy code to restructure municipal debts and unequal Medicare\npayments by the federal government. \xe2\x80\x9cFolks here are very upset about that\nand are organizing and mobilizing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand they want to know where\nthe candidates stand.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Christie, Paul and Perry Court the Black Vote\n<http://www.wsj.com/articles/christie-paul-and-perry-court-the-black-vote-1436305667>\n// WSJ // Jason Riley \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nPresident Obama will be leaving the White House in 18 months, but where\nwill that leave the minority voters who helped elect him? It\xe2\x80\x99s a question\nthat Republican presidential hopefuls not named Donald Trump are pondering.\n\n\n\nBetween 1980 and 2004, black support for the Democratic presidential\ncandidates ranged from 83% to 90%. But in 2008 Mr. Obama won 95% of the\nblack vote and was re-elected four years later with 93%. In 2012 black\nvoters turned out at higher rates than white voters for the first time on\nrecord. The likelihood of Hillary Clinton or another Democratic nominee\ndrawing Obama levels of black support is small. Many blacks may simply stay\nhome. Others, having observed the black economic retrogression that\noccurred even with a black Democrat in the Oval Office, might consider\nalternatives.\n\n\n\nTo that end, Republicans such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul have been actively courting minorities. Mr.\nChristie has become a familiar presence in Camden, Newark and other\neconomically depressed parts of the Garden State. In 2013 he was re-elected\nwith the backing of 51% of Hispanics and 21% of blacks\xe2\x80\x94an impressive\n19-point and 12-point increase, respectively, from four years earlier.\n\n\n\nWoody Allen once said that 80% of success is showing up, and Mr. Christie\nhas been willing to campaign in communities and among voters that\nRepublicans too often write off. The governor has bothered to introduce\nhimself to black voters directly instead of letting Democratic opponents\ndefine him or only giving the occasional speech to the NAACP.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many Republicans are you going to see walking up and down these\nstreets like this?\xe2\x80\x9d a black woman in Orange, N.J., told a Real Clear\nPolitics reporter in 2013. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s approachable. I really like that. And I\nthink the people in Orange are really thrilled, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re Democrat or\nRepublican, that he\xe2\x80\x99s here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Paul, for his part, has courted younger blacks by visiting historically\nblack college campuses, which is admirable. Less admirable is Mr. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s\ndecision to mouth liberal positions on voter ID, drug laws and prison\nsentencing in order to win black support. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m trying to go out and say to\nAfrican-Americans \xe2\x80\x98I want your vote, and the Republican Party wants your\nvote,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d he told a radio interviewer last year, explaining why he thinks\nthe GOP should drop the voter ID issue. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to be aware that the\nperception is out there and be careful about not so overdoing something\nthat we further alienate a block of people that we need to attract.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s not black outreach\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s pandering. Moreover, it\xe2\x80\x99s off-base. A Fox\nNews poll last year found majority support for voter ID laws among every\ndemographic group, including 51% of blacks. A 2012 Pew survey put black\nsupport for voter ID at 62%. And law-abiding ghetto residents want the\ncriminals who prey on them and their children locked up, not coddled. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\nconfuse the agenda of civil-rights groups and other black elites with the\ndesires of most blacks.\n\n\n\nThe better approach is the one taken by former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who\nlaunched his second bid for the White House last month and gave one of the\ncampaign\xe2\x80\x99s most poignant speeches last week. Mr. Perry is less concerned\nwith making race-based entreaties than he is with appealing to blacks as\nfellow Americans. Imagine that!\n\n\n\nThe governor acknowledged America\xe2\x80\x99s history of oppressing blacks\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand\nbecause slavery and segregation were sanctioned by government, there is a\nrole for government policy in addressing their lasting effects\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but he also\nnoted the tremendous progress that has been made.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA half-century ago, Republicans and Democrats came together to finally\nenshrine in the law the principle that all of us\xe2\x80\x94regardless of race, color\nor national origin\xe2\x80\x94are created equal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Perry. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen it comes to\nrace, America is a better and more tolerant and more welcoming place than\nit has ever been.\xe2\x80\x9d These may be plain truths, but such progress is\nregularly dismissed by many on the grievance-focused left, where there is\nmoney to be made by civil-rights groups, and votes to be had by Democratic\npoliticians, who are willing to pretend that systemic racism still drives\nracial disparities in the U.S.\n\n\n\nMr. Perry believes that a more significant barrier to black progress is\npoor political representation. The Democratic Party has long operated with\nno fear of losing the black vote, and Republicans have been too quick to\nconcede it. Mr. Perry\xe2\x80\x99s overarching theme, however, was a rebuke of\nidentity politics, stressing instead what all Americans desire\xe2\x80\x94safe\nneighborhoods, good schools, economic opportunity. And he urged black\nvoters to compare the track records of liberal and conservative governance\non those fronts and then hold politicians accountable.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the cities where the left-wing solutions have been tried over and over\nagain\xe2\x80\x94places like Detroit and Chicago and Baltimore\xe2\x80\x94African-Americans are\nmoving out,\xe2\x80\x9d said the governor. \xe2\x80\x9cIn blue-state coastal cities, you have\nstrict zoning laws and environmental regulations that have prevented\nbuilders from expanding the housing supply.\xe2\x80\x9d San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s black\npopulation today is half of what it was in 1970. That\xe2\x80\x99s obviously not\nbecause conservatives run the place.\n\n\n\nIf the GOP is getting serious about competing for black voters, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\nwelcome development for our political system. And if Republican\npresidential candidates are looking for the right approach, they could do a\nlot worse than Mr. Perry\xe2\x80\x99s template.\n\n\n\n*2016ers tiptoe around Puerto Rico\'s debt bomb\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/2016ers-tiptoe-around-puerto-ricos-debt-bomb-119820.html>\n// Politico // Daniel Strauss \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nWith Puerto Rico asking the U.S. federal government for a lifeline to\nrescue it from crushing debt, some 2016 candidates see an opportunity \xe2\x80\x93\nFlorida votes.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush was first out of the gates. Back in April, as the island territory\nstarted careening toward a breaking point, he said Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s public\nagencies should be able to file for bankruptcy.\n\n\n\nBut late last month, Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro Garc\xc3\xada Padilla announced\nthat the commonwealth could not pay back its roughly $72 billion in debts,\nlending the question new urgency.\n\n\n\nDemocrats have urged Washington to help. On Tuesday, frontrunner Hillary\nClinton called on Congress to allow Puerto Rico to restructure its debts\nunder Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code, the first step in what she called a\n\xe2\x80\x9cmultifaceted\xe2\x80\x9d approach. Her top rival for the Democratic nomination,\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, followed suit a few hours later. Former\nMaryland governor Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley had previously pressed President Barack\nObama and Congress \xe2\x80\x9cto act to ensure that Puerto Rico is able to negotiate\nwith its creditors.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut the rest of the 2016 field, including the other four senators running\nfor president, has been conspicuously slower to take a position. Sens. Ted\nCruz, Lindsey Graham, Rand Paul did not respond to questions on the issue.\nSen. Marco Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s office said the Florida senator was still looking into\nit.\n\n\n\nNone were willing to throw their support behind a bill being offered up by\nSens. Charles Schumer and Richard Blumenthal that would give Puerto Rico\nthe same bankruptcy protection as municipalities across the rest of the\nUnited States.\n\n\n\nPuerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s debt crisis has the potential to affect the 2016 race \xe2\x80\x94 and\nnowhere more so than in Florida, with its growing Puerto Rican population\nof about 1 million people, a key constituency in a purple state with 29\nelectoral votes.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a driver for their vote,\xe2\x80\x9d said Resident Commissioner Pedro\nPierluisi, Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s representative on Capitol Hill. \xe2\x80\x9cOur votes are\nswing votes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn the last two presidential elections, Puerto Rican votes boosted Obama in\nFlorida, but could easily help Republicans this time around, former Puerto\nRican governor Luis Fortuno said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can sway,\xe2\x80\x9d Fortuno, a conservative, said. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe other\nRepublicans that want to compete effectively ought to be thinking about\nthis, and they probably have to say something about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you get through the Florida primary without being asked,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former top economic adviser for Sen. John\nMcCain\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 presidential bid.\n\n\n\nBut calling for federal intervention is not without political risks: No\nRepublican presidential candidate wants to be tarred as pro-bailout.\n\n\n\nWhile bankruptcy protection would not provide the island territory with\ndirect financial support, it could still raise the hackles of creditors\neager to toss around the \xe2\x80\x9cb\xe2\x80\x9d word in a bid to sap congressional momentum.\n\n\n\nThe issue is especially perilous for Rubio, who rode to office in 2010 on a\nwave of support from tea party voters vehemently opposed to government\nrescues of big banks and underwater homeowners.\n\n\n\nSo even though Rubio is locked with Bush in a zero-sum struggle with Bush\nfor Florida primary votes, especially among Hispanics, he has been hesitant\nto weigh in.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSenator Rubio has been closely watching events in Puerto Rico and is\nconcerned about the economic situation there,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio spokeswoman Brooke\nSammon told POLITICO. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s in the process of reviewing the legislation to\nmake sure it is the right approach to begin addressing Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s debt\ncrisis without having any negative impact on American taxpayers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPierluisi said it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable why Rubio and Ted Cruz, the other 2016\ncandidate of Cuban descent, have been so cautious.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know for a fact that both of them have been studying this issue and\ntheir staff have been getting their feet wet on this,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierluisi said.\n\n\n\nFormer Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee has already previewed how the more\nconservative candidates might approach the issue.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough bailouts. Puerto Rico is a commonwealth, not a state, and\nshould not be allowed to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy,\xe2\x80\x9d Huckabee told\nPOLITICO.\n\n\n\nEven among the candidates who support allowing Puerto Rico to file for\nbankruptcy, there was a visible cautiousness about using the dreaded term.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about a bailout, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a fair shot at\nsuccess,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s statement.\n\n\n\n*Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton to share stage in Fort Lauderdale\n<http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/jeb-bush-hillary-clinton-to-share-stage-in-fort-lauderdale/2236438>\n// Tampa Bay Times // Alex Leary \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nJeb Bush will speak before the National Urban League Conference in Fort\nLauderdale on July 31, illustrating his campaign\'s goal of broadening the\nGOP message.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton is also addressing the group, as is Ben Carson and Martin\nO\'Malley.\n\n\n\n"The candidates will share their visions for saving our cities on Friday,\nJuly 31, during a session entitled \'Off To The Races: The 2016 Presidential\nCandidates\xe2\x80\x99 Plenary,\' " according to a release.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs we convene in Florida to deliberate solutions to the economic and\nsocial challenges our cities are facing, it\xe2\x80\x99s vital that those contending\nfor the highest office in the land be part of that conversation,\xe2\x80\x9d National\nUrban League President and CEO Marc H.

Now it has\ntwo very powerful allies on its side: Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nBoth 2016 presidential candidates support giving Puerto Rico the same legal\nbankruptcy rights that states have. Puerto Rico\'s governor has been\nlobbying hard for that right.\n\nThere\'s a bill in Congress to give Puerto Rico what it wants, but it has no\nco-sponsors. That\'s why Bush and Clinton\'s backing could be key.\n\n\n\n"I think that Puerto Rico ought to be treated as other states are treated\nas it relates to restructuring," Bush said during a visit to the island in\nlate April. Other Republican candidates have largely stayed silent on the\nissue thus far.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Clinton jumped on board as well.\n\n\n\n"Congress should provide Puerto Rico the same authority that states already\nhave to enable severely distressed government entities, including\nmunicipalities and public corporations, to restructure their debts," she\nsaid in a statement on her campaign website.\n\n\n\nFormer Maryland governor Martin O\'Malley has been a vocal supporter as well.\n\n\n\nWhat it means: To be clear, no state can file for bankruptcy. But the 50\nstates do have the right to allow municipalities -- cities, towns and other\nlocal government entities -- within their states to file for bankruptcy.\n\n\n\nPuerto Rican municipalities want to be able to file for what is known as\nChapter 9 bankruptcy like Detroit and Vallejo, California did.\n\n\n\nThe benefit of bankruptcy is that is allows a broke government to shed some\nof its debt -- if a judge approve a municipality\'s game plan.\n\n\n\nWill Congress act? The bill in Congress would give Puerto Rico the same\nrights that states have under Chapter 9. So far, the bill\'s only supporter\nin Congress is Puerto Rico\'s representative, who get to vote.\n\n\n\nIt might seem like a small issue in Washington, but it\'s a big issue for\nfinancial markets.\n\nPuerto Rico has a tiny population -- about the size of Connecticut -- but\nit has a debt the size of a big state like New York. Over 20% of U.S. bond\nfunds hold Puerto Rican debt.\n\nThe island doesn\'t have enough money to pay back its creditors. Some have\neven taken to calling it "America\'s Greece." Governor Alejandro Garc\xc3\xada\nPadilla says Puerto Rico is in a "death spiral."\n\n\n\nA lot of the trouble stems from Puerto Rico\'s power company, known as\nPREPA. It alone has $9 billion. It would be a game changer if PREPA could\ndeclare bankruptcy.\n\n\n\nWhy bankruptcy? "Chapter 9 is really the only way to impose some sort of\nrestructuring on all the bondholders," says David Tawil, a lawyer and\npresident of Maglan Capital.\n\nBond holders don\'t want Puerto Rico to get that because it opens the\npossibility that they would be forced to take a loss on their bond\ninvestment if a bankruptcy judge sides with the island.\n\n\n\nBut the proposal has little currency in Washington.\n\n\n\n"The bill that is in Congress has no co-sponsors and no support in\nCongress, although it does have a fair amount of support among bankruptcy\nexperts," says Juliet Moringiello, a professor at Widener University School\nof Law and a former scholar of the American Bankruptcy Institute.\n\n\n\nMoringiello notes that Chapter 9 bankruptcy is rare, although the majority\nof filings have been public hospitals and utilities like PREPA, not cities.\n\n\n\nWhere the candidates stand: Jeb Bush has been a vocal supporter of\nstatehood for Puerto Rico -- if the island\'s citizens want that.\n\n\n\n"I think statehood is the best path, personally," Bush said in April. Since\nthen, he has clarified that he thinks the island needs to make a number of\nchanges to deal with its debt beyond just declaring bankruptcy, including\nreducing some benefits for workers.\n\nOn the Democratic side, O\'Malley was an early supporter of Puerto Rico\ngetting Chapter 9 bankruptcy rights. Senator Bernie Sanders has voiced his\nsupport for Greece, but has yet to say much on Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\n*OPINIONS/EDITORIALS/BLOGS*\n\n\n\n*The non-Clinton alternative for Democrats\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-non-clinton-alternative-for-democrats/2015/07/06/9b8d33ec-241a-11e5-b72c-2b7d516e1e0e_story.html>\n// WaPo // Eugene Robinson \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nIs Bernie Sanders the political reincarnation of Eugene McCarthy? I doubt\nit, but let\xe2\x80\x99s hope he makes the Democratic presidential race interesting.\n\n\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if front-runner Hillary Clinton shares my wish, but she ought\nto. I\xe2\x80\x99m not of the school that believes competition for competition\xe2\x80\x99s sake\nis always a good thing. But Sanders has an appeal for younger, more\nliberal, more idealistic Democrats that Clinton presently lacks. If she\ncompetes for these voters \xe2\x80\x94 and learns to connect with them \xe2\x80\x94 she will have\na much better chance of winning the White House.\n\n\n\nSanders, the Vermont independent and the only self-described socialist in\nthe Senate, drew packed houses during a weekend barnstorming tour of Iowa.\nThe 2,500 people who attended his rally in Council Bluffs were believed to\nbe the largest crowd a candidate from either party has drawn in the state.\nThis followed last week\xe2\x80\x99s triumph in Madison, Wis. , where Sanders packed a\n10,000-seat arena with cheering supporters \xe2\x80\x94 the biggest event anywhere\nthus far in the campaign.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Sanders is rising in the polls. The latest Quinnipiac\nsurvey showed Clinton with a 19-point lead in Iowa, 52 percent to 33\npercent. As recently as May, Clinton had a 45-point advantage.\n\n\n\nComparisons have been made to McCarthy, the Minnesota senator whose\nopposition to the Vietnam War galvanized support on college campuses and\nstunned the Democratic Party establishment. McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s showing in the 1968\nNew Hampshire primary \xe2\x80\x94 he received 42 percent of the vote \xe2\x80\x94 helped lead\nincumbent Lyndon Johnson to pull out of the race.\n\n\n\nBut let\xe2\x80\x99s not get carried away. A lead of 19 points is a problem any\npolitician would love to have. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s numbers had nowhere to go but up,\nand Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere but down. What\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say at present is that\nSanders \xe2\x80\x94 not Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, Jim Webb or Lincoln Chafee \xe2\x80\x94 has become the\nnon-Clinton alternative for Democrats who, for whatever reason, are\nsuffering some Clinton fatigue.\n\n\n\nOne thing Sanders has going for himself is palpable authenticity. He is the\nantithesis of slick. To say there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing focus-grouped about the man is\nto understate; one doubts he knows what a focus group is. \xe2\x80\x9cRumpled\xe2\x80\x9d is the\nword most often used to describe him, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not quite right; it\xe2\x80\x99s not\nas if his suits are unpressed or his shirttails untucked. He\xe2\x80\x99s just all\nsubstance and no style \xe2\x80\x94 which, to say the least, makes him stand out among\npoliticians.\n\n\n\nClinton, by contrast, has always struggled to let voters see the\n\xe2\x80\x9cauthentic\xe2\x80\x9d her rather than the carefully curated, every-hair-in-place\nversion her campaigns have sought to project. Part of the problem, I\nbelieve, is that women in politics are held to an almost impossible\nstandard; no male candidate\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe choice or tone of voice receives\nsuch microscopic scrutiny. But she also distances herself by campaigning as\nif she\xe2\x80\x99s protecting a big lead \xe2\x80\x94 which she is \xe2\x80\x94 and wants to avoid\noffending anyone. Last, when asked her favorite ice cream flavor, she\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cI like nearly everything.\xe2\x80\x9d What, vanilla lovers were going to\nabandon her if she had said chocolate?\n\n\n\nSanders\xe2\x80\x99s main appeal, however, is that he speaks unabashedly for the\nparty\xe2\x80\x99s activist left. He is witheringly critical of Wall Street, wants to\nbreak up the big banks, proposes single-payer health care and promises to\nraise taxes. He voted against the 2003 invasion of Iraq; Clinton, then a\nsenator, voted for it but now says that she made a mistake.\n\n\n\nEight years ago, Barack Obama made opposition to the Iraq war his signature\nissue and rode it to victory in Iowa and beyond. Will lightning strike the\nClinton machine twice?\n\n\n\nNot the same kind of lightning, surely, and not in the same manner. Obama\nis a uniquely gifted politician whose appeal went beyond the issues. He was\nable to make voters believe not just in him but also in themselves and\ntheir power to reshape the world. And as the first African American with a\nlegitimate chance to become president, he gave the nation a chance to make\nhistory.\n\n\n\nThis time, Clinton is the candidate with history on her side. The fact that\nshe could be the first woman elected president is not enough, by itself, to\nwin her the nomination. But it does matter. She, like Obama, offers voters\nthe chance to feel a sense of accomplishment.\n\n\n\nAnd nothing about Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s past remotely compares with the millstone of\nVietnam that weighed LBJ down and ultimately caused him to give up. I just\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see a McCarthy scenario brewing \xe2\x80\x94 or an Obama scenario, either.\n\n\n\n*How Politico became a GOP stooge: Republicans want to destroy Hillary\nClinton\xe2\x80\x94and the media is helping them out\n<http://www.salon.com/2015/07/07/how_politico_became_a_gop_stooge_republicans_want_to_destroy_hillary_clinton%E2%80%94and_the_media_is_helping_them_out/>\n// Salon // Heather Digby Parton \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nAaron Blake at The Washington Post wrote a piece yesterday entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nClinton campaign is roping off reporters. But who will cry for us?\xe2\x80\x9d in\nwhich he lamented the treatment the press received over the weekend at the\nhands of Hillary Clinton. Again. If you were to read the twitter feeds of\npolitical reporters as it unfolded, it was a trauma they will not soon\nforget.\n\n\n\nHere is Politico\xe2\x80\x99s Glenn Thrush, who saw the deeper meaning of the event\nimmediately:\n\n\n\nThe weirdly obsessive Clinton twitter stalker Maggie Haberman of the New\nYork Times brought all the strands of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s various alleged crimes\ntogether:\n\n\n\nEven three days later, everyone\xe2\x80\x99s still abuzz:\n\n\n\nAaron Blake recounted the event in all its chilling detail and then rather\nsheepishly admitted that nobody in America really gives a damn about how\nHillary Clinton treats the press. (A point I made a month ago.) After all,\nthe press is held in only slightly higher esteem by the public than loan\nsharks and puppy mill operators. The thinly veiled threat underneath all\nthis outrage is that the media will react to being treated badly by giving\nthe candidate bad press, but it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that train left the station\na long time ago when it comes to Clinton, so the cost-benefit analysis\nprobably doesn\xe2\x80\x99t argue in favor of the campaign giving a damn either.\n\n\n\nAs it happens, another political reporter wrote a piece about the way the\npress covers Hillary Clinton yesterday and it was quite a blockbuster\nconfessional. Jonathan Allen of Vox laid it all out:\n\n\n\nThe Clinton rules are driven by reporters\xe2\x80\x99 and editors\xe2\x80\x99 desire to score the\nultimate prize in contemporary journalism: the scoop that brings down\nHillary Clinton and her family\xe2\x80\x99s political empire. At least in that way,\nRepublicans and the media have a common interest.\n\n\n\nI understand these dynamics well, having co-written a book that\ndemonstrated how Bill and Hillary Clinton used Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s time at State to\nbuild the family political operation and set up for their fourth\npresidential campaign. That is to say, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot of research about\nthe Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 relationship with the media, and experienced it firsthand. As\nan author, I felt that I owed it to myself and the reader to report,\ninvestigate, and write with the same mix of curiosity, skepticism, rigor,\nand compassion that I would use with any other subject. I wanted to sell\nbooks, of course. But the easier way to do that \xe2\x80\x94 proven over time \xe2\x80\x94 is to\nwrite as though the Clintons are the purest form of evil. The same holds\nfor daily reporting. Want to drive traffic to a website? Write something\nnasty about a Clinton, particularly Hillary.\n\n\n\nAs a reporter, I get sucked into playing by the Clinton rules. This is what\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in my colleagues, and in myself.\n\n\n\nThis does not come as a surprise to many observers. It\xe2\x80\x99s been obvious for\nmore than 20 years. But it\xe2\x80\x99s refreshing to see a journalist admit that the\ndynamic is driven by the media\xe2\x80\x99s Ahab-like obsession with bringing down\nHillary Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 and that this means they have a common interest with\nRepublicans. It\xe2\x80\x99s not ideological, it\xe2\x80\x99s professional.\n\n\n\nAllen goes on to list the unofficial rules for covering the Clintons and\nelaborates on each one. (There are, by his reckoning, five.) He notes that\nthe media must always assume that the Clintons are acting in bad faith\nuntil proven otherwise, that everything is newsworthy (even things that\nreally are nobody\xe2\x80\x99s business) because the Clintons are like America\xe2\x80\x99s royal\nfamily, and because everything Hillary Clinton does is, so the thinking\ngoes, \xe2\x80\x9cfake and calculated.\xe2\x80\x9d These assumptions distort political coverage\nin a dozen different ways. But it\xe2\x80\x99s two rules in particular which should be\nof very serious concern to the public.\n\n\n\nThe first is, \xe2\x80\x9ceverything, no matter how ludicrous-sounding, is worthy of a\nfull investigation by federal agencies, Congress, the \xe2\x80\x98vast right-wing\nconspiracy,\xe2\x80\x99 and mainstream media outlets.\xe2\x80\x9d Allen notes that the Clintons\nhave been investigated for 25 years and have probably revealed more about\ntheir lives, some of it intensely personal, than any other people in\nAmerican public life. This has made them protective of their privacy and,\nperhaps perversely, fatalistic about the media\xe2\x80\x99s hostility. But he also\nnotes something that we should acknowledge is a big problem for our\npolitics:\n\n\n\nThis is, for Republicans, a reasonable strategy. They know that if they\nkeep investigating her, it will do two things: keep the media writing about\nscandals that might knock her out, and turn off voters who don\xe2\x80\x99t want a\nreturn to the bloodsport politics of the 1990s. They leak partial stories\nto reporters hungry for that one great scoop that will give them the\nbiggest political scalp of them all.\n\n\n\nHe points out that the Republicans are never able to deliver, which often\nplays into Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s hands, but that\xe2\x80\x99s hardly a justification for the\nmedia\xe2\x80\x99s behavior. There is nothing new about this arrangement. This was\nexactly what happened back in the 1990s. It\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassing for the press\nthat so many of their ranks are either unaware of this history, don\xe2\x80\x99t care\nabout it, or are taking up the challenge to harpoon that big fish without\nhaving the slightest compunction about being used by political operatives\nfor partisan purposes. It\xe2\x80\x99s tragic for our country that after the\nridiculous spectacle of impeachment, a stolen election, the war in Iraq,\nand an epic economic meltdown that our political media is still this\nshallow. That they are willing to enable this three-ring circus that calls\nitself today\xe2\x80\x99s Republican Party in order to gain power is frightening.\n\n\n\nAllen\xe2\x80\x99s other point is: \xe2\x80\x9cEvery allegation, no matter how ludicrous, is\nbelievable until it can be proven completely and utterly false. And even\nthen, it keeps a life of its own in the conservative media world.\xe2\x80\x9d That\ncorrelates to another Clinton rule, which is the \xe2\x80\x9cWhere there\xe2\x80\x99s smoke\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s fire\xe2\x80\x9d tactic. The idea is for there to be so many accusations\nfloating around that a reasonable person must conclude that there\xe2\x80\x99s\nsomething to it, even if nothing has been proven. That, after all, is what\nBenghazi is all about.\n\n\n\nAllen writes:\n\n\n\nTerrorists killed four Americans. The conservative echo chamber seems\nconvinced Hillary Clinton is at fault. The reasonable argument to make is\nthat we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been in Libya in the first place and the murders\nwere a down-the-chain result of bad policy. But the right wing wants to\nprove that they happened because of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s actions \xe2\x80\x94 or inaction \xe2\x80\x94 on\nsecurity matters.\n\n\n\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about security requests denied for Libya (never mind that\nthe stronger contingent would have been in Tripoli, not Benghazi, and that\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence Clinton herself was aware of the requests), a\nstand-down order that prevented reinforcements from arriving in Benghazi\n(never mind that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gotten there until after the fighting\nwas done, and that even a House Republican committee found that there was\nno such order) and, most of absurd of all, that Clinton knew the attack was\ncoming. This is how Limbaugh put it in May.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is they knew about the Benghazi attack 10 days before it was to\nhappen. They knew who did it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe freedom of the conservative media to make wild allegations often acts\nas a bulldozer forcing reporters to check into the charges and, in doing\nso, repeat them. By the time they\xe2\x80\x99ve been debunked, they\xe2\x80\x99re part of the\nAmerican public\xe2\x80\x99s collective consciousness. Or, as it\xe2\x80\x99s been said, a lie\ngets around the world before the truth gets out of bed.\n\n\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s more to this, however, and it goes hand in hand with the previous\nrule. These investigations are little more than fishing expeditions in\nwhich Republicans demand more and more information and then selectively\nleak juicy bits to the press for partisan purposes. Trey Gowdy\xe2\x80\x99s Benghazi\nselect committee has descended into farce already, but that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped\nthe New York Times from breathlessly reporting it like it\xe2\x80\x99s Watergate.\n\n\n\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not just The Times, although they\xe2\x80\x99ve been among the worst. Eric\nWemple of the Washington Post reported that Representative Elijah Cummings\ncame out swinging at Politico yesterday for running with leaked Clinton\nemails which they didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually see, based on intel from unidentified\n\xe2\x80\x9csources.\xe2\x80\x9d The selectively presented, and allegedly undisclosed, emails\ngave the appearance that Clinton was working hand-in-glove with adviser\nSidney Blumenthal to circulate Benghazi talking points from the Media\nMatters, where Blumenthal was then on payroll, inside the White House \xe2\x80\x94 an\ninsinuation used by Clinton detractors to suggest some sort of Benghazi\ncoverup.\n\n\n\nHowever, as the Washington Post explains:\n\n\n\nBut as Cummings notes in his letter, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t go down like that. The\n[Hillary Clinton email cited by Politico] actually attaches to a different\ne-mail correspondence between Clinton and Blumenthal, from a week before\nBlumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s boast about those Benghazi links. As documents released by the\nState Department last week show, Clinton was actually intent on sending to\nthe White House a Salon article claiming that the campaign of Republican\npresidential candidate Mitt Romney was planning a brand-new line of attack\nbased on Benghazi.\n\n\n\nCummings rips away, \xe2\x80\x9cIt appears that this source fed Politico an inaccurate\ncharacterization of these emails and that Politico accepted this\nmischaracterization without obtaining the emails themselves. The source\napparently took an email that was produced to the Select Committee in\nFebruary, isolated Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s statement about the White House,\nremoved it from the original email exchange about the presidential debates,\nand then added it to a different email exchange involving Media Matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnother point: The Politico story cites a source as saying that the e-mail\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t among those turned over by the State Department. Cummings writes\nthat State had passed it along in February.\n\n\n\nPolitico later issued a correction (which was clear as mud and clarified\nnothing).\n\n\n\nCummings is going to have his hands full trying to sort out these leaks.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a dirty job, but apparently he\xe2\x80\x99s decided that somebody has to do it,\nso that somebody will be him. It remains to be seen if his work to correct\nthe record of this Benghazi committee will have any effect. And who knows\nif Jonathan Allen\xe2\x80\x99s piece will be taken seriously by his fellow political\nreporters. It\xe2\x80\x99s clear they are using Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s lack of \xe2\x80\x9caccessibility\xe2\x80\x9d as a\nlame excuse for their sophomoric behavior, but it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take one of\ntheir own writing a Vox explainer on \xe2\x80\x9cthe Clinton rules\xe2\x80\x9d for them to\nunderstand that they are being willing dupes for Republican partisans who\nare laughing behind their backs at their credulousness.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be handled with kid gloves. The presidency\nis a tough job. But neither does she deserve to be held to a different\nstandard than anyone else or subject to a set of rules that are based upon\nlazy, false assumptions fed by partisans with an agenda they aren\xe2\x80\x99t even\ntrying to hide. The fact that the press is falling so comfortably into that\nold groove is a testament to the fact that nobody ever paid a price for\nwhat they did the first time.\n\n\n\n*Stop the bed-wetting: Hillary Clinton\'s doing fine\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/07/opinions/pfeiffer-bedwetting-over-hillary-clinton/index.html>\n// CNN // Dan Pfeiffer \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nIt\'s officially bed-wetting season in the political world when it comes to\nHillary Clinton\'s campaign. With stories this week in Politico and The New\nYork Times about the newly competitive Democratic primary, the whispers\nhave begun about whether this is 2008 all over again. Back then, Clinton\nwas defeated by Obama, an insurgent, progressive outsider.\n\n\n\nBed-wetting is a term of art in Obamaland. In 2008, Obama\'s then campaign\nmanager David Plouffe made it famous in a New York Times article; it refers\nto the premature panic among pundits and party stalwarts alike during\ntrying political times. While bed-wetting is not an affliction exclusive to\na party, Democrats do seem to have a special affinity for it.\n\n\n\nWith Vermont Sen. (and presidential candidate) Bernie Sanders raising\nmillions, exciting progressives, drawing crowds and surging in the polls,\nit\'s suddenly the Summer of Sanders. Cue the second-guessing and the\nhandwringing over Clinton and her campaign strategy.\n\n\n\nBut while Clinton\'s campaign to date hasn\'t been perfect, she is doing\nexactly what she needs to do to ensure that she is the Democratic nominee\nand the 45th President of the United States.\n\n\n\nA little perspective:\n\n\n\nFirst, despite Sanders\' very impressive fundraising, Clinton outraised him\nby about $30 million. In the second quarter of 2007, Obama actually\noutraised Clinton. Sanders has surged in the polls, impressively\nconsolidating the anti-Clinton vote, but the latest polls have him down 40\npoints nationally and 19 points in Iowa.\n\n\n\nWhile Clinton had huge leads in national polls at this point in 2007, Obama\nwas always in striking distance in the early states. This cycle, the party\nis much more united around Clinton; in 2008, some of the best fundraisers\nand strategists were looking for an alternative and found one in Obama.\n\n\n\nSecond, Sanders is a wonderful senator and a very important voice in the\nDemocratic Party, but he is not Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama is a once-in-a-generation political talent -- a phenomenal\nspeechmaker and "retail politician" who is quick on his feet and possesses\nthe ability to see around corners.\n\n\n\nObama also had natural inroads into two critical constituencies within the\nparty: white college educated progressives and the African-American\ncommunity, giving him broader appeal than any previous insurgent candidate.\n\n\n\nFinally, Hillary Clinton circa 2015 is not Hillary Clinton circa 2008.\n\n\n\nHer first campaign was beset by timidity, dissension and constant changes\nin strategy in reaction to the D.C conventional wisdom du jour. In Obama\nheadquarters, we would shake our heads in bemusement at some of her\ncampaign\'s decisions as we realized it was either using an outdated\nplaybook or no playbook at all.\n\nHer campaign this time has been disciplined, cohesive and bold. Sure there\nare tactical things they could have done differently, but they have a smart\nstrategy and are executing it with a precision that reminds me of our\ncampaign in 2008.\n\n\n\nOne of her biggest mistakes her 2008 campaign made was treating field\norganization as an afterthought. Our field organizers and volunteers were\nthe heart of Obama\'s 2008 campaign; they were its most valued asset, were\ngiven speaking slots at campaign rallies and developed relationships with\nthe candidate.\n\n\n\nAt her recent campaign rally in New Hampshire, one of Clinton\'s field\norganizers addressed the crowd. Reporters took mild notice, but on the\nvarious text chains, email threads and social media feeds that constitute\nthe informal Obama alumni network, this was taken as a sign that this\nHillary Campaign gets it.\n\n\n\nThere is a long road to travel before the Iowa caucuses with many potential\npitfalls and a lot of work ahead for Clinton. Sanders is running a great\nrace and the Democratic Party (and Clinton) are better for it. Clinton is\nnot inevitable, and a Sanders win is far from impossible.\n\n\n\nHowever, it\'s worth remembering with that with all of the Clinton\ncampaign\'s mistakes and Obama\'s talents and advantages in 2008, we barely\nbeat her. This time around, the environment is better and she is a better\ncandidate, running a much better campaign against a less well-known\nopponent with fewer resources and a narrower coalition.\n\n\n\nFor all the contretemps about emails, speeches and roped-off reporters,\nelections are about fundamentals and the fundamentals point to a decisive\nif hard fought victory for Clinton.\n\n\n\nA lot can change in the coming months, but at this point in the race,\neveryone should stop all the bed-wetting.\n\n\n\n*Donald Trump\'s Latino comments are just GOP orthodoxy in a cruder shell\n<http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/07/donald-trump-mexico-immigration-republican-politics>\n// The Guardian // Jeb Lund \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nalling Donald Trump an idiot is not one of those things you will find on a\nlist of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most arduous tasks. But if you looked to the current\nfield of viable Republican presidential candidates, you\xe2\x80\x99d think it amounted\nto an impossibility on par with finding an error in the Bible. A party that\ndesperately needs to win more Latino votes in the 2016 election evidently\nconsiders condemning Trump\xe2\x80\x99s depiction of Latin American immigrants as\nrapists and fiends something worth half-heartedly getting around to\neventually.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Mexico (meaning the Mexican Government) send its people, they\xe2\x80\x99re not\nsending their best,\xe2\x80\x9d he said last month, when announcing his candidacy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not sending you (pointing to the audience). They\xe2\x80\x99re not sending\nyou (pointing again). They\xe2\x80\x99re sending people that have lots of problems,\nand they\xe2\x80\x99re bringing those problems to us. They\xe2\x80\x99re bringing drugs. They\xe2\x80\x99re\nbringing crime. They\xe2\x80\x99re rapists. And some, I assume are good people!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA dozen heroic culture warriors ordinarily wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take weeks to call out\nthis sort of vitriol, especially coming from a TV personality who\xe2\x80\x99s spent\n10 years sounding as tough as a cabbie who talks your ear off about the bar\nfight he broke up between \xe2\x80\x9cthree different guys who knew karate.\xe2\x80\x9d But\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s an explanation for that lack of courage. You can\xe2\x80\x99t castigate Donald\nTrump for acting like a stereotyping, fear-mongering bully when he\xe2\x80\x99s just\nfollowing your lead. The best you can do is accuse him of being loutish\nwhile doing it.\n\n\n\nHere are some examples of this responsive leadership in action:\n\n\n\nRand Paul, 17 days later: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s been saying, but uh, he\napparently is drawing a lot of attention.\xe2\x80\x9d He apparently chuckled when\nsaying this, so the thing he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about was funny. Also, I suppose\nwe should hope that \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear the thing you just said\xe2\x80\x9d works as well\nin the White House as it does as an excuse to avoid doing the dishes by\npretending that you\xe2\x80\x99re unaware your spouse just asked you to.\n\n\n\nBobby Jindal, 19 days later: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t view people as members of ethnic\ngroups or economic groups. This president has done too much to divide us,\nso obviously I disagree with [Trump\xe2\x80\x99s] comments. I think we need to look at\npeople as individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d Disagreed how? Also, Jindal\xe2\x80\x99s reply here is from\nthe Baby\xe2\x80\x99s First Libertarian Argument Handbook, e.g. Racism and classism\nare forms of collectivism, which is a form of leftism, which is why\nleftists like Obama are the ones who create racism and class warfare.\n\n\n\nChris Christie, 20 days later: Trump\xe2\x80\x99s comments were wrong and\n\xe2\x80\x9cinappropriate,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[I] won 51% of the Hispanic vote.\xe2\x80\x9d Points for\nChristie, but after about 10 seconds on Trump, he immediately pivoted from\nTrump to call out Ted Cruz for being hypocritical about criticizing other\nRepublicans. There\xe2\x80\x99s no indication how or why Trump is wrong or why\nChristie appeals to Latinos; instead, the next five minutes of the\ninterview address Cruz, entitlement reform and tone-policing of Trump.\nSpeaking of which:\n\n\n\nRick Santorum, 19 days later: \xe2\x80\x9cWhile I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the verbiage he\xe2\x80\x99s used, I\nlike the fact that he is focused on a very important issue for American\nworkers and particularly, legal immigrants in this country.\xe2\x80\x9d Misuse of\nverbiage aside, this ducks the substance of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s comments, which weren\xe2\x80\x99t\nabout American workers but about Mexican \xe2\x80\x9cfelons\xe2\x80\x9d streaming over the\nborder. Instead, Santorum implies that what Trump said was wrong because of\nhow he said it, which probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising coming from someone who, on\nthe 2012 campaign trail, addressed \xe2\x80\x9centitlements\xe2\x80\x9d with, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\nmake black people\xe2\x80\x99s lives better by giving them somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s money.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nTo be fair, some Republican candidates did condemn Trump. Former New York\nGovernor George Pataki emphatically criticized The Donald, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the\nsort of thing you can do when you\xe2\x80\x99re polling about as well as write-in\nvotes for Captain Kirk. Lindsey Graham, who is running for Secretary of\nDefense in someone else\xe2\x80\x99s administration, was likewise free to say\nsomething realistic.\n\n\n\nEven a few viable candidates reluctantly stood up as slowly and vaguely as\npossible.\n\n\n\nRick Perry, 19 days later: \xe2\x80\x9cI will stand up and say that those [comments]\nare offensive, which they were.\xe2\x80\x9d Again, Perry eventually tone-polices\nTrump, but what that means is anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess. This is the same guy whose\nconcerns about the appearance of offensiveness to minorities was low enough\nto see him vacation at N*****rhead Ranch. This is also the same guy who, in\nAugust 2014, told CNN\xe2\x80\x99s Candy Crowley, \xe2\x80\x9cSince September of \xe2\x80\x9908, we have\nseen 203,000 individuals who have illegally come into the United States,\ninto Texas, booked into Texas county jails. And, Candy, these individuals\nare responsible for over 3,000 homicides and almost 8,000 sexual assaults.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhich is a bunch of BS.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush, 14 days later: Bush said that Trump does \xe2\x80\x9cnot represent the\nvalues of the Republican Party,\xe2\x80\x9d in Spanish. In English, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\nagree with him. I think he\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d Which, hey, fair play to Bush. Four\ndays later, he added that he \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely\xe2\x80\x9d took personal offense to Trump\xe2\x80\x99s\ncomments, in light of his own family. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Columba, is Mexican. One\nwonders, though, if Bush forgot about that for two weeks.\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio, 17 days later: \xe2\x80\x9cTrump\xe2\x80\x99s comments are not just offensive and\ninaccurate, but also divisive,\xe2\x80\x9d the candidate said, before immediately\nlaying racial problems at Obama\xe2\x80\x99s feet and reassuring the base about his\nown policies. \xe2\x80\x9cOur next president needs to be someone who brings Americans\ntogether \xe2\x80\x93 not someone who continues to divide. Our broken immigration\nsystem is something that needs to be solved, and comments like this move us\nfurther from \xe2\x80\x93 not closer to \xe2\x80\x93 a solution. We need leaders who offer\nserious solutions to secure our border and fix our broken immigration\nsystem.\xe2\x80\x9d Those serious solutions amount to \xe2\x80\x9csecuring the border\xe2\x80\x9d in the\nsame vague but absolutist way that Trump would, in addition to imposing\nimmigration standards that would not have applied to either of his parents.\nIn effect, what Donald Trump said about the border and immigration was\nwrong because he labeled immigrants as felons, rather than wanting to lock\nthem out on general principle.\n\n\n\nBut if you want to take the temperature of the Republican response to\nTrump, look to Ted Cruz, who in his grandstanding way can\xe2\x80\x99t help but give\naway the game. Fifteen days after Trump\xe2\x80\x99s comments, Cruz defended Trump\nagainst the loss of relationship with NBC, stating, \xe2\x80\x9cI think he speaks the\ntruth, and I think NBC is engaging in political correctness that is silly\nand that is wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d Days later, on NBC, Cruz added, \xe2\x80\x9cI salute Donald Trump\nfor focusing on the need to address illegal immigration. \xe2\x80\xa6The Washington\ncartel supports amnesty, and I think amnesty\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBrand recognize Brand, and Cruz is happy to cross-promote one as\ninsubstantial as his. As my colleague Simon Maloy points out, it\xe2\x80\x99s good\nlong-term strategy. Whenever Trump fizzles out or realizes that campaigning\nis work, his voters have to go somewhere, and Ted Cruz wants them to have a\nhome. And Trump is currently polling second in Iowa and New Hampshire. Ted\nCruz\xe2\x80\x99s interest in those voters is no different than any other candidate\xe2\x80\x99s.\nBut, like Homer Simpson, he keeps accidentally saying the innocuous things\nin his head and the Republican inner monologue out loud.\n\n\n\nLook back at that list. Rand Paul ducked the question, while everyone else\navoided it or criticized Trump for the way he said things, not for having\nbad ideas about immigration. The most principled statements come from\ndead-enders, wafflers or hypocrites. Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s objection showed up two\nweeks late and came out of the mouth of a guy who spent a career being\nfairly positive about immigration before doing a 180 back in 2012 to appeal\nto hardline Tea Partiers and is now trying to walk that back. Rick Perry is\nbasically Trump with better hair and focus. And Marco Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s immigration\npolicy probably differs from Trump\xe2\x80\x99s only by one gaudy border fence.\n\n\n\nThe party has run so long on nativist anxiety about foreigners plundering\nlady liberty, stealing jobs and slowly strangling the republic to death\nthat the next step is just calling immigrants rapists, thieves and\nmurderers. And thanks to years of purity testing in Republican primaries,\nafter trying to ignore the issue for weeks, the remaining candidates have\nonly two options left: try to join or outflank Trump to the right or try to\nnon-ignore ignore him by writing him off as \xe2\x80\x9cinappropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe rest of the world can just call Trump an idiot, a man with few\nambitions outside of being Trumpy, whose remaining strands of what one\nmight call policy are wisps of spun sugar extruded by hot air, reminding\neveryone of the tacky coif that sits atop his blanched Smithfield Ham of a\nface. The Republican Party can\xe2\x80\x99t even luxuriate in ad hominem. Yeah, they\ncould call him an empty suit and a bozo, but that stops working the moment\nanyone notices that he sounds like a slightly loaded version of themselves.\n\n\n\n*Why Hillary Clinton Is Revising Expectations Downward\n<https://www.commentarymagazine.com/2015/07/07/hillary-clinton-inevitable-nominee-no-more/>\n// Commentary Magazine // Noah Rothman \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m baaaack!\xe2\x80\x9d former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced as she\ntook the stage in Iowa at former Senator Tom Harkin\xe2\x80\x99s annual steak fry\nevent in September of last year. Presidential campaigns are replete with\nbizarre moments, but perhaps none were as curious as Clinton implicitly\ncomparing herself to the poltergeist that torments little Carol Anne in the\nclassic flick of the same name. For a campaign that is itself haunted by\nthe ghosts of failure, it would have been in the best interests of the\ninevitable Democratic nominee to make the case for candidacy beyond her own\nprohibitive stature within her Party. If that pillar were to collapse,\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s viability as Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s successor would soon follow. Today,\nas the specter of a modestly competitive Democratic primary looms,\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign is at work setting back expectations for how well she\nwill perform in the early primary states and, in doing so, is chipping away\nat the central pillar holding her candidacy aloft.\n\n\n\nIn an appearance on MSNBC on Monday, Clinton campaign communications\ndirector and former White House communications official Jennifer Palmieri\nconceded that the former secretary\xe2\x80\x99s campaign had become formally \xe2\x80\x9cworried\xe2\x80\x9d\nabout the insurgent challenge to her inevitability mounted by Vermont\nSenator Bernie Sanders. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will be a serious force for the campaign, and I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think that will diminish,\xe2\x80\x9d Palmieri confessed.\n\n\n\nWhen the New York Times investigated the thinking inside the Clinton\ncampaign, reporters discovered that there was emerging consensus that the\ncoronation had been abruptly called off. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we underestimated that\nSanders would quickly attract so many Democrats in Iowa who weren\xe2\x80\x99t likely\nto support Hillary,\xe2\x80\x9d an unnamed advisor told the Times. Apparently, that\nfear was confirmed by other similarly well-placed sources. Ultimately, the\nTimes report suggested what former Democratic advisor Joe Trippi contended\noutright: \xe2\x80\x9cShe could lose Iowa.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s support has ebbed in recent weeks, particularly in Iowa among\nlikely Democratic caucus-goers. The most recent Quinnipiac survey of\nDemocrats in the Hawkeye State showed Sanders support had more than doubled\nsince May to 33 percent while Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s had ebbed some from 60 to 53\npercent. In a caucus state, in which energy and enthusiasm are the central\nelements of victory, the candidate with the most animated supporters can\nengineer an upset \xe2\x80\x93 as Clinton, who came in third in Iowa in 2008 behind\nBarack Obama and John Edwards, would attest.\n\n\n\nAnd if Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s support is ebbing, she only has herself to blame.\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign has not substantially adapted to changing political\ncircumstances in almost a year. \xe2\x80\x9c[H]er remarks were neither exceptional in\nwhat she said nor particularly passionate in how she delivered them,\xe2\x80\x9d\nWashington Post columnist Dan Balz wrote after digesting Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s steak\nfry performance. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were safe and largely predictable, a kind of\nDemocratic Message 101 heading into the most important stretch of the fall\ncampaign.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut the midterm campaign came and went and Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s tactics failed to\nevolve. Her campaign remains safe and predictable; she projects the air of\na candidate who is allergic to unscripted events and substantial contact\nwith unscreened voters. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s aversion to exposing herself to press\nscrutiny neared cartoonish levels when she was photographed perambulating\ndown a New Hampshire street amid a Fourth of July parade with the media\ngaggle almost literally in tow, straining at the ropes that held them at a\nsafe distance from the lofty figure in their midst.\n\n\n\nSo why would Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign want to shed her formerly cultivated air of\ninevitability? Even Trippi concedes that Clinton would merely shrug off an\nunthinkable loss in Iowa and go on to win the nomination anyway. Why would\nthe campaign that has spent so much energy and capital to stave off a\nreprise of what she described in her memoirs as an \xe2\x80\x9cexcruciating\xe2\x80\x9d defeat in\nthe Hawkeye State embrace the prospect that history might repeat itself?\nPerhaps because Sanders is the best challenger that Clinton could have\nhoped for.\n\n\n\nA fringe politician with a small but fanatical following who once held\nradical and deeply impolitic social views poses about as much challenge to\nClinton as former Texas Rep. Ron Paul posed to Mitt Romney. Clinton is in\nno danger of losing her party\xe2\x80\x99s nomination to Sanders in the same way she\nwould, say, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. But if Clinton appears\nsoft in a primary and, ultimately, beatable in a general, those beads of\nsweat dotting the brows of Democratic Party elders will soon grow into a\ncascading torrent. Draft efforts that failed to draw Warren, or any other\ncredible Democrat, into the race will be resurrected. Democratic careerists\nwho dared not challenge their party\xe2\x80\x99s anointed heir will think twice about\nwhether they made the right move, and a late entry into the race might\nspark a stampede among skittish and unenthusiastic grassroots Clinton\nsupporters. It is in Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s interests to cast Sanders as the best that\nthe anti-Clinton elements in her party can do.\n\n\n\nIs Hillary Clinton truly vulnerable in Iowa? Perhaps. A narrow loss is easy\nto envision. Might Sanders rob her of her party\xe2\x80\x99s nomination? That\xe2\x80\x99s far\nharder to imagine; at least, harder than it would be to see another\ncredible Democrat with broader appeal and proper left-wing bona fides\npulling off a successful coup. That\xe2\x80\x99s probably the true nightmare scenario\nthat Clinton hopes to stave off by feigning injury.\n\n\n\n*TOP NEWS*\n\n\n\n\n*DOMESTIC*\n\n\n\n*\xe2\x80\x98Complicated\xe2\x80\x99 Support for Confederate Flag in White South\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/us/a-georgia-county-where-the-rebel-flag-is-still-revered.html?ref=us&_r=0>\n// NYT // Richard Fausset \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nBrandon Heath, Haralson County\xe2\x80\x99s chief magistrate judge, flies the\nConfederate battle flag on his property. A version of it adorns the front\nbumper of his cherry-red Chevrolet pickup. It is painted on the wall of the\ngymnasium of his alma mater, Haralson County High School, where the sports\nteams are called the Rebels and Rebelettes.\n\n\n\nLike a number of people in this rural, working-class county \xe2\x80\x94 which is 92\npercent white and just beyond the creep of Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s western suburbs \xe2\x80\x94 Mr.\nHeath believes that efforts to remove the flag from public spaces across\nthe South are \xe2\x80\x9cplumb ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d And he insists that his reverence for the\nbanner has nothing to do with race.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just about where we come from, and locally here, we\xe2\x80\x99re just real\nproud of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Heath, 35, an auctioneer who, when not in court,\nfavors camouflage ball caps and speaks with an unhurried country twang.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all about your school, and your upraising, and who you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSupport for the Confederate flag may be waning among Southern lawmakers in\nthe aftermath of the church shootings in Charleston, S.C. But here in this\ncounty of 29,000 people, as in many other stretches of the white,\nworking-class South, the flag remains a revered symbol, not only of the\nConfederate dead, but of a unique regional identity.\n\n\n\nAt the Georgia Peach Oyster Bar, President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s campaign poster, altered\nto say \xe2\x80\x9cNope,\xe2\x80\x9d combined with a Confederate flag. Credit Kevin Liles for The\nNew York Times\n\nIn Haralson County, a ragged patch of low hills and homesteads at the\nsouthern tip of Appalachia, it can seem like the battle flag is baked into\nthe culture. One finds it displayed on the welcome sign in Buchanan, the\ncounty seat, as part of the seal of the Sons of Confederate Veterans,\nalongside that of the Lions Club.\n\n\n\nAnd while support for the flag is widespread here, its supporters, and\ntheir justifications, vary drastically: There are overt racists and avowed\nantiracists; students of history and those who seem oblivious to it; ardent\ndefenders of the Lost Cause and others who do not understand why the\nblue-spangled X on a red field \xe2\x80\x94 as ubiquitous here as deer stands, church\nsteeples and biscuits with gravy \xe2\x80\x94 can be so controversial.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just don\xe2\x80\x99t get why people are getting all mad about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Corey\nDoyle, 19.\n\n\n\nMr. Doyle, who was recently hired as a car salesman, was standing the other\nday with five other white protesters on a grassy berm outside the local\nWalmart, whose corporate office decided to pull Confederate merchandise\nfrom its shelves after the Charleston massacre.\n\n\n\nThe protesters waved the battle flag and an old version of the Georgia\nstate flag. That state flag, which prominently incorporated the battle\nflag\xe2\x80\x99s design, was introduced in 1956 by an arch-segregationist state\nLegislature as courts were ordering the South to integrate. It was replaced\nin 2001 by lawmakers more sensitive to Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s image to outsiders.\n\n\n\nPassing cars and trucks honked in solidarity as they turned into the\nparking lot.\n\n\n\nEarnest Fryer, 28, an ice cream truck driver, was waving the old state\nflag. Asked about its segregationist origins, he drew a blank. To him, it\nwas the flag that his father had given him, and one that had long adorned\nthe wall of his room, he said. Like Mr. Heath and Mr. Doyle, Mr. Fryer\ninsisted that his stand on the flag had nothing to do with matters of race.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want to offend nobody,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Fryer said, noting that he was part\nCherokee. Later, he said slavery was the \xe2\x80\x9cone thing that makes all the rest\nof my heritage look bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more about us than that one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\n\nAnd yet that one thing still looms disturbingly large.\n\n\n\nAt Kimball\xe2\x80\x99s General Store, a popular meeting place here, a man who\ndeclined to give his name blamed blacks for the new assault on the flag,\nand muttered a racial slur. Near Mr. Heath\xe2\x80\x99s office at the county\ncourthouse, a pickup parked beside a weatherworn house sported a pair of\nConfederate flags, and a window sticker that read \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Nazi Party.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nJust across the county line, the Georgia Peach Oyster Bar has operated as a\nscandalous open secret. Its website features two Confederate battle flags,\nthe description, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Original Klan, Klam & Oyster Bar,\xe2\x80\x9d and a stunningly\nvirulent collection of racist signs. Patrons are confronted with a\nselection of crude cartoons and graffiti, and a menu that declares, on the\nappetizer page, \xe2\x80\x9cWe cater to hangins\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Heath acknowledged the existence of such sentiments here. But he also\nnoted that this overwhelmingly white place, so committed to the flag, also\nelected a black man, H. Allen Poole, as the chairman of its Board of\nCommissioners in 2004, and has re-elected him twice. Last year, voters\nelected the state\xe2\x80\x99s first Asian-American Superior Court judge, Meng Lim, a\nCambodian refugee who grew up in the Haralson County city of Bremen.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s complicated,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Heath said.\n\n\n\nAt Haralson County High School, where the sports teams are called the\nRebels and Rebelettes, students once voted by a wide margin to repaint the\nbattle flag at the gym when it was defaced. Credit Kevin Liles for The New\nYork Times\n\nFor Mr. Heath, the flag helped get him elected in 2008, when he bounced\naround the county\xe2\x80\x99s rural back roads in his pickup, hunting for votes. The\nbattle flag was affixed to the front bumper. A 12-gauge shotgun was in the\ngun rack, and an old bloodhound was in the back.\n\n\n\nIt was all part of a package that validated Mr. Heath\xe2\x80\x99s regular-guy\ncredentials and bolstered his argument that the magistrate court would be\nbetter run by a self-proclaimed good old boy with a high school diploma\nthan by the lawyer who was the incumbent at the time.\n\n\n\nMr. Heath saw it as an appeal to a common culture, not a racial gesture, a\nway to show voters that he was one of them: conservative, Republican (the\ncounty went 81 percent for Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election)\nand, as he said, \xe2\x80\x9csalt of the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn a recent weekday morning, Mr. Heath gave a brief tour of Haralson\nCounty, starting with Hutcheson\xe2\x80\x99s Memorial Chapel and Crematory, where he\nintroduced the owner, Danny Hutcheson, the county coroner.\n\n\n\nMr. Hutcheson sat in a back room that was decorated with political and\nhistorical memorabilia, including a picture of an ancestor who, according\nto family legend, was robbed of his cattle by Yankee soldiers during the\nCivil War.\n\n\n\nHe says he does not display the flag for fear of upsetting his black\nfriends and clients. But he defends those who do.\n\n\n\nA reproduction of the old Georgia flag, which incorporates the Confederate\nbattle flag, on Mr. Heath\'s truck. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just about where we come from, and\nlocally here, we\xe2\x80\x99re just real proud of that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Credit Kevin Liles\nfor The New York Times\n\n\n\nMr. Heath drove on to the high school where the trophy room of the gym\nfeatures the battle flag painted on the wall.\n\n\n\nSuch displays have caused trouble here in the past. In September 2000,\nsomeone painted over a flag at the gym, and students were allowed to vote\non whether to repaint it. Repainting won by a vote to 861 to 150, according\nto news reports at the time. A group of black football players threatened\nto boycott a game, but that never materialized. It all seemed perplexing to\nCain Jackson, a 22-year-old graduate, who is white.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how it\xe2\x80\x99s racist to anybody,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nLater, Mr. Heath paid a visit to Mr. Poole, the chairman of the county\ncommission.\n\n\n\nMr. Poole, a Republican, said Southern governors were wrong to take the\nbattle flag down. He noted that he, too, had graduated from Haralson County\nHigh School in 1974, and had played safety and outside linebacker on the\nfootball team.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a Rebel,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor four years.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut not everyone is so comfortable. Angelica Griffin is also an\nAfrican-American, and also played sports at the high school. She said she\nwas \xe2\x80\x9cterrified\xe2\x80\x9d to criticize the flag while she was there.\n\n\n\nMs. Griffin, 28, recently completed law school at DePaul University in\nChicago and is studying for the bar exam. After the Charleston shootings,\nshe said, she posted her displeasure with the flag on social media,\nsparking debate and pushback from white friends back home.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople were so apt to defend it, without even thinking about other people\nand how that flag makes them feel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nBut Ms. Griffin also spoke about the time, in 2008, when her mother lost\nher job. White Haralson County neighbors showered her mother with money and\ngift cards so she could afford to drop her off at college.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what? It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Griffin said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the great\nconundrum of the South.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Air Force jet collides with Cessna over South Carolina, killing two people\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/07/07/military-jet-collides-with-cessna-over-south-carolina/?hpid=z4>\n// WaPo // Mark Berman \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015*\n\n\n\nTwo people were killed Tuesday morning when an Air Force fighter jet and a\nsmall civilian plane collided in the air over South Carolina, according to\nfederal authorities.\n\n\n\nEmergency responders rushed to a region north of Charleston, S.C., shortly\nafter 11 a.m., as word emerged of the rare midair collision that sent\ndebris raining down on the area below.\n\n\n\nThere were two people killed aboard the small plane, a Cessna 150,\naccording to the National Transportation Safety Board.\n\n\n\nThe pilot of the F-16 Fighting Falcon ejected safely, according to a\nstatement from Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter, S.C., where the aircraft\noriginated.\n\n\n\nAir Force officials later identified the pilot as Maj. Aaron Johnson of the\n55th Fighter Squadron at Shaw. After the crash, Johnson was taken to a\nclinic at Joint Base Charleston to be examined.\n\n\n\nJohnson was conducting a routine instrument training mission when the crash\noccurred, Col. Stephen F. Jost, commander of the 20th Fighter Wing at Shaw,\nsaid at a news conference on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\n\nIt did not appear that Johnson had any injuries, Jost said, and the pilot\nwas expected to return to Shaw on Tuesday evening.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you in my experience, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had any close calls because the\nAir Force is very disciplined about how it operates its aircraft,\xe2\x80\x9d Jost\nsaid.\n\n\n\nWhile Jost said that he knows about military planes colliding, he has never\nseen a military plane crash into a civilian one.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very rare, because of the procedures and the equipment we have in\nplace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA spokesman for Berkeley County said the two planes collided over\nLewisfield Plantation in Moncks Corner, a town about 45 minutes north of\nCharleston. The county government said it was setting up a command center\nin that town, which is near Lake Moultrie.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom what I understand from a witness, the military plane struck the\nother, small aircraft broadside,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill Salisbury, the Berkeley County\ncoroner and chief of the county\xe2\x80\x99s rescue squad, said at an earlier news\nconference on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\n\nDebris was seen on land as well as in the water, officials said Tuesday. In\nthe hours after the crash, authorities found the F-16\xe2\x80\x99s wreckage and some\nparts of the Cessna on the ground and the water, but they were still\nlooking for other parts of the Cessna.\n\n\n\nThe Cessna left the Berkeley County airport in Moncks Corner just before 11\na.m. and were likely heading for Myrtle Beach, Salisbury said. He said that\na wallet was found after the collision.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have no reason to believe that anyone survived the crash,\xe2\x80\x9d Salisbury\nsaid.\n\n\n\nHe declined to identify the people who were on the Cessna, saying only that\nthey were believed to be from the area.

Meetings\nbetween Taliban representatives and Afghan officials have taken place in\nrecent months in Qatar, China and Norway.\n\n\n\nAt least one dead in Taliban attack on Afghan intelligence agency(0:48)\n\nThe Taliban on Twitter claimed responsibility Tuesday for two attacks that\nrocked the Afghan capital that same day. (Reuters)\n\nBut this meeting carried more significance because of Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s\nlong-standing ties to the Taliban, as well as Afghan President Ashraf\nGhani\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to persuade Pakistan to play a significant role in bringing\nthe Taliban to the negotiating table. It was the first time such a\nsenior-level Afghan delegation has met face-to-face with Taliban\nrepresentatives.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have always had a pretty clear view of what Pakistan can and cannot do\nin terms of delivering the Afghan Taliban to the negotiating table,\xe2\x80\x9d a U.S.\nofficial, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss the\npeace efforts, said in a recent interview. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we see, at this point, a\nsustained effort by the Pakistanis to support President Ghani\xe2\x80\x99s effort.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Ghani\xe2\x80\x99s office announced through its official Twitter account\nthat \xe2\x80\x9ca delegation from the High Peace Council of Afghanistan has traveled\nto Pakistan for negotiations with the Taliban.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe council is a body that includes former Taliban members. It was created\nin 2010 by then-President Hamid Karzai to negotiate with elements of the\nTaliban. The delegation also includes Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x99s deputy foreign\nminister, Hekmat Karzai, a cousin of the former president.\n\n\n\nAccording to Pakistani officials, the Taliban sent four delegates\nrepresenting \xe2\x80\x9call top Taliban leaders.\xe2\x80\x9d A second U.S. official said the\nUnited States also sent representatives to the talks after being invited by\nthe Afghan and Pakistani governments.\n\n\n\nThe meeting between the two sides took place after the end of the daily\nRamadan fast, according to Pakistani officials. The talks continued past\nmidnight.\n\n\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the talks will have any impact on the\nconflict, now nearing the 14-year mark. Even as meetings have taken place\nin various countries, the Taliban has mounted fierce offensives across\nAfghanistan and dispatched suicide bombers to attack government officials\nand symbols of official power in Kabul and elsewhere.\n\n\n\nThe second U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to\ndiscuss sensitive negotiations, said the fact that legitimate\nrepresentatives of the Taliban and the Afghan government were meeting was\nsignificant.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means something. . . . But how you get to a process where you start\ntalking about substantive issues is a difficult question,\xe2\x80\x9d the official\nsaid.\n\n\n\nSome analysts have suggested that the Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s offensives are an attempt\nto strengthen its bargaining position ahead of potential peace\nnegotiations. There is also growing concern in the Taliban about the\nemergence of the Islamic State, which has been wooing Taliban factions to\ndefect and align with its cause. In Nangahar province, the Taliban is\nengaging in skirmishes with defectors operating under the Islamic State\nbrand who have managed to seize control of several areas of the province.\nThe specter of more fighters joining the Islamic State could prompt the\nTaliban\xe2\x80\x99s leadership to agree to a political settlement with the\ngovernment, some analysts say.\n\n\n\nBut there is also the question of which Taliban the Afghan government is\nnegotiating with. The insurgency is far less cohesive today than it was in\n1996, when it quickly seized power across Afghanistan. With its supreme\nleader, Mohammad Omar, not seen in years, many factions have become more\nindependent from the Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s core leadership. It remains unclear whether\nmany Taliban commanders would even accept a peace agreement \xe2\x80\x94 or would\ninstead continue fighting or would join the Islamic State.\n\n\n\nPakistan is viewed by some as a questionable intermediary. Many Afghans,\nincluding powerful political and military figures, remain suspicious of\nIslamabad and its motives. The Pakistani military and intelligence services\nhave long been viewed in both Afghanistan and Pakistan as the godfathers of\nthe Taliban, nurturing it as a proxy and providing haven to its leadership.\n\n\n\nPakistani officials on Tuesday said they are honest brokers.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPakistan, as a friend of Afghanistan, is trying to facilitate\nresult-oriented talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban,\xe2\x80\x9d said\na Pakistani security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity under\ngovernment rules.\n\n\n\nIn a meeting Tuesday with local reporters and political analysts, Ghani\nsaid the meeting in Islamabad would focus on \xe2\x80\x9cconfidence-building and\npreparing key points in the peace talks agenda,\xe2\x80\x9d and would set the stage\nfor future discussions, according to a statement from his office.\n\n\n\nGhani said that peace talks would be led by the Afghans, suggesting that\nthe Pakistanis would play a less visible role, and that the government was\nspeaking with the insurgents from a position of strength, the statement\nsaid. He also said that women will continue to be part of the peace\ndelegations.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur goal is reducing the violence level in the initial phase and then end\nit finally,\xe2\x80\x9d Ghani said, according to the statement.\n\n\n\n*Eurozone Sets Sunday Deadline for Greece Financing Deal\n<http://www.wsj.com/articles/solution-to-greek-crisis-wont-come-overnight-juncker-warns-1436255691>\n// WSJ // Gabriele Steinhauser And Matthew Dalton \xe2\x80\x93 July 7, 2015 *\n\n\n\nEurozone leaders set Greece a Sunday deadline to come up with new and\neven-tougher economic measures if the country wants to avoid defaulting on\nthe European Central Bank and crashing out of the currency union.\n\n\n\nAs a sweetener for such a deal, leaders raised the possibility of some\nshort-term financing to help Athens make a July 20 payment and\xe2\x80\x94most\nimportant for Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\xe2\x80\x94action down the road to\nrelieve Greece\xe2\x80\x99s crushing debt burden.\n\n\n\nObstacles to an agreement that keeps Greece in the eurozone remain high,\nhowever. Most notably, the policy overhauls and budget cuts demanded go\nbeyond those that were resoundingly rejected by Greek voters in a\nreferendum last weekend.\n\n\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said after Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s emergency summit of\neurozone leaders that it is up to Greece to act. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, at the very\nend, one will have to discuss how debt sustainability can be recreated but\nnot by saying first \xe2\x80\x98How do we close the gap?\xe2\x80\x99 but \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can Greece do?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said.\n\n\n\nShe added that Mario Draghi, the ECB president, made clear to leaders at\nthe summit that Sunday would be \xe2\x80\x9cthe right moment to take decisions\xe2\x80\x9d for\nGreece to avoid a meltdown of its banking system.\n\n\n\nMr. Tsipras said that the negotiation process would be fast. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe\nthere will be a solution by the end of the week at the latest,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nLeaders said that the broad outlines of such an agreement needed to be\nnailed down at a new summit on Sunday of the leaders from the entire\nEuropean Union, including nine countries that aren\xe2\x80\x99t in the eurozone.\n\n\n\nWithout some new cash in the coming weeks, Greece won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to make the\n\xe2\x82\xac3.5 billion ($3.8 billion) bond payment to the ECB, leading to the\ncountry\xe2\x80\x99s second default in less than a month.\n\n\n\nSuch a nonpayment could push the ECB to cut emergency lending to Greek\nbanks\xe2\x80\x94a move that would send the country\xe2\x80\x99s financial system into meltdown\nand force the government to print its own money to recapitalize them.\n\n\n\nGreek banks have been shut for more than a week, after the ECB put a limit\non the emergency loans they had been drawing to buffer growing deposit\noutflows. Cash withdrawals from ATMs have been limited to \xe2\x82\xac60 a day and\ndepositors are unable to transfer money abroad.\n\n\n\nSome short-term funding and the prospect of a longer-term bailout deal from\nthe rest of the eurozone could allow Greece\xe2\x80\x94and the ECB\xe2\x80\x94to let banks reopen\nand normal economic activity in the country to resume.\n\n\n\nGetting there, however, would require a formidable turnaround by Mr.\nTsipras and his government.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the pension cuts and tax increases, rejected in the\nreferendum, a new rescue package to keep the government afloat for two to\nthree years would require overhaul measures that had dropped out of\nnegotiations in recent months.\n\n\n\nThese, Ms. Merkel said, include changes to labor laws to make it easier to\nfire workers, changes to product markets and the privatization of state\nassets.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t about a program from today, or from yesterday or from 10 days\nago, for a program until November\xe2\x80\xa6this program is, according to the\nnow-withdrawn Greek request, meant to be two years long, so it is a\nmultiyear program,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Merkel said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat such a multiyear program has to entail more commitments is in itself\nclear,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\n\n\n\nOnly once that is clear, leaders would look at ways to make Greece\xe2\x80\x99s debt\nsustainable again, Ms. Merkel said, adding that any debt relief wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\ninclude cuts to the nominal value of rescue loans.\n\n\n\nBut talks on details of a final plan could drag on for weeks.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe short-term deal is only possible in a longer-term deal,\xe2\x80\x9d French\nPresident Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande said at his postsummit news conference. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nthe short-term deal has conditionality.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA senior French official pushed the idea that Greece could get emergency\nfinancing by passing just the budget measures of a potential agreement\nthrough the Greek parliament, and passing non-budgetary, more structural\nchanges later. But Germany may not accept that.\n\n\n\nEmboldened by Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s referendum, Mr. Tsipras came to Brussels to present\nhis eurozone counterparts a proposal for interim financing until the end of\nthe month, a senior Greek government official said.\n\n\n\nThat would give Greece and its creditors time to work out a longer-term\nfinancing deal and avoid defaulting on the ECB.\n\n\n\nMr. Tsipras was hoping to use the leverage from his referendum victory to\nwin enough of a political nudge from the summit that would allow the ECB to\nkeep its lifeline in place.\n\n\n\nHe raised the idea of interim financing with Ms. Merkel, Mr. Hollande and\nJean-Claude Juncker, head of the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s executive Commission,\nahead of the summit, the Greek official said.\n\n\n\nWhether the new reform commitments from Mr. Tsipras were credible, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\nsay today,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Merkel said later.\n\n\n\nAt a meeting of finance ministers earlier Tuesday, Greece\xe2\x80\x99s new finance\nchief, Euclid Tsakalotos, read out proposals the government had presented\nlast week, three European officials said.\n\n\n\nBut the new finance minister\xe2\x80\x99s performance raised some hopes among\nministers that things had changed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe minister Tsakalotos came for the\nfirst time in this meeting and he adopted clearly a constructive, moderate\nlistening mode, which I think was appreciated by all the colleagues,\xe2\x80\x9d\nPierre Moscovici, the EU\xe2\x80\x99s economics commissioner said.\n\n\n\nThe International Monetary Fund, which Greece technically defaulted on last\nmonth, has said \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive\xe2\x80\x9d debt relief should be included in any\nfurther bailout. But divisions still run deep in Europe.\n\n\n\nLeaders warned Tuesday that failure to strike a deal could catapult Greece\noutside the common currency.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a Grexit scenario prepared in detail,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Juncker.\n'
