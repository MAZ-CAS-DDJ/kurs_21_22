What I should have added is that when she was on the road is when she MOST needed to email personally, friends, family, etc. Time differences, trips were jam packed, etc.\n\nBut this brings up a good point. Heather, i'll connect with you separately on exactly what she was doing at that moment.\n\n\n\nFrom: Mandy Grunwald\nSent: Sunday, March 8, 2015 7:19 PM\nTo: Philippe Reines\nCc: Philippe Reines; Cheryl Mills; Robby Mook; Joel Benenson; Jim Margolis; Jennifer Palmieri; Kristina Schake; John Podesta; Nick Merrill\nSubject: Re: \x8cHuge gaps\xb9 in Clinton emails: Chairman of House Benghazi Committee | New York Post\n\n\n\nThis was apparently the day Diana Walker took the iconic photo of her on the plane looking at her blackberry.\n\nMandy Grunwald\nGrunwald Communications\n202 973-9400\n\n\nOn Mar 8, 2015, at 7:07 PM, Philippe Reines <pir@hrcoffice.com<mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com>> wrote:\n\nI can\x92t address the larger question of why the department didn\x92t. I believe the answer is that Oct 2011 was well outside the scope of what State was asked for until November 2014. So Gowdy is complaining about the last 3 months. State is not exactly nimble and are still responding to the Oct 2012 letter from Issa.\n\nBut for our narrow equities, the time when Hrc least needed to email for work was on trips. She had both her Deputy Chiefs of Staff with her, me, always a high ranking State person most relevant to the issue \x97 often career, a representative of the WH and the Pentago on the plane. Not to mention a four person State staff giving her paper. Not to mention she had a telephone. But it\x92s primarily because there was no time where she had more 24/7 human connectivity than on the road. She was living in a mobile office.\n\n\nFrom: Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com<mailto:gruncom@aol.com>>\nDate: Sunday, March 8, 2015 at 7:01 PM\nTo: PIR <preines.hrco@gmail.com<mailto:preines.hrco@gmail.com>>, Cheryl Mills <cmills@cdmillsGroup.com<mailto:cmills@cdmillsGroup.com>>, Robby Mook <robbymook2015@gmail.com<mailto:robbymook2015@gmail.com>>, Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com<mailto:jbenenson@bsgco.com>>, Jim Margolis <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com<mailto:Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com>>, Jennifer Palmieri <jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com<mailto:jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com>>, Kristina Schake <kristinakschake@gmail.com<mailto:kristinakschake@gmail.com>>, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com<mailto:nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>>\nSubject: \x91Huge gaps\x92 in Clinton emails: Chairman of House Benghazi Committee | New York Post\n\nDo we have an answer for why there are no emails from the Oct. 8 trip to Libya?\n\nhttp://nypost.com/2015/03/08/huge-gaps-in-clinton-emails-chairman-of-house-benghazi-committee/\n\n\nMandy Grunwald\nGrunwald Communications\n202 973-9400\n\n\n"
