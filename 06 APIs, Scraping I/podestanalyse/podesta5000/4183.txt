Obviously it struck a chord, because Barack Obama\'s campaign came\nout and did a pre-emptive negative campaign ad. which is pretty -- pretty\ninteresting from a tactical standpoint. But, you know, the bottom line is we\nemphasized this because it -- it\'s part and parcel \x96 "\n\n[...]\n\n"It\'s very important to draw attention to this for a couple of reasons. The\nmost important being, that Barack Obama says whatever he needs to say in\nfront of whatever group he happens to be in, which is why the Barack Obama\nrunning in the general election is very, very different from the Barack\nObama running in the primary election. and so when -- when Mr. Ayers was\nuseful to Barack Obama, then Barack Obama hung out with him.  As soon as he\nbecame a senator, he didn\'t. but you\'ve got him -- I mean, in meetings with\nhim in \'95.   Theoretically launching his political career at least, having\nan -- one of his very early meetings there. in \'97 endorsing his book and\nserving on boards with him through 2002, exchanging voice mails and e-mails\nwith him through 2005."\n\nHighlight #2\n*CNN Covers the "Michael Phelps of Town Halls" and His Proclivity for\nHostility *(CNN 10/06/08 6:50pm)\nCANDY CROWLEY: *McCain, said an Obama aid, is the Michael Phelps of town\nhalls. But the senator can be edgy and what he claims as humor can backfire\nin front of the uninitiated.*\n\nQUESTIONER: "Do you ever you worry that you might like die in office or get\nalzheimer\'s?"\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: "Thanks for the question, you little jerk."\n\nCROWLEY: "In truth, they both need to watch it tomorrow, they\'re in the\nmidst of the nasty season; the hostilities ever more personal. that may work\nin short sound bytes in front of adoring crowds. It does not work over the\ncourse of an hour and a half in front of cameras nor would those uncommitted\nvoters who will be asking the questions literally within feet of the\ncandidates. Style matters*. Victory may go to the candidate who can keep his\ncool."*\n\nHighlight #3\n*Pfotenhauer Says McCain is Cleared from Keating and Reminds of McCain\'s\nReform Efforts *(FNC 10/06/08 5:15pm)\n"in 1993, Senator McCain introduced legislation that would have established\na regulator for Fannie and Freddie that would have been housed at treasury.\nHe was focused on this very far in advance, and basically Barack Obama [\x85]\ncalled it in, but really it was Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, Chuck Schumer that\nwere leading the charge to prevent reform at Fannie and Freddie, so the\nDemocrats midwifed it with the help of a couple of Republicans, [\x85] Barack\nObama went right along with it."\n\n"[\x85] the bottom line is that he was exonerated.  He wasn\'t even found guilty\nof violating an ethics rule or senator proceduere or anything, much\nless  anything\nmore serious than that.  And, by the way, it really spurred him on to take\non one of the greatest missions of his career since then, which is reform\nefforts. That\'s what led to his campaign finance reform effort that took 14\nyears [\x85] leading the Abrahomoff investigation, all of that has become a\ncornerstone of McCain\'s career."\n\nHighlight #4\n*Him in 2000* (MSNBC 10/06/08 6:09pm)\nLAWRENCE O\'DONNELL: It turns out the special place in hell [...] that John\nMcCain mentioned for the people eight years ago who ran those ads against\nhim; that special place in hell turns out to be the McCain campaign where\nseveral of them are working and generating this new [attack] material.\n\nHighlight #5\n*Duhaime Insists McCain Has Taken a Leadership Position on the Economy *(MSNBC\n10/06/08 3:38pm)\nNORA O\'DONNELL: Are these new attacks part of a strategy to turn the page,\ntalk about something else?\n\nMIKE DUHAIME: [...] certainly Senator McCain has been talking about the\neconomy for the last few weeks. He\'s actually taken a leadership position\nduring the last few weeks where he suspended the campaign and came back to\nget the job done. Senator Obama was largely out of sight; basically said,\n\'If you need me, call me.\'\n\nHighlight #6\n*McCain Finds Qualification in his VP\'s Choice of Tax Return Service* (CBS\n10/06/08 7:36pm)\nJOHN MCCAIN: [Sarah Palin] the only one that did her income tax return at\nH&R Block.\n\nHighlight #7\n*McCain\'s Specialty: Town Hall Meetings* (MSNBC 10/06/08 6:40pm)\nSAVANNAH GUTHRIE: McCain has always been very good in these town hall\nformats.
