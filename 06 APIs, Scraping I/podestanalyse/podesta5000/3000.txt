The misguided Presidential candidate said, "Congress should come\nback into session, and I\'m willing to come off the campaign trail."\n\n"What Senator McCain seems to have forgotten is that he has missed every\nsingle significant energy vote of the last two years," LCV President Gene\nKarpinski said.  "In December 2007, his was the single vote that prevented\nthe Senate from transferring billions of dollars in tax subsidies from the\noil industry to clean, renewable energy sources.   It\'s nice that after\nnearly two years of playing hookey from his responsibilities in the Senate,\nJohn McCain has finally promised to cast a vote instead of casting about for\nvotes."\n\nThe last vote John McCain cast on a major energy proposal was on August 1,\n2006.  Senator McCain has missed all 15 of the following significant energy\nvotes since that day.\n\nRoll Call #210--June 13, 2007--Oil Refineries\n\nRoll Call #211--June 14, 2007--Undermining Renewable Electricity\n\nRoll Call #212--June 14, 2007--Virginia Offshore Drilling\n\nRoll Call #213--June 19, 2007--Liquid Coal\n\nRoll Call #219--June 20, 2007--Biofuels\n\nRoll Call #225--June 21, 2007--CAFE & Energy Efficiency Cloture\n\nRoll Call #226--June 21, 2007--CAFE & Energy Efficiency Passage\n\nRoll Call #416--December 7, 2007--CAFE & Clean Energy Cloture\n\nRoll Call #425--December 13, 2007--Oil Subsidies Repeal Cloture\n\nRoll Call #95--April 10, 2008--Ensign Amdt.\n\nRoll Call #123\x97May 13, 2008--Dominici-McConnell Amdt.\n\nRoll Call #141--June 02, 2008--Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act\n\nRoll Call #145--June 06, 2008--Boxer Amdt\n\nRoll Call #146--June 10, 2008--Consumer First Energy Act\n\nRoll Call #147--June 10, 2008--Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act\n\n###\n\n\n------ End of Forwarded Message\n\n\n\n-- \nEddie Vale - Communications Director\nProgressive Accountability\n202-609-7692 (office)\n631-334-8191 (cell)\nEddVale (AIM)\neddie@progressiveaccountability.org\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
