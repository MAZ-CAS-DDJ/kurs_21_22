john.podesta@gmail.comb'John-- I just wanted to quickly give you a few points from the event I hosted in LA for Hillary last week. \nWe raised  $1.6 million--a great team effort.  Buffet was also a big draw and very interesting in an hour plus Roundtable with about 30 people \nHillary skipped the stump speech and did 40 minutes of q&a-- she was terrific and energized in that format which demonstrated how knowledgeable she is on a broad range of topics. She got a very enthusiastic reaction from 300 people-- a sellout. \nI gave her a copy of the memo I sent you in October and we had a good discussion of some of it as well as a couple points related to Dodd Frank vs the bigger threat in shadow banks  plus my support for her view that Glass Steagle is not particularly relevant  as a cause of the financial crisis   \nHope all this helps.  I know the next couple months are critical \nAll the best \nRussell \n\nSent from my iPhone'
