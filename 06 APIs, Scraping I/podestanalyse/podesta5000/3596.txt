To our delight, just before the holidays Bloomberg approved a $500,000 grant to ClimateWorks.  Bloomberg also decided they wanted to move the funds in 2015, so our team worked quickly to finalize the paperwork Bloomberg needed.  We received the $500,000 by wire transfer on December 23.  The funds are designated to support our \x93green finance strategy scoping and development for China.\x94\n\nThis brings the number of Funders Table participants who have substantial current investments in ClimateWorks to six (Oak, Packard, Hewlett, KR, MacArthur, and Bloomberg).  You\x92ll recall one other Funders Table participant, the Tilia Fund, also made a modest first-time contribution to ClimateWorks in 2015 ($120,000 over two years).\n\nOf course, we continue to explore funding options with other Funders Table participants\x97as well as other funders that aren\x92t part of the Funders Table\x97and hope to attract additional support in 2016.  We\x92ll continue to enlist your help and update you on our progress.\n\nBest wishes in the new year,\nCharlotte\n------\nCharlotte Pera\nPresident & CEO\nClimateWorks<http://www.climateworks.org/> Foundation\n[http://www.climateworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CWF021015__0005_Global-View_-NASA.jpg]<http://www.climateworks.org/>\n\nClimateWorks<http://www.climateworks.org/>\nwww.climateworks.org\nResponse.
