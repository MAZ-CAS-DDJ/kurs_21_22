As chair of the Africa subcommittee on Foreign Relations, he has been a voice for US business interests on the continent.   I am proud to consider him a friend, and someone who genuinely cares about the place of the United States in the world.  He also serves on the Appropriations, Judiciary and Budget Committees.\n\nI hope you can join us for this small lunch, and to get to know (and be impressed by) Chris's thoughtful brand of leadership.  Details are below.\n\nNelson\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE JOIN\n\nStacey Bernards, Nelson Cunningham, Claude Fontheim\n(Host Committee in Formation)\n\nFor a Global Issues Luncheon with\n\nChris Coons\nUnited States Senate,\nDelaware\n\nGlobal Issues\nDevelopment, Trade and Foreign Policy\n\n\nWednesday, June 18, 2014\nNoon\n\n101 Constitution Avenue\nSuite 500 West\nWashington, DC\n\n\nSuggested Contribution:\n$2,500 Host / $1,000 Guest\n\n\n\nRSVP to Tracey Buckman 202-558-2290\ntracey@traceybuckman.com<mailto:tracey@traceybuckman.com>\n\n"
