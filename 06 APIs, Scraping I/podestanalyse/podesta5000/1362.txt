Lynch said that four of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest\nbanks would pay more than $2.5 billion after pleading guilty to\nmanipulating foreign exchange rate markets.\nBy Associated Press on Publish Date May 20, 2015. Photo by Gabriella\nDemczuk for The New York Times.\n\n    For the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest banks, what seemed like the perfect business\nturned out to be the perfect breeding ground for crime.\n\nThe trading of foreign currencies promised substantial revenues and\nrelatively low risk. It was the kind of activity that banks were supposed\nto expand after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nBut like so many other seemingly good ideas on Wall Street, the foreign\nexchange business was vulnerable to manipulation, so much so that traders\ncreated online chat rooms called \xe2\x80\x9cthe cartel\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe mafia.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNo one government agency is responsible for policing the currency market,\nleaving it up to committees, some run by the banks themselves, to set\nguidelines. And even when federal authorities adopted rules to rein in Wall\nStreet a few years ago, they exempted certain foreign exchange\ntransactions, a little-noticed concession to banks.\nOn Wednesday, four large global banks \xe2\x80\x94 Citigroup\n<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/citigroup_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org>,\nJPMorgan Chase\n<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/morgan_j_p_chase_and_company/index.html?inline=nyt-org>,\nBarclays\n<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/barclays_plc/index.html?inline=nyt-org>\nand Royal Bank of Scotland\n<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/royal-bank-of-scotland-group-plc/index.html?inline=nyt-org>\n\xe2\x80\x94 pleaded guilty to a series of federal crimes over a scheme to manipulate\nthe value of the world\xe2\x80\x99s currencies. The Justice Department accused the\nbanks of collusion in one of the largest and yet least regulated markets,\nnoting that at one bank one trader remarked \xe2\x80\x9cthe less competition the\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat lack of oversight, coupled with the pressure to squeeze profits from a\nrelatively middling business, set the stage for this scandal, one that\nunfolded nearly every day for five years. The crimes described on Wednesday\nalso painted the portrait of something more systemic: a Wall Street culture\nthat enabled many big banks to break the law even after years of regulatory\nblack marks after the crisis.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you aint cheating, you aint trying,\xe2\x80\x9d one trader at Barclays\n<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/barclays_plc/index.html?inline=nyt-org>\nwrote in an online chat room where prosecutors say the price-fixing scheme\nwas hatched.\n\nIn announcing the cases, the Justice Department emphasized that the banks\xe2\x80\x99\nparent companies entered the guilty pleas rather than a subsidiary,\nrepresenting a new frontier in efforts to punish Wall Street misdeeds. At a\nnews conference, Loretta E. Lynch showed that she had taken on the mantle\nas top Wall Street cop, less than a month after she was confirmed to\nreplace Eric H. Holder Jr. as attorney general.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x99s historic resolutions are the latest in our ongoing efforts to\ninvestigate and prosecute financial crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Lynch said on Wednesday.\n\nFor the banks, though, life as a felon is likely to carry more symbolic\nshame than practical problems. Although they could be barred by American\nregulators from certain activities, the banks scrambled behind the scenes\nto persuade those regulators to grant exemptions. That process, which\ndelayed the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s announcement by a week, already led\nto the Securities\nand Exchange Commission\n<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/securities_and_exchange_commission/index.html?inline=nyt-org>\nproviding a number of waivers that allow the banks to conduct business as\nusual.\n\nAdvertisement\n Continue reading the main story\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/21/business/dealbook/5-big-banks-to-pay-billions-and-plead-guilty-in-currency-and-interest-rate-cases.html?ref=business#story-continues-5>\n\nAnd at least for now, the Justice Department did not indict any employees\nwhose errant instant messages underpin the cases against the banks. The\nbanks long ago dismissed most of the employees suspected of wrongdoing,\nthough New York State\xe2\x80\x99s financial regulator, Benjamin M.

Photo by Aaron Byrd/The New York Times.\n\nA fifth bank, UBS\n<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/ubs-group-ag/index.html?inline=nyt-org>,\nwas also accused of foreign currency manipulation. Although it was not\ncriminally charged for that misconduct, the accusations cost the bank an\nearlier nonprosecution agreement related to the manipulation of another\nfinancial benchmark, the London Interbank Offered Rate\n<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/l/london_interbank_offered_rate_libor/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier>,\nor Libor\n<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/l/london_interbank_offered_rate_libor/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier>,\nwhich underpins the cost of trillions of dollars in credit cards and other\nloans. The Justice Department voided that nonprosecution agreement,\nprompting UBS\n<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/ubs-group-ag/index.html?inline=nyt-org>\nto plead guilty to Libor manipulation, a rare stand against corporate\nrecidivism.\n\nIn private negotiations, lawyers for UBS argued that the punishment was\n\xe2\x80\x9cunfair,\xe2\x80\x9d and had the bank\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive make an in-person entreaty to\nprosecutors. But even after appealing to the deputy attorney general, their\nrequest was denied, a person briefed on the negotiations said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUBS has a \xe2\x80\x98rap sheet\xe2\x80\x99 that cannot be ignored,\xe2\x80\x9d said Leslie Caldwell, head\nof the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s criminal division.\n\nThe five banks \xe2\x80\x94 which also struck civil settlements with the Federal\nReserve, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/commodity_futures_trading_commission/index.html?inline=nyt-org>,\na British regulator and Mr. Lawsky \xe2\x80\x94 agreed to pay about $5.6 billion in\npenalties. That comes in addition to the $4.25 billion that some of these\nbanks agreed to pay in November to many regulators.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is very little that is more damaging to the public\xe2\x80\x99s faith in the\nintegrity of our markets than a cabal of international banks working\ntogether to manipulate a widely used benchmark in furtherance of their own\nnarrow interests,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aitan Goelman, the trading commission\xe2\x80\x99s head of\nenforcement.\n\nThe foreign exchange business may have been particularly susceptible to\nmanipulation, analysts say, because it can be less profitable than other\nforms of trading. That dynamic may have increased the incentives for the\ntraders to break the rules.\n\nAnd unlike the stock market, where regulators can monitor every trade,\nfederal regulators lack a formal mandate to watch the currency market. In\nfact, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, Congress opened the door to\nregulating the market, but the Treasury Department exempted portions of it\nfrom certain new rules.\nContinue reading the main story\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/21/business/dealbook/5-big-banks-to-pay-billions-and-plead-guilty-in-currency-and-interest-rate-cases.html?ref=business#story-continues-8>\n  Timeline: Tracking the Libor Scandal\n<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/23/business/dealbook/db-libor-timeline.html>\n\nThat regulatory gap has started to narrow. Banking regulators, which have\nthe authority to root out unsafe practices, are increasingly scrutinizing\ncurrency trading desks in light of the scandal.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has come under even higher levels of scrutiny than certain other fixed\nbusinesses went through after 2008 financial crisis,\xe2\x80\x9d said George\nKuznetsov, head of research and analytics at Coalition, a financial\nanalytics provider.\n\nFacing that scrutiny, the trading desks have lost some of their swagger.\nSome senior traders now spend less time trading and more time retraining\ntheir teams and meeting with clients to reassure them that their business\npractices are sound, people close to the business say. Many banks have\nreined in chat rooms, which were at the heart of the fixing scheme but were\nalso a home for trading desk banter and camaraderie.

Investors tend to place fewer trades when prices are moving largely\nin one direction.\n\nThe foreign exchange market did brighten a bit in the first quarter, as the\nbanks said their results were buoyed by diverging monetary policies around\nthe world and increased volatility.\n\nDespite the headaches, most large banks remain committed to foreign\nexchange because valuable clients like hedge funds and big companies demand\nit. For banks desperate to advise big companies on mergers and\nacquisitions, they see foreign exchange as a \xe2\x80\x9cgateway\xe2\x80\x9d toward attracting\ntheir more profitable business.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForeign exchange is not a complete loss leader for the banks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fred\nCannon, a banking analyst with the investment bank Keefe Bruyette & Woods.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is not a profitable stand-alone business either.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBecause so many buyers and sellers flood the foreign exchange market \xe2\x80\x94 more\nthan $5 trillion changes hands every day \xe2\x80\x94 the money banks can charge for\nbrokering trades tends to be lower than for products like derivatives.\n\nTo get an edge, prosecutors say, traders at the five banks colluded to pad\ntheir returns from at least 2007 and 2013. To carry out the scheme, one\ntrader would typically build a huge position in a currency, then unload it\nat a crucial moment, hoping to move prices. Traders at the other banks\nwould play along, coordinating their actions in online chat rooms.\n\nThe banks also misled their clients about the price of currencies, the\nfederal and state authorities said, imposing \xe2\x80\x9chard markups,\xe2\x80\x9d which one\nBarclays employee described as the \xe2\x80\x9cworst price I can put on this where the\ncustomer\xe2\x80\x99s decision to trade with me or give me future business doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nchange.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the invitation-only chat room known as \xe2\x80\x9cthe cartel,\xe2\x80\x9d the stakes were\nhigh. \xe2\x80\x9cMess this up,\xe2\x80\x9d one newcomer was warned, \xe2\x80\x9cand sleep with one eye\nopen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on May 21, 2015, on page A1 of\nthe New York edition with the headline: Banks Admit Scheme to Rig Currency\nPrice .
