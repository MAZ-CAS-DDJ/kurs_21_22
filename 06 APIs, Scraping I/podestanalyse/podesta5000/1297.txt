john.podesta@gmail.comb"Hi Mr. Podesta,\n\nThanks so much for taking the time to get together on Tuesday, I greatly\nappreciate it and I know your time is very valuable.\n\nWe had mentioned a few different options for next steps for me. For\nagencies you had mentioned that, given my leadership on the phone unlocking\ncampaign, I should connect with NTIA's Lawrence Strickland and FCC's\nChairman Wheeler. I also thought I may be a potential fit over at OSTP if\nyou knew someone over there. And for lobbying firms, given my work on the\nconservative side and with tech, you had mentioned Heather Podesta's firm\nand Tony Podesta's group as a potential fit.\n\nI have enclosed my CV here if you wouldn't mind introducing me to some of\nthose folks. I greatly appreciate your advice and assistance.\n\n [image: photo]\n*Derek Satya Khanna*\nTechnology Consultant\nYale Law Scholar (Information Society Project)\nm:(202) 643-2483 | e:Derek.Khanna@gmail.com | w:@DerekKhanna\n<http://derekkhanna/>\n <http://twitter.com/derekkhanna> <http://linkedin.com/in/derekkhanna/>\n<http://facebook.com/derekkhanna>\n"
