But if we stand together, I know that we will not only elect a president who will protect our health care, education, and job benefits -- but also a new generation of progressive veterans like Tammy Duckworth, Jason Kander, and Joe Sestak who understand our needs. \n\nPlease make your $15 contribution to VoteVets before the clock strikes midnight. It is important. \n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/vv-deadline\n\nThank you for standing with VoteVets as we approach the final official FEC fundraising deadline of the year. \n\nAll of my best, \n\nRick Hegdahl \nIraq War Veteran \nVoteVets \n\n--------------\n\nI entered the service over 50 years ago, and it is hard for me to remember a more important election for veterans and military family members than the one ahead. \n\nAlmost every Republican candidate for president promises to continue, or even escalate, the cycle of endless war in the Middle East. One of them has even threatened to use nuclear weapons in the region. Meanwhile, a multi-million dollar Koch-connected effort is pushing hard to privatize veterans' health care.\n\nAnd then there's Donald Trump. Thankfully, the American people have consistently defeated demagogues like Donald and relegated them to the dustbin of history. But this time, it will be veterans leading the way.\n\nWith all this at stake, I want to ask you an important question: \n\nCan I count on you to contribute $3 to VoteVets before tonight's final FEC fundraising deadline of the year. It's important.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/vv-deadline\n\nI've been a VoteVets advisor since their launch in 2006, and I can't imagine a progressive organization better suited to meet the challenges of the coming election cycle.\n\nThank you for contributing before their final fundraising deadline of the year. It's important.\n\nThank you,\n\nGeneral (Ret.)
