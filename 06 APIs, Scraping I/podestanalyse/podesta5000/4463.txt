john.podesta@gmail.comb"John:\n\nWe have exactly 100 days left to make Iowa's fresh start happen.\xc2\xa0\n\nI've been campaigning across the state this weekend, with Monica Vernon in Ames and Sioux City, while I attended the Italian-American Heritage Festival in Des Moines and then headed to Creston, Corning, Clarinda, and Council Bluffs before joining Governor Martin O'Malley in Sioux City.\n\nWe're campaigning hard every day because we know Iowans are ready for a fresh start. We'll create jobs from the community up instead of giving huge tax breaks to undeserving corporations.\n\nWe can make the change with your help. Please make a contribution of $75, $50, or $25 today. (www.jackhatch.com)\n\nWe'll rebuild our rural roads and bridges that are among the worst in the country. Our schools will be world class again, and Iowa's children will again have a chance to get an early start with preschool.\n\nWe are coming down to the final stretch. Will you join us and restore honesty and integrity to Iowa's government?\xc2\xa0\n\nPlease make a contribution today of $75, $50, or $25 to give us the boost we need. (www.jackhatch.com)\n\nYou can count on us to make the change we need. Can we count on you?\n\nThanks,\nJack Hatch\n\n\n\nPaid for by Neighbors for Hatch\nPO Box 4915\nDes Moines, IA 50305\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 Neighbors for Hatch, All rights reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://act.myngp.com/el/-4574098818555640064/-985434706789726464"
