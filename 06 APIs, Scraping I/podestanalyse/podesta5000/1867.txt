john.podesta@gmail.comb' \nCrashing the Gates of the Status Quo \n\nSenate Majority Leader  Harry Reid\x92s announcement that he will send health \ninsurance reform to the floor  of the Senate this week signals that the long \nmarch to change America, that  began with Barack Obama\x92s announcement for \nPresident three years ago, has  arrived at the gates of what is most \ncertainly the \x93castle of the status  quo.\x94 \nThe next two months will \x96  without question \x96 be a decisive period in \nAmerican history. The Obama victory  opened up a great historic opportunity to \nmake fundamental change in  America.  But the ability of the progressive  \nforces to take advantage of that opportunity now hinges on our success at \nlaying  siege to that \x93castle\x94 and crashing through its gates by passing \nsignificant  health care reform. \nEveryone realizes that  health insurance reform is not just another piece \nof legislation.  But its significance goes well beyond  the fact that it \naffects one-sixth of the economy; or that it will massively  impact our country\x92\ns ability to create jobs in the future; or even that it will  determine \nwhether or not health care finally becomes a right in  America. \nIf we succeed in winning health insurance  reform we will have breached the \ngates of the status quo.  We will demonstrate that fundamental change  is \npossible.  Into that breach will  flow a wave of progressive change.  That \nvictory will also make it possible for us to pass legislation to  restructure \nthe energy economy \x96 to put the brakes on climate change and free us  from \nthe tyranny of foreign oil.  It  will make it possible for us to rein in the \npower of Wall Street and pass  long-overdue comprehensive immigration \nreform. It will make it possible to  structure a bottom-up economy that can \nproduce the jobs of the  future. \nOf course none of  these changes will happen automatically. The massive \nforces whose economic  interests lie in maintaining the status quo will not \njust roll over and concede  defeat.  But if they are capable of  preventing our \nvictory on health care reform, they will make it ever so much  more dif\nficult for us to succeed on other critical fronts. \nSo an enormous amount  is at stake \x96 both for the progressive agenda and \nfor the forces that oppose  us. \nAll depends on our ability to  vanquish the forces that -- over the next \ntwo months -- will use every weapon at  their disposal to prevent our success. \n It won\x92t matter whether the special interests in question have a  \nfundamental interest in health care.  The Chamber of Commerce, the insurance \nindustry, the Republican Party,  and right wing talk show hosts will all rally to \ndefend the status quo.  They understand beyond the shadow of a  doubt the \nsignificance of this engagement. They will lie, they will threaten,  they will \nsew fear, they will batter our supporters with negative  advertisements, \nthey will pay for busloads of right wing zealots, they will  offer jobs, they \nwill do favors, they will bite, scratch and poke out eyes \x96  they will do \nwhatever is necessary to prevent us from breaching those  gates. \nIt is up to us to have  the resolve, the resourcefulness and endurance to \ndefeat them. \nThis particular battle is so  decisive for three reasons: \n1). Change is about momentum. Just as  in physics, it takes a great deal \nmore energy to accelerate an object at rest  than it does to continue its \nmotion.  Those who fear change have always used delay and obstruction to slow  \nmomentum to a standstill.  \nIn the Senate, the  other side will do everything it can to delay action.  \nTheir first trick will be to demand that  the entire 1,900 page bill be read \naloud.   America has  debated health insurance reform for over 60 years.   \nWe have seriously debated the  current round of proposals for nine months. \nNow is the time for action.  Americans deserve and up or down vote on  health \ncare. \nAs we confront the  obstructionists in the Senate, we must maintain our \nmomentum for change and make  our movement a battering ram that is un-slowable \nand therefore unstoppable.  Progressives in the Senate cannot accept  \ninfinite delay.  They must be \x96 and  I believe they are \x96 prepared to use every \nparliamentary technique available to  make certain there is an up or down \nvote.  If the other side insists on a filibuster, we need to make them  \nfilibuster \x96 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  We need to force them to stay on the  \nSenate floor and show themselves to be the obstructionists they are, for as \nlong  as it takes. \n2). To maintain an  unjust status quo, those with power must always prevent \nthe majority from  believing that change is possible.  They must extinguish \n hope.  They must convince us  that the status quo is immutable \x96 the \nnatural order \x96 that we must accommodate  ourselves to things as they are, and \nsatisfy ourselves with our lot in  life. \nOnce people see that change  is possible, the flood gates open, so the \ndefenders of the status quo  must prevent us from even imagining a different \nworld.  \nOnce the sons and  daughters of African American families left their lives \nas sharecroppers in the  South \x96 took jobs in Chicago and New York \x96 saw \nEurope  during World War II -- there was no longer any stopping the surging \ndemand for  change that ultimately became the civil rights movement.  \nSuddenly, they could imagine the  possibility of a different world.    \nThe other side understands  this completely.  If they block health care \nreform, they  know that it will convince millions of Americans that change \x96 \nnot just health  care reform -- is not possible \x96 that they have to live with \nthings as  they are.  They know it will  snuff out the light of hope that \nwas ignited by the Obama victory. And just as  important, it will drain the \nreservoir of confidence that President Obama can  make change.  They know it \nwill  cause America to lose faith in possibility  \x96 and that is exactly what \nthey desperately want to do, because they know that  the reverse is also \ntrue.  They know that if we win, faith in the  possibility of change \x96 and in \nPresident Obama\x92s ability to deliver change \x96  will explode. \n3). The outcome of this battle will send a  signal to economic and social \nforces throughout American society, telling them  whether they should get \nonboard the bandwagon of change, or settle in and  accommodate themselves to \nthe status quo. \nThat is true of politicians  who know that failure will make change appear \nto be \x93bad politics.\x94  It is true of business people who will  either make \ninvestment decisions that seek opportunities in a new economy, or do  their \nbest to exploit the inequities of the present order. It is true of  everyday \nvoters who want to be with a winner. \nThe results of this  battle will define a narrative about the likelihood of \nchange that will shape  millions of individual decisions about career and \neducational choices,  investment opportunities, and votes.  \nThe battle that will  happen over the next two months will test the mettle \nof progressive leaders \x96 in  and out of political office.  More  than \nanything else it will be a test of wills.   \nIt is not appropriate  to pull out the big guns for every engagement.  You \ncan\x92t go-for-broke on every issue,  every day. But this is the time. \n\xb7       We must demand  that Congress pass a health insurance reform bill \nthat restructures the  relations of power in the health care industry by \ncreating a strong, viable  public option that will free us all from the \nstranglehold of the private  insurance industry.   \n\xb7       We must demand that  health care decisions are ripped from the \ncontrol of Wall Street investment  bankers and insurance company bureaucrats, \nand returned to doctors and their  patients.  \n    *   We must do whatever is  necessary to assure that we do not miss \nthis historic opportunity to finally  make health care a right for all \nAmericans.\nThis is an historic opportunity. Of course nothing in history is  \npreordained. It is up to us to make that history by winning this decisive  battle and \nturning this opportunity into a new era of progressive change in  America. \nRobert Creamer is  a long-time political organizer and strategist, and \nauthor of the recent book:  \x93Stand Up Straight: How Progressives Can Win,\x94 \navailable on _amazon.com_ \n(http://www.amazon.com/Listen-Your-Mother-Straight-Progressives/dp/0979585295/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1206567141&sr=8-1\n) . \n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
