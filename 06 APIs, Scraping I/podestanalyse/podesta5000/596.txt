john.podesta@gmail.comb'John, \n\n \n\nI know that it is important to include Liz Sherwood Randall in the\ntransition. Based on her ability to contribute to the DOD Agency team to\ndate, we had assigned her to the Russia policy team.  \n\n \n\nHowever, the organizational structure that Susan and Jim agreed upon today\nnow leaves Liz with a minor role (albeit one consistent with having a family\nin CA).  Given the level of interest, I wanted to double back with you. \n\n \n\nShould we put Liz Sherwood back on DOD Agency team so she has the choice of\na more significant role?  Pls advise.\n\n \n\n-sarah \n\n'
