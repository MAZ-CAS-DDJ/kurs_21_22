Rockefeller's and Feinstein's concerns.\r\n\r\nI'll ask John Podesta to make sure he or someone involved in this selection process calls Sen. Feinstein.\r\n\r\n----- Original Message -----\r\nFrom: Tom Daschle <tomd50@mac.com>\r\nTo: Pete Rouse\r\nSent: Fri Nov 28 07:53:09 2008\r\nSubject: Dianne Feinstein\r\n\r\nGood morning, Pete.\r\nI hope that you had a good Thanksgiving.\r\nOurs was very nice.  Linda's parents are here.\r\nThe kids came over.  I cooked.\r\n\r\nDianne Feinstein called me last night.\r\nShe apologized for calling on Thanksgiving but said she was calling for herself and Jay Rockefeller and that it was urgent.\r\n\r\nShe had heard that the Intelligence team was going to be announced on Monday.  She was very concerned about that.\r\nHer choice to head Intelligence is Dennis Blair, although she has some concerns about a problem in his recent past that she described at length to me. She doesn't think his problem has been resolved satisfactorily. She is opposed to Jane Harmon even though Jane is a friend and has heard that she may be Barack's choice.\r\n\r\nShe wanted me to find out the status of these appointments and the plans for rollout.\r\n\r\nAs you know, she will be chair of the Intelligence committee.  It might make sense for someone with authority and knowledge of the circumstances to call her today. Her cell number is 202 812 6972. Her home number is: 415 929 2254.\r\n\r\nIf you or someone could let me know if/when you are going to call her, I would appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nTom\r\n"
