I suggested we start spending as much time as we can over the next few weeks reviewing/discussing/revising the org charts so she can start forming a point of view on organizational structure.  I want to get completely aligned on exactly what roles we think we need, what purpose they serve, and what kind of people we're looking for.  Then we can ratify an interview process and drill down on the prospect lists.  She said she felt ready to start doing that.\n> \n> 2) We talked more about pollsters and the message process.  She wants to include Benenson and I recommended that he be in an advisor role...but obviously he can also do some of the work if we want.  There's a fundamental conflict of interest with his WH work, so it's better to start small and get bigger if we're comfortable.  She's meeting with Pollock and Anzalone this coming week...she seems inclined just to have Pollock and Benenson at this point.  Based on the discussion with Wendy, I'm going to get back to her with a plan for the research process as a whole. \n> \n> \n> \n> \n"
