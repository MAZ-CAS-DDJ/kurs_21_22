We'll need to vote to fill these two positions during our December meeting.

Personally, I would be very happy to see Sue and Pam continue in these roles for at least another year, but we are fortunate to have a board that is full of people who would be excellent in the chair role.\n> \n> We'll use part of our time in the morning executive session to discuss this topic and vote.
