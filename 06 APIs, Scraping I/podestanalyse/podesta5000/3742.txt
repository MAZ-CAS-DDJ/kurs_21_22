john.podesta@gmail.comb'Is the message we want to send that our middle class \x93competes on a fair playing field overseas\x94 or that our middle class doesn\x92t get screwed (not those words of course).  I just think the issue of \x93fair trade\x94 with normal folks goes in the category of the \x93deck stacked against them\x94 so I think we should be more protective of foul play in anything she says.  She is in their corner.\n\n\x97 John Anzalone\nAnzalone Liszt Grove Research\n334-387-3121\nwww.algpolling.com\ntwitter: @AnzaloneLiszt\n\n\nFrom: Robby Mook <robbymook2015@gmail.com<mailto:robbymook2015@gmail.com>>\nDate: Saturday, March 21, 2015 at 3:57 PM\nTo: Jake Sullivan <jake.sullivan@gmail.com<mailto:jake.sullivan@gmail.com>>\nCc: John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>, Jennifer Palmieri <jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com<mailto:jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com>>, Kristina Schake <kristinakschake@gmail.com<mailto:kristinakschake@gmail.com>>, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com<mailto:dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>>, Joel Beneneson <Jbenenson@bsgco.com<mailto:Jbenenson@bsgco.com>>, Jim Margolis <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com<mailto:Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com>>, Mindy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com<mailto:gruncom@aol.com>>, John Anzalone <john@algpolling.com<mailto:john@algpolling.com>>\nSubject: Re: TPA/TPP\n\nThat\'s a relief to hear that you don\'t think it\'s moving.  If that\'s the case, I completely agree she should keep her powder dry.\nOn the quote--and I agree she should have one ready for the event--I would maybe be more specific along the lines of "there have to be clear groundrules in these agreements that other countries must abide by the same labor standards and environmental protections that we do here so our middle class competes on a fair playing field overseas.  I\'m certain Americans can out compete anyone, but everyone needs to play by the same rules".  Others can say that better than me.\n\nOn Sat, Mar 21, 2015 at 4:45 PM, Jake Sullivan <jake.sullivan@gmail.com<mailto:jake.sullivan@gmail.com>> wrote:\nRobby - my sense is that the support isn\'t there now.

But I would prefer to avoid this at the event Monday and we\'ve been told by both cap and aft that they don\'t expect it to come up.\n\nIf it does come up, I would love guidance from the comms folks.   As a straw man, let me throw this out:\n\n"The details really matter.  I believe that there is a way to do this right. I want to make sure that trade legislation and trade deals look out for the middle class.   That\'s why the details really matter.  I\'ll have more to say on this in the days to come."\n\nThen I would have us do the letter.\n\n\n\n> On Mar 21, 2015, at 4:16 PM, Robby Mook <robbymook2015@gmail.com<mailto:robbymook2015@gmail.com>> wrote:\n>\n> Simas called--few updates:\n>\n> --This week, they\'re releasing a letter from former DNC chairs endorsing the deal\n> --Deval Patrick and Tom Daschle are going to roll out a progressive coalition supporting it\n> --They\'ve been told she\'s going to get asked about TPA/TPP at the Saunders event...I don\'t think Lee would ever try to screw her, but I can see someone else doing it.\n>\n> Three questions:\n> 1.
