john.podesta@gmail.comb'\nDear\xc2\xa0John,\xc2\xa0\n\nCandidates ask a lot from people, but for a good reason. It takes a lot of resources to run a campaign and get your message out to voters. This week it was my turn to ask for your help, and\xc2\xa0I cannot thank you enough for taking the time to look at my introductory message, forwarding my notes to your friends, following me on\xc2\xa0social\xc2\xa0media,\xc2\xa0and last but not least, for investing in my campaign.\xc2\xa0\n\nWe have a long road ahead, but I know that we can do this together. Again, I thank you and cannot wait to hear your feedback, your stories, and your input as we meet on the campaign trail and work together to build a brighter future!\n\nFor Progress,\xc2\xa0\n\n\nKim\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nForward to a Friend: https://act.myngp.com/el/484220105088108544/-2694012825883310080\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n|    Paid for by Kim Weaver for Congress    |\n---------------------------------------------\n\nKim Weaver For Congress\nPO Box 334\nSheldon IA 51201 United States\n\nIf you believe you received this message in error or wish to no longer receive email from us, please https://act.myngp.com/el/484220105088108544/-2766070419921238016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n -->'
