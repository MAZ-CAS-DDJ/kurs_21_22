john.podesta@gmail.comb'John --\n\nIt\'s time.\n\nThe Pentagon study released yesterday confirms what we\'ve long known: The military is ready to repeal "Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell."\n\nThe report found that 70 percent of troops do not believe the change would have a negative impact on morale, and troop readiness would not be affected.\n\nThis important news means that we are closer than ever to ending this discriminatory policy that punishes patriotic men and women who want nothing more than to serve our country -- and harms our own security by preventing qualified and much-needed Americans from serving.\n\nLast time, we were just two votes shy of passing repeal in the Senate. And now the lawmakers who have been dragging their feet have no excuses left.\n\nNeither do we. On this issue, our voices may not get more powerful than they are today -- after the military has weighed in, when the media is paying close attention, just before the Senate starts its debate.\n\nLet\'s ensure the Senate passes repeal -- and sends it to President Obama\'s desk -- before the end of the year.\n\nPlease add your name to the President\'s call to repeal "Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell" now:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/RepealDADT13\n\nThe release of the Pentagon\'s report is just one more sign that the days are numbered for "Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell."\n\nBut the Republican opposition in the Senate -- led by Senator John McCain -- is already digging in its heels.\n\nPeople like Sen. McCain said they would defer to military leadership -- and then refused to budge when people like Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Admiral Mike Mullen, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and former Secretary of State Colin Powell all came forward to support repeal.\n\nThese senators said they were worried about how repeal would weaken our military or hurt troop morale -- and that we should wait for the results of the Pentagon study.\n\nWell, the results are in: Our military believes the time has come to end "Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell."\n\nWe know that some of these senators are going to do everything they can to shift their standards once again. But we don\'t need them all to agree with us -- we just need two more votes to end this policy once and for all.\n\nWith the hearings set to begin tomorrow, it\'s important we make our voices heard now.\n\nJoin President Obama -- and add your name to the call for repeal:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/RepealDADT13\n\nThanks -- now let\'s make history,\n\nMitch\n\nMitch Stewart\nDirector\nOrganizing for America\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for America, a project of the Democratic National Committee -- 430 South Capitol Street SE, Washington, D.C. 20003.
