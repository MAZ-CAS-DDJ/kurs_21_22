john.podesta@gmail.comb'Jenny just reached out to me asking if you could get on the phone with\nDenis this afternoon. He very conveniently has a window right during your\noffice time HOLD time. I suggested that 3:00 CT/4:00 ET would work well.\n\nSound OK to you? Jenny is getting back to me on who will call who.\n\nThanks\n-- \nMilia Fisher\nSpecial Assistant to the Chair\nHillary for America\nmfisher@hillaryclinton.com\nc: 858.395.1741\n'
