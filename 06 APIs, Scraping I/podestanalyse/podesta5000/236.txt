"Ohio is\nhurting now, people in Ohio are having trouble staying in their homes,\nkeeping their jobs," he said as he set out on a two-day bus tour of the\nstate.\n\n \n\n"We have got to get this economy out of the ditch."\n\n \n\nObama, bidding to become the first black president, also pointed to the\ngovernment\'s report that the economy had declined in the third quarter.\nHe told a large crowd in Florida that McCain has been perched "right\nnext to George Bush" for eight years, and consumers are paying a steep\nprice for their partnership."\n\n \n\nThe Democrats who described the Obama campaign\'s approach to Emanuel\nspoke on condition of anonymity, saying they were not authorized to be\nquoted by name. An aide to the congressman, Sarah Feinberg, said in an\ne-mail that he "has not been contacted to take a job in an\nadministration that does not yet exist. Everyone is focused on Election\nDay, as they should be. "\n\n \n\nEmanuel is a veteran of President Clinton\'s White House, and has made a\nrapid ascent of the House leadership ladder since his election to\nCongress. He was chairman of the Democratic campaign committee two years\nago when the party won a majority for the first time in more than a\ndecade, and he cemented his reputation as a prodigious fundraiser and\nstrong-willed political strategist.\n\n \n\n# # #\n\n \n\nPress Secretary\n\nRepublican National Committee\n\n202-863-8614\n\nwww.GOP.com\n\n'
