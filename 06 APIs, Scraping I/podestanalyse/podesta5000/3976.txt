As ISIS has strengthened and the situation in the Middle East has deteriorated, the neocons have reasserted themselves&#8212;and this time they seem to have found receptive audiences in President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and other Democrats.\n\nIn this issue, <a href="http://www.democracyjournal.org/35/countering-the-neocon-comeback.php">Leslie H. Gelb</a>, president emeritus of the Council of Foreign Relations and Democracy advisory committee member, takes aim at the rejuvenated neocons and puts forward an alternative path for progressives to follow: a new American realism.\n\nNext: three terrific features. First, <a href="http://www.democracyjournal.org/35/what-new-left-history-gave-us.php">Rich Yeselson</a> dives deep into the world and work of the New Left historians and ponders their legacy. Next, <a href="http://www.democracyjournal.org/35/infiltrate-the-nsa.php">Margo Schlanger</a> calls for reviving civil liberties as a priority in our national security apparatus&#8212;and that begins with getting more civil libertarians in government. Finally, <a href="http://www.democracyjournal.org/35/the-disability-cliff.php">Samuel R. Bagenstos</a> offers his solution to the problem of the \xc2\x93disability cliff,\xc2\x94 that parlous threshold when state programs for disabled children disappear and disabled adults are left to fend for themselves. \n\nThere\xc2\x92s more: <a href="http://www.democracyjournal.org/35/the-reason-for-reagan.php">Rick Perlstein</a> on the reason for Reagan. <a href="http://www.democracyjournal.org/35/american-progressives-and-israel.php">Matthew Duss</a> on American progressives and Israel. <a href="http://www.democracyjournal.org/35/pilotless-program.php">Linda Robinson</a> on the rise of drone warfare. <a\nhref="http://www.democracyjournal.org/35/bring-back-corruption.php">Lee Drutman</a> on Zephyr Teachout\xc2\x92s new book. <a href="http://www.democracyjournal.org/35/whats-right-with-human-rights.php">Beth A. Simmons</a> on human rights law and its discontents. And <a\nhref="http://www.democracyjournal.org/35/automation-for-the-people.php">Christine Rosen</a> on automation and what it means to be human.\n\nFinally, do check out our website for exclusive web content.
