That may sound\nlike some sort of riddle, but it\'s an important question when it comes\nto the effectiveness of our health, safety, environmental, and\nconsumer finance protections.\nhttp://community.foreffectivegov.org/site/R?i=-wT7SyeO30lTRHIXurik6A\n\nIn a new report just released today, we found that trade associations\nand big business are shutting genuine small business voices out of the\nfederal rulemaking process and weakening some crucial standards and\nsafeguards meant to protect all of us.\nhttp://community.foreffectivegov.org/site/R?i=ydBWJ-nQXmW2jRJMM0lVoA\n\nThis is happening through a process required by federal law. EPA,\nOSHA, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have to hold\nspecial small business review panels if they believe a proposed\nstandard may have a significant economic impact on small businesses.\nBut Gaming the Rules: How Big Business Hijacks the Small Business\nReview Process to Weaken Public Protections shows that this process\nhas been captured by trade associations and their large corporate\nmembers.\nhttp://community.foreffectivegov.org/site/R?i=rW3krPw7Z1YrOjWKWrzzTA\n\nThe Office of Advocacy, an independent office within the Small\nBusiness Administration, has played a key role in this problem by\nrecommending that trade association representatives, rather than small\nbusiness owners, serve as advisors to these panels.\n\nSmall business owners have echoed our concerns. "Big businesses and\nthe trade associations that represent them have hijacked this\nprocess," said Frank Knapp, small business owner and president of the\nSouth Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce. "This effectively\ngives corporate interests early access to federal regulators and\nensures that small business voices are not heard."\n\nThe result: recommendations from the review panels have not been\nlimited to small business concerns, and in some cases, agencies have\nweakened health, safety, and consumer protection standards. This\nhappened with an important clean air standard from EPA and an OSHA\nstandard that was designed to protect workers from a cancer-causing\nchemical called hexavalent chromium.\n\nIt doesn\'t have to be this way. Our report contains recommendations\nthat the agencies and the Office of Advocacy can adopt to improve the\nprocess. These include identifying qualified small business owners to\nadvise the panels and limiting panel recommendations on public\nprotections to specific small business concerns.\n\nPlease take a look at our report. Then let these agencies know that\nthey should be listening to the voices of real small businesses.\nhttp://community.foreffectivegov.org/site/R?i=hYLOytRVVPHGiTjauCkrew\n\nWarm regards,\n\nKatherine McFate\nPresident and CEO\n\nDONATE\n\nhttp://community.foreffectivegov.org/site/R?i=4KSmMwKBxF_zev1EGLCL4w\n\nVisit Our Affiliated Web Sites\n\nRTK NET\nhttp://www.rtknet.org\n\nCoalition for Sensible Safeguards\nhttp://www.sensiblesafeguards.org\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/foreffectivegov\nhttp://twitter.com/ForEffectiveGov\nhttp://www.youtube.com/ForEffectiveGov\n\nCombined Federal Campaign #10201\n\nTo stop receiving e-mails like this, click to unsubscribe.\nhttp://community.foreffectivegov.org/site/CO?i=EYfDjas7I81Sztrv3SMz4Psrvj8GEMXs&cid=0\n\nhttp://community.foreffectivegov.org/site/R?i=P_9kU4yroW4cPyXDNRGLWw\n\n'
