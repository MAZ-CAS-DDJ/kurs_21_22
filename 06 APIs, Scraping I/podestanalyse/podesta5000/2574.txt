Federal Election Commission, struck down significant \nportions of campaign finance laws.  In particular, the case removed \nrestrictions in place for decades that have limited campaign spending from \ncorporations.  The Sierra Club offered the following comments in response.\nThe High Court\'s ruling can be viewed here:\nhttp://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf\nStatement of Cathy Duvall, Political Director of Sierra Club\n"We are extremely troubled and dismayed by today\'s decision.  It appears \nthat the High Court confirmed our worst fears with its sweeping ruling \nthat cast aside the laws that protected us from unlimited corporate \ncampaign spending. \n"Congress is already awash in a sea of special interest money; this \ndecision will launch a tsunami of corporate cash whose purpose is to \noverrun the public\'s interests.  Big Oil, Dirty Coal, and other special \ninterests have a stranglehold on the Congress and today\'s ruling will \nfurther endanger the ability of citizens to influence the political \nprocess.  This ruling could put today\'s "pay-to-play" political culture on \nsteroids. \n"We already have very clear indications of the dangers that lie ahead. The \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has been involved in today\'s case, \nreported just yesterday that it spent a record-breaking $71 million on \nlobbying last quarter.  Even before today\'s decision, it has already been \nlaundering hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate cash, most notably \nfor the health insurance industry and polluters, and has pledged to spend \ntens of millions of dollars in this year\'s elections.  Now it and the \nspecial interests that fund it will be allowed to spend limitless amounts \nnot only in the legislative process, but to support or oppose individual \ncandidates. \n"Now only Congress can stem the tidal wave of special interest cash and \ninfluence peddling that is about to overwhelm the electoral process.  The \nSierra Club has long supported campaign finance reform and we now urge \nCongress to find a solution to help candidates combat the expected \nincrease in spending on independent expenditures.  In particular, we \nsupport passage of the Fair Elections Now Act." \n# # #\n\n----- Forwarded by Josh Dorner/Sierraclub on 01/21/2010 11:16 AM -----\n\nFrom:   "Josh Dorner, Sierra Club" <josh.dorner@sierraclub.org>\nTo:     josh.dorner@sierraclub.org\nDate:   01/21/2010 11:12 AM\nSubject:        High Court Unleashes Tsunami of Corporate Cash w/ Citizens \nUnited Ruling\n\n\n\nView a web version of this email.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: January 21, 2010\nCONTACT: Josh Dorner, 202.675.2384\nHigh Court Unleashes Tsunami of \nCorporate Cash with Citizens United Ruling\nWashington, D.C.--The U.S. Supreme Court today, in its ruling in the case \nCitizens United v.
