Five years since they swung open the gates and let special interest groups stampede over our elections. \n\nThat's five years way, way too long in my book. \n\nDark money groups have spent millions upon millions of dollars to influence elections since 2010. It has to stop. \n\nWe want to pass a constitutional amendment to reverse the effects of Citizens United. It's not a simple process, but we can do it -- as long as we have folks like you fighting with us. \n\nJoin my colleagues and me in calling for a constitutional amendment to end Citizens United. Add your name to our petition today. \n\nhttp://sign.actiontaker.org/page/s/co-sponsor-s2015?source=kirkpatrick\n\nIt will take a huge effort to corral dark money groups. Especially the ones backed by powerful figures like the Koch brothers or Karl Rove. \n\nBut our democracy wasn't designed for them. It was designed for the people, by the people. \n\nAnd it's up to us -- the people -- to take it back. \n\nAdd your voice to mine and thousands of others. Together, we can stop the damage Citizens United has caused. \n\nhttp://sign.actiontaker.org/page/s/co-sponsor-s2015?source=kirkpatrick\n\nThank you for signing on today. I appreciate it. \n\nAnn----\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.\n\nTo unsubscribe, go to: \nhttp://kirkpatrickforsenate.com/subscriptions\n\n\nPaid for by Kirkpatrick for Senate\n\n"
