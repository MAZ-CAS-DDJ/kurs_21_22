As its\r\nThanksgiving eve, my father has cataract surgery the day before and Bruce\r\nhas a doctor's appointment at 1:30pm ET, it makes the most sense for us to\r\nmeet in Chappaqua from 12pm-1:30pm, going later if need be and debriefing\r\nwith Bruce afterwards. Simpson Thatcher will set up a confidential\r\nconference call in line to ensure that we have complete privacy and\r\npreserve attorney client privilege. They or I will forward those details\r\nwhen we have them.\r\nThanks,\r\nChelsea\r\n\r\n"
