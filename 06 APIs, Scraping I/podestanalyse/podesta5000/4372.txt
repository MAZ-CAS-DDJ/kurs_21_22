With his recent ad blitz, all hopes of picking up seats could be lost - and the rest of President Obama's term could be ruined. But John, we still have a chance to avoid this fate if we are able to step up in a big way before our next deadline tomorrow at 8pm.\n\nSo, can you do what you can?\n\nJohn Podesta\nSUPPORTED PRESIDENT OBAMA'S AGENDA: NO\nIf you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:\n\nDonate $5 right away\n\nDonate $25 right away\n\nDonate $50 right away\n\nDonate $100 right away\n\nOr donate another amount.\n\nThanks,\n\nProgressives 2014\n\n\nContributions or gifts to House Majority PAC are not tax deductible\n\nPaid for by House Majority PAC. www.thehousemajoritypac.com.
