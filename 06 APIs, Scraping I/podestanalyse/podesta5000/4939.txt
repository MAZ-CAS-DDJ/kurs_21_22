With the successful recalls of Senate President\nJohn Morse and Senator Angela Giron, Colorado loses two progressive\nchampions who have fought hard, not just for common sense gun safety\nlegislation, but also for the rights of women and gays and lesbians\nand immigrants and children and working families.\n\nToday we get to allow ourselves a minute or two, and only a minute or\ntwo, to reflect on what happened last night. We can Monday morning\nquarterback the fact that legal challenges took away the option for\npeople to vote with mail ballots, the most common way Coloradans vote\nthese days. We can pick apart campaign strategies and messages and\nmoney spent for a few moments. We can take the time we need to study\nlast night enough to make sure we learn from our mistakes.\n\nBut we can only give ourselves a minute to dwell on last night.\nBecause the fight is just getting started.\n\nIf the NRA and the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners and the Koch Brothers\nwant a fight, let's stand up and give them a fight! We passed common\nsense gun safety measures here in Colorado--background checks, taking\nguns from domestic abusers--and last night doesn't change any of that.\nWhat last night should do is steel our resolve. It should stiffen our\nspines. We know progressive victories are never easy. That's why we\nnever give up. Last night we lost. Next time, we win.\n\nHere's how.\n\nStep one. Get ready for November 5th, 2013. There's a very important\nballot initiative--Amendment 66--to provide smaller class sizes and\nmore teachers for our public schools. We all need to get involved\nright now and do everything we can to pass Amendment 66. Start right\nhere.\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=b6deFDX9OMHCCI9TDD9ZOw\n\nStep two. Get ready for the 2014 legislative session. Last night we\nlost two progressive Senators, but we still hold a slim majority in\nthe Senate--and in the House. We all need to support our\nrepresentatives and the important legislation they will push and fight\nagainst next year.\n\nStep three. Get ready for November 2014. We'll be voting on a\nGovernor, a US Senator, and our state legislative races next year.\nThis is when we can really stand up to the NRA and the Koch brothers\nand show them they won a skirmish last night, but there's no way we're\ngoing to let them win the war here in Colorado.\n\nSo please, make a commitment right this second to: Get involved.\nDonate. Talk to your friends and family about the issues. And most\nimportantly, get yourself out to vote this November and next November.\nBecause the number one lesson we learned last night: winning feels\nmuch better than losing.\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=1ZsBTnA1qa6PmtW2xMiThA\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=s3JsVCclUiLtbtU_sLz4Iw\n\nThank you so much for all you do,\n\nAmy Runyon-Harms\nExecutive Director, ProgressNow Colorado\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa9 2005-2011 ProgressNow Colorado.
