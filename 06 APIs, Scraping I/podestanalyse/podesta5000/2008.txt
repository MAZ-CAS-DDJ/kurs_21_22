And you can help. \n\n*CLICK HERE* [ https://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/6676/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9025 ] to like and share this photo on Facebook. And then, be sure to donate to VoteVets.org, so we can keep the pressure up!\n \n\n [ https://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/6676/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9025 ] \n\n \nMitt Romney and Paul Ryan can't run away from their records. And as much as they'd like to hide the fact that they've supported plans to slash veterans care to pay for tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, we're not going to let them. \n\nSo, let's get the word out! \n\nThanks for your support. \n\nSincerely,\nJon Soltz \nIraq War Veteran\nChairman, VoteVets.org\n@jonsoltz [ http://www.twitter.com/jonsoltz ] \n\n\n\nPAID FOR BY VOTEVETS ACTION FUND\n\nUnsubscribe Here: https://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/6676/unsubscribe.jsp?Email=john.podesta@gmail.com&email_blast_KEY=1220830&organization_KEY=6676"
