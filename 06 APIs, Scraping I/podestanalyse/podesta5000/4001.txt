john.podesta@gmail.comb'\nDennis and Gary,\n\nJust wanted to let you know that we are making great progress on our new Affiliate Membership class.  We have already begun inviting our list to join, should be able to provide a strong audience for you guys in about 30 days.\n\nAs I mentioned last month, more than half the business leaders on our list are women.  We\x92ve found that it works best to organize calls on general business issues, like access to capital, rather than to focus on \x93women\x92s\x94 issues, like family leave or child care.\n\nWe\x92d very much like to organize business leader calls with you, and women-only call might be a nice way to start.  Again, we hope to have critical mass for our Affiliate Membership in October.\n\nThanks\n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Doyle | 1717 Rhode Island Avenue, NW, Suite 660 | Washington, DC  20036 | (w) 202/861-1272 | (m) 202/744-8479 | jdoyle@doylellc.com\n\n\n\nFrom: Hillary Clinton <info@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:info@hillaryclinton.com>>\nReply-To: "info@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:info@hillaryclinton.com>" <info@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:info@hillaryclinton.com>>\nDate: Friday, September 4, 2015 at 12:47 PM\nTo: James Doyle <jdoyle@doylellc.com<mailto:jdoyle@doylellc.com>>\nSubject: We\x92re officially launching Women for Hillary -- will you help?\n\nWe\'re launching Women for Hillary.\nJim --\n\nThe GOP candidates for president have some of the most extreme views on women\'s health and rights that I\'ve ever seen -- and trust me, I\'ve become something of an expert on their views on women\'s rights.\n\nWe need to make sure not one of them becomes president. The way we do that is by reaching out to as many women as we can and getting them involved in the community of this campaign.\n\nToday, I\'m asking you to help me do that. Send this link to a few of the women in your life and ask them to join Women for Hillary (or join yourself):\n\nhttps://www.hillaryclinton.com/women-for-hillary/<http://links.hillaryclinton.com/ctt?kn=12&ms=MjM0MzQxOTIS1&r=MTA3MzIzMTE0NTE0S0&b=0&j=NjQwNDM3OTEwS0&mt=1&rt=0>\n\nWe\'re building an incredible organization that\'s going to fight for all Americans -- no matter what gender you are. Thanks so much for being a part of it.\n\n-H\n\nP.S.
