Can dissuade if you think this is unnecessary.\n________________________________________\nFrom: caputo.lm@gmail.com <caputo.lm@gmail.com>\nSent: Monday, March 2, 2015 8:42:56 AM\nTo: Huma Abedin; Huma Abedin\nSubject: Circling back\n\nHuma,\n\nI've been thinking about how and where I can add value. I want to help based on where the needs are. I would love to work closely with Podesta if that makes sense  - does he need a #2 or a deputy? Happy to discuss whenever convenient.\n\nLisa\n\nSent via BlackBerry by AT&T\n"
