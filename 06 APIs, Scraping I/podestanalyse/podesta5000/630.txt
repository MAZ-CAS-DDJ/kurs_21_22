[mailto:Blake_L._Gottesman@who.eop.gov]\nSent: Mon 8/18/2008 11:58 AM\nTo: John Podesta; Melody Barnes\nSubject: Follow-Up\n\n\n\nJohn/Melody,\n\nIt was a pleasure to have met both of you last week; thanks again for your time.  As indicated in our meeting, when we receive a request from one transition team for a document or meeting, we plan to both (i) notify the other transition team of the request and (ii) make available any document response or meeting option.\n\n \n\nTo that end, I am writing to let you know that the McCain transition team has requested a meeting next week between its lead personnel rep and members of the Presidential Personnel Office.  We are accommodating the request and would be glad to do the same for your team, if desired.  We ask that, consistent with past practice, any requests for documents or meetings come to me in writing so that we have a record of the request and can jump-start the process (drafting an NDA for the meeting participants to sign, scheduling the meeting, notifying the other transition team, etc.).\n\n \n\nAlso, we are working to get the Presidential Personnel binders cleared for transmittal as well as to determine the feasibility of GSA procuring a robust IT system/database suitable for both the transition and the White House.  I'll keep you updated on our progress.  Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.\n\n \n\nBest,\n\nBlake\n\n"
