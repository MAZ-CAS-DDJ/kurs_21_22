Voters won't know the truth about Barack unless supporters like you reach out to them.\n\nI also wanted to share a video of personal moments from behind the scenes at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, so you can see Barack and Michelle as they are -- decent, warm, and kind people with a loving family.\n\nWatch the video and get to know the Obamas a little better. Then sign up to volunteer on a crucial day before the Election:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/4Days\n\nOur opponents try to stir up doubt and fear by questioning who Barack really is -- as if after more than a decade in public office, more than 20 months on the campaign trail, dozens of debates, two books written by him and dozens more about him, people still don't have enough information to decide for themselves who should lead our country.\n\nMillions of Americans have gotten to know Barack Obama as an American who's devoted his life to things bigger than himself -- his community, his country, and ordinary citizens looking for a voice.\n\nOur challenge now is to do the same -- to devote these last weeks to a cause bigger than ourselves. \n\nThese tough economic times make our cause more urgent and the stakes even higher. Barack needs your help to win this election and bring the change we need to Washington.\n\nCan you give a day of your time during the last four days of the election?\n\nWatch the video, share it with others, and get involved:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/4Days\n\nOnly 24 days remain until Election Day. Won't you commit at least one to ensure our victory?\n\nDavid\n \nDavid Plouffe\nCampaign Manager\nObama for America\n\nP.S. -- You can make a difference in a nearby battleground state where the election is neck-and-neck.
