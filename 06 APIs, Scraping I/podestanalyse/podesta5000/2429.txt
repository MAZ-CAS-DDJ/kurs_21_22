The Iraq War\nhas been won." [Associated Press, 5/15/08\n<http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iNxTApa2sQRu0Xx99P3jt2bEXw7gD90MEBV0\n0> ]\n*\tNow, today, McCain moves the goalposts once again...to\nindefinitely: http://thinkprogress.org/2008/06/11/mccain-iraq-important/\n\n \n\nIn an interview on NBC\'s Today Show, host Matt Lauer asked Sen. John\nMcCain (R-AZ) about his support for the war in Iraq. Noting that\nviolence has decreased in Iraq, Lauer asked if McCain has a better\n"estimate" of when he would withdraw troops from the country. "No, but\nthat\'s not too important," McCain responded:\n\nQ: A lot of people now say the surge is working.\n\nMcCAIN: Anyone who knows the facts on the ground say that.\n\nQ: If it\'s working, senator, do you now have a better estimate of when\nAmerican forces can come home from Iraq? \n\nMcCAIN: No, but that\'s not too important. What\'s important is the\ncasualties in Iraq. Americans are in South Korea. Americans are in\nJapan. American troops are in Germany. That\'s all fine. \n\n"It seems like only yesterday - a few weeks ago actually - that Senator\nJohn "100 Years" <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFknKVjuyNk>  McCain\ndelivered a remarkably straight faced speech in Ohio declaring that if\nhe were President, the Iraq war would be won within four years, a\nfunctioning democracy would be left behind, and most all U.S. troops\nthere would come home," said Jeremy Funk, spokesman for the Iraq\nCampaign 2008. "Now he says it\'s "not too important" to him if the\ntroops come from Iraq at all.  McCain ought to ask military families\nmaking unimaginable sacrifices with their loved ones serving two, three,\nor more tours in Iraq if it\'s \'important at all\' to them when they get\nto come home."\n\n \n\n"Why can\'t Senator McCain keep his straight talk straight on how long he\nwants to keep our soldiers struck in the crosshairs of an endless civil\nwar in Iraq?  His commitment to continue the very same failed \'stay the\ncourse\' Bush policies there certainly hasn\'t changed - so why does his\nrhetoric?  Senator McCain has a long and troubling history of moving the\ngoalposts and making rosy predictions about Iraq\'s future that has\nearned him a credibility gap that is surely the envy of even former\nDefense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEBu2FW7LB8&feature=related>  and\nVice-President Dick Cheney <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKFL-Mz4rto>\n."   \n\n \n\n-30-\n\n \n\nMr. Straight Talk Moves the Goalposts...Again\n\nwww.mccainsource.com <http://www.mccainsource.com/> \n\n \n\nToday: \n\n"No, but that\'s not too important."\n\n-- John McCain, asked if he had a "better estimate" of when American\ntroops could come home from Iraq.   [NBC, "Today Show," 6/11/08]\n\n \n\nLast Month:\n\n \n\n"By January 2013, America has welcomed home most of the servicemen and\nwomen who have sacrificed terribly so that America might be secure in\nher freedom.  The Iraq war has been won."\n\n-- John McCain, on his four-year vision for America [McCain Remarks,\n5/15/08\n<http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/Speeches/e8114732-e294-4a0d-b0\nb6-e5fa16857f61.htm> ]\n\n \n\nThis morning on NBC\'s "Today Show," John McCain said bringing American\ntroops home was "not too important."  His statement is one that the\nfamilies of America\'s service men and women are sure to dispute.  After\nmaking dozens of predictions since the beginning of the war, McCain has\nlost credibility in the eyes of the public. After years of faulty logic\nand failed strategies, McCain still walks hand-in-hand with President\nBush on the war in Iraq.  From predicting victory in "months" to "a\nhundred years," McCain consistently moves the finish line farther and\nfarther away in an effort to mask the fact that he has no plan to end\nthe war in Iraq and no idea when the conflict will be over.\n\n \n\nEarly 2003: The End is "Very Much in Sight."\n\n \n\nMcCain Predicted a "Brief, Successful War In Iraq." While speaking on\nthe floor of the senate on the day before U.S. military action commenced\nin Iraq, McCain said, "The costs of these enterprises are not known with\nany degree of certainty at this time.  Nor are the costs we will incur\nafter what I believe, what I fervently, hope, will be a brief,\nsuccessful war in Iraq, as we seek to establish the foundations for a\npeaceful, stable and democratizing Iraq."  He added, "I believe the war\nin Iraq can be concluded successfully in a relatively brief time."\n[McCain Senate Press Release, 3/18/03]\n\n \n\nMcCain Believed The War In Iraq Would Be Relatively Short.  While\nappearing on NBC\'s "Meet the Press," McCain said, "I believe that this\nconflict is still going to be relatively short. I believe we\'ve achieved\nsignificant goals and successes." [NBC, "Meet the Press," 3/30/03]\n\n \n\nIn 2003 McCain Said The End Was "Very Much In Sight."  Senator McCain\nwas asked "At what point will America be able to say the war was won?"\nMcCain said there were oil fields to secure and "die-hards" to take care\nof but "it\'s clear that the end is very much in sight, and today I think\nAmericans should be very proud of their leadership, their\ntechnology...There are still some foreigners, Syrians and others hanging\naround. But it won\'t be long. It will be a fairly short period of time,\nbut this happens in wars. I\'m confident that once they are confident the\narea is no longer a threat to the Marines and to or army troops that\nthey\'ll start imposing discipline. In the meantime, we\'ll have a short\nperiod of chaos."  [ABC, Good Morning America, 4/9/03, emphasis added]\n\n \n\nIn April 2003, McCain Said He Was "Sure" The End Of Conflict In Iraq Was\nNear.  While appearing on "Lou Dobbs Moneyline," Dobbs asked McCain, "Is\nit your judgment that we are near the end of this conflict?"  To which\nMcCain replied, "Oh, I\'m sure that\'s true." [CNN, "Lou Dobbs Moneyline,"\n4/10/03]\n\n \n\n \n\nOctober 2003: Five Years?\n\n \n\nMcCain Predicted The War Would Take "Four Or Five Years."  During an\nappearance on ABC\'s Nightline, Ted Koppel asked McCain how much more\nmoney the war would cost.  He said, "Estimates I hear as much as 50 to\n$55 billion more." When asked, "Over a course of how many years?" McCain\nanswered, "Four or five years." [ABC, "Nightline," 10/1/03]\n\n \n\nNovember 2003: A Few Months?\n\n \n\nMcCain Said "We Would Probably Know Within The Next Few Months" If\nAmerica Won Or Lost In Iraq.  During an appearance on MSNBC\'s "Buchanan\n& Press," McCain was asked what "victory" in Iraq was.  McCain said, "I\nthink the next three to six months are very critical in this whole\nscenario because the Iraqi people don\'t want to go back to Saddam\nHussein. They\'re not crazy. But many of them in the Sunni Triangle are\nlosing any confidence that the United States can bring them what their\nambitions are all about for themselves and their families. So I think\nwe\'re in a very critical time. And we would probably know within the\nnext few months." [MSNBC, "Buchanan & Press," 11/6/03]\n\n \n\n2004: Five Years?\n\n \n\nMcCain Said "Listen, My Friend, We\'re Going To Have To Be There For Five\nor Six Years."  During a February 2004 appearance on MSNBC\'s "Hardball,"\nMcCain discussed the war in Iraq and said, "Listen, my friend, we\'re\ngoing to be there for five or six years. A little straight talk. We\'re\ngoing. We\'re going to have to be there for quite a while." [MSNBC,\n"Hardball," 2/25/04]\n\n \n\nEarly-2005: One Year?\n\n \n\nMcCain: "I Would Think That It\'s Going To Be Another Year To A Year And\nA Half."  During an appearance on CBS\'s "The Early Show," McCain was\nasked "What is a realistic timetable" regarding the war in Iraq? McCain\nsaid, "If I had to guess, I would think that it\'s going to be at least\nanother year to a year and a half, but, hopefully before then we could\nhave our troops out of a lot of the areas where they\'re vulnerable to\ncasualties." [CBS, "The Early Show," 2/3/05]\n\n \n\nMid-2005: A Couple of More Years?\n\n \n\nMcCain: "I Think Part Of That Is It\'s Going To Be, At Least, A Couple\nMore Years."  While appearing on NBC\'s "Meet the Press," McCain said, "I\ndon\'t think Americans believe that we should cut and run out of Iraq by\nany stretch of the imagination. But I think they also would like to be\ntold, in reality, what\'s going on and, by the way, I think part of that\nis it\'s going to be, at least, a couple more years." [NBC, "Meet the\nPress," 6/19/05]\n\n \n\nMcCain: "I Think We Should Tell People It\'s Not Going To Be A Short-I\'d\nRather Say Two Or Three Years."  While appearing on NBC\'s "Meet the\nPress," McCain said, "And, again, I think we should tell people it\'s not\ngoing to be a short--I\'d rather say two or three years, and be surprised\na year from now, than say, \'Everything\'s fine,\' and then be disappointed\na year or two from now." [NBC, "Meet the Press," 6/19/05]\n\n \n\nMcCain: I Think It\'s Very Possible "Within The Next Year or Two."  While\nappearing on "Meet the Press," McCain said, "I think it\'s going to be\nlong and hard and tough."  Tim Russert asked, "Years?" McCain responded\nby saying, "Well, when I say years, I think that it\'s very possible\nwithin the next year or two that you could see this transition taking\nplace, but the American troops being a supplement rather than being\nreplaced by, in other words, most of the effort being carried on over\ntime by the Iraqis, but it\'s going to be tough. " [NBC, "Meet the\nPress," 12/4/05] \n\n \n\n2006: Months?\n\n \n\nMcCain: "We\'re Either Going To Lose This Thing or Win this Thing Within\nthe Next Several Months."  While appearing on NBC\'s "Meet the Press,"\nMcCain said, "If you talk to most military experts, we\'re in a critical\nand crucial time. We\'re either going to lose this thing or win this\nthing within the next several months." [NBC, "Meet the Press," 11/12/06]\n\n \n\nEarly 2007: Ten Years?\n\n \n\nMcCain Said Americans Could Be Persuaded To Support The War For 5 to 10\nYears.  According to the Houston Chronicle, while at the opening of the\nCenter for the Intrepid, "McCain said it was important for America to\n\'accomplish the mission\' in Iraq, but said he didn\'t know how long that\nwould take. He said Americans could be persuaded to support the conflict\nanother five to 10 years \'if we can show progress.\'" [Houston Chronicle,\n1/30/07]\n\n \n\nMid 2007: "I Don\'t Have A Date"\n\n \n\nMcCain Said "I Don\'t Have A Date" When Asked About The End of The War.\nWhile discussing the war in Iraq on NBC\'s "Meet the Press," McCain said,\n"If it is only in a role that is of support and American casualties are\nminimal, then I think it\'s probably worth the investment. If the level\nof casualties stays where it is, and we do not have success, then we\nknow that that will be a condition that we cannot stand before."  Tim\nRussert then asked, "By when?" to which McCain replied, "I don\'t have a\ndate, I think that the important thing is whether we assess as we move\nalong." [NBC, "Meet the Press," 5/13/07; emphasis added]\n\n \n\nEarly 2008: Months?\n\n \n\nMcCain Said Winning The War "Is Going To Take Months."  During an\ninterview with the editorial board of the Detroit News, McCain was\nasked, "Can we win this war? And how long will it take?" McCain\nresponded, "It is going to take months. Al-Qaida is on the run, but it\nis not defeated. [The Iraqi military] can be effective with our support.\nI know how frustrated all of us are with the lack of effectiveness of\nthe Iraqi government. ... Whoever invented this form of government ought\nto be taken out and shot. There has been some progress..." [Detroit\nNews, 1/3/08]\n\n \n\nEarly 2008: A Hundred Years?\n\n \n\nMcCain Said US Could Stay In Iraq for "Maybe A Hundred Years" and He Was\n"Fine" With It.  In January 2008, McCain said the U.S. military could\nstay in Iraq for "a hundred years" and that "would be fine with me."  At\na town hall meeting in New Hampshire, a questioner said, "President Bush\nis talking about our staying in Iraq for 50 year," at which point McCain\ninterrupted and said, "Make it a hundred.  We\'ve been in South Korea,\nwe\'ve been in Japan for 60 years, we\'ve been in South Korea for 50 years\nor so.  That\'d be fine with me as long as Americans are not being\ninjured, or harmed, or wounded, or killed.  That\'s fine with me, I hope\nit would be fine with you." [Town Hall Meeting in Concord, NH, 1/3/08\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LEFrZCNqss> ; emphasis added]\n\n \n\nMcCain: "I Don\'t Think Americans Are Concerned If We\'re There For 100\nYears Or 1,000 Years Or 10,000 Years." In an interview on CBS\'s "Face\nthe Nation," host Bob Schieffer asked McCain about staying in Iraq for\n100 year. McCain responded, "We\'ve got to get Americans off the front\nline, have the Iraqis as part of the strategy, take over more and more\nof the responsibilities. And then I don\'t think Americans are concerned\nif we\'re there for 100 years or 1,000 years or 10,000 years. What they\ncare about is a sacrifice of our most precious treasure, and that\'s\nAmerican blood. So what I\'m saying is look, if Americans are there in a\nsupport role, but they\'re not taking casualties, that\'s fine. We\'re in\nKuwait now. As you well recall, we had a war, we stayed in Kuwait. We\ndidn\'t stay in Saudi Arabia. So it\'s going to be up to the relationship\nbetween the Iraqi government and the United States of America." [CBS,\n"Face the Nation," 1/06/08; emphasis added]\n\n \n\nMcCain: "It Doesn\'t Matter...We Could Be There For A Hundred Years, For\nAll I Know."  During an interview with the editorial board of the\nDetroit News, McCain was asked, "When should the United States leave\nIraq?"  McCain responded, "It doesn\'t matter. We\'re still in Kuwait\nsince the first Gulf War. If we can continue to show this progress, we\ncould be there for 100 years, for all I know, as long as Americans are\nnot dying. It\'s not a matter of American presence; it\'s a matter of\nsuccess so we can beat back this adversary. If we\'d done what they\nwanted us to do six months ago, al-Qaida would now be trumpeting to the\nworld that it defeated the United States of America." [Detroit News,\n1/3/08,emphasis added]\n\n \n\nMcCain: "We\'re Going To Be In This Struggle For The Rest of The\nCentury."  While speaking at a town hall meeting in Sun City Center,\nFlorida, McCain said, "I\'d like to look you in the eye and tell you\nthere\'s not gonna be any more wars.  I\'d like to look you in the eyes\nand tell you that this terrible evil called radical Islamic extremism is\ndefeated.  I can\'t do that.  I\'ve got to tell you that we\'re gonna be in\nthis struggle for the rest of this century because it\'s a transcendent\nevil." [Town Hall Meeting; Sun City Center, FL 01/26/08; emphasis added]\n\n \n\nMcCain: "We Are In A Greater Struggle That Is Going To Be With Us For\nThe Rest of This Century."  While giving a speech in Nashua, New\nHampshire, We are in two wars. We are in a greater struggle that is\ngoing to be with us for the rest of this century... He added, "These\nyoung people that are in this crowd, my friends, I\'m going to be asking\nyou to serve. I\'m gonna be asking you to step forward and serve this\nnation in difficult times."
