He irked\nsome Republicans when he challenged the Bush administration\'s post-9/11\nrestrictions on civil liberties, but has built a small and devoted following\nfrom disgruntled conservatives who believe the GOP has lost its way.\n\n"A vote for the status quo . . . is really and truly a wasted vote, because\nit is not going to do anything," Barr said at a news conference to announce\nhis candidacy. He pledged to cut federal spending and to pull the United\nStates out of Iraq, although he said it would be "foolhardy" to give a\ntimetable for withdrawal.\n\nBarr, 59, who left the GOP two years ago after losing his congressional seat\nin 2002 because of redistricting, is not expected to become a viable\ncontender for the White House. But some political analysts say he could\ndeliver the election to the Democratic nominee as Republicans unhappy about\nthe war and government spending, or suspicious of McCain, vote for the\nthird-party contender.\n\n"This could be that outlet for conservatives who don\'t want to vote for\nMcCain, but have to have a comfortable place to go," said John Zogby, an\nindependent pollster based in upstate New York.\n\nZogby\'s own polling suggested that Barr would capture some 3 percent of the\nvote nationwide. "Do I think he\'ll get 3 percent? Probably not, but he\ndoesn\'t have to," Zogby said. "If we just look at the states in play, he\ncan, with just 10,000 votes here and there, make a difference. I think we\'re\nlooking at a razor-thin election."\n\nCharles Black, a senior adviser to the McCain campaign, said he did not\nthink Barr\'s run would damage the Arizona senator\'s quest. "I guess it\'s\nconceivable you could have another Florida," Black said in a telephone\ninterview, referring to Democrats\' complaints that Nader tilted the state\nthat decided the 2000 election for George W. Bush. "But I think that\'s a\nonce-in-a-century thing."\n\nBarr acknowledged that some officials in the Republican Party had pleaded\nwith him not to run, so as not to divide an already splintered GOP base. But\nhe insisted that he was not getting in the race to play spoiler and said his\nvoters "would not likely fall into the category of people who would be\nenthused about voting for John McCain, if such exist."\n\nTo get on the November ballot, Barr must win the Libertarian nomination at\nthe party convention Memorial Day weekend. He is expected to face, among\nothers, Mike Gravel, the former senator from Alaska who competed for this\nyear\'s Democratic nomination, but party officials predict Barr will prevail\nbecause of his national profile.\n\nIf Barr is nominated, the party will still have to get on the ballot state\nby state. Libertarian Party officials say it has already qualified in 28\nstates, including several key swing states. According to the party,\npresidential candidate Michael Badnarik appeared on the ballots of 48 states\nin 2004.\n\nThird-party candidates are rarely more than an irritant to major party\ncontenders, and Libertarian candidates - who captured fewer than 400,000\nvotes nationally in both 2000 and 2004 - have not done as well as Nader, who\nattracted 2.8 million votes in 2000. But with the number of independent\nvoters growing, and the country in a mood for change, a third-party\ncandidate could attract enough votes to tip the election in certain states,\npolitical specialists said.\n\nMcCain, with his appeal to independents, could be a threat to win in\nMichigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which have gone Democratic in recent\nelections, Schier said. Democratic gains in other parts of the country could\nmake the race tight in states such as Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Nevada,\nNorth Carolina, and Virginia, which Republicans have won in recent\nelections, Zogby said - especially if Democratic front-runner Barack Obama\nbecomes the nominee and inspires a huge turnout among black voters.\n\nIn those battlegrounds, a few thousand votes for a third-party contender\ncould make a critical difference.\n\nIn Colorado, for example, McCain enjoys a regional advantage, while Obama\ncould benefit from a Democratic trend, said Floyd Ciruli, an independent\npollster based in Denver. Barr could appeal to enough of Colorado\'s\ndisaffected Republicans - those voters who decry high federal spending and\ngovernment surveillance - to deny McCain a chance to win his neighboring\nstate, Ciruli said.\n\n"We normally have some attrition on both sides from the mainstream\ncandidates," Ciruli said. Reform Party candidate Ross Perot attracted enough\nvotes to give Colorado to Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992, and Barr could do\nthe same to defeat McCain, if the election there is very close, he said.\nBarr has hired Perot\'s former campaign manager.\n\nAs a consultant to the American Civil Liberties Union on privacy issues,\nBarr could also draw some votes from Obama, Black said. But with the GOP\nsplintered, McCain cannot afford to lose elements of the Republican base.\nChristian conservatives are already unhappy with McCain\'s support for\ncampaign finance reform - a law Barr opposes as an attack on free speech\nbecause it limits what independent organizations can do to promote a\ncandidate.\n\n"I think the conventional wisdom says, yes, [Barr] will be a problem," said\nGary Bauer, president of American Values, a socially conservative group, and\na former GOP candidate for president.\n\n"I think he could get 1 or 2 percent, but I\'m not sure out of whose hide it\ncomes," Bauer added.\n\nURL:\nhttp://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/05/13/libertarian_a_potentia\nl_spoiler_for_mccain?mode=PF\n\n\n\n'
