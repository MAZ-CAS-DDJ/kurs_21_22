john.podesta@gmail.comb"I have a new one for people's awareness (and adding John too) -- will work\nthis through the usual vetting and calendaring process, but wanted to\nmention while all the relevant parties are on an email.\n\nBoris (Univision/Fusion) told me last night that Fusion is being added to\nthe snapchat discover channel, and their new #1 request is for Hrc to do\nsomething with them for this. They have until mid January to gain traction\nor else snapchat will pull them. This is #1 for Univision too, not just\nfusion.\n\nWe should try to comply if at all possible. Could do something relatively\nquickly and easily from NYC on the 14th or 21st if we wind up using those\ndays for shoots/interviews.\n\nOn Wednesday, December 2, 2015, Kristina Schake <kschake@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Attached is our updated scheduling request memo from comms and digital for\n> our call on Thursday.\n>\n> --\n>\n>\n>\n> Kristina Schake | Communications\n> Hillary for America\n>\n>\n>\n"
