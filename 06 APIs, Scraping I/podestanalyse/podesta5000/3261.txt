The letter was circulated by Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell just days after it was revealed<http://thinkprogress.org/2010/04/13/mcconnell-financial-hedge-fund/> that he and NRSC chairman Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) had a  "private meeting with elite hedge fund managers and other Wall Street executives" in New York with the purpose of enlisting "Wall Street\'s help<http://links.mkt2079.com/ctt?kn=6&m=2930047&r=MTM3Njc1Mjk3MzcS1&b=0&j=MTc2NTg4NDA1S0&mt=1&rt=0>" in electing more Republicans and killing any tough financial reform.\nTom McMahon, Acting Executive Director, Americans United for Change: "With all 41 Republican Senators publicly opposed to financial regulatory reform, it\'s clear they\'ve been listening to the 1,500 Wall Street lobbyists and CEO\'s camped out in their offices this week<http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/04/a-matter-of-influence-lobbyists-and-financial-execs-swarm-in-to-dc-to-push-against-wall-street-refor.php> a lot more than their constituents back home who lost their jobs and retirement savings in the wake of the financial crisis. Instead of holding these big bank executives accountable for their greed and recklessness that laid waste to our economy, Republican Leaders are shaking them down for campaign cash at private meetings on Wall Street - a revelation that is no doubt leaving a bad taste in the mouths of folks on Main Street.\n\n"The big Wall Street banks are more reckless than ever before, taking the same huge gambles with our money and paying themselves bigger and bigger bonuses," continued McMahon.  "Make no mistake: the more Republicans delay and put forth fake solutions bought-and-paid-for by the banks, the greater the risk of another collapse that will cost more jobs and end the economic recovery.   The united Republican front is already showing cracks<http://thinkprogress.org/2010/04/19/corker-mcconnell-bailout/> in the face of enormous pressure<http://www.pewfr.org/project_reports_detail?id=0031> from average Americans who want Wall Street held to account right now.
