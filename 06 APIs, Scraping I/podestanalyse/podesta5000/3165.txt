That\nwill have the effect of siding with labor, while -- on substance -- still\nbeing neutral on both TPP and TPA.\n\n\nPROPOSED ANSWER\n\n- As I have said all along, before deciding whether to support any trade\nagreement, I want to see the final language.\nAnd I think members of Congress should have the same ability to see the\nfinal language of any deal before they are asked to support it.\n\n- That's not what is happening right now. By having votes on TPA before the\nfinalization of the underlying deal, members of Congress are essentially\nbeing asked to fast-track a deal they haven't seen in its final form.\n\n- I understand Democrats not wanting to do that. So I understand what\nhappened with Friday's vote, and think that it would make sense if the\nnegotiations on the trade agreement were finalized before fast-track is\napproved.\n"
