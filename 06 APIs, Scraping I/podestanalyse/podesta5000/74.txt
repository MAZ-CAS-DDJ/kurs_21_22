john.podesta@gmail.comb"This week, I called on my opponent, Senator Rob Portman, to do his job and confirm President Obama's Supreme Court nominee.\n\nFriend,\n\nWhen I was growing up in Ohio, if someone refused to do their job, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be employed very much longer. It seems like Senator Portman never learned that lesson.\n\nSenator Rob Portman is flat-out refusing to do his job. He\xe2\x80\x99s ignoring his constitutional responsibility to give President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court nominee a fair hearing. He\xe2\x80\x99s shirking his responsibilities to our nation, jeopardizing the institutions of our democracy, and engaging in exactly the kind of dysfunctional behavior that frustrates Ohioans about Congress.\n\nSeems like grounds for losing your job to me.\n\nOhio deserves a senator who will follow the Constitution, not his political party. Ohio deserves a senator who will listen to Ohioans, not his dark money friends. Ohio deserves a senator who will give the President\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court nominee a hearing immediately -- not someone who is willing to keep the Supreme Court one justice short for purely political interests. \n\nWill you support my campaign to ensure that in 2016, we can take back Ohio, take back the Senate, and put an end to the senseless obstruction in Washington? With the Supreme Court at stake, your support couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more important at this critical moment.  \n\n http://links.e.tedstrickland.com/ctt?kn=4&ms=ODU2MTUyMQS2&r=MTAyNDUyNjI4OTcwS0&b=2&j=ODYxODM4MDA0S0&mt=1&rt=0 \n\nIf you care about worker\xe2\x80\x99s rights, women\xe2\x80\x99s rights, affordable healthcare, the environment or virtually any major issue being debated in America today, then Portman and his allies refusal to give President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s nominee a fair hearing and an up or down vote directly affects YOU. So let\xe2\x80\x99s get to work.\n\nThanks,\n\nTed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.
