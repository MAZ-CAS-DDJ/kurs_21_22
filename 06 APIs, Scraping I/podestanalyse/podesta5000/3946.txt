john.podesta@gmail.comb'Panelists all around are saying there\xe2\x80\x99s no smoking gun in this release.\n\n\n\nFox has a couple of different storylines on the emails: Harris Faulkner\n(filling in for Shepard Smith) went through and talked about specific\nemails with James Rosen, who cherry-picked a handful of emails to discuss;\nGretchen Carlson and Ed Henry got caught up in reports that HRC sent\nnow-classified information over her email account after her UN press\nconference when she said she didn\xe2\x80\x99t send classified information (most\nreporters are noting that the information was not classified at the time,\nthough).\n\n\n\nOn MSNBC, the only flag is that Alex Seitz-Wald brought up that NARA took\nonly two days to analyze emails to determine whether emails were personal\nor professional while the State Department is taking months to look over\nthose same emails. He did not mention the redaction process State is going\nthrough.\n\n\n\nOn CNN, correspondent Chris Frates noted positively that HRC\xe2\x80\x99s personality\ncomes out in some of these emails.\n\nOn Fri, May 22, 2015 at 4:06 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n> How are they covering this on TV now that it\'s been a few hours?\n>\n>\n>\n> On May 22, 2015, at 4:02 PM, Tyson Brody <tbrody@hillaryclinton.com>\n> wrote:\n>\n>\n> http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clinton-emails-silent-on-deadly-danger-facing-americans-in-benghazi/article/2564920Clinton\n> emails silent on deadly danger facing Americans in Benghazi\n> BY BYRON YORK <http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/author/byron-york>\n> <http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clinton-emails-silent-on-deadly-danger-facing-americans-in-benghazi/article/2564920?rel=author>\n>  | MAY 22, 2015 | 3:51 PM\n>\n> <http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clinton-emails-silent-on-deadly-danger-facing-americans-in-benghazi/article/2564920/comments#disqus_thread>\n> <https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://washex.am/1Q1PjUH>\n>\n> The newly-released Hillary Clinton Benghazi emails do not contain any\n> communications relating to security from the critical last month before the\n> September 11, 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. facility in Libya. During\n> that period, Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who along with three other\n> Americans would die in the attack, warned Clinton and other State\n> Department officials of a growing danger, indeed a security emergency, in\n> Libya. Stevens specifically noted that the possibility of an attack on\n> Americans was growing, and, if such an attack occurred, the U.S. contingent\n> did not have the strength to repel it. But to judge from the emails made\n> public Friday, Clinton gave not a thought to the matter.\n>\n> Go back to August 2012. On the 15th of that month, U.S. security officers\n> in Libya held an "emergency" meeting to address the very real possibility\n> that growing violence in the area could soon target Americans. The next\n> day, August 16, Stevens sent a cable to Clinton concluding that the\n> Americans in Libya could not defend U.S. facilities "in the event of a\n> coordinated attack, due to limited manpower, security measures, weapons\n> capabilities, host nation support, and the overall size of the compound."\n>\n> It was a clear call for help, one that, judging by the newly-public\n> emails, went entirely unheard at the highest level of the State Department.\n> Apart from some hugger-mugger analyses of Libyan politics by Clinton\'s\n> friend Sidney Blumenthal, there is nothing at all in the emails concerning\n> Benghazi from the month before the attack.\n>\n> Clinton has long maintained she never saw the August 16, 2012 cable. "That\n> cable did not come to my attention," Clinton testified under oath before\n> the House Foreign Affairs Committee in January 2013. "I have made it very\n> clear that the security cables did not come to my attention or above the\n> assistant-secretary level, where the [State Department internal\n> investigation] placed responsibility."\n>\n> Clinton explained that she was simply too busy, and there were simply too\n> many cables, for her to see every one. "One-point-43 million cables a year\n> come to the State Department," she told the House committee. "They\'re all\n> addressed to me. They do not all come to me."\n>\n> But wasn\'t that August 16, 2012 cable -- warning of dire consequences\n> should the existing violence in Libya target Americans -- a pretty\n> important communication? What struck Republicans investigating Benghazi is\n> that, while they knew Clinton was indeed busy, other equally busy top Obama\n> administration officials did read the cable. In an appearance before the\n> Senate Armed Services Committee, both former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta\n> and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey -- two busy men with\n> pretty big jobs -- testified they knew about it.\n>\n> "You were aware that Ambassador Stevens -- of his cable that said that the\n> consulate could not withstand a coordinated attack, is that right?"\n> Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte asked Panetta.\n>\n> "Correct," said Panetta.\n>\n> "General, you had said that you previously were aware of that?" Ayotte aid\n> to Dempsey.\n>\n> "Yes, I was aware of the communication back to the State Department,"\n> Dempsey answered.\n>\n> Clinton, on the other hand, insists to this day that she knew nothing. And\n> there is nothing in the newly-released emails to contradict her sworn\n> testimony on the matter. That should not come as a surprise to anyone.\n> After all, because Clinton kept her communications on a separate, secret\n> system, the only emails that State Department officials possess are the\n> ones Clinton has given them. Clinton and her lawyers, of course, chose the\n> emails that she gave to the State Department and then destroyed all of her\n> email communications, including backups. Could anyone possibly be surprised\n> that nothing Clinton turned over to the State Department -- and ultimately\n> to the public -- contradicted her testimony under oath?\n>\n> The period leading up to the Benghazi attacks is the most critical time in\n> the entire tragic episode. What did Clinton know about the danger to\n> American officials there, and what did she do about it? That is the key\n> question of Benghazi. What happened afterward -- the blame-the-video spin\n> -- can be interpreted as an attempt to cover up Clinton\'s inaction before\n> the attack. Yes, the spin campaign was dishonest. But the more serious\n> offense was allowing the conditions that led to the deaths of Stevens and\n> three other Americans. The crime is worse than the cover-up. And if\n> Republicans thought they would receive any new information in the\n> Clinton-edited version of the emails released Friday, they will surely be\n> disappointed.\n>\n> On Fri, May 22, 2015 at 3:45 PM, Tyson Brody <tbrody@hillaryclinton.com>\n> wrote:\n>\n>> Defer to those who know better on Morocco but in the days after the\n>> attack HRC attended the opening plenary on the US-Morocco strategic\n>> dialogue: http://m.state.gov/md197711.htm\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>> On Fri, May 22, 2015 at 3:42 PM, Jake Sullivan <\n>> jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n>>\n>>> The other casualty was Sean Smith.\n>>>\n>>>\n>>>\n>>> On May 22, 2015, at 2:54 PM, Tyson Brody <tbrody@hillaryclinton.com>\n>>> wrote:\n>>>\n>>> https://twitter.com/lachlan/status/601822415807770625\n>>>\n>>> @lachlan\n>>>\n>>> HRC in Hard Choices: "My thoughts immediately went to Chris" (Stevens)\n>>> HRC email on 9/11/12 asks abt "Chris Smith"\n>>>\n>>> [image: Embedded image permalink]\n>>>\n>>> On Fri, May 22, 2015 at 2:46 PM, Ian Sams <isams@hillaryclinton.com>\n>>> wrote:\n>>>\n>>>> Looks to have just been response to the clip.
