The girl's family is throwing a Sangeeth (song and dance) for their\nguests on the 27th evening from 6:30 pm to 11:30 pm.\n\nRitu's father, Monte Ahuja, is a very prominent businessperson and\nphilanthropist. He happens to be a Republican and Senator Rob Portman, his\nfriend, is coming to the Sangeeth. Lots of prominent folks from the Indian\nAmerican community and Ohio will be there.\n\nSecretary Clinton happens to be in Cleveland on August 27th for a\nfundraiser. I wonder if it would be possible for her to stop by the event\nfor 10 minutes to wish the couple.\n\nHere are the reasons she should consider it:\n\n1. She would send an incredible signal to the Indian American diaspora and\neven the tech community of her being supportive of the future.\n\n2. She risks no blowback. Honda's folks would be very petty to criticize\nSecretary Clinton for wishing a couple on their marriage, particularly\ngiven it will be a beautiful ethnic ceremony.\n\n3. Secretary Clinton may marginally make a good impression among an\nimportant group in Ohio that includes prominent Republicans.\n\nIt would just be a 10 minute drop by anytime from 6:30pm to 11:00pm.\n\nLet me know your thoughts, and thanks for your consideration. Obviously, I\nwill totally respect and understand your decision.\n\nHonda continues to be in deep trouble. The press will not be kind to him\nafter the Sept 3 OCE report. I honestly don't see how he survives this.\n\nJohn, I believe with all my heart that Ro represents an important part of\nthe future of our party.\n\nThanks,\nSteve\n415-640-7746\n"
