They\xe2\x80\x99re also\nserving as fodder for critics of the Democratic presidential front-runner,\nwho is still dogged by questions about a 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi\nthat killed Ambassador Chris Stevens.\n\n\n\nAnd they are sure to raise more questions about the administration\xe2\x80\x99s and\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s response to what quickly became a political scandal. There is an\nemail dated Sept. 15 with Clinton providing \xe2\x80\x9ctalking points\xe2\x80\x9d for an\nupcoming closed-door hearing before the House Select Committee on\nIntelligence, but with the exception of Jake Sullivan the recipients are\nblacked out, along with the entire document.\n\n\n\nIt states only: \xe2\x80\x9cPer the discussion at Deputies, here are the revised TPs\nfor HPSCI.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe emails also show that Clinton received now-classified documents on her\npersonal email address. One of the documents State recently deemed\nclassified was a November 2012 email reporting possible arrests in Libya\nrelated to the Benghazi attack. The memo was sent through unclassified\nState Department channels and forwarded to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s private account by\nSullivan, State\xe2\x80\x99s Director of Policy Planning. A notation on the document\nreleased says it was classified as \xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x9cSECRET\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the middle tier of national\nsecurity classification\xe2\x80\x94on Friday, the same day the records were released.\n\n\n\nClinton has been under intense pressure for weeks since it was revealed\nthat she used a non-official email address while at the State Department\nand stored those emails on a personal server in her New York home.\nRepublicans jumped on those revelations to accuse Clinton of attempting to\nrunaround federal records laws and keep key documents about Libya and\nBenghazi from the public.\n\n\n\nRepublican Rep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Select Committee on\nBenghazi, has subpoenaed the State Department for all documents on Libya\nfrom Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s time at the State Department and is refusing to schedule the\nformer secretary to testify until the Obama administration turns the emails\nover to congressional investigators.\n\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/insiders-benghazi-testimony-works-to-hillarys-advantage-118202.html?ml=ri>\n\n*ALSO ON POLITICO\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/insiders-benghazi-testimony-works-to-hillarys-advantage-118202.html?ml=ri>*\nInsiders: Benghazi testimony works to Hillary\'s advantage\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/insiders-benghazi-testimony-works-to-hillarys-advantage-118202.html?ml=ri>\n\n*KATIE GLUECK* <http://www.politico.com/reporters/KatieGlueck.html>\n\nGowdy said in a statement Friday that the committee will continue to seek\nall documents from Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s tenure at the State Department on Libya and\nBenghazi and not the \xe2\x80\x9cself-selected\xe2\x80\x9d emails the former secretary made\navailable.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo assume a self-selected public record is complete, when no one with a\nduty or responsibility to the public had the ability to take part in the\nselection, requires a leap in logic no impartial reviewer should be\nrequired to make and strains credibility,\xe2\x80\x9d Gowdy said.\n\nThe Benghazi Committee has had access to this first batch of email, which\nrepresents less than 2 percent of the 55,000 emails Clinton returned to\nState, for months. Leaked portions of the emails contain extensive\ncommunications between Clinton and Sidney Blumenthal \xe2\x80\x94 a longtime family\nally. Blumenthal would often send Clinton memos on the security in Libya\nbefore the 2012 attacks that left four Americans dead.\n\nBlumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s analyses of Libya was often met with skepticism from senior\nState Department officials, including Clinton. Gowdy asked the U.S.\nMarshals Service to serve Blumenthal with a subpoena on Tuesday.\n\nThe emails also give a personal look at Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s habits and relationships.\n\nA Oct. 7, 2012 email from Blumenthal invited Clinton and her husband,\nformer President Bill Clinton, to a dinner.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPostelection, we\xe2\x80\x99d like to have you over for dinner. Bill can come, too,\nif he\xe2\x80\x99s in town. Whatever works,\xe2\x80\x9d Blumenthal wrote.\n\nThe rest of the 55,000 emails will be released to the public in stages.\nState proposed releasing those records next January, but a judge rejected\nthat plan and ordered the agency to come up with a rolling schedule, which\nhas yet to be finalized.\n\nThe documents released Friday are from January 2011 to Dec. 31, 2012, \xe2\x80\x9cand\nrelate to the security of, and attacks on, the State Department facility in\nBenghazi and to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 diplomatic presence in Libya, including\nin Benghazi,\xe2\x80\x9d Harf said.\n\nMaryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the Benghazi panel, said\nin a statement that the committee should now schedule Clinton to testify.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of the selective leaking that has happened so far, the American\npeople can now read all of these emails and see for themselves that they\ncontain no evidence to back up claims that Secretary Clinton ordered a\nstand-down, approved an illicit weapons program, or any other wild\nallegation Republicans have made for years,\xe2\x80\x9d Cummings said.\n\n\n\nRead more:\nhttp://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/hillary-clinton-emails-release-118214.html#ixzz3atDON74L\n\n\n\nOn Fri, May 22, 2015 at 1:29 PM, Ian Sams <isams@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\nThis strikes me as a selective placement from someone with access to the\nemails, maybe Benghazi committee staff since Alex has strong House GOP\nrelationships.

These\nemails were turned over to the State by former Secretary Clinton in the\nfall of 2014 in reaction to a request from the Select Committee:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than six months after the Select Committee first discovered Secretary\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s unusual email arrangement with herself, and after the media\ndiscovered Secretary Clinton relied exclusively on a personal server\nhousing a personal email account eschewing any official email address,\nState Department transferred 300 messages exclusively reviewed and released\nby her own lawyers,\xe2\x80\x9d Gowdy said. \xe2\x80\x9cThese lawyers, it must be noted, owed and\ncontinue to owe a fiduciary responsibility to Secretary Clinton to protect\nher interests. To assume a self-selected public record is complete, when no\none with a duty or responsibility to the public had the ability to take\npart in the selection, requires a leap in logic no impartial reviewer\nshould be required to make and strains credibility."\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is also important to remember these email messages are just one piece\nof information that cannot be completely evaluated or fully understood\nwithout the total record. The Committee is working to collect and evaluate\nall of the relevant and material information necessary to evaluate the full\nrange of issues in context.  We will not reach any investigative\nconclusions until our work is complete, but these emails continue to\nreinforce the fact that unresolved questions and issues remain as it\nrelates to Benghazi.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Select Committee continues to believe the American people have a right\nto the full and complete record of her official emails and, therefore,\nasked Secretary Clinton to turn her server and the full body of emails over\nto a neutral, detached, independent third party for review. This is also\nwhy the State Department must comply with a months-old subpoena for emails\nof the former Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s top aides, whose emails have never been received\nor reviewed by any congressional committee."\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Committee\xe2\x80\x99s interest is in building a complete record from which the\nfinal, definitive accounting regarding the terrorist attacks in Benghazi\ncan be provided.  The best way to answer all questions related to the\nattacks in Benghazi continues to be having access to the full public\nrecord, not a "record" controlled, possessed and screened exclusively by\nSecretary Clinton\'s personal lawyers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\n*Background Information on Released Emails:*\n\n\n\n*Among the emails the Select Committee finds highlight the existence of\nsignificant investigative questions:*\n\n\xc2\xb7  September 24, 2012\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCompiled protest and Benghazi Statements.\xe2\x80\x9d A\ndocument that reinforces issues relating to characterization of the motives\nfor the attacks. For example, Jake Sullivan noted, \xe2\x80\x9cYou never said\nspontaneous or characterized the motives. In fact you were careful in your\nfirst statement to say we were assessing motive and method.

But on Thursday, the New York Times released about a third of that\nbatch of correspondence, which Clinton exchanged using a private server\nrather than a government email account.\n\nThe documents show that, while Clinton used her personal email account to\nreceive information the government calls "sensitive," she did not appear to\nuse her private server to exchange classified information.\n\nThe "sensitive" information included details like the location of State\nDepartment officials in Libya during a time of instability in the country\nin 2011.\n\nThe documents released by the New York Times also show that Clinton\nreceived numerous briefing memos about Libya from Blumenthal, a longtime\nfriend of the Clintons who was not employed by the State Department. The\nNew York Times reported earlier this week that Blumenthal was also involved\nwith a possible business venture in the country at the time.\n\nTwo of those memos from Blumenthal came in the days immediately following\nthe September 11, 2012 Benghazi attacks.\n\nIn one, sent on September 12, Blumenthal suggested that top security\nofficers in the country believed that the attacks "were inspired by what\nmany devout Libyan viewed as a sacrilegious internet video on the prophet\nMohammed originating in America." Clinton forwarded that information to top\nadviser Jake Sullivan with the message "more info."\n\nBut another memo sent the following day indicated that the attacks may have\nactually been carried out by a militia group. Blumenthal wrote that\nofficials in the country "believe that the attackers having prepared to\nlaunch their assault took advantage of the cover provided by the\ndemonstrations in Benghazi protesting an internet production seen as\ndisrespectful to the prophet Mohammed."\n\nThe release of the emails comes after a prolonged political fight for\nClinton over her use of a private email server while serving as Secretary\nof State.\n\nOn Tuesday, Clinton urged the State Department to expedite the vetting of\nthe emails after initial reports suggested that the data trove would not be\nready for public release until January of next year\n\n\n\nOn Fri, May 22, 2015 at 1:00 PM, Brian Fallon <bfallon@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nState did a nice job with this, despite the initial, sensationalized tweet\nby AP\n\n\n\nOn Friday, May 22, 2015, Josh Schwerin <jschwerin@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\nState Dept. releases Hillary Clinton e-mails in Benghazi probe\n\nAP  MAY 22, 2015\n\nhttp://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2015/05/22/state-dept-set-release-hillary-clinton-mails-benghazi-probe/E48MdmnEHKruEi5sTKzOwM/story.html\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton received\ninformation on her private email server about the deadly attack on U.S.\ndiplomatic facilities in Benghazi that was classified Friday at the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s\nrequest.\n\nThe email in question, forwarded to Clinton by her deputy chief of staff,\nrelates to reports of arrests in Libya of possible suspects in the attack.\n\nThe information was not classified at the time the email was sent and was\nupgraded from unclassified to \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98secret\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 on Friday, according to State\nDepartment officials. The officials said 23 words of the November 2012\nmessage were redacted from the release of 896 emails totaling 296 pages, to\nprotect information that may damage foreign relations.\n\nThey said no other redactions were made for classification reasons.\n\nSpokeswoman Marie Harf says publication includes 296 e-mails given to a\nHouse committee investigating the 2012 attack on the US diplomatic post in\nBenghazi, Libya.\n\nShe says redactions were made according to Freedom of Information Act\nstandards. The emails will be released via the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s FOIA\nwebsite, foia.state.gov.\n\nThe documents cover e-mails between 2011 and 2012 related to the Benghazi\nfacility and its security, and to the broader issue of a US diplomatic\npresence in Libya.\n\nHarf says the e-mails don\xe2\x80\x99t provide new facts about how four Americans were\nkilled on Sept. 11, 2012. The State Department also said on Twitter that\nthe emails don\xe2\x80\x99t provide a change in its understanding of the events.\n\nThe State Department is still reviewing 55,000 further pages of e-mails\nfrom Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s private email account.
