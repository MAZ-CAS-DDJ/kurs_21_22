In\nfact, the President\'s numbers never really rebounded since 2005\nfollowing his hugely unpopular attempt to privatize Social Security; the\ntragic milestone of 2000 fallen U.S. soldiers hit and surpassed in Iraq;\nand of course, his administration\'s woefully inept response to Hurricane\nKatrina.\n\nThat year, Katrina\'s wake washed away whatever credibility remained\nfollowing the exposure of this Administration\'s penchant for payola\n<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2005/jan/29/pressandpublishing.usnews>\n, staged "town hall meetings,"\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28120-2005Mar11.html>\ndisingenuously named initiatives like "Clear Skies"\n<http://www.sierraclub.org/cleanair/clear_skies.asp>  and "Healthy\nForests,"\n<http://www.sierraclub.org/forests/fires/healthyforests_initiative.asp>\nfabricated news reports\n<http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E2DF1631F936A25750C0\nA9629C8B63>  praising the President\'s prescription drug program,\ngallingly inappropriate stunts like strutting across an aircraft carrier\nin a flight suit to declare "Mission Accomplished"\n<http://www.americansunitedforchange.org/blog/entries/major_bush/>  in\nIraq, and even a phony reporter planted\n<http://mediamatters.org/items/200512020010>  in White House press\nbriefings as a lifeline. Such propaganda tactics would make "The\nMinistry of Truth" from George Orwell\'s dystopian classic 1984 blush.\n\nAnd now the same folks that brought us the needless $3 trillion war in\nIraq have the mother of all swan songs left in store: redefining the\nBush legacy as something other than a failure. Weekly Standard senior\nwriter and GOP insider Stephen Hayes let slip earlier this month\n<http://videocafe.crooksandliars.com/heather/stephen-hayes-bush-administ\nration-working>  that an unofficial White House PR campaign is afoot -\nwhich Hayes dubbed the "Bush Legacy project" -- with the mission of\nhighlighting what they believe are the President\'s accomplishments and\nshirking responsibility for the more numerous and far more consequential\nfailures.\n\nFor instance, during the first in a series of scheduled media "exit\ninterviews" with the President, ABC\'s Charlie Gibson asked Bush if he\ncould have a "do-over," what it would be. In true "mistakes were made"\nform, Bush shrugged off any personal responsibility, replying: "[T]he\nbiggest regret of all the presidency has to have been the intelligence\nfailure in Iraq. A lot of people put their reputations on the line and\nsaid, you know, the weapons of mass destruction, is a reason to remove\nSaddam Hussein. It wasn\'t just people in my administration."\n\nIn reality, more than a few people formerly in his administration have\ncome forward as witnesses to a serious failure of leadership, not\nintelligence, including former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke and\nformer CIA national intelligence officer Paul Pillar\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/09/AR20060\n20902418.html> . Collectively, they tell a tale of a White House that\ncherry-picked questionable intelligence supporting the claim that Iraq\nharbored weapons of mass destruction and blatantly ignored intelligence\nthat contradicted it. A White House that pressured Clarke and others to\nfind any way to link the 9-11 attacks to Saddam Hussein. A White House\nthat outed an undercover CIA operative in retribution for her husband\ngoing public about dubious claims Bush made about Iraq pursuing nuclear\nmaterial in Africa.\n\nTheir accounts perhaps provide some explanation why Bush, when asked why\nhe rarely mentioned Osama bin Laden anymore during a March 2002 press\nbriefing, -- just six months after the attacks of 9-11 - replied: "I\ndon\'t know where he is. I\'ll repeat what I said. I truly am not that\nconcerned about him."\n<http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/03/20020313-8.html> By\nthat time, the mastermind behind the most deadly attack ever on American\nsoil who shamefully remains at large today on Bush\'s watch had already\nbecome an afterthought in the most costly bait and switch scheme in our\nnation\'s history.\n\nNo further proof is needed that the White House PR team is a shell of\nits former self with their decision to allow the always loveable,\nreassuring face of Vice-President Dick Cheney back on the airwaves\nagain, despite the recent CNN poll that found 1 and 5 Americans think he\nis the worst VP ever\n<http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/12/22/poll.cheney/> . Darth Buckshot\nis still up to his old Jedi mind tricks, confidently looking the\nAmerican people straight in the eye and insisting that waterboarding\nisn\'t torture and that the unimaginable human and financial toll of the\nwar in Iraq was well worth it. Not stopping there, during an interview\nwith ABC News\n<http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=news-000002999006> , Cheney\nsaid he adamantly disagreed with Karl Rove\'s recent statements that if\nthe intelligence concluded that Hussein had no weapons of mass\ndestruction, the nation probably would not have gone to war. And when\nasked on Fox News Sunday\n<http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=news-000002999006>  this\nweekend what he thought was the "highest moment the last eight years,"\nCheney didn\'t skip a beat: "Well, I think that the most important, the\nmost compelling, was 9/11 itself, and what that entailed." 9/11, his\nproudest moment? Clearly Dick didn\'t get the memo.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times\n<http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-na-bush9-2008de\nc09,0,4145069.story> , the White House recently felt the need to\ndistribute a memo to Cabinet members and other high-ranking officials\nwith vague talking points on what Bush accomplished the last 8 years,\njust in case they find themselves at a loss of words during their final\nround of public speeches. The memo reportedly includes such talking\npoints as "responded with bold measures to prevent an economic\nmeltdown;" "kept the American people safe;" and maintained "the honor\nand the dignity of his office." \n\nNo word yet whether the highlight reel will include the President\'s\nassault on labor or the 6 million fewer Americans that have health\ninsurance since he took office; or the nearly 2 million lost jobs and\nthe more than 2.5 million homes have that been foreclosed on so far this\nyear; or the national debt nearly doubling to over $10 trillion thanks\nto repeated irresponsible tax cuts for millionaires in a time of war. \n\nNo word yet whether the talking points on the unnecessary and mismanaged\nwar in Iraq will note the over 4,200 dead Americans soldiers and over\n30,000 more wounded; or how we are less safe as a result after yanking\ncritical military resources from the central front on terror in\nAfghanistan. \n\nWe can expect some self congratulation on the President\'s education\nprogram, but not for the millions of children left behind thanks to its\nunderfunded mandate. No word yet whether the systematic effort to\nmanipulate climate change science and mislead policymakers and the\npublic about the dangers of global warming will make the list. Or how\nabout all the sweeping deregulations written by and for their biggest\nsupporters from the big drug, financial, insurance and oil companies\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/15/AR20051\n11501842.html>  that delivered record profits for each industry at our\nexpense? \n\nAnd what of the deep recession the nation has struggled through for the\nlast year? The White House memo reportedly proclaims that Bush\n"responded with bold measures to prevent an economic meltdown." Indeed,\nanother "Mission Accomplished." The millions of Americans who have lost\ntheir jobs and homes this year or saw their retirement evaporate on Wall\nStreet apparently owe the President a debt of gratitude. \n\nThe White House will no doubt keep attempts at white washing recent\npresidential history relatively quiet for now. Because, really, how\nwould it look for the sitting President to be focusing his remaining\ndays in office repairing his legacy rather than on the enormous problems\nleft in its wake, like the half a million more jobs that disappeared\nlast month?\n\nBut while the administration\'s subtle efforts at an extreme legacy\nmakeover may seem laughable today considering Bush\'s painfully obvious\nculpability for the nation\'s woes -- that doesn\'t mean those efforts\nshould be left unchecked at any level. Just ask the Reagan\nadministration. \n\nIn 1987, President Reagan\'s job approval rating plummeted to 42 percent\nduring the height of the Iran-Contra scandal. However, in the remaining\nmonths of his presidency, Reagan went largely unchecked and managed to\nleave office with a 63 percent approval rating -- allowing his\nconservative disciples to redefine his presidency as an example of\nsuccessful conservative governance. A remarkable feat, to be sure, for a\nlegacy of unhinged deficit spending, draconian cuts in federal\nassistance to local governments, a homelessness boom, and a refusal to\nacknowledge the fledgling AIDS epidemic. Reagan got away with repairing\nhis legacy on the way out the door; George W. cannot be allowed to do\nthe same.\n\nFearing a repeat of history, Americans United for Change launched a\npreemptive strike in January 2008 with a multi-million dollar\n<http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22825540/>  "Bush Legacy Project" of our\nown with the goal of cementing into history how 8 years of failed\nBush-conservative polices have ruined our economy, threatened our\nnational security and sacrificed so many key domestic priorities. The\neffort included a national television ad\n<http://www.americansunitedforchange.org/blog/entries/state_of_the_union\n/>  aired around Bush\'s final State of the Union address and culminated\nwith a 5 month long national Bush Legacy Bus Tour\n<http://www.bushlegacytour.com/bushlegacy> , a 45 foot, 23 ton museum on\nwheels featuring interactive exhibits on Bush\'s worst policy failures.\nThe Bush Legacy Bus traveled 24,000 miles, visited 42 states, and was\nvisited by tens of thousands of Americans while parked in front of the\nlocal constituent offices of Bush\'s conservative enablers in Congress.\n\nThe Bush legacy should be remembered as a grand and failed experiment of\nwhat happens when conservatives are in complete control of the\ngovernment. Conservative ideology rails against government, argues that\ngovernment is the problem, not the solution. So when a government run by\nconservatives is faced with the most important responsibility any\ngovernment has - to protect its citizens - is it any wonder you wind up\nwith a tragedy of epic proportions like Katrina? \n\nFor helping drive a stake in the heart of conservative governance for\nyears to come, Bush actually deserves all the credit and thanks in the\nworld. \n\n \n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail lori@progressiveaccountability.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
