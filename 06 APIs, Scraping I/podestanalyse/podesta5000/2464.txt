We are considering some pioneering moves with the dispatch rule and natural gas, hope to increase the RPS to 25% in 2010, and start early retirement of some older coal plants.  \n \nWe have had some musical chairs in the Cabinet and I am looking at becoming the director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.  But as I think about that move, I think it makes sense to put my name in for heading EPA Region 8.  Each position would offer some terrific opportunities but I have heard that there hasn't been anyone particularly stellar up for Region 8 and I would love to talk to Lisa Jackson about it.  \n \nI am attaching my CV\x97any help/advice you could give would be terrific!\n \nThx,\nAlice Madden\n303 589 2560\n     p.s. ran an amazing \xbd marathon in Moab, UT on 10/18"
