john.podesta@gmail.comb"John - \n\nIt's hard to overstate the importance of 2016 for veterans and military family members. \n\nThe Koch Brothers are financing a multi-million dollar campaign to privatize veterans health care.\n\nRepublicans running for Congress are eager escalate our endless war in the Middle East, threatening to re-commit more troops to the region and drop nuclear weapons on Iraq and Syria.\n\nAnd, of course, control of the U.S. Senate is on the line and we're going to elect a new Commander in Chief before the year is done.\n\nAt VoteVets, we're set to take on these challenges and more, but we want to hear from you about your priorities for the year ahead.\n\nTake a moment to complete our official VoteVets 2016 Supporter Survey, and let us know the issues you are passionate about in the year ahead.\n\n\thttp://action.votevets.org/2016-priorities\n\nWith fewer members of Congress who have served in the military than at any point in decades, and none still in the race to become the next president, it is even more important that veterans and military family members make their voices heard on the issues of the day. \n\nWe're ready to lead with you, but first we want to get a sense of your thoughts for the year ahead.\n\nYour priorities are our priorities -- let us know the issues you're most concerned about taking on in the year ahead.\n\n\thttp://action.votevets.org/2016-priorities\n\nThank you for making your voice heard. It's an important part of our decision making process as we consider our work in 2016.\n\nThank you for standing with us.\n\nJon Soltz\nIraq War Veteran and Chairman\nVoteVets.org\n----\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.\n\nTo unsubscribe, go to: \n  http://action.votevets.org/unsubscribe\n\n"
