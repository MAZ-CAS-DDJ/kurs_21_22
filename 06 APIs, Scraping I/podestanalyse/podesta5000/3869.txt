Hopefully this all works.  Bob should then  \ncommunicate that to Gordon.  I also explained that we considered and  rejected \nGordon (not least b/c he violently opposes aspects of BO's plans like  \nincreasing armed forces).\n\n\n\n**************Psssst...Have you heard the news? There's a new fashion blog, \nplus the latest fall trends and hair styles at StyleList.com.      \n(http://www.stylelist.com/trends?ncid=aolsty00050000000014)\n"
