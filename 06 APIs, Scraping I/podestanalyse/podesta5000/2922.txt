Did it come up\nanywhere today ?\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Jul 16, 2015, at 9:17 PM, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nTeam, thanks for the good feedback on the Iowa speech. Latest draft is\nattached, which also reflects her suggestions.  Two notes: 1) apparently a\ntime limit is being strictly enforced, so I've cut this down a bunch. 2)\nHRC felt strongly about not touching Planned Parenthood right now. Jen\ntalked to her about it so perhaps could elaborate.\nThanks\nDan\n\nOn Wed, Jul 15, 2015 at 3:11 PM, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Here's a first cut at HRC's remarks for the IDP dinner. Would love your\n> thoughts. She is reviewing as well. A few notes:\n>\n> -- This opens by recalling previous collaborations with the other Dem\n> candidates. To me, this is a chance to seem big and inclusive when they are\n> likely to be trying to drive wedges.  Easy to cut, but might be a nice\n> grace note.\n> -- This draft throws out some red meat early on with Donald Trump to get\n> the crowd jazzed at the top. Then she can do your affirmative agenda and\n> circle back to the fuller contrast later on. Plenty of other ways to\n> organize this, but a good hit at the top seemed important.\n> -- Given the growing controversy over the leaked Planned Parenthood video,\n> with Boehner calling for hearings and other GOPers piling on, we should\n> think about whether this is a good time to join the battle and come to\n> Planned Parenthood's defense, or whether it's wiser to stay away. For now,\n> its in here.\n> -- Finally, you'll see a hit on Governor Branstad for his veto of mental\n> health funding.  Matt thinks this is a good fight to pick and I agree.\n> Gives you a chance to make an emotional appeal on an issue you care about\n> so much. The Governor is also riling folks up with his education cuts, so\n> that's in here as well.\n>\n> Am going to keep working this and punching up the language, but wanted to\n> share early draft in case folks have initial reactions.\n>\n> Thanks\n> Dan\n>\n\n<2015-07-16 IDP dinner - 9pm.docx>\n"
