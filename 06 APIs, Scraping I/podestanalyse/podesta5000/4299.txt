john.podesta@gmail.comb'Please try to help me honor my birthday after I got a greeting from Hillary Clinton.  I greet the Mikva Challenge, the Clinton Foundation with Bill and Hillary, and John Podesta.\n\nI would like to ask the Mikva Challenge to help me explore my probably desired relocation to Chicago during 2016.  Please tell me if Abner still does alternative dispute resolution or if he uses Deborah Stewart.   I admire President Obama yet felt D.C. staffs did not encourage me to do enough when my count of people who want to circulate my resume on LinkedIn in the Chicago area is 126, much higher than only 26 in the Washington, D.C. area where I currently reside at the Community for Creative Nonviolence.    I will tell the federal government we had disappointments with my past 5 years of unemployment since my Georgetown Certificate in Project Management and the Obama Administration would have concerns since the Workforce Investment Act program paid for it with a grant from the U.S. Department of Labor.  This is not formal ADR yet mostly an idea to ask Abner and his friends to facilitate communication with the Obama White House on my goals, past messages from Dan Pfeiffer, and apparent willingness to consider my involvement in historic areas after the Barack Obama Foundation acknowledged my resume.\n\nJohn, I was pleased to see you with Cardinal Rodriguez in November yet your Center for American Progress is the only major organization that considers me in D.C.:  Chicago is probably best.\n\nI will send more messages.  Thanks.\n\n\nJoe Slovinec\n'
