The new Chairman is Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon\x85 the past two Chairs have been Andrew Liveris of Dow and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan.   Their next meeting is going to be in Silicon Valley on Feb. 27-28.  We usually get a good group of approximately 100 CEO\x92s at each meeting. The meetings are for CEO\x92s and their spouses only and off the record.   \n> \n> I saw a blurb on Politico a few days ago saying that Hilary Clinton was going to be in the area a few days before the meeting. (--"Hillary ... to Deliver Keynote Address at Inaugural 2015 Watermark Lead On Silicon Valley Conference for Women" on Feb. 24).\n> \n> There are two key speaking spots open on the agenda of the Feb. 27-28 meeting \x97 one for the dinner on Thursday, Feb. 27, and one for the closing spot at 11:00am on Friday, Feb. 28th.  I would love to see if Ms. Clinton could join the meeting and speak in one of those spots.  I think it would be a great group for her to talk with and because it is private, think she could engage in real conversations with them. I would also be delighted to help set up some one off meetings for her with some CEO\x92s if that would be helpful. \n> \n> I am pretty sure the Business Council will not be able pay her normal speaking fees - but could pay her hotel room/expenses etc if she can stay in the area for a couple days to be able to participate in the meeting. \n> \n> Do you think she would be interested/able to attend the meeting?  And if so, how should I proceed from here?  \n> \n> I am attaching a list of the Business Council member for you here.. \n> \n> Many thanks and I look forward to getting your feedback, best, Melissa\n> \n> <Business Council Members.pdf>\n> \n> \n> \n> Melissa Moss\n> melissa@melissa-moss.com\n> 202-285-8456\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\nMelissa Moss\nmelissa@melissa-moss.com\n202-285-8456\n\n\n\n\n'
