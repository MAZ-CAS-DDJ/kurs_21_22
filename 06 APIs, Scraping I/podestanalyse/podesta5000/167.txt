john.podesta@gmail.comb'Team,\n\n\n\nAttached is a draft oped, reflecting initial comments from Jake and Laura,\non the Paris climate talks, which are starting on Monday. The intent is to\npitch this to the FT over the weekend and have it run Monday morning,\nbefore the President gives remarks at the opening of the conference.\nBecause of the Thanksgiving holiday, we would like to send this forward to\nHRC no later than tomorrow. In addition to this future-oriented oped, we\nare planning on a Podesta \xe2\x80\x98tweetstorm\xe2\x80\x99 that will give more color on HRC\xe2\x80\x99s\nleadership role on these issues, and we will amp up contrast with the\nRepublicans even more in a Briefing post.\n\n\n\nPlease send edits and comments to me by 2pm Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nKLC\n'
