john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear Community Colleagues,\n\nPut on your thinking caps this weekend - the Building Community Committee is pleased to announce the Second Annual Georgetown Law Halloween / Fall Decoration Contest!\n\nAll Georgetown Law community members may participate.  You may choose either a Halloween or a fall seasonal theme and you can partner with other staff/offices if you wish.   There are three broad groupings: Individual Workspace/Office, Door Decoration, Offices/Teams.\n\nThe "Rules"\n\n\n*         Decoration can begin at any time.  To encourage the opportunity for the entire community to view the decorations, please put up your decorations as early as possible.  The decorations will be judged on October 30th.\n\n*         Our Georgetown Law Communications colleagues may wish to incorporate the decorations into various messages for our internal and external communities.  Obviously, if your decorations are done earlier, your work has a better chance of being memorialized.\n\n*         Please keep costs in mind - our prior decoration contests were offered at minimal cost by staff donating or bringing from home most of the materials used outside of a small amount of office supplies.  The decorations are for everyone and they are greatly enjoyed by the students and the enhanced community spirit benefits all.  In my other role as Assistant Dean for Financial Aid, I thank you in advance for balancing both fun and finances.\n\n*         Finally - HAVE FUN!\n\nOnline registration information will be provided next week so everyone will have the opportunity to see who is participating!  A viewing guide will be provided as well.\n\nHappy Fall from the Building Community Committee!\n\nCharles\n\nCharles W. Pruett\nCo-Chair Building Community Committee\n'
