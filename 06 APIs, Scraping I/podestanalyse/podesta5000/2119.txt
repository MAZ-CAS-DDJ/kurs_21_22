Also, Roy Blunt got challenged on it by Stephanopoulos on\nSunday.\n\n\n\nThe other question is whether there is a member who would introduce a bill\nto end the FOIA exemption for Members of Congress? They should be just as\ntransparent as they\xe2\x80\x99re demanding HRC be. It would put the focus on the\nMembers keeping their emails private and would never actually pass.\n\n\n\n*From:* John Podesta [mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com]\n*Sent:* Sunday, March 15, 2015 9:35 PM\n*To:* Robby Mook\n*Cc:* Joel Benenson; Jesse Ferguson; Jim Margolis; John Anzalone; Mandy\nGrunwald; Kristina Schake; Jennifer Palmieri\n*Subject:* Re: Earned Media Update\n\n\n\nBetter off with an H R C warrior.

Secretary\nClinton spent more than five hours testifying before the Senate and the\nHouse of Representatives and  participated in briefings for Members.\n\n\xc2\xb7         Gowdy has been criticized for subpoenaing the State Department\nfor emails already turned over to the Select Committee.\n\n\xc2\xb7         Gowdy and Republican have been caught numerous times trying to\nuse the Benghazi investigation to fire up their base and raise money.\n\n\n\n*Republican Hypocrisy on Emails.
