john.podesta@gmail.comb'I received your email address from your assistant, as from time to time I would like to get you information that is not appropriate for others to see. And here is one of those times. The ranking General on my committee has some ideas for a memo that would help provide context for his and the other Officers work on this project. \n\nAlso- I am flying out to Texas to meet some more \xe2\x80\x98 rivate\xe2\x80\x99 individuals, and then flying to have dinner with current Commanding Officers at the Air Force Space Command in a couple days in Colorado Springs to discuss how to move this project forward. My committee grows larger by the day. After, I will write you and fill you in.\n\n\nGeneral\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts:\n\n"I was thinking a bit more about what a White House memo should say.  Something like these points to all Federal Agencies:\n- In light of the President\'s policy on STEM (citing official policy encouraging the study of science, technology, engineering and math)\n- some back ground on your project\n- the Administration encourages a favorable Public Affairs position by all Agencies\n- appointes NASA to lead (this kind of public outreach is in NASA\'s job jar, and if no Agency is appointed all will simply note and file the memo and likely do nothing)\n- and to coordinate with DoD, DNI and NOAA (the other major space actors, putting a bit of light on them)\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nbest,\nTom DeLonge\n\nTOM DELONGE | FOUNDER\nTOM@TOTHESTARSINC.COM <mailto:TOM@TOTHESTARSINC.COM> | (760) 518-7801 <> | TO THE STARS MEDIA <http://www.tothestarsinc.com/>\nSAN DIEGO | 1053 S Coast Hwy 101 Encinitas, CA 92024\n\n\n\n'
