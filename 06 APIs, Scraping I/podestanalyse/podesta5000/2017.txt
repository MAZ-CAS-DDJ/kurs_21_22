Mae told me you guys will be out this way around Easter, so I hope we get a chance to see you guys - we still need to finish our Bocce game from Radha's wedding.\n\nIn order to not entirely abandon the international development world since I joined the private sector, I have been working closely with Project Concern International.  They are an international development organization with an annual budget of ~$50 million; and the largest international development organization with its headquarters in Southern California.  Their newest and largest project is the Women Empowered (WE) initiative.  Project Concern is trying to identify an ambassador or spokeswoman for the initiative and thinks Ambassador Melanne Verveer is the ideal individual.  Because of her association with WJC and Georgetown, I want to see if you were connected with her.  I would love an introduction to her or one of her staff members to see if this is something she would consider.  Not a problem if you are not connected with her, but thought I would reach out.\n\nMore importantly, I hope we get to see you in a few weeks.\n\n---------------------------------\nPeter Huffman\nSenior Vice-President, Wealth Management\nThe Huffman Group\nMerrill Lynch\n858.456.3624\n800.955.3380\n858.201.4439 (fax)\nhttp://fa.ml.com/Huffman_Group\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis message, and any attachments, is for the intended recipient(s) only, may contain information that is privileged, confidential and/or proprietary and subject to important terms and conditions available at http://www.bankofamerica.com/emaildisclaimer.
