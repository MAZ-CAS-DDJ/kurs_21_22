The subject-matter area is broadly defined as any particular\n> matter, field of policy, or agency. In addition, this option would require\n> deregistration before joining the Transition.\n>\n> The second option involves a similar 12-month substantive look back period,\n> but would prohibit federally-registered lobbyist from engaging in any\n> lobbying activity during the period of their involvement in the Transition\n> rather than requiring deregistration.\n>\n> While both options create substantial restrictions on lobbyist involvement\n> in the Transition that would be consistent with President-elect Obama's\n> stated commitment during the campaign, several concerns have been raised by\n> our lawyers regarding the deregistration requirement. In short, they have\n> argued that a two-month deregistration requirement, following which any\n> number will promptly re-register, seems dodgy, hard to defend in the press\n> and doesn't address the conflict of interest concern. In addition, the\n> deregistration process is cumbersome to the point that any deregistration\n> would not be immediately accessible to the public. As such, any enterprising\n> reporter seeking to confirm registration status would not be able to confirm\n> a deregistration.\n>\n> Based on the above, I recommend that the Board approve the second option.\n> The attached document includes a draft of the code of conduct with the\n> second option outlined in paragraph 3. Please review and share your\n> feedback. We would like to finalize this document by the end of the day in\n> order to begin the process of fully vetting staff and volunteers to the\n> Transition.\n>\n> Best,\n> Cassandra\n>\n"
