john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\r\n\r\nBrian may have already sent an earlier version, but Jeff and I were wondering your reaction to the below, which follows from our discussion a couple of weeks ago. The thought at this point is to try to place in HuffPo, to get on record, but not force the debate back onto center stage. Does that seem right to you?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n-David\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: Edelman, R.

David\r\nSubject: Final OpEd\r\n\r\nCONSUMER PRIVACY: MOVING THE CONVERSATION FORWARD\r\nBy: Jeff Zients & Brian Deese\r\nWe live in an era where nearly every commercial interaction involves the exchange or use of personal data \xe2\x80\x93 often without our knowing it. But for years, the legislative debate over how to provide consumers with more confidence, and businesses with more clarity, about the rules of the road for the use of private information has been stalled.  The reasons for that are clear -- privacy advocates and businesses seem at odds, government enforcers are limited to decades-old tools to address emerging technologies, the existing legislative/legal framework is fragmented, and Congress has passed no laws to address consumer privacy broadly even as the era of \xe2\x80\x9cbig data\xe2\x80\x9d creates a need for more cross-cutting/integrated/holistic responses.\r\nThat is why over the course of this year the Obama Administration has been putting forward new, concrete proposals to strengthen consumer privacy, including the release this month of an initial draft of legislation aimed at enhancing privacy protections in the digital age.  And we\xe2\x80\x99re happy to see that releasing the draft has had its intended effect: in conference halls, at think tanks, in the broader public \xe2\x80\x93 and in the pages of this newspaper \xe2\x80\x93 people are now are talking about a specific, comprehensive, legislative approach to consumer privacy.  To keep the discussion moving forward, we think it would be useful to clarify what is new and different about our draft proposal.\r\nFirst, our proposed legislation would create strong requirements that would give consumers new rights to control how data about them is collected and used, including the right to know how businesses are planning to collect and use information, and the rights to delete data they provide and to correct data that is wrong.  The proposal also gives the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) new authority to levy millions in fines for violations of these requirements and other consumer privacy provisions.  These consumer rights and the powers given to agencies charged with enforcing them don\xe2\x80\x99t exist today, but they should.\r\nThis discussion draft is far from the final word on how to realize these important goals.  As we expected, it has sparked passionate debate about the right approach to consumer privacy legislation \xe2\x80\x93 from what are the appropriate exceptions and enforcement authorities, to whether the legislation should create a single national standard or rather be a federal complement to existing state laws.  These are important and worthy discussions.  Part of why we committed to put out a specific legislative proposal was to f move the process forward while having the debate play out in the light of day, not behind closed doors with only a handful of special interests providing input.\r\nPrivacy law is tricky terrain \xe2\x80\x93 done clumsily, a drive for strong consumer privacy could conflict with the desires for innovation and openness.  No one wants to put search engines out of business, eliminate free email services enjoyed by tens of millions Americans, or block engineers from research or from developing the next voice-to-text app or mapping site.  The answer cannot be that in order to preclude potential harm we effectively stop data from flowing across borders; that approach would be impractical and unwise.\r\nBut the debates over where to draw the lines and how to strike the right balance don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be starkly black-and-white.  That is precisely why new ideas and approaches presented in the discussion draft, like relying upon enforceable codes of conduct with strong FTC oversight, are so badly needed.  A privacy law will necessarily be a delicate balance between providing the practical privacy protections and greater control over their data that consumers deserve; allowing for the data innovations consumers demand and are benefiting from today; and giving startups and other companies who are responsible stewards of data the flexibility they need to create the next new, in-demand innovation.\r\nThe privacy discussion is also much bigger than any one proposal, and we are eager to move forward where there is common ground.  Leading up to his State of the Union address in January, the President put forward several proposals to protect  American consumers and families, including legislation that would give consumers peace of mind and companies clear understanding of how and when to notify victims of a data breach \xe2\x80\x94 like those that affected tens of millions of Americans last year alone.  The President also put forward legislation that would ensure that educational data on students, from kindergarten through high school, are not used in harmful ways.  Already we are seeing momentum on these proposals, with leaders on Capitol Hill committing to introduce measures that address the issues the President highlighted.  We look forward to working with Congress to address these complex challenges that are of great concern to the American public.\r\nA world in which consumers feel powerless and uncertain; where companies lack clarity on how the rules of the road apply to their innovations; and where enforcement authorities have vague, limited tools to draw upon is unacceptable.  But that\xe2\x80\x99s the world we live in today \xe2\x80\x93 a status quo where privacy concerns routinely generate front page news, but remain unaddressed by Congress.\r\nSo, instead of offering vague solutions too simplistic to be practical in this complex terrain, we decided to add comprehensive, specific legislative proposals to advance the discussion.  We are moving forward on privacy issues not only because they matter, but because they deserve a nuanced, thoughtful debate.\r\nWe do so with an open mind, and are eager to consider modifications to our proposals.  A serious and transparent debate is certainly preferable to no debate at all.\r\nBrian Deese is Senior Advisor to President, and Jeff Zients is Director of the National Economic Council, both at the White House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'
