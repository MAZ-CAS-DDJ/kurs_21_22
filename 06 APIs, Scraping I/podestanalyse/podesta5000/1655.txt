john.podesta@gmail.comb'John -- Fresh off a week of media coverage of his support for a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States," Trump is in Arizona today.\n\nAs his rally today will show, Trump has joined a long list of extreme politicians our state has watched exploit issues like immigration or national security for political gain. Most Arizonans see right through it.\n\nAnn knows we don\'t make progress by having the most-played, most outrageous soundbite coursing through the media 24/7 -- we make progress by fighting for real solutions and working across the aisle to build consensus.\n\nAnd that\'s exactly why we need Ann as our next senator.\n\nWe may not have a billion-dollar empire like Trump. But we have something more powerful: YOU.\n\nAnd with your help, we can make our voices heard not by saying something really incendiary, but by working hard. Every. Single. Day. That\'s what Ann is doing and that\'s what we\'re doing.\n\nWe set a goal to raise $2,000 in the next 16 hours to prove that Trump\'s rhetoric doesn\'t belong in politics OR Arizona.\n\nCan you get us started with a contribution? Time is short. And while $2,000 doesn\'t seem like a lot of money to Trump, to us it\'s the precious fuel of our grassroots campaign.\n\nThanks, we could not do this without you!\n\nTeam Kirkpatrick\n----\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.\n\nTo unsubscribe, go to: \nhttp://kirkpatrickforsenate.com/subscriptions\n\n\nPaid for by Kirkpatrick for Senate\n\n'
