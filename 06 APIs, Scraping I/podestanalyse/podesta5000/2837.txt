It didn't come through in coverage for\nunderstandable reasons but it is there in spades in the speech.\n\nHe's right on the education piece - both that it's crucial and that too\nmuch emphasis on it in this speech would've made it a dead letter with\nprogressives.  We'll solve that in two weeks.\n\n\n\nOn Jul 13, 2015, at 11:09 PM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com> wrote:\n\nFyi.
