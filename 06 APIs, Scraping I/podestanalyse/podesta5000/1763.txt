john.podesta@gmail.comb"MS-\n\nWe have been working with Julie Pace of the AP today to lay out a story ahead of tomorrow with some basic teasers on how you came to the decision to run and your rationale for doing so.  We had John and Robby talk to Julie, all on background, so as not to get ahead of ourselves in confirming anything officially prior to tomorrow.\n\nJohn did a run-through highlighting the things you've worked on your whole life, your experiences, including your more recent experiences as Secretary of State, and how it further shaped your views and your approach to problem-solving (the need to be globally competitive, what it takes to remain indispensable, and some examples of seeing the need to make progress in the US when you see things like the Chinese institute universal Pre-K).  He went on to detail the last couple of years post-State, and the fact that this was a real decision that you came to after spending the fall thinking through solutions that are commensurate with our biggest challenges.  Robby then did a little on the rationale to lay out the basics, that this is a campaign driven by people, etc.\n\nThe piece will shorter and process-focused but will get the attention we want it to get, and will go up this afternoon.\n\nNick\n\n\n"
