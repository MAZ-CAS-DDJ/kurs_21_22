Shear and Jeffrey H. Birnbaum\nWashington Post Staff Writers\nFriday, February 22, 2008; A01\n\n\nFor years, Sen. John McCain\n<http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/m000303/>\n(R-Ariz.) has railed against lobbyists and the influence of "special\ninterests" in Washington, touting on his campaign Web site his fight\nagainst "the \'revolving door\' by which lawmakers and other influential\nofficials leave their posts and become lobbyists for the special\ninterests they have aided."\n\nBut when McCain huddled with his closest advisers at his rustic Arizona\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Arizona?tid=informline>\ncabin last weekend to map out his presidential campaign, virtually every\none was part of the Washington lobbying culture he has long decried. His\ncampaign manager, Rick Davis\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Rick+Davis?tid=informli\nne> , co-founded a lobbying firm whose clients have included Verizon\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Verizon+Communications+\nInc.?tid=informline>  and SBC Telecommunications. His chief political\nadviser, Charles R. Black Jr., is chairman of one of Washington\'s\nlobbying powerhouses, BKSH and Associates, which has represented AT&T,\nAlcoa\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Alcoa+Inc.?tid=informli\nne> , JP Morgan and U.S. Airways\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/US+Airways+Group+Inc.?t\nid=informline> .\n\nSenior advisers Steve Schmidt and Mark McKinnon\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Mark+McKinnon?tid=infor\nmline>  work for firms that have lobbied for Land O Lakes, the UST\nPublic Affairs, Dell\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Dell+Inc.?tid=informlin\ne>  and Fannie Mae\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Fannie+Mae?tid=informli\nne> .\n\nMcCain\'s relationship with lobbyists became an issue this week after it\nwas reported that his aides asked Vicki Iseman\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Vicki+Iseman?tid=inform\nline> , a telecom lobbyist, to distance herself from his 2000\npresidential campaign because it would threaten McCain\'s reputation for\nindependence. An angry and defiant McCain denounced the stories\nyesterday, declaring: "At no time have I ever done anything that would\nbetray the public trust."\n\nEven before McCain finished his news conference, uber-lobbyist Black\nmade the rounds of television networks to defend McCain against charges\nthat he has been tainted by his relationship with a lobbyist. Black\'s\ncurrent clients include General Motors\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/General+Motors+Corporat\nion?tid=informline> , United Technologies\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/United+Technologies+Cor\nporation?tid=informline> , J.P. Morgan and AT&T.\n\nBlack said he is still being paid by his firm and does work for clients\nin his "spare time," recusing himself from lobbying McCain: "I not only\ndo not lobby him [McCain], but if an issue comes up that I have a client\non, I will tell him that and stay out of the discussion."\n\nA common career path for political operatives is a lucrative job at a\nWashington lobbying firm that allows them to continue campaign work, and\nMcCain is hardly the first candidate to draw on that talent pool. The\ncampaign of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton\n<http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/c001041/>  (D-N.Y.)\nhas been aided by lobbyists Harold Ickes\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Harold+Ickes?tid=inform\nline>  and Mark Penn\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Mark+Penn?tid=informlin\ne> , who heads Burson Marsteller\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Burson-Marsteller+Ltd.?\ntid=informline>  Worldwide. Sen. Barack Obama\n<http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/o000167/>  (D-Ill.)\nhas been advised by former senator Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.), who does\nnot register to lobby but advises clients about Washington.\n\nIn McCain\'s case, the fact that lobbyists are essentially running his\npresidential campaign -- most of them as volunteers -- seems to some\npeople to be at odds with his anti-lobbying rhetoric. "He has a closer\nrelationship with lobbyists than he lets on," said Melanie Sloan\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Melanie+Sloan?tid=infor\nmline>  of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Citizens+for+Responsibi\nlity+and+Ethics+in+Washington?tid=informline> . "The problem for McCain\nbeing so closely associated with lobbyists is that he\'s the candidate\nmost closely associated with attacking lobbyists."\n\nDavis did not respond to requests for an interview. Black, acting as a\ncampaign spokesman, said that Davis is being paid neither by his firm\nnor by the McCain campaign, and has not been a registered lobbyist for\nthree years.\n\nSchmidt and McKinnon said they remain with their firms, but are not\nlobbyists and have recused themselves from the issues of their clients\nin the McCain campaign. "I\'ve never discussed a client issue with the\ncandidate or his staff," McKinnon wrote in an e-mail.\n\nCampaign finance experts said employees of a company are allowed to\nvolunteer for a campaign as long as they do so on their own time, or\ncontinue to perform the functions for which their employers are paying\nthem.\n\nMcCain\'s reliance on lobbyists for key jobs -- both in the Senate and in\nhis presidential campaign -- extends beyond his inner circle.\n\nMcCain recently hired Mark Buse to be his Senate chief of staff. Buse\nled the Commerce Committee staff in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and\nwas until last fall a lobbyist for ML Strategies, representing EBay,\nGoldman Sachs Group\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Goldman+Sachs+Group+Inc\n.?tid=informline> , Cablevision\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Cablevision+Systems+Cor\nporation?tid=informline> , Tenneco and Novartis Pharmaceuticals\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Novartis+AG?tid=informl\nine> .\n\nMcCain\'s top fundraising official is former congressman Tom Loeffler\n(R-Tex.), who heads a lobbying law firm called the Loeffler Group. He\nhas counseled the Saudis as well as Southwest Airlines\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Southwest+Airlines+Inc.\n?tid=informline> , AT&T, Toyota\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Toyota+Motor+Corporatio\nn?tid=informline>  and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of\nAmerica.\n\nPublic Citizen\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Public+Citizen+Foundati\non?tid=informline> , a group that monitors campaign fundraising, has\nfound that McCain had more bundlers -- people who gather checks from\nnetworks of friends and associates -- from the lobbying community than\nany other presidential candidate from either party.\n\nBy the group\'s current count, McCain had at least 59 federal lobbyists\nraising money for his campaign, compared with 33 working for Republican\nRudolph W. Giuliani\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Rudolph+Giuliani?tid=in\nformline>  and 19 working for Democrat Clinton.\n\n"The potential harm is that should Senator McCain become elected, those\npeople will have a very close relationship with the McCain White House\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/The+White+House?tid=inf\normline> ," Sloan said. "[That] would be very helpful for their clients,\nand that would give them a leg up on everybody else."\n\nOf all the lobbyists involved in the McCain campaign, the most prominent\nis Black, who has made a lucrative career of shuttling back and forth\nbetween presidential politics and big-time Washington lobbying. He has\nworked for the campaigns of former congressman Jack Kemp\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Jack+Kemp?tid=informlin\ne>  (N.Y.), former president George H.W. Bush\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/George+H.W.+Bush?tid=in\nformline>  and former senators Phil Gramm\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Phil+Gramm?tid=informli\nne>  (Tex.\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Texas?tid=informline> )\nand Robert J. Dole\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Robert+J.+Dole?tid=info\nrmline>  (Kan.\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Kansas?tid=informline>\n), all Republicans.\n\n"I\'ve spent a fair amount of my life as a lobbyist, but I\'ve spent a\nmajority of my adult life running Republican political campaigns,"\nBlack, 60, said.\n\nHis relationship with McCain, for whom he is a senior adviser, goes back\n30 years, from the time McCain first came to Washington. They got to\nknow each other well during Gramm\'s 1996 presidential run; Gramm, now an\ninvestment banker, now is a major supporter and adviser to McCain.\n\nBut even as Black provide a private voice and a public face for McCain,\nhe also leads his lobbying firm, which offers corporate interests and\nforeign governments the promise of access to the most powerful\nlawmakers. Some of those companies have interests before the Senate and,\nin particular, McCain\'s Commerce Committee.\n\nBlack said he does a lot of his work by telephone from McCain\'s Straight\nTalk Express bus.\n\nHe said, however, the combination now requires that he work on weekends,\nwhich means 80- or even 90-hour weeks. If McCain were to ask him to step\nup his commitment to the campaign during the general election, Black\nsaid he would take a leave or a reduced salary from BKSH and devote\nhimself to electing McCain president.\n\nMcCain has long sought to defend his associations with lobbyists,\nstressing that friendships with them do not influence his independent\njudgment when it comes to legislative action. In comments to reporters\nyesterday, he acknowledged those friendships.\n\n"I have many friends who represent various interests, ranging from the\nfiremen to the police to senior citizens to various interests,\nparticularly before my committee," McCain said. "The question is . . .\ndo they have excess or unwarranted influence? And certainly no one ever\nhas in my conduct of my public life and conduct of my legislative\nagenda."\n\nStaff writer Glenn Kessler, research editor Alice Crites and\nwashingtonpost.com <http://washingtonpost.com/>  staff writer Chris\nCillizza contributed to this report.\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\nComments that include profanity or personal attacks or other\ninappropriate comments or material will be removed from the site.\nAdditionally, entries that are unsigned or contain "signatures" by\nsomeone other than the actual author will be removed.
