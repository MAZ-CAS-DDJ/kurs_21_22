john.podesta@gmail.comb"Mr. Podesta -\n\nI've been a democratic lobbyist in DC going on 10 years (I believe you may recall my father, Sante Esposito). I currently represent Polk County, Iowa (which includes Des Moines), which I have had as a client for the last 5 years. I am extremely close with the supervisors, and other electeds, who I believe could significantly help early in Iowa. I understand that efforts to put together the campaign are in the early stage but I would like to offer my assistance. \n\n\nMichael Esposito\nManaging Partner\nFederal Advocates, Inc. \n1701 Pennsylvania Avenue\nSuite 300\nWashington, D.C.  20006\nMain: (202) 351-6855\nFax: (202) 351-6855\nCell: (202) 999-0224\nEmail: mesposito@federaladvocates.com\nWebsite: www.federaladvocates.com"
