It's a staggering figure.\n\nBut here's the thing: the Arizona Republican primary hasn't even happened yet. Once it's over, just 21 days from today, you can bet your bottom dollar Boehner and the Kochs will pour even more money into our race.\n\nJohn, if we're not prepared when the general election begins, Ann's re-election could be in serious trouble.\n\nWill you help us reach 250 online donations for Ann before tomorrow's critical pre-primary FEC deadline? Our Arizona campaign depends on it.\n\nJohn Podesta\nGoal: 250 Online Donations\nSuggested Support: $5.OO\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/kirkpatrickq32014?refcode=em_FR_2014.08.05_b1_afa_nd&amp;recurring=auto&amp;amount=25&amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=DC&amp;zip=20016&amp;phone=2162818851&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=\n\nSpeaker Boehner and the Kochs are bound and determined to unseat Ann and replace her with another yes-man for their Tea Party majority.\n\nWe can't let that happen.\n\nJohn, chip in whatever you can to give us the resources we need to fight back for Ann.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/kirkpatrickq32014?refcode=em_FR_2014.08.05_b1_afa_nd&amp;recurring=auto&amp;amount=25&amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=DC&amp;zip=20016&amp;phone=2162818851&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=\n\nThanks for all you do,\n\nArizonans for Ann\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis message was emailed to: podesta@law.georgetown.edu\n\nTo unsubscribe from this email list, please paste this URL into your browser: \nhttp://action.kirkpatrickforarizona.com/unsubscribe\n\nPaid for by the Kirkpatrick for Arizona\n\n"
