He has a 2 pm\ncall to resolve remaining issues.\n\nI think our best course now is to hold our staff statement till Sunday\nafternoon (past Sunday shows), have Brian and I do a lot of tv on Monday to\nair some of the issues out and then not have HRC do an interview until\nTuesday.  She would, however, have to do a media avail on Monday.   Two\nbenefits of this revised plan - we have a better sense of press reactions\nbefore having her sit down and it is more time for her to be in right head\nspace.  Given where she is now, I don't think it is realistic to expect\nthat an interview on Monday would go well.  Do also think there is a value\nin having staff take first round of questions on this.\n\nThoughts?\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Aug 8, 2015, at 10:58 AM, Heather Samuelson <hsamuelson@cdmillsgroup.com>\nwrote:\n\nThanks Dan -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll review factsheet now -- it needs some updating.\n\n*From:* Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Sent:* \xe2\x80\x8eSaturday\xe2\x80\x8e, \xe2\x80\x8eAugust\xe2\x80\x8e \xe2\x80\x8e8\xe2\x80\x8e, \xe2\x80\x8e2015 \xe2\x80\x8e10\xe2\x80\x8e:\xe2\x80\x8e48\xe2\x80\x8e \xe2\x80\x8eAM\n*To:* Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com>, Kendall, David\n<DKendall@wc.com>, Jennifer Palmieri <jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com>, Cheryl\nMills <cheryl.mills@gmail.com>, Robby Mook <re47@hillaryclinton.com>, Heather\nSamuelson <hsamuelson@cdmillsGroup.com>, Brian Fallon\n<bfallon@hillaryclinton.com>, Kristina Schake\n<kschake@hillaryclinton.com>, Jake\nSullivan <jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com>, Huma Abedin\n<ha16@hillaryclinton.com>, Katherine Turner <KTurner@wc.com>, John Podesta\n<john.podesta@gmail.com>\n\nHere is a revised open letter attached to the current version of the fact\nsheet from the website.
