Can you contribute before the FEC deadline tomorrow at midnight?\n\nhttp://action.thehousemajoritypac.com/this.is.it\n\n--Jess\n\nSent from my iPhone, please excuse any typos or unfortunate auto-corrects. \n\n\n\nListen up, John,\n\nRight now, there is one BIG fight going down across the country. The Koch brothers, Karl Rove and the rest of the GOP are trying to buy seats in Congress while nobody is focused on the House. Well, John, let me tell you something. We can't let that happen.\n\nMy friends at House Majority PAC are Democrats' only hope of standing up to these attacks. They're on the air in some of the tightest races, but if they aren't able to get the resources they need, they're going to have to scale their ad buys back. In these final few weeks, that is something we can't have happen.\n\nSo, John, can you stand with my friends at House Majority PAC and make a small contribution before their HUGE deadline tomorrow at midnight?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/suit_bo?refcode=em101414_carville&amp;amount=25.00&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;zip=20016&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=&amp;phone=&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=\n\nI've been around politics most of my adult life, and if there is one thing I know, it's that we CANNOT LET the Koch brothers and Karl Rove buy any more Tea Party radicals seats in Congress. They shut down the government last year. If there are more Tea Partiers in Washington, they'll just do it again.\n\nWe have to stop these guys John, so I am counting on you.
