New research from the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley, indicates the war on terror has less impact on\npresidential popularity than it did during President Bush\'s first term.\n\nContrary to earlier studies that found that the threat of terrorism favors\nconservative leaders, a new national field study conducted by UC Berkeley\nsociologists Robb Willer and Nick Adams shows that terror warnings delivered\nby such government agencies as the Department of Homeland Security may\nreduce support for Sen. John McCain among moderates or swing voters.\n\nWhile the survey shows that terror alerts have little, if any, influence on\nhow self-described conservatives and liberals cast their ballots,\npolitically moderate voters or swing voters are less likely to vote for\nMcCain in the face of an imminent terror threat, according to a report on\nthe survey published this week in the journal Current Research in Social\nPsychology.\n\n"Most past research led us to expect that terror threats would increase\nsupport for conservatives," said Willer, lead author of the study and\nassistant professor of sociology at UC Berkeley. "But discontent with Bush\'s\napproach to the war on terror could be impacting views of McCain."\n\nAnd, the survey found, while the war in Iraq still ranks as a major concern,\nthe economy is a greater priority than the "war on terror."\n\nThe survey is a follow-up to Willer\'s earlier study at Cornell University in\nwhich he tracked 131 Gallup polls between 2001 and 2004 and found that each\ngovernment-issued terror alert prompted an increase the following week in\nPresident Bush\'s approval rating.\n\nTo test the effect of the threat of terrorism on the presidential election,\nWiller and Adams designed an Internet-based survey experiment funded by a\nNational Science Foundation program for large-scale field experiments. The\nsurvey was conducted by the media research firm Knowledge Networks in late\nMay and early June with a nationally representative group of 1,282\nAmericans. Of the total sample, 36 percent identified themselves as\nconservative; 40 percent as moderate and 24 percent as liberal.\n\nRespondents first were divided into a control group and a "threat-exposed"\ngroup and asked to rate various journalistic accounts based on their\nnewsworthiness and importance. Both groups evaluated two articles about\nsocial welfare policy and health technology, but the "threat-exposed" group\nrated an additional article, adapted from The New York Times, which warned\nof a possible Al Quaeda attack on the United States.\n\nRespondents were then asked whom they planned to support in the 2008\nelection and to what degree they favored President Bush.\n\nFor political moderates, exposure to the Al Quaeda attack article led to an\n11 percent drop in their support for McCain. With just weeks until the Nov.\n4 election, recent polls show that the race for the president is very close\nand that both campaigns are heavily courting moderate swing voters.\n\n"A variety of studies conducted during Bush\'s first term showed that terror\nconcerns led to greater support for the Bush presidency," Willer said. "Now,\nhowever, growing evidence suggests that many, possibly even most, Americans\nmay prefer a new approach to combating terrorism."\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
