She also\nrequested that the Army disclose the number of wounded soldiers who have\nbeen affected by this policy and promised to introduce new legislation\nto guarantee the fully payment of bonuses and incentives to wounded\nveterans.\n\n \n\nIn the wake of recent news reports of wounded combat veterans forced to\nrepay thousands of dollars in signing bonuses to the Army because they\ncould not complete their tour of duty (see: \nhttp://kdka.com/kdkainvestigators/military.signing.bonuses.2.571660.html\n), Senator Clinton sent a letter to Secretary of the Army Pete Geren,\nstrongly urging a reversal of policy.\n\n \n\n"Requiring soldiers who are being medically discharged to return their\nbonuses is outrageous. It dishonors their service and undermines the\nArmy\'s solemn commitment to soldiers and their families," Senator\nClinton said. "If the Administration does not reverse this misguided\npolicy, Congress should pass legislation to set this right."\n\n \n\nSenator Clinton announced that she will introduce legislation that\nrequires the military services to continue to pay certain bonuses to a\nmember of the Armed Forces who is medically retired or separated due to\na combat-related injury. The legislation would amend Title 37 of the\nUnited States Code to guarantee full payment for various incentive\npayments for wounded servicemembers. \n\n \n\n[A copy of Senator Clinton\'s letter is attached].\n\n \n\n \n\nNovember 21, 2007\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Honorable Pete Geren\n\nSecretary of the Army\n\nDepartment of the Army\n\nWashington, D.C. 20310\n\n \n\n \n\nDear Mr. Secretary:\n\n \n\nI write to request the immediate reversal of an Army policy that\nrequires repayment of enlistment bonuses by medically discharged wounded\nsoldiers.  According to recent media reports, the Army is directing\nwounded soldiers who have been medically discharged to repay their\nenlistment bonuses because they are unable to complete their term of\nenlistment.  This policy is outrageous and should be reversed\nimmediately.  Soldiers who have enlisted in the Army have made a\ncommitment to serve our nation.  With our nation at war in Iraq and\nAfghanistan, we should honor those who make that commitment.  By\nagreeing to serve and then suffering wounds during their service, these\nsoldiers have earned their bonuses.  To ask soldiers who are being\nmedically discharged to return their bonuses dishonors their service and\nundermines the Army\'s stated commitment to soldiers and their families. \n\n             \n\nSince the beginning of the war in Iraq, wounded soldiers have faced\nnumerous bureaucratic hurdles that have resulted in treatment that does\nnot measure up to their service and sacrifice.  Whether it is the\ndisgraceful treatment as outpatients at Walter Reed Army Medical center\nor the pay problems experienced by wounded soldiers, many wounded\nsoldiers have been treated with indifference and neglect. \n\n \n\nAs a Senator on the Armed Services Committee, I have continuously raised\nthe problems faced by wounded soldiers to Army leadership at hearings,\nmeetings, through correspondence and by offering legislation.  At each\npoint, I have been assured by the Army and Defense Department leadership\nthat they are working to improve the treatment of wounded soldiers.  In\nlight of this history, it shocks the conscience that the Army could\ndemand that wounded soldiers return their enlistment bonuses. \n\n \n\nTherefore, I again request a reversal of the flawed policy of requiring\nwounded soldiers to repay their enlistment bonuses.  I also request any\ndata that reflects the total number of medically discharged wounded\nsoldiers who have been affected by this enlistment bonus repayment\npolicy to date and the total amount of enlistment bonus repayment money\ncollected to date. \n\n \n\nWith soldiers bravely serving every day in Iraq, Afghanistan and\nelsewhere, it is important that we demonstrate our commitment to\nsoldiers and their families by reversing this flawed policy. \n\n \n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\n \n\nSincerely yours,\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHillary Rodham Clinton\n\n \n\n \n\nCc:       The Honorable Robert M. Gates\n\n            Secretary of Defense\n\n \n\n            Admiral Mike Mullen\n\n            Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff\n\n \n\n###\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n'
