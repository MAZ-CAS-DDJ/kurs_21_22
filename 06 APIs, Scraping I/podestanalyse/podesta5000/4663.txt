It is largely started by one person, Vijay Prashad, who has been\ncampaigning against me since I got an award from the Indian community in\n2003.  He is convinced that the India right wing is penetrating at the\nhighest levels of the US government.  He has already started emailing\ncampaign donors.\n\nI have two concerns: 1) that the campaign is aware; 2) that they will\ncontinue this until he can get traction (including have prominent Muslims\nand Indians send you letters).\n\nI am not sure what to do, but do you think it is worth issuing a statement\nthat puts this to rest?\n\nThanks for you help and sorry to bring forward a stupid issue.\n\nBest,\nSonal\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Bansal, Preeta D <PBANSAL@skadden.com>\nDate: Fri, Nov 7, 2008 at 7:55 PM\nSubject: links on Sonal\'s story - FYI\nTo: "Sutphen, Mona" <MSutphen@stonebridge-international.com>,\ndmcdonough@barackobama.com\nCc: Sonal Shah <sonalshah@google.com>\n\n\n\nhttp://epaper.hindustantimes.com/Default.aspx?Id=756142434579396251584F707447774B322F6863456C594961764E4E4F4556776D4932347646655649734D3D\n\nhttp://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=Cricket&id=c92bdef7-a366-47df-bf51-daae396caeec&MatchID1=4816&TeamID1=6&TeamID2=1&MatchType1=1&SeriesID1=1212&PrimaryID=4816&Headline=Obama+team+member%2c+Sonal%2c+has+VHP+links\n\nhttp://www.counterpunch.org/prashad11072008.html\n\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Ahmedabad/Obamas_Gujarati_aide_has_RSS_roots/articleshow/3687115.cms\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n****************************************************\n\nTo ensure compliance with Treasury Department regulations, we advise you\nthat, unless otherwise expressly indicated, any federal tax advice contained\nin this message was not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used,\nfor the purpose of (i) avoiding tax-related penalties under the Internal\nRevenue Code or applicable state or local tax law provisions or (ii)\npromoting, marketing or recommending to another party any tax-related\nmatters addressed herein.\n****************************************************\n****************************************************\n\nThis email and any attachments thereto, is intended only for use by the\naddressee(s) named herein and may contain legally privileged and/or\nconfidential information.
