john.podesta@gmail.comb"John --\n\nAs we prepare for 2015 and 2016, we need to get our priorities straight and we need your help.\n\nIn 2014, our supporters took over 1 million actions, grew our donor base to over 50,000 grassroots donors, and helped win some key Democratic races in a year when the odds were stacked against us.\n\nWe can make 2015 and 2016 even bigger, but we want to make sure we're supporting what our base wants. So tell us, John. Where do you stand?\n\nClick here to let us know what matters the most to you.\n\nYou input will be critical as we ramp up our work in the off-year to hold the Tea Party accountable, to stand up for issues that help more people into the middle class, and to build the foundation to elect a Democratic majority in 2016.\n\nTell us where you stand. What matters most to you?\n\nBy starting early, we can make 2015 and 2016 our best years yet!\n\nThanks for having our back,\n\nDemocrats United\n\nPS: House Majority PAC is the only super PAC dedicated to electing a Democratic majority in Congress and stopping the Tea Party once and for all.
