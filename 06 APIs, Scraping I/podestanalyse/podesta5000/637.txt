Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Americans continue to face injustice every day. Many live in constant fear they will be fired from their job, bullied at school, or kicked out of the house if they come out. \n\n*John, will you join me as an ally for the cause of equality and donate $5 right now to help us continue to fight for a world free of discrimination?* [ https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/polisjuneeom?refcode=em062315history ] \n\nHere's why this matters: In a few weeks, I'll be bringing comprehensive civil rights legislation before Congress which would ensure the civil rights of LGBT Americans are protected no matter who they love or where they live. \n\nThis bill is going to face serious opposition from tea party Republicans who will do everything the can to make sure it never becomes law. Our best chance to get it to President Obama's desk is to build a large coalition of grassroots supporters to overcome whatever stands in our way. \n\nWe can't build a world free of discrimination if we don't organize. And to do that, we need to find more supporters just like you who are willing to champion LGBT rights. *So please join me by pitching in $5 or whatever you can afford to help us continue to fight for equal rights. And by all means, if you can afford more, I'd appreciate it. [ https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/polisjuneeom?refcode=em062315history ]* \n\nIt comes down to this: Just a few weeks ago, the valedictorian of a Colorado school was barred from delivering his graduation speech because he planned to come out to his classmates. That kind of prejudice is wrong and it shouldn't happen anywhere in this country. We don't choose to be gay or straight any more than we choose the zip code we're born in. *So please pitch in $5 now, and let's get to work.
