Great win. \n\n \n\nQuestion for you: I am thinking of going with friends to Truckee for Easter weekend. A million years ago you said I should tell you if I was ever interested in staying at your place there, so here I am telling you! Alternatively, if you'll be there that weekend, it would be great to catch up. \n\n \n\nI know you have MUCH more impt things on your mind but figured it was worth a shot...\n\n \n\nSent from my phone: 510-501-7075\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"
