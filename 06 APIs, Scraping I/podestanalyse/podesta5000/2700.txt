john.podesta@gmail.comb"John - \n\nI started VoteVets almost ten years ago after returning from Iraq because there were not enough leaders in Congress who recognized that the cost of war continues long after we returned home from overseas.\n\nOver the years, we've led the fight to elect progressive veterans who understand that fact: Rrepresentatives like Tammy Duckworth, Seth Moulton, Tulsi Gabbard and many others. \n\nBut this year, we face some of our most important challenges to-date: we have a chance to elect leaders like Tammy Duckworth, Jason Kander, and Joe Sestak to the U.S. Senate. And we have to do it while beating back a Koch-funded effort to privatize veterans' health care.\n\nWe're going to need to work together to accomplish both of these objectives.\n\nMake  $3 contribution to VoteVets before Thursday night's FEC fundraising deadline, our last and most important one of the year.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/vv-deadline\n\nThe Koch Brothers' have already contributed almost $13 million to Concerned Veterans for America, the group leading the fight for privatized veterans' health care. And in Illinois, Mark Kirk is already running ads attacking Tammy Duckworth's service -- insinuating that she is aiding ISIS.\n\nThat is what we're up against. But there is no group better positioned to elevate the voices of veterans in the fight for our shared values. That's why it's so important you make a $3/AVG contribution to VoteVets ahead of this week's critical fundraising deadline.\n\nYou can do that here: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/vv-deadline\n\nThank you for counting yourself among the 450,000 veterans, military family members, and supporters who make up VoteVets.\n\nAll of my best,\n\nJon Soltz\nIraq War Veteran & Chairman\nVoteVets\n\n\n\n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/unsubscribe\nPaid for by VoteVets Action Fund\n\n"
