john.podesta@gmail.comb'\n\nJohn,\n\nI just wanted to make sure you saw Jake\'s email from yesterday. This is the most important weekend of the campaign so far. Our team in Iowa needs your help to make sure it\'s successful. How much we are able to invest in the ground game this weekend will directly reflect how successful caucus night will be for us.\n\nWe are counting on your support, chip in now: https://martinomalley.com/donate\n\nThanks,\nDave\n\nDavid Hamrick\nCampaign Manager\nO\'Malley for President\n\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\n\nFrom: Jake Oeth\nDate: Fri, Jan 39, 2016\nSubject: For Iowa\nTo: podesta@law.georgetown.edu\n\n\n\nJohn,\n\nToday marks the start of a very exciting weekend we call Get Out The Caucus weekend. This is when our field staff and our volunteers work all day to knock on doors and make calls to mobilize those caucusing for Governor O\'Malley.\n\nWe have volunteers from all over the country, from California to North Carolina, all taking time off from work and school to help us have a great caucus night.\n\nHere is what I need from you: help us have a successful GOTC weekend by donating $10 right now.\n\nYour $10 will help us get our volunteers out across the state. A $20 donation will help get a gas card so a volunteer can knock on 150 more doors. A $30 donation will help buy pizza for the volunteers at tonight\'s phone bank.\n\nWith matching funds, your donation may be doubled for our campaign. This means your $10 donation will be worth $20 for Iowa. \n\nWill you chip in to help Team Iowa #HoldStrong this weekend?\n\nThanks,\nJake\n\nJake Oeth\nIowa State Director\nO\'Malley for President__________________\n<a href="https://martinomalley.com/donate?ms=email-donate" title="Donate">DONATE</a>\n\nPaid for by O\'Malley for President\n\nContributions to O\'Malley for President are not tax deductible.\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.\nClick here to <a href="https://secure.martinomalley.com/unsubscribe">unsubscribe</a>.\n\nO\'Malley for President\n1501 St. Paul Street, Suite 115\nBaltimore, MD 21202\n\n'
