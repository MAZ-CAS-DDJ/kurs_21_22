Apparently they have done tele-presence before, but they find it creates constraints in engaging with the candidates.  What they recommend is arranging an in-person meeting for the second round, and these could be done in DC on Dec. 19-20 if that makes it easier for you.  They were also thinking that in between the first and second round, we could entertain flying a group of candidates out to San Francisco to meet Eric. We could also consider flying the candidates to Little Rock to meet with Bruce for that matter.\n\nLet me know if you think I should send a note to Bruce on this, or if you think you would want to discuss it with him.  Also, please let me know your thoughts about your seeing the second-round candidates in DC.  Thanks.\n\nTerry\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: John Podesta [mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com] \nSent: Sunday, November 20, 2011 3:40 PM\nTo: Terry Sheridan\nSubject: Re: CGSGI CEO Executive Search\n\nTerry,\nI need to be in DC on those days, but could probably participate in a number of the interviews by phone from DC.
