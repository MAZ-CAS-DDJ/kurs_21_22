Democrats are depending on the individual support we get from people like you.\n\n24 HOURS TO GO: Donate $3 or more to elect a strong Democratic Majority to Congress to work with President Obama to move America forward. http://www.dccc.org/agore-4\n\nThis deadline is so important that a group of Democrats have agreed to match your contribution 2-1, tripling your impact.\n\nI am fully committed to doing everything I can to make sure we win a Democratic Majority to partner with President Obama. I hope I can count on you. Please join me.\n\nhttp://www.dccc.org/agore-4\n\nAl Gore\n\n\n\n\nThis message was emailed to: john.podesta@gmail.com\n\nTo unsubscribe from this email list, please paste this URL into your browser: \nhttp://dccc.org/optout\n\nPaid for by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \n430 South Capitol Street, S.E.
