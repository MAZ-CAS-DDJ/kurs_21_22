john.podesta@gmail.comb'\nPolitico.com: Obama aide blames McCain on public-financing\n\n\nObama spokesman Bill Burton is blaming Senator John McCain\'s campaign for\nfailing, he says, to negotiate in good faith on a course to public\nfinancing.\n\n"In the past couple of weeks, our campaign counsels met and it was\nimmediately clear that McCain\'s campaign had no interest in the possibility\nof an agreement," Burton said. "When asked about the RNC\'s months of raising\nand spending for the general election, McCain\'s campaign could only offer\nits expectation that the Obama campaign would probably, sooner or later,\ncatch up. And shortly thereafter, Senator McCain signaled to the 527s that\nthey were free to run wild, without objection."\n\nBurton said that while Obama had essentially shut down fundraising for\nProgressive Media USA, which aspired to be a major anti-McCain media voice,\nMcCain had sent no such clear signal to GOP 527s.\n\nAt the same time, no well-funded GOP 527 has yet emerged to attack Obama.\n\nI\'ll add the McCain camp\'s response when it comes.\n\nALSO: Lynn\n<http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2008/06/obama_told_tim_russert_in_febr.html\n>  Sweet notes that Obama said in February that he would personally sit down\nwith McCain to work out a financing deal, which never happened.\n\n\n\n\n'
