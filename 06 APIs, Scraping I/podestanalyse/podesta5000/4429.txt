I had much fun.\nWondering if you could give me a sense of the general purpose and scope of\nthe fundraising meetings you are doing this week-how many cities/meetings?\nWhat is your main message for potential bundlers?\nWe are going to do a fundraising story of some sort later this week and\nwill surely talk to people who are attending but would be good to get an\noverview straight from you...\nLet me know if you can help. I read you are the most helpful person in DC!\nAll best,\nLaura\n\n\n\nLaura Meckler\nThe Wall Street Journal.\n202-862-9212 (w) | 202-446-4530 (c)\n@laurameckler\nhttps://www.facebook.com/LauraMecklerWSJ\n\n\n<winmail.dat>\n'
