On a joint call\nwith Conservation Voters New Mexico, our two organizations proudly\nannounced our endorsement of New Mexico Rep. Martin Heinrich for U.S.\nSenate.\n\nBe a part of this moment -- make a gift of\xa0$500.00 via LCV Action Fund's GiveGreen website and help support Martin Heinrich for U.S. Senate: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=NmqKm4-s4PRiR3C2nxH-kQ..\n\nWhy did LCV Action Fund endorse so early? Two simple reasons:\n\n1. The Candidate. Martin Heinrich is - hands down - one of the strongest environmental champions currently serving in the U.S. House of Representatives. During his tenure in the U.S. House representing New Mexico's 1st district Rep. Heinrich earned a perfect 100% lifetime score on LCV's National Environmental Scorecard. He has been a steadfast defender of the Clean Air Act and champion for clean energy.\n\n2. The Campaign. New Mexico is a swing state that is sure to be targeted by Big Oil, the Koch Brothers, and the Tea Party. We expect corporate special interests to spend millions in slash-and-burn television and radio ads early and often in the\nstate. That's why it's absolutely essential that LCV Action Fund begins organizing and mobilizing for the Senate race right away.\n\nWe need Martin Heinrich in the U.S. Senate. Big Polluters are attacking some of our most crucial environmental protections, including the Clean Air Act and the Environmental Protection Agency. We need an environmental champion like Martin Heinrich to fight for us.\xa0\xa0\n\nWith so much at stake in New Mexico, it's critical that we get urgent financial support to Martin Heinrich immediately. And frankly, the best way for LCV Members like you to support solid environmental candidates like Martin Heinrich is through GiveGreen.\n\nLCV Action Fund's GiveGreen website bundles thousands of contributions from environmental supporters and delivers them to environmental candidates. Contributing via GiveGreen is the best way to signal to candidates that environmental issues are a top priority for you.\n\nSo please, make a donation of $500.00 via LCV Action Fund's GiveGreen website and let's make Martin Heinrich the next U.S. Senator from the great state of New Mexico: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=d6wUdl0QT_fUTBLOih_QFg..\n\nThank you for all your support this year.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGene Karpinski\nPresident\nLeague of Conservation Voters\n\n\n\nUpdate Your Profile\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=dwN9psG_GFueni26OEZobg..\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=5STE6D6K7vopbxvdIBROfN4dotfZTSrz&cid=0\n\n"
