It is\nthe vast American middle class. It is the upward mobility of people who\nthought they could do better than their parents.\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n*\xe2\x80\x93Hillary Clinton*\n\n\n\n*BACKGROUND:* Hillary Clinton has dedicated her life to ensuring that\nhardworking Americans can succeed.  In uncertain times, families need faith\nthat opportunity for their children and grandchildren is alive and well.\nHillary Clinton wants the American Dream to be a real possibility for every\nchild and every family across our nation.\n\n\xc2\xb7       *Hillary Clinton knows that tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s shared success starts with\ntoday\xe2\x80\x99s child*, and her dedication to children began long before she ever\nentered public office. In fact, her first job out of law school was for the\nnewly-formed Children\xe2\x80\x99s Defense Fund, an organization she would later\nchair.\n\n\n\n\xc2\xb7       *Hillary Clinton has worked to expand access to early childhood\neducation for children of lower-income families.* As First Lady of\nArkansas, Hillary Clinton introduced her husband to the HIPPY program,\nwhich expanded early childhood education to economically disadvantaged\nchildren.

In the Senate, Hillary Clinton looked for ways to strengthen the\nprogram, introducing bills to allow states to expand it.\n\n\n\n\xc2\xb7       *Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s record proves she believes that every American\nshould be able to earn an equal day\xe2\x80\x99s pay for an equal day\xe2\x80\x99s work.* As a\nSenator, Hillary Clinton introduced the Paycheck Fairness Act and was an\noriginal cosponsor of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\n\n\n\n\xc2\xb7       *In the Senate, Hillary Clinton supported increasing the minimum\nwage* and voted repeatedly to protect and increase it. She was an original\ncosponsor of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, and authored the 2006 and\n2007 Standing with Minimum Wage Act to tie Congressional salary increases\nto an increase in the minimum wage.\n\n\n\n\xc2\xb7       *As a Senator, Hillary Clinton supported progressive tax policies*\nthat required millionaires to pay their fair share. She opposed tax cuts\nfor the wealthiest Americans and corporations in 2001 and 2003, and she\nsupported a variety of middle-class tax cuts, including tax credits for\nstudent loan recipients, and keeping in place the tax cuts for those who\nmake under $250,000 a year.\n\n\n\no   Clinton has said \xe2\x80\x9cthat inherited wealth and concentrated wealth is not\ngood for America,\xe2\x80\x9d and she has consistently voted against repealing the\nestate tax on millionaires, doing so in 2001, 2002, and 2006.\n\n\n\n\xc2\xb7       *Hillary Clinton supported working families going through difficult\ntimes through no fault of their own.* In the Senate, she was a bipartisan\nleader on fighting to extend emergency unemployment benefits.\n\n\n\n*BOTTOM LINE:* Leading the charge for equal pay for equal work, fighting to\nincrease  wages, strongly advocating for progressive tax policies and\naccess to education and healthcare to help middle-class families \xe2\x80\x93 Hillary\nClinton has fought for an America and a future where everyone can rise to\ntheir potential.\n\n\n *HILLARY CLINTON\xe2\x80\x99S RECENT STATEMENTS ON THE MIDDLE CLASS*\n\n*In her many public appearances over the past year, Hillary Clinton has\ncontinued to advocate for the middle class by sharing her vision all over\nthe country: *\n\n\xc2\xb7       *In a speech to a women-focused event for Democrat Tom Wolf,\n\xe2\x80\x9cClinton focused on \xe2\x80\x98hard-working families\xe2\x80\x99 and restoring America\xe2\x80\x99s luster\nand a strong middle class with \xe2\x80\x98a fresh start.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d* According to Politico,\nClinton gave one of her strongest political speeches since her 2008\ncampaign ended in June 2008 as she headlined a women-focused event for\nDemocratic gubernatorial Tom Wolf in Pennsylvania. Clinton focused on\n\xe2\x80\x9chard-working families\xe2\x80\x9d and restoring America\xe2\x80\x99s luster and a strong middle\nclass with \xe2\x80\x9ca fresh start,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as women\xe2\x80\x99s pay equity and her gauzy\nfirst days as a new grandmother. For the first time in months, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\npublic talk was neither a dry recitation of public policy nor a\nself-reflection about her tenure as secretary of state.\xe2\x80\x9d [Politico\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/pennsylvania-governor-race-2014-tom-wolf-hillary-clinton-111760.html#ixzz3Fkai9jLu>,\n10/9/14]\n\n\xc2\xb7       *Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s language at a women-focused event for Democrat Tom Wolf\nwas \xe2\x80\x9csome of her strongest about rebuilding the middle class.\xe2\x80\x9d* According\nto Politico, \xe2\x80\x9cThe remarks were some of her strongest about rebuilding the\nmiddle class. They came after she was accused of being out of touch for her\ncomment in June about being \xe2\x80\x98dead broke\xe2\x80\x99 when she left the White House, and\nfor giving paid speeches at exorbitant prices.\xe2\x80\x9d [Politico\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/pennsylvania-governor-race-2014-tom-wolf-hillary-clinton-111760.html#ixzz3Fkai9jLu>,\n10/9/14]\n\n\xc2\xb7       *The theme of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s speech at an event for Pennsylvania\ngubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf was working families.* According to\nBuzzFeed, \xe2\x80\x9cThe thread running through Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s message here in\nPennsylvania, the state she won six years ago in a primary against Barack\nObama, was working families \xe2\x80\x94 a theme she teased repeatedly throughout her\nspeech with populist undertones, mentions of her granddaughter, and stories\nabout her own trips as a child to Scranton, where Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s father, Hugh,\nwas born to a working-class immigrant family.\xe2\x80\x9d [BuzzFeed\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/hillary-clinton-finds-her-message#ukknyi>,\n9/9/14]\n\n\xc2\xb7       *In Pennsylvania, Clinton criticized the power of corporations,\nsiding with middle-class families.* According to the Wall Street Journal,\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough she and her husband have raised more than $1 billion from U.S.\ncompanies and corporate officials over the last two decades*, *Mrs. Clinton\nsignaled that she sided with everyday families struggling to pay bills and\nkeep afloat. Corporations, she said, \xe2\x80\x98seem to have all the rights, but none\nof the responsibilities of people \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99 She decried practices that pay women\nless than men for the same work and took aim at politicians who\xe2\x80\x99ve\nbelittled women\xe2\x80\x99s rights. \xe2\x80\x98A 20th century economy will not work for\n21st century\nfamilies,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\xe2\x80\x9d [Wall Street Journal\n<http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/10/09/hillary-clinton-blends-family-stories-populist-attacks-at-pennsylvania-rally/>,\n9/9/14]\n\n\xc2\xb7       *Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s speeches are revealing a theme that she would\nfight to restore and re-open the middle class. *According to TPM, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nnotion of \xe2\x80\x98upward mobility\xe2\x80\x99 was central to Clinton\'s message to the New\nAmerican audience in May. She described it as \xe2\x80\x98time-tested wisdom\xe2\x80\x99 that was\n\xe2\x80\x98at the heart of what I believe is the basic bargain of America.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa6 Here is\nhow Clinton described that basic bargain of America, as she sees it, in\nMay: \xe2\x80\x98No matter who you are or where you come from, if you work hard and\nplay by the rules, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to build a good life for\nyourself and your family.\xe2\x80\x99" [TPM\n<http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/hillary-clinton-2016-economic-message>,\n9/22/14]\n\n\xc2\xb7       *Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s speeches are revealing a theme that she can\naddress income inequality and gender inequality. *According to TPM, \xe2\x80\x9cSo\nincome inequality has been a big part of the message. But it\'s also been\nmarried to inequality between the sexes. At both the New American and CAP\nevents, the same factoid made an appearance: That three-quarters of jobs\nthat rely on tips -- like \xe2\x80\x98waiters, bartenders and hairstylists\xe2\x80\x99 as she\nsaid on both occasions -- are held by women\xe2\x80\xa6. And she said Thursday that\nthese issues should be used to mobilize voters -- in the 2014 midterms and\nmoving forward.\xe2\x80\x9d [TPM\n<http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/hillary-clinton-2016-economic-message>,\n9/22/14]\n\n\xc2\xb7       *In recent speeches, Clinton has taken a tougher stance on big\nbusiness, likely in \xe2\x80\x9can effort to find the balance between populism and her\nfamiliar centrism\xe2\x80\x9d she may need in 2016, according to Reuters. *According\nto Reuters, \xe2\x80\x9cLong viewed as an ally by Wall Street, likely 2016\npresidential contender Hillary Clinton has increasingly been taking banks\nand big business to task while on the campaign trail for Democrats across\nthe country.\xe2\x80\xa6 This is a change of tone for the former New York senator, who\nfaced criticism for her Wall Street ties as recently as September, after\nappearing with Goldman Sachs (GS.N) chief executive Lloyd Blankfein. Allies\nand analysts see it as an effort to find the balance between populism and\nher familiar centrism that Clinton may need in order to broaden her appeal\nin a potential 2016 Democratic primary contest.\xe2\x80\x9d [Reuters\n<http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/02/us-usa-elections-clinton-idUSKBN0IM0ED20141102>,\n11/2/14]\n\n\xc2\xb7       *During a New Hampshire midterm event, Clinton discussed expanding\neconomic opportunity and raising the minimum wage. *According to the Boston\nGlobe, \xe2\x80\x9cClinton spoke in New Hampshire about expanding economic\nopportunity, raising the minimum wage, and protecting women\xe2\x80\x99s rights. She\nacknowledged that, across the country, there is \xe2\x80\x98a lot of anxiety and\ninsecurity.\xe2\x80\x99 But the former secretary of state and US senator from New York\nstruck a hopeful note: She bookended her remarks talking about her new\ngranddaughter and said seeing another generation in the family focuses the\nmind on what\xe2\x80\x99s important. Clinton said she and her husband were raised to\nbelieve the American Dream was within your reach if you worked hard. \xe2\x80\x98You\nshould not,\xe2\x80\x99 Clinton told a packed gymnasium, \xe2\x80\x98have to be the grandchild of\na governor or a senator or a former secretary of state or a former\npresident to believe that the American Dream is in your reach.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d [Boston\nGlobe\n<http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/11/02/hillary-clinton-campaign-with-jeanne-shaheen-maggie-hassan-new-hampshire/rNXPdVMI3umCS97hOY5ytK/story.html>,\n11/2/14]\n\n\xc2\xb7       *In midterm campaign appearances, Clinton has been echoing populist\nnotes. *According to Bloomberg, Clinton \xe2\x80\x9chas been sounding more populist\nnotes of late as a campaign-trail advocate for Democratic candidates who\nare on the ballot next week. That\'s an important turn as she contemplates a\nrun for president in 2016 because Clinton\'s biggest weakness among\nDemocrats, and some Republicans, is the perception that she\'s too close to\nWall Street and corporate America\xe2\x80\xa6. And the more anti-corporate tone is\npleasing to the ears of liberals who have pined for Senator Elizabeth\nWarren, a scourge of Wall Street banks, to challenge Clinton for the\nDemocratic nomination. And, they say, it\'s a message Clinton can use\nagainst Republicans because many in the GOP have turned wary of Wall Street\nand big corporations since the 2008 financial crash.\xe2\x80\x9d [Bloomberg\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-10-27/clinton-trickledone-economics-has-failed>,\n10/27/14]\n\n\xc2\xb7       *During a midterm appearance in New York, Clinton clarified earlier\ncomments about companies and job creation, while maintaining the same\ntheme: \xe2\x80\x9cClinton\xe2\x80\x99s for the little guy.\xe2\x80\x9d *According to Bloomberg, \xe2\x80\x9cDays after\nRepublicans feasted on her claim that corporations don\'t create jobs,\nHillary Clinton tried Monday to \xe2\x80\x98be absolutely clear about what I\'ve been\nsaying for a couple of decades.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98So-called trickle-down economics has\nfailed,\xe2\x80\x99 Clinton said as she stumped for Representative Sean Patrick\nMaloney in New York. \xe2\x80\x98Our economy grows when businesses and entrepreneurs\ncreate good-paying jobs here in an America where workers and families are\nempowered to build from the bottom up and the middle out\xe2\x80\x93not when we hand\nout tax breaks for corporations that outsource jobs or stash their profits\noverseas.\xe2\x80\x99 While campaigning Friday for Massachusetts gubernatorial\ncandidate Martha Coakley, Clinton created a stir\xe2\x80\x93and drew criticism from\nRepublicans\xe2\x80\x93by saying, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t let anybody tell you that it\xe2\x80\x99s corporations\nand businesses that create jobs.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa6The cleaned-up message, though, hits at\nthe same theme: Clinton\'s for the little guy.\xe2\x80\x9d [Bloomberg\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-10-27/clinton-trickledone-economics-has-failed>,\n10/27/14]\n\n\xc2\xb7       *While campaigning for Democrats in the midterm election, Clinton\nfrequently tells voters that \xe2\x80\x9ceveryone deserves a second chance, a third\nchance.\xe2\x80\x9d *According to a CNN, an investigation into Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s most common\nlines on the trail found that Clinton frequently tells voters, "\xe2\x80\x98Everyone\ndeserves a second chance, a third chance...\xe2\x80\x99 Clinton has focused a great\ndeal on economic populism on the stump, an issue other Democrats thinking\nabout seeking the presidency in 2016 have started to tweak Clinton on.\n\xe2\x80\x98Everyone deserves a second chance, a third chance to keep going and to\nmake something of themselves,\xe2\x80\x99 Clinton said in Iowa earlier this year.\n\xe2\x80\x98That was one of the most important lessons of my life.\xe2\x80\x99 Clinton usually\nuses the line to encourage compassion from a crowd, and to show that she\nhas compassion, too.\xe2\x80\x9d [CNN\n<http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/28/politics/clinton-midterm-lines/>, 10/28/14]\n\n\xc2\xb7       *In a San Francisco speech, Clinton revealed some of what may be\nher economic message: \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s on your side?\xe2\x80\x9d *According to the Washington\nPost, \xe2\x80\x9cHere in San Francisco on Monday, Clinton gave a spirited call to\narms to Democrats as she road-tested what is likely to be her economic\nmessage if she runs again.
