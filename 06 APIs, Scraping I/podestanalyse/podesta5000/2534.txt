This CLE will be held at Arnold & Porter LLP, 555 12th Street, NW, Washington, DC.\n\nLast month's landmark net neutrality decision by the FCC to classify Internet Service Providers (ISP) as common carriers will impact every ISP's collection, use, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII) and other related data. The Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) requirements under Section 222 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, will now apply to more entities. This is a very new development for ISPs and anyone doing business with ISPs, such as broadcast stations or other media/telecom companies that serve behavioral advertising, or online service providers that are engaged by media and telecommunications companies and their clients.\n\n    How does the FCC's net neutrality decision impact Big Data companies or providers, or the Big Data ecosystem?\n    What changes in internal privacy practices and business operations will be required for use of PII not previously regulated?\n    Will the FCC's net neutrality decision impact behavioral advertising? Can ISPs continue to collect, use and/or disclose information about consumer viewing, habits, search or transaction history? What precautions, if any, should be taken?\n    How will the FCC's CPNI Rules govern ISPs?\n    For ISPs and other media and communications companies' use of Big Data, what is the new enforcement regime under the FCC and the FTC?\n    Does Section 5 of the FTC Act still govern ISPs or will the FTC's common carrier exemption apply?\n\nThe FCBA has applied for 3.5 hours of MCLE credit from the VA and CA State Bars. Approval is pending.\n\n*Note that ABA Forum on Communications Law members attending in person may not register online.
