You\nknow, the question to ask yourself is why: Why am I getting this phone call?\nAnd I\'ll go to the one about free trade, using Hispanic or Latin accents.\nAnd the point there is to create cross-pressure.\n\nSo if you call a Democratic household that you\'re fairly certain is\x97maybe\neven a union household\x97opposed to legislation such as, or policies such as\nNAFTA, the national\x97the North American Free Trade Agreement, which a union\nhousehold is going to perceive as a threat to their job, if you make that\nphone call that says\x97you know, talking about NAFTA in that accent, you\'re\ngoing to create cross-pressure, because you\'re going to be saying to that\nhousehold, you know, while\x97depending on who they support, they may be in\nconflict, and they may just throw up their hands and say, "You know what?\nI\'m not going to vote. I\'m just going to stay home." Or they may cast a vote\nthat ultimately is not in their best interest. So what you\'re doing is\nyou\'re\x97\n\nAnother example might be, you know, if you\'re a Republican, calling into\nwhat you\'ve identified as a Green Party leaning household and encouraging\nthem to vote for the Green Party, because more than likely, that household\nis going to be a Democratic-voting household if they\'re not a Green Party\nhousehold.\n\nSo, essentially, you\'re polarizing, you\'re dividing, and that\'s how you win\nin politics. I mean, this is a\x97as I said earlier, this is not about\nmorality, this is about winning, but winning in a way that you stay on the\nright side of the law, which, again, as your listeners know, is something I\nviolated and paid a stiff price for. But nonetheless, the idea is, to win,\nyou need 50% plus one, that means half the electorate plus one vote. And\nsometimes it\'s not even a majority, sometimes it\'s just a plurality. So this\nis about polarization. It is about division, and it is about wedge issues.\n\n(He\'s the NH guy who got caught and sent to jail, who now has a book out)\n\nhttp://www.democracynow.org/2008/1/8/how_to_rig_an_election_convicted\n'
