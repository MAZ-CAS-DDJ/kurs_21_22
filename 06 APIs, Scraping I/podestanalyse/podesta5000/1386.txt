If you do have a line to Warren that could enable you to ask her to encourage Sheila to confer, that's an ideal way to figure that out.   And Dan, like I said before, she may be reacting to not hearing from HRC herself.   Again, Warren or perhaps John could talk to her.    When she's at Pew, she sits in one of my dept's offices.  So I'll ask if I see her.  But she is often on the road like she says.   Finally another angle might be by looking up The Systemic Risk Council that she formed and see if there's a friend of ours on its board who could engage her.   There must be at least one!!   \n\nSent from my iPhone\nTamera Luzzatto\nWork:  202-540-6501\nCell: 202-329-6864\n\n\n> On Feb 10, 2015, at 11:31 PM, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com> wrote:\n> \n> John & Tamera, flagging for you this somewhat odd message from Sheila Bair.  \n> Backstory: Bair was high on our list for policy outreach for some time.
