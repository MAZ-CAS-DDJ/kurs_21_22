Invitation to be not for attribution.  Just saw it so may be too late.\r\n\r\nI am sensitive to not criticize or raise questions about how WH appears to be organized for various reasons.\r\n\r\nI\'d be inclined to say what matters is that there be the discipline to make sure all relevant voices get heard on key decisions -- in the room or in paper flow -- and that can work with many organizational strucutres if there is commitment to having a good informed debate and then faithful implemetation of the president\'s decisions.  All signs from outside are that this appears to be the President-elect\'s style.  Given how ambitious the agenda, urgency, etc. the various leads on policy are necessary and essential to drive change on so many fronts simultaneously.  Not sure I fully believe it but it is what I would say.\r\n\r\nJohn -- that raise any issues for you (co-author and transition chair).  I can skip replying if it is problemmatic.  Any suggestions for things to watch?\r\n\r\nJen/D -- other thoughts?\r\n\r\nSarah Rosen Wartell\r\nActing CEO and Executive Vice President\r\nswartell@americanprogress.org<mailto:swartell@americanprogress.org>\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Michael Scherer [mailto:michael_scherer@timemagazine.com]\r\nSent: Wednesday, January 14, 2009 10:25 AM\r\nTo: Sarah Wartell\r\nSubject: Re: Quick fact check\r\n\r\nHey Sarah, Do you have a chance to talk today, not for attribution? I am working on a story about the new structure of the White House, have been reading your pieces in the Change for America book, and am interested in your thoughts on what the Obama White House will be doing differently, why it will be better, what are the most interesting things to track, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nMichael Scherer\r\nTIME\r\n(202) 861 4092 office\r\n(202) 277 8845 cell\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 11/18/08 6:22 PM, "Sarah Wartell" <swartell@americanprogress.org> wrote:\r\n\r\nThanks!!!!!!!\r\n--------------------------\r\nSent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Original Message -----\r\nFrom: michael_scherer@timemagazine.com <michael_scherer@timemagazine.com>\r\nTo: Sarah Wartell\r\nSent: Tue Nov 18 18:20:36 2008\r\nSubject: Re: Quick fact check\r\n\r\nOk.

Sometimes that is fine. But some of the activities/content of CAPAF -- thinkprogress, wonk room, mic check, and some of capaf analyses of candidate policy proposals -- are not appropriate for CAP as a 501c3 only capaf, a c4.  In fact, if you inadvertantly describe any political advocacy as cap when it was capaf, the irs rulings tell us we need to send you a letter (yours whether or not to publish) correcting the record.  I try to be careful when talking to always say "capaf\'s ... " Or cap"s.. about particiular products. But if you were not sensitized to the issue it might not end up in your notes.  I thought i sent a follow up that day but may not have hit send.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes use "American Progress" sometimes to describe the two organizations together but when mentioning the specific political advocacy are careful to always try to say it was action fund.\r\n\r\nSorry to be confusing.\r\n--------------------------\r\nSent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Original Message -----\r\nFrom: michael_scherer@timemagazine.com <michael_scherer@timemagazine.com>\r\nTo: Sarah Wartell\r\nSent: Tue Nov 18 18:02:44 2008\r\nSubject: Re: Quick fact check\r\n\r\nMy super secret source was insistent on your gender forwardness.\r\n\r\nI mention both cap and cap af.
