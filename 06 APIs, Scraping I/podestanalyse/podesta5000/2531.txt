john.podesta@gmail.comb'Mike & Co. --\n\nHouse and Senate leaders are pursuing different legislative strategies as Congress continues to make progress on a fiscal year 2017 budget for the U.S. government.  \n\nOne chamber is processing down the good governance path of regular order, with Appropriations subcommittee hearings by the dozens already held and a date certain for a budget resolution mark-up.  The other chamber has scheduled and cancelled a Budget Committee mark-up and has not rescheduled it. \n\nWhich is which and why?  What is at stake?  More below.\n\nBest,\n\nDana\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nRegular Budget Order or None at All?\n\nThe divide is a result of two unrelated factors -- the curious vote-a-rama and reconciliation features of the budget making process and the deep divide regarding strategic objectives within the GOP between the views that \n\n   \xe2\x80\xa2  the GOP should pass a budget through regular order to demonstrate its ability to govern and \n\n   \xe2\x80\xa2  the GOP should throw out the Obama-Boehner spending deal and enact a cost-slashing budget in line with the sequestration levels.  \n\nThe major bone of contention is the spending deal reached last year between President Obama and former Speaker Boehner, which increases spending roughly $30 billion this year.  While Senate Republicans seem increasingly content to abide by that deal House leadership has had no end of trouble getting their colleagues to toe the line.\n\nRyan, Price, and Brady (not to mention their Senate counterparts) are advocating the former while the House Freedom Caucus insists on the latter of these two approaches, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a public and embarrassing battle for the House GOP so far.  In any other year the House Speaker may look for cooperation from Democrats, especially to save his promise for passing a budget.  But considering the political nature of the promise, to show that the GOP can govern, it might look like a surrender to turn to Democrats for help.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Chair Kevin Brady has tried to break the stalemate by releasing a series of tax bills touted as a \xe2\x80\x9cbudget savings\xe2\x80\x9d package.  The legislation will cut $16 billion in two years and $98 billion over ten.  The bills are expected to be market up this week.  \n\nThe Brady bill comes after the Freedom Caucus balked at a deal by Tom Price which would pass a budget resolution sticking to last year\xe2\x80\x99s deal while allowing a separate vote to cut $30 billion in mandatory spending.  Holdouts against the Price deal claimed that they would not accept any deal which included passing a budget in line with the Obama-Boehner deal; Brady\xe2\x80\x99s legislation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t touch that issue at all, and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been made contingent on Freedom Caucus cooperation.  It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see how this package will sway the hardliners.\n\nMeanwhile in the Senate\n\nSenate Republicans have signaled they\xe2\x80\x99re unlikely to act on a budget before the House, placing more pressure on Ryan et al.   So why are Senate Republicans so amenable to skipping out on a budget?  A number of their colleagues are up for reelection in difficult states, and being forced to cast embarrassing votes may hurt their chances.  Senate procedures allow 30 hours of open debate and unlimited amendments to budget resolutions, the so called \xe2\x80\x9cvote-a-rama,\xe2\x80\x9d so it\xe2\x80\x99s a virtual certainty that politically sensitive votes will come up.\n\nSenator Richard Shelby has noted that a budget wasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary since the Senate already had a total discretionary spending figure to shoot for.  Senator Corker echoed his statement, calling the budget \xe2\x80\x9can unbelievable hoax\xe2\x80\x9d that he could live without.\n\nIn a move sure to upset budget hawks, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said of the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming appropriations bill: \xe2\x80\x9cwe will be using the top-line that was agreed to last year \xe2\x80\xa6 We have the top-lines for this year and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go forward with appropriations.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nConsequences of Failure\n\nIf the Senate and House don\xe2\x80\x99t pass identical budgets then the GOP will lose its ability to pursue budget reconciliation, through which budget-related legislation can move through the Senate on a simple majority and avoid filibusters.  This was used last year to pass legislation repealing large swaths of ACA, though it was promptly vetoed by Obama.  The GOP would surely like to have that option available again to take one last swing at the outgoing administration.\n\nThe GOP has to ask itself: is it worth losing reconciliation to make a stand against spending levels?  It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe that the majority will ever think they gain more ground politically by giving up on reconciliation in favor of making a budget statement.  After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to make failure look good.  \n\n_________________________\n\nFuture/Recent Updates\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Monday --  Budget Irresolution \n\xe2\x80\xa2   Tuesday --  Fed: Regulatory Update\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Wednesday -- Fed: Monetary Update\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Thursday --  The Fiduciary Rule\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Friday -- Pre-Recess Review\n\n  \xe2\x80\xa2   ERI/Housing\n  \xe2\x80\xa2   EU/US Derivatives Deal\n  \xe2\x80\xa2   Pension Crisis\n\nRegular Budget Order or None  (Mar. 14)\nTax Bills on the Hill (Mar. 11)\nSenate Banking Nominations (Mar. 10)\nSurvey of the SIFI Landscape  (Mar. 9)\nMichigan and the Meaning of Flint  (Mar. 8) Puerto Rico\'s Debt Crisis  (Mar. 5)\nMunicipal Finance Caucus  (Mar. 4) \nFlint Bill:  Provisions & Prospects (Mar. 2) \nTop Tax Bills Handicapped  (Feb. 24)\nBigger than the Budget Battle  (Feb. 23)\nInfrastructure Finance Update  (Feb. 18) \nDoes DFA Fail on Too Big to Fail?

Brady\'s gambit reflects the growing buyers remorse regarding the omnibus agreement within the Freedom Caucus.  Hard liners have objected to the spending levels set in the Obama-Boehner deal; this package is meant to buy their cooperation in the larger negotiations between parties.\n\nIt\'s one of a number of tax proposals getting attention and generating debate on the Hill.  A review of the tax issues on the table is below. \n\nGood weekends all.  Don\'t hesitate to let me know if there\'s an issue you think should be covered in an upcoming update. \n\nBest,\n\nDana\n\n_______________________________\n\n\n\nTax Legislation in 2016\n\nTax reform advocates entered 2016 with a great deal of fanfare \xe2\x80\x93 optimistic talk of comprehensive, bipartisan, pro-growth tax reform abounded.  What\xe2\x80\x99s happened since New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day?  A lot of interesting proposals have come forward to fix critical but narrow issues, and the bold talk of comprehensive reform has remained just that \xe2\x80\x93 talk.  \n\nGiven the developments since Paul Ryan and Kevin Brady called for comprehensive tax reform \xe2\x80\x93 Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s death, the rise of the Donald, and the stalled budget \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that sweeping legislation will take form.  More likely we\xe2\x80\x99ll see smaller bills focused on particular issues.\n\nInternational \n\nPresident Obama, Senator Wyden, and Rep Brady, long ago hammered home the need for international tax reform.  Their proposals include finding a way to repatriate foreign-held profits of US-based multinationals, dealing with corporate inversions, and setting up a new international tax code.\n\nThe key to reaching an agreement on the proposals below likely lies in determining where revenue will go after foreign earning are brought back to the US.  Brady has said before that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t support a proposal in which any tax is levied on foreign earnings, while Wyden says the opposite \xe2\x80\x93 revenue is a requirement.  There is so much pressure for this to happen it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe they can\xe2\x80\x99t compromise. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2   taxing foreign earnings:  Competing proposals exist between parties.  President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s FY17 budget includes a 14 percent repatriation holiday with 19 percent tax thereafter on all foreign earnings.  Brady has said he\xe2\x80\x99d rather these earnings come home with no tax attached, so that they can be used for investment.  Sen. Wyden proposes that the income be repatriated, taxed, and the revenue be used for infrastructure development.  A recent bill by Schumer and Brown (below) would tax the foreign income of any company that moves its headquarters overseas.  \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  preventing inversions:   Sen. Wyden proposes making the ownership minimum for a corporate inversion 50% (current law is 15%).  Reps Levin and Van Hollen have announced legislation to prevent \xe2\x80\x9cearnings stripping\xe2\x80\x9d by reducing the tax preference for interest payments.  \n\nSens. Schumer and Brown have announced they will introduce two pieces of legislation to tackle inversions \xe2\x80\x93 one to impose an exit tax on companies moving their address overseas, and another to limit earnings stripping.  The exit tax proposal enforces the full 35 percent tax rate on all foreign earnings for companies that move abroad; their earnings stripping legislation limits the tax-deducibility of interest payments to 25 oercent, down from the current 50 percent.  \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  territorial system: Brady has mentioned repeatedly that the US must adopt a territorial system to remain competitive, whereby earnings from abroad are not taxed in the US.  It\xe2\x80\x99s been a perennial favorite of Republicans but likely will remain a non-starter for Democrats.  \n\nCorporate Tax Reform\n\nMany issues solved in international tax reform proposals would affect corporate tax reform efforts \xe2\x80\x93 often the two are considered indelibly linked.  Prominent policymakers agree that the corporate rate must be lowered, but the final size of the tax and how it is aimed differ.\n\nRepublican proposals generally have rates between 0 and 20 percent, with Democrats above those at 24 percent and 28 percent for Wyden and Obama respectively.  New rules on depreciations of assets \xe2\x80\x93 specifically replacing the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery Systems with something less generous \xe2\x80\x93 are being floated as well.  Ending the tax-deductibility of debt is a dual-purpose proposal \xe2\x80\x93 useful for preventing inversions (see above) as well as encouraging businesses to fund themselves using equity rather than credit.\n\nEarned Income Tax Credit\n\nA favorite of both Democrats and Republicans \xe2\x80\x93 and notable of Paul Ryan and President Obama.  They were rumored to discuss the issue during their first meeting, this past February, after Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s ascension to Speaker.  \n\nThe EITC is a part of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposal for this year; he suggests to expand the EITC for childless workers and create a $500 \xe2\x80\x9csecond earner\xe2\x80\x9d tax credit. The total cost would be $150 billion. Ryan has proposed something that is very similar. In addition to that, there have been five recent congressional proposals (introduced by Senators Sherrod Brown and Richard Durbin, by Rep. Richard Neal, by Rep. Charles Rangel, by Rep. Danny Davis, and by Senators Patty Murray, Jack Reed, and Sherrod Brown) that would substantially strengthen the EITC for childless workers. All of them, including Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s and Obama\xe2\x80\x99s, would lower the eligibility age to 21, and all would raise the maximum credit \xe2\x80\x94 the Obama and Ryan proposals to about $1,000 and the other proposals to somewhat higher amounts.\n\nThe recent focus on the issue makes it likely that something will be done on it soon. If Ryan and Obama can work together on this, it will be a bipartisan light in the gridlocked darkness. \n\nCarried Interest \n\nSenator Tammy Baldwin has released a proposal to tax carried interest as a regular income rather than capital gains.  Historically this has been a particularly divisive issue, with lawmakers on the right refusing to entertain the idea.  However, recently Republicans have begun to soften on this position \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps after seeing the populist sentiment inspired by their presidential candidates\xe2\x80\x99 own call to end the loophole.  \n\nBaldwin released her proposal in conjunction with Sander Levin, who released a version of the bill in the House as well.  \n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAny piece of tax reform legislation put forward which reduces revenues would have to find a way to offset its costs.  In light of the Obama-Boehner deal on spending limits for 2016 this may be a particularly important issue \xe2\x80\x93 especially as GOP leaders try to keep their right flank in order as they tussle over the spending rules.  Conversely, any reform which raises revenue will face strong calls from Republicans to fund tax cuts, and from Democrats to fund infrastructure or other initiatives.\n\nAs the year drags on the prospects for comprehensive reform dwindle further \xe2\x80\x93 they were never that great to begin with, despite enthusiasm from party leaders.  Even the more modest proposals laid out here may be too divisive to survive, especially in a political environment like this one.  Senators can\xe2\x80\x99t be blamed for focusing their efforts on Supreme Court nominees, the budget, their own party candidates, and more.\n\n_________________________________\n\nFuture/Recent Updates\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Wednesday -- SIFI Landscape\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Thursday--  Financial Nominations \n\xe2\x80\xa2   Friday -- Update on Tax Bills\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Monday --  Budget Irresolution \n\xe2\x80\xa2   Tuesday --\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2   ERI/Housing\n\xe2\x80\xa2   EU/US Derivatives Deal\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Pension Crisis\n\nTax Bills on the Hill (Mar. 11)\nSenate Banking Nominations (Mar. 10)\nSurvey of the SIFI Landscape  (Mar. 9)\nMichigan and the Meaning of Flint  (Mar. 8) Puerto Rico\'s Debt Crisis  (Mar. 5)\nMunicipal Finance Caucus  (Mar. 4) \nFlint Bill:  Provisions & Prospects (Mar. 2) \nTop Tax Bills Handicapped  (Feb. 24)\nBigger than the Budget Battle  (Feb. 23)\nInfrastructure Finance Update  (Feb. 18) \nDoes DFA Fail on Too Big to Fail?

The former MIT Professor of Applied Economics and Brookings Fellow has served in half a dozen senior White House and Treasury positions.  \n\nSen. Shelby acted with alacrity: \xe2\x80\x9cGovernor Brainard\xe2\x80\x99s contributions to Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign call into question the political independence of the board,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in an emailed statement from his press office. \n\nMeanwhile, the same Senate Banking Committee Chair has announced he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to hold hearings for some of the 16 nominations -- reviewed below -- which have languished under his tenure. \n\nBest,\n\nDana\n\n__________________________________\n\nUpdate:  Senate Banking Nom Queue\n\nSenate Banking has the ignominious distinction of being the only Senate committee to have not acted on a single nominee before it in the 114th Congress.  There are currently 16 nominations waiting for Committee action.  These aren\xe2\x80\x99t small time positions -- the logjam includes nominees to the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Governors and senior Treasury, SEC, FDIC, and Ex-Im posts. \n\nFor months, Chairman Shelby has defended his Committee\xe2\x80\x99s inaction by citing two issues -- he was facing a live primary threat and President Obama has not yet nominated a Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision, a prerequisite. \n\nLogjam Lifting at Long Last?\n\nShelby\'s primary behind him, he has scheduled a March 15 hearing for two SEC nominees, Lisa Fairfax and Hester Peirce.  Fairfax teaches at George Washington University and Peirce is a senior research fellow at George Mason\xe2\x80\x99s Mercatus Center. The Committee will not be considering either of the two Federal Reserve nominees, nor Adam Szubin, nominated for Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s top post in terrorism and financial crimes.\n\nEven if the Committee confirms the three nominee scheduled for its next hearing, it will have hardly made a dent in the queue. \n\nNominations have continued despite the dearth of hearings on them.  On March 3, President Obama nominated Brian Quintenz and Chris Brummer to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  Quintenz, a Republican, works for Saeculum Capital in D.C. and Brummer, a Democrat, is a professor at Georgetown University Law School.\n\nBacklog at Banking\n\nWith 16 unfilled vacancies before it (Messrs. Quintenz and Brummer will make it  18), the Banking Committee has its work cut out for it.  The Chairman\xe2\x80\x99s refusal  to consider any Fed nominee until Obama nominates a vice chair for supervision means that those two critical positions may remain unfilled longest.   Key vacancies exist at the Export-Import Bank as well, because the board does not have enough members to reach quorum it is unable to approve loans in excess of $10 million, severely hampering its impact on export promotion deals.\n\nWith so many nominees waiting to receive a hearing and the number legislative days the Senate remaining this session rapidly dwindling, it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that the  Democrats on Banking have been pushing harder than ever for the Chairman to move forward quickly.  \n\nIn a letter sent to Sen. Shelby, Ranking Member Sherrod Brown and his colleagues wrote \xe2\x80\x9cFor more than a year, the committee has failed to carry out one of its basic duties \xe2\x80\xa6 Failure to act impairs agencies\xe2\x80\x99 and offices\xe2\x80\x99 ability to fulfill all of their functions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe pending list includes the nominations below:\n\nFederal Reserve\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Allan R.

Joined by the heads of the Fed, the FDIC, and the CFPB, Obama declared \xe2\x80\x9cI want to dispel the notion that exists both on the left and on the right that somehow, after the crisis, nothing happened," he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe did not just rebuild this, we rebuilt it better, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve rebuilt it stronger.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe has a strong argument.  You can\'t prove a negative and we will never know how many financial crises were averted by Dodd-Frank.  But metrics bear out the view that Americans and the economy have less to fear today from the Systemically Significant Financial Institutions (SIFIs) than at any time since the turn of the millennium.  More on the regulatory circumstances of SIFIs below.  \n\nBest,\n\nDana\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nA Survey of the SIFI Landscape\n\nThe landscape for the eight SIFIs today -- Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, State Street, and Wells Fargo -- is worth looking at from various perspectives.  Presidential candidates on both sides have made a point of criticizing \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big to fail\xe2\x80\x9d banks, court proceedings are challenging regulators powers\', members of Congress are debating whether to loosen Dodd-Frank Act SIFI rules, and a current Federal Reserve Bank president has spoken out in favor of breaking them up.  But do SIFIs pose the same threat they did in 2008?\n\nThe Power of DFA\n\nPresident Obama hasn\xe2\x80\x99t remained silent in the face of criticism of DFA.  After the Monday summit, Obama said that critics are spreading \xe2\x80\x9ccynicism\xe2\x80\x9d:  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is popular \xe2\x80\xa6 to suggest that the crisis happened and nothing changed.  That is not true.\xe2\x80\x9d  The President cited the 14 million new jobs created since his inauguration, proof, he said, that sensible regulations on Wall Street don\xe2\x80\x99t stifle business growth.\n\nTwo major business news stories from 2015 support the President\xe2\x80\x99s view:  \n\n\xc2\xb7   General Electric continued to sell off GE Capital, its $42 billion investment arm, hoping to exit SIFI status in Q1 2016 as a result of its divestiture.  \n\n\xc2\xb7   MetLife has been embroiled in a legal battle with the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) since the regulator announced in December 2014 that the insurance company was considered a SIFI \xe2\x80\x93 arguments were heard in New York this January. \n\n70 percent of DFA has been implemented by the regulatory agencies since it was passed.   Despite the constraints on SIFIs, they have by and large adapted well, making adjustments faster, earlier and more successfully\xe2\x80\x9d than their overseas counterparts. \n\n\xc2\xb7   SIFIs now hold much more capital now than they did before the crisis \xe2\x80\x93 to the tune of $700 billion in additional capital, twice the amount prior to it\n\n\xc2\xb7   SIFIs have three times the liquidity they had before the crisis\n\n\xc2\xb7   Derivatives clearing houses force transparency on SIFI speculation, preventing over-exposure\n\n\xc2\xb7    SIFIs now post collateral on their derivatives trades\n\n\xc2\xb7    SIFIs submit to rigorous stress testing by the Federal Reserve and FDIC \n\n\xc2\xb7    SIFIs are being forced to draft \xe2\x80\x9cliving wills,\xe2\x80\x9d which have already forced some to streamline or simplify so they can wind down without requiring a bailout\n\nCongressional Update\n\nCongress is split between those who want to reduce regulatory pressure on big banks and those who would rather see it ramped up.  Sen. Shelby, Senate Banking Chair, introduced the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015, a grab-bag of exceptions and exemptions from regulations, mostly for banks with between $50 and $500 billion in assets.  In a similar vein, Sens Warner, Portman, and Collins introduced the Independent Agency Regulatory Analysis Act to require that regulators undertake a cost-benefit analysis of any rules they wish to implement.\n\nOn the flip side, Sens. McCain and Warren\xe2\x80\x99s 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act proposes to split commercial and investment banks in a bid to finally kill off the TBTF problem.  Sens. Warren and Vitter teamed up early in 2015 to introduce a package of amendments to the Federal Reserve Act \xe2\x80\x93- that bill notably would set forward stricter regulations when an entity is considered insolvent, and therefore ineligible for Federal Reserve loans, as well as require that the Fed lend money to distressed institutions at market rates.\n\nThe Regulators\' Agenda \n\nUnder Basel III requirements for large banks to satisfy Liquidity Coverage Ratios (LCR) were adopted by a number of national regulators, including the Federal Reserve.  While the Fed has floated a rule change allowing some municipal bonds to count as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA), that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped Rep. Luke Messer from proposing HR 2209 to force regulators allow a greater share of munis to count as HQLA (see Update, Feb. 18).\n\nThe Fed is also working on implementing a rule on Single-Counterparty Credit Limits (SCCL), setting boundaries on credit exposure between large banks or major counterparties.  The rule is meant to prevent banks from becoming overexposed to other financial institutions, preventing them from taking overly large losses in the event that the counterparty fails.  Analysts suspect that firms are nearly $100 billion over the limits imposed by this rule, but Yellen says it is necessary to set a \xe2\x80\x9cbright line\xe2\x80\x9d on credit exposure.\n\nSIFIs Moving Forward\n\nThere is no doubt that the upcoming MetLife ruling will be a critical pivot point for how regulators interact with SIFIs.  If the FSOC is required to retract the firm\xe2\x80\x99s SIFI status it will open the regulator up for a whole slew of challenges from other banks and institutions.  The fate of Congressional proposals to restrict regulator\xe2\x80\x99s efforts, either by determining rules for them or by burdening them with regulations of their own, should be seen as the start of a potential sea change in the regulatory climate.  During his Monday meeting, President Obama warned of this: "If there is a significant challenge in terms of regulating Wall Street and regulating our financial sector it is primarily coming from certain members of Congress who are consistently pressuring independent regulators to back off.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt is not a bad time to be a SIFI in America \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly much better to be one now than in 2010.  While DFA has forced restructuring and streamlining to occur, events like the GE Capital sell-off may prove to be exceptions that prove the rule rather than the new normal for SIFIs, especially if MetLife wins its case against regulators.  President Obama was right to point to Congress as the cause of regulatory gridlock; the political will seen after the economic collapse has largely evaporated, giving SIFIs far more breathing room and opening up opportunities to push through \xe2\x80\x9cregulatory reform\xe2\x80\x9d measures.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nUpcoming/Recent Updates\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Thurs --  Financial Reg.

There had to be a debate in Flint because there had to be a debate about it... and the Secretary deserves far more credit than she\'s getting for making sure it happened. \n\nIn Washington, the Senate is readying to vote on a bipartisan package for drinking water aid.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not a slam dunk, however, as Mike Lee has maintained a hold on the bill, saying political grandstanding is taking the place of policy.  More on all this below. \n\nBest,\n\nDana\n______________________________________\n\n\nFlint -- Bills and Broad Strokes\n\nThe Michigan legislature approved in January a $28 million appropriation to provide immediate aid to Flint.  Some critics maintain that the need to do so demonstrates the sorry condition of the state\xe2\x80\x99s tax policy.  \n\nThe tax base in Flint was eroded significantly during the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s and 90\xe2\x80\x99s as industry jobs left and the population fell.  To deal with the resulting fiscal imbalance the Flint city manager was instructed to cut costs \xe2\x80\x93 he did so partly by switching the source of Flint\xe2\x80\x99s drinking water. The broad and deep cuts to state and local budgets affected basic public services most profoundly.  Now, as a direct cause of these cuts, the residents of Flint are grappling with an issue no American ever considered possible \xe2\x80\x93 they do not have access to fresh drinking water.\n\nFor all the talk of federal aid in infrastructure financing there must be a place made for regular tax payers.  These people bear a significant portion of direct funding for infrastructure projects both in their states and municipalities.  When those tax revenues are redirected, or when state spending is cut to the point that basic services can\xe2\x80\x99t be provided then taxpayers are right to question what, in fact, their taxes are paying for.  \n\nCongressional update:\n\nAt the insistence of Democrats, the Flint agreement has been attached to a Senate energy bill introduced by Sen. Murkowski, S. 2012, which is next in line in the Senate following the opioid addiction bill.  The energy bill will be voted on soon, providing that things moves quickly (not a sure bet, since Dems may want to vote on certain amendments to the opioid bill).  Despite these potential hang ups, Senate leadership hopes to wrap up the energy bill by the end of the week \xe2\x80\x93 giving them some breathing room before the Senate adjourns for Easter recess by March 21. \n\nWhile Sen. Cruz lifted his hold on the bill last week, Mike Lee has continued to block movement on the legislation.  Sen. Lee is claiming that federal aid is not necessary to deal with Flint: \xe2\x80\x9cThe state of Michigan has an enormous budget surplus this year and a large rainy-day fund, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars," the Senator said in a statement.\n\nFlint agreement:\n\nThe bill provides $250 million to assist the residents of Flint, Michigan and other American cities experiencing critical problems with their water supplies by increasing funding for Drinking Water Act State Revolving Funds and provide start-up funding for the new Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act.  It includes:\n\n\xc2\xb7       $100 million for Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs) accessible by any state with a drinking water emergency.  It requires states to submit plans explaining how the money will be spent to address the emergency before funding is provided.   Funds that remain after 18 months will be distributed to all states under the existing SRF formula. \n\n\xc2\xb7       $70 million in funding to back secured loans made under the new Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA).  A federal investment of $70 million could support secured loans of up to $4.2 billion to address water and wastewater infrastructure needs across the country, according to Sen. Inhofe\xe2\x80\x99s office.  All states and all communities with clean water and drinking water infrastructure needs are eligible for this assistance. \n\n\xc2\xb7       $50 million for various in authorized health programs for national use to address and prevent impacts from exposure to lead. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlint\xe2\x80\x9d is more than Flint\n\nFlint is a crisis of governance \xe2\x80\x93 there is a disconnect in the relationship between citizens and government, and it bridges every demographic.  Just as the poor drink water so do the wealthy, and when a service as basic and fundamental is undermined to the point that an entire town of nearly a hundred thousands is poisoned by its own government, voters will express themselves, given the chance. \n\nResidents, customers, consumers, taxpayers \xe2\x80\x93- citizens at the end of the day  \xe2\x80\x93- are seeing their government in a significantly different light and thus far are voting differently this year accordingly. Donald Trump would not likely be able to put Michigan in play without this new perspective animation politics in Michigan as much as anywhere. \n\n_____________________________________\n\nUpcoming/Recent Updates\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Tues --  Financial Reg.

Once again, the US economy maintained strong job growth without wage gains.  Wages fell 0.1 percent in February, but 242,000 positions were added to the economy, marking 72 months of uninterrupted job gains \xe2\x80\x93 the longest streak on record. \n\nAdditionally, labor participation rose by 1.5 million Americans since November \xe2\x80\x93 making it the highest it has been in 16 years (62.9 percent of the overall share of Americans).\n\nThe report from Puerto Rico is not as sunny.  The territory is still waiting on a Congressional bill designed to handle the ongoing debt crisis on the island.  More  below.\n\nBest,\n\nDana\n\n______________________________________\n\nPuerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s Time Bomb\n\nThe Puerto Rican debt crisis has been an ongoing concern for both Congress, Wall Street and the Obama administration for some years now \xe2\x80\x93 the territory\xe2\x80\x99s bond ratings have been steadily dropping into the junk category and fell from A- in 2005 to CCC+ last April.  At the heart of the matter is $70 billion in bonds that Puerto Rico owes and says it cannot pay on. \n\nBecause Puerto Rican bonds are tax exempt in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, making them incredibly popular investments for mutual funds, pensioners, and big banks.  Over 20 percent of mutual funds in the United States hold at least some Puerto Rican bonds, with $11.3 billion in portfolio, with a further $15 billion in bonds held by hedge funds.  Now that the territory\xe2\x80\x99s bonds are in the \xe2\x80\x9cjunk\xe2\x80\x9d category, pension funds and insurance firms are unable to hold them any longer.\n\nThe diverse list of bond holders has thrown a wrench into the plans of those who would rather allow Puerto Rico to default on its obligations \xe2\x80\x93 something which would require legislative action (the territory doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have that luxury, unlike states).  If Puerto Rico is allowed to renege on its contractual agreements, the argument goes, then it creates a moral hazard for other entities to do the same rather than make the tough choices necessary to honor their obligations.  The fact that many of these bonds are essentially held by ordinary Americans (through mutual funds and pensions) makes the argument all that stronger for many representatives.  A state hasn\xe2\x80\x99t declared bankruptcy since Arkansas did so in 1933.\n\nMoral hazard is inherent in a debt restructuring deal; here, the path for Puerto Rico toward capital markets after anything of the sort would still be an especially painful one (see: Argentina).  Additionally, there are few serious proposals to grant the island full Chapter 9 status.  Most opt instead for some form of negotiated haircut agreement combined with extending maturities on the bonds; these proposals are likely to succeed, considering Puerto Rico is almost certainly unable to maintain its bond payment schedule without a restructuring agreement.\n\nAdministration Position\n\nTestifying before the House Committee on Natural Resources on Feb 25, Treasury official Antonio Weiss warned lawmakers that Puerto Rico needs \xe2\x80\x9can immediate solution\xe2\x80\x9d if it\xe2\x80\x99s to survive past May 1, when a $470 million bond payment is due.  Soon after that, on July 1, a $1.9 billion bond payment will come due as well \xe2\x80\x93 Puerto Rican representatives have already declared they cannot meet those payments without assistance.\n\nWeiss laid out the administration\xe2\x80\x99s two-part plan: first the territory must be allowed to restructure its debt obligations, second a fiscal oversight board should be established to assist the island with managing its finances.  Importantly, Weiss stopped short of advocating for bankruptcy protection for Puerto Rico and told the committee that \xe2\x80\x9can advisory board is not adequate to do the job\xe2\x80\x9d alone.  \n\nHouse Democrats voiced concern over the financial oversight board, Rep. Luis Guti\xc3\xa9rrez: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s a joint responsibility, but it seems to me that all of the responsibility is being weighed on the people of Puerto Rico.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\nMeanwhile Republicans claimed that any plan to restructure Puerto Rican debt was a non-starter; a few hours after the hearing the Republican Study Committee announced it would oppose any plan including such a provision.  "Changing the rules mid-game would be unfair to Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s creditors who entered into these arrangements with agreed upon terms and would delegitimize future transactions," said RSC Chairman Bill Flores.\n\nPolicy Options\n\nUntil recently the two parties have maintained starkly contrasting views on how to best deal with Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s debt crisis \xe2\x80\x93 Democrats have pushed for a forced debt restructuring, with some calling for the island to be granted Chapter 9 bankruptcy protections, meanwhile Republicans called for a financial oversight council to make the tough fiscal decisions necessary for Puerto Rico to maintain its debt obligations without reneging on its agreements.\n\nThe administration, through Weiss, has advocated a middle of the road approach. By adopting both proposals and avoiding the further edges of each (no bankruptcy, and no unaccountable board staffed by Wall Streeters), the administration hopes to find compromise between each group.  And it seems like it might work.\n\nFinding Compromise\n\nRecently, however, the conservative stance against debt restructuring has lessened \xe2\x80\x93 with some Republicans saying that they could support a PR bill as long as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include Chapter 9 bankruptcy.  House Natural Resources chair Bob Bishop has been working on a bill for Puerto Rico that does include some element of debt restructuring, and recently said \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure RSC will be satisfied with what we do \xe2\x80\xa6 to say that some element of [debt restructuring] could be in there, yeah.\xe2\x80\x9d          \nThe House is still sticking to its end of March deadline set by Speaker Ryan for putting forward a final bill on Puerto Rico on the floor for a vote. \n\n_____________________________________\n\nUpcoming/Recent Updates\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Thurs -- Municipal Finance Caucus\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Fri -- Puerto Rico\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Mon -- FY17\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Tues -- 13 D Regs\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Wed --  TBD\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2   SBC Nominations\n\xe2\x80\xa2   ERI/Housing\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Intl Tax Reform\n\xe2\x80\xa2   EU/US Derivatives Deal\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Pension Crisis\n\nMichigan and the Meaning of Flint (Mar 8) Puerto Rico\'s Debt Crisis  (Mar. 5)\nMunicipal Finance Caucus  (Mar. 4) \nFlint Bill:  Provisions & Prospects (Mar. 2) \nTop Tax Bills Handicapped  (Feb. 24)\nBigger than the Budget Battle  (Feb. 23)\nInfrastructure Finance Update  (Feb. 18) \nDoes DFA Fail on Too Big to Fail?

If you\'d like an update or have any questions, please let me know. \n\nMeanwhile, amid the most fractious campaign in recent history comes an initiative in Congress that sounds, well, incongruous with the cacophany.  A broad and bipartisan group of House members is behind the official launch of a caucus this week dedicated to protecting and expanding the tax exemption enjoyed by municipal debt. \n\nYou have to start somewhere and why not with incentives to address the nation\'s long-neglected infrastructure with tax breaks -- about the only kind of stimulus and jobs measure that can garner bipartisan support?   More on the new Municipal Finance Caucus below.  \n\nBest,\n\nDana\n\n_____________________________________\nA New Caucus\n\nOn Tuesday, Reps. Randy Hultgren and Dutch Ruppersberger announced that they have formed the Municipal Finance Caucus to protect the tax-exempt status of municipal debt and reexamine the way it is treated in financial regulations.  In 2015, Hultgren and Ruppersberger sent a letter (reprinted below) to House leadership opposing the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposed 28 percent cap on tax deductions for municipal bonds, signed by over 120 of their colleagues.  \n\nTheir announcement coincided with the National Association of State Treasurers\xe2\x80\x99 legislative conference in D.C. The same group drafted another letter, signed by more than 600 state and local officials, which urges the leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee to reject curbs to the muni exemption. \n\nWho\xe2\x80\x99s in it?\n\nRight now just the founding representatives have declared their official membership, but it\xe2\x80\x99s foreseeable that some of the 120 representatives that signed the letter to House leadership in 2015 will join as well.  It\xe2\x80\x99s also seen a s likely that some Senators will want to join the caucus, but the founders haven\'t made clear if bicameral membership is a priority.\n\nIs it Bipartisan?\n\nSince 2013 Hultgren and Ruppersberger have led bipartisan efforts to draft letters of support for municipal bonds.  The signatories to these letters include members from both sides of the aisle.  Rep. Ruppersberger focuses mostly on local government and is pretty moderate. Rep. Hultgren is a more orthodox conservative Republican. \n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the Purpose?\n\nThe Caucus plans to defend municipal bonds\xe2\x80\x99 tax exempt status and advocate for regulatory changes which favor those bonds.  Proposals to limit the tax-exempt status of these bonds have been floated in recent years. \n\nIn addition to calling for the bonds to maintain their tax preferred status, the Caucus will push for the passage of HR 2209, legislation considering municipal bonds as a High Quality Liquid Asset (HQLA) \xe2\x80\x93 a particularly contentious issue because of the disagreement over how flexible these liquidity rules should be from a systemic risk perspective. \n\nPositions Taken to Date\n\nThe Caucus founders have opposed Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 2015 proposal to cap municipal bond tax exemption at 28 percent. Rep. Hultgren is also a co-sponsor of HR 2209 \xe2\x80\x93 the bill to set the liquidity for municipal bond assets at Level 2A (see Update, Feb. 18).  Hultgren said the liquidity rules are an example of how regulators misunderstand municipal bonds, specifically the frequent serial structure of the their issuances.\n\nMany investors flock to municipal bonds for security. But some federal regulators trying to shore up the banking system aren\'t convinced the bonds would be easy to sell in a crisis. \n\nDivision of Opinion\n\nDivision of opinion on HR 2099 falls along unusual lines, with Wall Street, Congress and municipal officials challenging bank regulators\' skepticism toward municipal debt.   At issue are new rules aimed at ensuring banks can raise enough cash during a financial-market meltdown to fund their operations for 30 days. The requirements mean banks have to hold more cash or securities that are easily sellable. \n\nRegulators don\'t think it is the place of Congress to second guess how they size up securities. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, at a congressional hearing Feb. 11, said legislation would "interfere with our supervisory judgments." \n\nBig banks such as Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. have sprung into action in lobbying Congress, along with municipal leaders who fret the rules will diminish bank bond-buying which could raise borrowing costs on infrastructure projects.\n\nHultgren also said the caucus will work to update the number of projects that could be financed by qualified small issue manufacturing bonds, a type of private-activity bond whose proceeds can be used to finance manufacturing facilities for small- and mid-sized manufacturers. The tax code provisions on small industrial development bonds have not been changed since the 1980s, he said. Hultgren sponsored a bill last year entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Modernizing American Manufacturing Bonds Act,\xe2\x80\x9d which was focused on expanding opportunities for qualified small issue manufacturing bonds, particularly by changing the national volume cap set by Congress. \n\nWhat can be achieved?\n\nCaucuses such as this one don\'t have the best reputation when it comes to getting things done.  But rules relating to the liquidity value of capital is one of the few policy  areas of any kind where there is bipartisan agreement.  Municipal bonds, in particular, have a universal appeal because of their direct link to local and state infrastructure projects.  At the very least, the caucus will spark some discussion about the best way to both reform existing methods for funding infrastructure investment and find new ways to fund it. \n\n_________________________________\n\nRecent/Planned Updates\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Thurs -- Municipal Finance Caucus\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Fri -- Puerto Rico\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Mon -- FY17\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Tues -- 13 D Regs\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Wed --  TBD\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2   SBC Nominations\n\xe2\x80\xa2   ERI/Housing\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Intl Tax Reform\n\xe2\x80\xa2   EU/US Derivatives Deal\n\xe2\x80\xa2   Pension Crisis\n\nMunicipal Finance Caucus  (Mar. 4) \nFlint Bill:  Provisions & Prospects (Mar. 2) \nTop Tax Bills Handicapped  (Feb. 24)\nBigger than the Budget Battle  (Feb. 23)\nInfrastructure Finance Update  (Feb. 18) \nDoes DFA Fail on Too Big to Fail?

The package has been fully paid for -- it redirects appropriations by taking funds from the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Fund, which offers loans for auto companies. \n> Does that matter?   Per Sen. Inhofe \xe2\x80\x9c[the ATVM is] a failed program that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been used in more than a year and has only issued five loans since 2008."\n> More on ATVM: The ATVM program is authorized to award up to $25 billion in loans; there is no deadline for completing such loan commitments. Congress funded the program in 2009, when it appropriated $7.5 billion to cover the subsidy cost for the $25 billion in loans, as well as $10 million for program implementation. Since the start of the program, DOE has awarded $8.4 billion in loans to five companies. As of January 2015, ATVM has $16.6 billion in remaining loan authority. No new loans have been made since 2011. Two companies \xe2\x80\x94 Fisker and the Vehicle Production Group \xe2\x80\x94 were unable to make payments on their loans, and DOE auctioned the loans off in the fall of 2013. Tesla paid off all of its loan in 2013, nine years ahead of schedule. \n> Criticisms of ATVM: The unobligated funds remaining for the program have been a point of contention in recent appropriations debates. The House has voted several times to transfer some of the unused appropriation for the ATVM subsidy costs to other purposes. None of these transfers were enacted. Other legislators have sought to expand the program. Two recent federal reports call for rescinding the program\xe2\x80\x99s unobligated balance: the FY2015 budget resolution reported by the House Budget Committee calls for outright rescission, and an April 2014 GAO report recommends Congress consider taking the same step unless DOE can generate new demand for the program.\n> Legislative Strategy:   Architects of the bipartisan deal put out a hotline request to see if anyone would object to a series of procedural moves that would split Flint aid off the energy bill (S. 2012), attach it to a House bill (H.R. 4470) sponsored by Reps. Dan Kildee and Fred Upton, allow voice votes on 30 amendments to the energy bill, and allow roll call votes on eight additional amendments. Michigan Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters said Democrats are on board, but in order to achieve unanimous consent, Republicans need to sign on. \n> Will it pass?  The Flint package and the energy bill amendments would come to a vote only after the Senate gets unanimous consent to some procedural maneuvers. Lee\'s hold went unnoticed earlier when GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz had a hold of his own, which he has now lifted. The Senate had hoped to hold votes on Flint and end debate on the energy bill as early as next week.                                                \n> What\xe2\x80\x99s Next?   Sen. Stabenow, a key leader on the bill, predicted that \xe2\x80\x9cone way or another\xe2\x80\x9d the package would be voted on in the Senate this week.  And while the House hasn\'t decided what it will do if the Flint bill clears the Senate, Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton said it would move quickly.\n> \n> The Obama administration, which declared Flint a federal emergency in January freeing up much-needed funds for the distressed city, has not issued an official stance on the Flint deal.  Early in the year the President also made available to the state of Michigan $80 million from a revolving fund for infrastructure repair and improvement.  \n> \n> A number of important events are scheduled for the month of March, listed below.\n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2   March 3 -- Flint is supposed to begin its lead service line replacement project.\n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2   March 6 -- The 7th Democratic debate will take place in the city of Flint, MI.  \n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2  March 15 --  House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will hold its next hearing on the Flint crisis.  On schedule is testimony on the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) by various policy professionals.\n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2   March 17 --  Hearings resume on SDWA oversight, with Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy scheduled to testify.\n> \n> Upcoming/Recent Updates\n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2   Wed -- Flint \n> \xe2\x80\xa2   Thurs -- Municipal Finance Caucus\n> \xe2\x80\xa2   Fri -- Puerto Rico\n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2   Budget Irresolution\n> \xe2\x80\xa2  13 D Regs\n> \xe2\x80\xa2   ERI/Housing\n> \xe2\x80\xa2   Intl Tax Reform\n> \xe2\x80\xa2   EU/US Derivatives Deal\n> \xe2\x80\xa2   Pension Crisis\n> \n> Flint Bill:  Provisions & Prospects (Mar. 2) \n> Top Tax Bills Handicapped  (Feb. 24)\n> Bigger than the Budget Battle  (Feb. 23)\n> Infrastructure Finance Update  (Feb. 18) \n> Does DFA Fail on Too Big to Fail?

The two parties will have difficulty coming to an agreement on first what to do and then how to do it.  Narrower legislation is more likely to succeed than comprehensive reform.  Most viable bills in this area:\n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2  Earnings Stripping --  On the eve of today\xe2\x80\x99s Ways and Means hearing regarding international tax reform,  ranking member Chris Van Hollen and senior member Sander Levin offered bills to constrain the practice whereby foreign parent companies extend large loans to their newly acquired U.S. partners and take advantage of the tax-deductible status of interest payment arrangement.  \n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2. Exit Tax Bills --  Bills seeking to reduce corporate inversions by making them too expensive to make business sense are likely to be introduced before next recess. \n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2  Repatriation --  Ryan and Schumer have talked up the idea of introducing legislation to repatriate U.S. multinational profits that are held abroad.  A compromise will have to be struck between Democrats seeking reduced tax levels for this purpose and Republicans who cite moral hazard.  The Obama budget for FY2017 includes a proposal to allow overseas profits to come home at a special 14 percent trate, and all overseas profits thereafter be taxed at 19 percent. \n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2  Broader Corporate Tax Reform  --   \n> \n> Any successful across the board corporate tax reform would almost have to lower the nominal corporate tax rate of 35 percent.  -- the highest in the world.  Republicans are adamant that the high rate yields corporate inversions.  Ways and Means chair Brady has pointed to the corporate rate repeatedly as a sign that the U.S. has a \xe2\x80\x9cbroken tax code that discourages investment and growth.\xe2\x80\x9d \n> \n> Brady has not yet released his own reform bill, but an op-ed of his published this morning gives an indication of what it will include:  \xe2\x80\x9cWe must address the real root of the problem \xe2\x80\x93 our broken tax code that discourages investment and growth \xe2\x80\xa6 Our sky-high 35 percent corporate tax rate bears much of the blame \xe2\x80\xa6 We cannot allow American taxpayers to foot the bill for tax revenue grabs in Europe and elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\n> \n> Provisions to look for: a lower overall corporate tax rate, language to address European investigations on U.S. businesses dodging taxes abroad.  The bill likely won\xe2\x80\x99t include language restricting inversions.  \n> Senate Finance chair Hatch has suggested writing legislation to make dividends tax deductible for corporations, eliminating the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cdouble taxation\xe2\x80\x9d of hitting corporate earnings as well as dividend incomes from investors.  The proposal faces long odds. \n> \n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2  Earned-Income Tax Credit (EITC) -- \n> \n> One tax provisions in the Obama FY17 budget that has been muted if not mooted this week is his proposal to expand the EITC for childless workers and create a $500 \xe2\x80\x9csecond earner\xe2\x80\x9d tax credit.  The cost would be $150 billion over ten years. \n> \n> During his SOTU, Obama expressed his desire to work with Speaker Ryan on the issue:  \xe2\x80\x9cI also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a hand up. And I\xe2\x80\x99d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who don\'t have children.\xe2\x80\x9d\n> \n> The credit is a long-standing darling of both progressives and the GOP establishment. Ryan and President Obama support extending it to childless workers.  But they face resistance from not just the hard right but from Sen. Hatch, who say it\xe2\x80\x99s not \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d to expand the break. \n> \n> Upcoming/Recent Updates\n> \n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2  Derivatives Agreement w.

Nothing remotely on the scale of blocking the confirmation of a Supreme Justice.  But as Senate Budget\'s ranking member Sen. Cardin warned at a breakfast today, you can forget regular order on the budget -- after the President submits a nomination, all comity in the Senate will be gone until Election Day. \n> \n> Details and the latest below.  Taxes tomorrow (be still your heart, right?). \n> \n> Best,\n> \n> Dana \n> \n> Story in the Senate\n> \n> At the same DSCC  breakfast one month ago, Sen. Merkley announced that, to his surprise, Senate Budget Chair Mike Enzi was going to put out a manager\'s mark for an FY17 budget resolution for Committee markup, for February.  Today, Enzi withdrew his markup plans, without announcing a reschedule date.\n> \n> To add to the growing problems within the GOP, the party, led by Senator Mitch McConnell, has declared all-out war on Obama\xe2\x80\x99s impending Supreme Court nomination -- an "nomination abomination" -- making it even more difficult to predict how these budget deliberations will end. \n> \n> Histrionics of the House \n> \n> Even before Obama released his FY2017 budget proposal earlier this month, House Republicans made it a point to emphasize that it was DOA.  Now, GOP is running into some dead ends of its own. \n> \n> Speaker Ryan announced early on that he intended to pass the budget through regular order this year -- a process that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been successfully completed in a generation.  Due to internal dicisions and outside pressures, House Republicans have changed their tune.  \n> \n> Yesterday, House Budget announced plans for a proposal next month to stick with the spending levels set by last fall\xe2\x80\x99s deal with the White House while also giving members the chance to vote on other bills that would slash government spending. The compromise is meant to appease hard-right GOP members who vehemently opposed the Obama-Boehner budget agreement.  Per Ryan\'s office: \xe2\x80\x9cThis proposal enjoys the overwhelming support of the committee members, and the chairman looks forward to sharing it with the broader Conference as we continue moving this process forward.\xe2\x80\x9d\n> \n> The conservative Freedom Caucus so far has supported Speaker Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s overtures for cooperation on the budget.  But the GOP\'s hard-right wing may not remain so understanding of the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s position, especially if their credentials are called into question by outside groups with sway over their base of support.   Heritage Action said Monday that the group would oppose any budget blueprint that sticks to the Obama-Boehner deal, which increases spending by about $30 billion.\n> \n> Going Forward \n> \n> It won\'t be an easy road ahead on the budget.   The conservative caucus has several dozen members, which gives it the power to torpedo any budget proposal that lacks at least some Democratic support.  If it decides to back the new proposal put forth by Chair Tom Price of House Budget, it would be likely for GOP leaders to be able to move forward.  Some members have voiced their willingness to cooperate, but the pull of outside right-wing groups may prove to be too strong.\n> \n> Meanwhile, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer said today that any Republican budget strategy that strays from the Obama-Boehner deal would be opposed by House Democrats. \n> \n> The House Budget plan is to submit the proposal honoring the spending limits agreed to last year, while allowing the hard-right GOP wing to vote on other bills which would slash spending, mollifying the more hawkish members.  \n> \n> Dearth of Legislative Days\n> \n> Lengthening the odds against Ryan, the House Budget is now working on a delayed schedule.  In mid-January, the House Budget Committee announced that it would be releasing its markup of the White House budget proposal early -\xe2\x80\x93 on February 25. However, that has also changed. Yesterday, The Committee announced that it was now delaying its markup till sometime in March.  The change is curious for a few reasons.  It raises the question of why the House Budget Committee said it would have the markup done so early in the first place. Moreover, it goes against the House Republicans message of \xe2\x80\x9cgetting things done\xe2\x80\x9d during this Congress. \n> \n> Democrats are jumping on this delay already.  Nancy Pelosi said: \xe2\x80\x9cYet again, it\xe2\x80\x99s the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s own broken promises \xe2\x80\x93 and his own rhetoric \xe2\x80\x93 that are coming back to bite him.  Because while the Speaker pledged an end to dysfunctional House-Republican leadership, all the American people are seeing is more of the same.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n> \n> One thing is looks increasingly likely: that the nomination will exert a tidal force on at least the budget deliberations and everything else, through the election.  \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> Upcoming/Recent Updates\n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2  Tax Talk\n> \xe2\x80\xa2  Derivatives Agreement w.

Municipal obligations, including bonds, are at the heart of infrastructure investment in America.  And infrastructure investment has been a large focus of this primary.  Both Democratic candidates have proposed multi-hundred billion dollar infrastructure investment proposals.\n> \n> Details below...\n> \n> Best,\n> \n> Dana\n> \n> Infrastructure is mostly funded at the state or local level through the use of municipal bonds.  Between 2003 and 2012, counties, states, and other localities invested $3.2 trillion in infrastructure through long-term tax-exempt municipal bonds, 2.5 times more than the federal investment.  \n> \n> The Bill\n> \n> HR 2209 requires federal banking regulators to include municipal bonds under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR).  The LCR is designed to ensure that financial institutions have the necessary assets available to handle a liquidity disruption.  Local officials have said that if the new rules aren\xe2\x80\x99t changed, it will saddle them with higher borrowing costs by eliminating incentives banks have to purchase their bonds. Without bonds, these governments will lose a significant source of their funding.  Per Indiana State Treasurer Kelly Mitchell: \xe2\x80\x9cThis bill helps ensure cash-strapped school districts and municipalities will continue to have access to bonds to finance projects they think are best for their communities.\xe2\x80\x9d \n> \n> Rep. Luke Messer, an Indiana Republican who wrote the bill:  \xe2\x80\x9cPut simply, our bill requires the federal government to recognize the obvious, that our municipal bonds are some of the safest investments in the world and that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have rules that give preferential treatment to corporate bonds or other countries\xe2\x80\x99 bonds over our own.\xe2\x80\x9d \n> \n> After passing the House with unanimous bipartisan support, a companion bill is expected to be introduced in the Senate this year.  \n> \n> Municipal Bond Issue\n> \n> After the crisis of 2008, federal regulators adopted international banking standards that require banks to have enough "High-Quality Liquid Assets" to cover their cash outflows for 30 days in case of a future financial meltdown.  Now, municipal bonds are not considered liquid assets and therefore cannot be included under the  LCR.   As a result, financial institutions have been discouraged from holding municipal debt, which means that cash strapped municipalities and school districts may eventually be forced to reduce or even stop work on projects  financed with municipal bonds. \n> \n> Infrastructure Financing -- Alternative Financing\n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2   Tax-exempt bonds:  Exemption from federal taxes and many state and local taxes is possible through the use of municipal bonds.   In recent years, with the increasing use of PPPs, barriers to this tax exemption have arisen.  Treasury has reviewed relevant tax rules and based on their findings and have put forth a proposal for an expanded and permanent America Fast Forward Bond Program as an alternative to tax-exempt bonds.  Based on the successful Build America Bond program, \xe2\x80\x9cwould provide an efficient borrowing subsidy to state and local governments while appealing to a broader investor base than traditional tax-exempt bonds [and] would cover a broad range of projects for which tax-exempt bonds can be used.\xe2\x80\x9d \n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2  Obama\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposal:  Obama has also put forth a plan to strengthen local and state government infrastructure projects. His plan relies on a new Federal credit program to support public-private partnerships within the Department of the Treasury. It will provide direct loans to US infrastructure projects developed through PPPs. The Obama Administration believes that private investment is crucial for infrastructure development moving forward, so there should be more flexibility in regards to what PPP is subject to. In addition to that, President Obama has proposed the taxable, direct-pay America Fast Forward bond program to help finance infrastructure.  \n> \n> State Infrastructure Banks\n> \n> Local governments receive financing in a number of ways.  Traditional sources such as tax revenues have been dwindling and local authorities have been relying on federal government loan programs, public-private partnerships, and State Revolving Funds (SRFs).  State Infrastructure Banks (SIBs) are a subset of SRFs -- the funds act like a bank, because they don\xe2\x80\x99t own the infrastructure asset, but act as a lender or guarantor to the project sponsor. Per Brookings:  \xe2\x80\x9cSRFs rely on principal repayments, bonds, interest and fees to re-capitalize and replenish the fund as a perpetual source of debt financing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n> \n> SIBs generate more investment per dollar than traditional federal and state grant programs.  They only exist in 33 states and 10 of those SIBs are currently inactive. A large problem may be compliance with federal regulations.  Brookings again: \n> \n> \xe2\x80\x9cWe found that many SIB officials cite compliance with federal regulations as slowing down the investment process either because of environmental and contractual requirements or due to the lack of flexibility in projects that are not Title 23 or 49 eligible. For states with smaller projects, this may be prohibitively costly compared to the advantage of using the low-cost SIB financing.\xe2\x80\x9d \n> \n> Just being called a bank subjects SIBs to regulations that commercial banks are subject to.  SIBs are non-for-profit organizations with a goal of increasing infrastructure investment, so they don\xe2\x80\x99t quite fit into the category of the average bank.  SIBs may be more successful outside this classification.  \n> \n> For or Against Dodd-Frank\n> \n> Before Dodd-Frank, particularly in the case of relatively small municipalities, many underwriters forged long-term relationships with municipalities and would provide financial advice before and after a bond issuance.  With Dodd-Frank, that relationship changed, with a new \xe2\x80\x9cmunicipal adviser\xe2\x80\x9d category that must register with the SEC and be regulated by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSR).  Now, it is widely illegal to provide advice to governmental entities concerning the issuance of municipal bonds, the use of financial derivatives, and the investment of the proceeds of a bond issue to, or on behalf, of a municipal entity or an obligated person unless the adviser is registered with the SEC. \n> \n> HR 2209 appears to address a problem within Dodd-Frank, but it is unclear if it vitiates the law materially.  At face value, it appears to be more a technical fix. Dodd-Frank expanded regulations for banking institutions, but the entities that fund state and local governments are far unlike the TBTF institutions that Dodd-Frank was meant to regulate.   \n> \n> Groups like Americans for Financial Reform oppose HR 2209: \xe2\x80\x9cWhile we sympathize with the belief that municipal debt was incorrectly treated under the initial LCR rule, we believe that it is inappropriate to classify such debt as a Level 2A asset. AFR therefore opposes this bill unless a more appropriate liquidity classification is used.\xe2\x80\x9d  AFR has previously said it supports treating municipal bonds as more liquid and does not approve the type of classification used in HR 2209, because it goes too far in its treatment of municipal debt as level 2A liquid assets and specifically with micromanaging regulators with this kind of detail and they prefer a Level 2B classification. \n> \n> The bill could provide relief for smaller institutions, so that they can fund infrastructure investment more easily. In terms of Dodd-Frank, it is yet to be decided if it is simply a necessary tweak or a criticism.                              \n> \n> Looking Ahead\n> \n> HR 2209 could end up being an important issue in the national infrastructure discussion.  It brings up questions about how far a state or local government can go before its activities begin to resemble an actual bank.  With the growth of PPPs, the private sector is being even more integrated into the process \xe2\x80\x93 should those companies be given tax exemptions, as well? \n> \n> \n> \n> Upcoming/Recent Updates\n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2  Derivatives Agreement w.

And perhaps with reason -- the TBTF (too big to fail) issue has dogged Congress and the administration for years and is one of the central ones in the Democratic presidential campaign this far. \n> \n> Or maybe it was just a slow news day.  You decide...\n> \n> Best, \n> \n> Dana\n> \n> \n> \n> A Peculiar Package of Proposals\n> \n> Kashkari argued in the alternative that Dodd-Frank needs to be used and/or needs to be reformed.  He says the law as written does not solve the TBTF problem.  He also wants regulators to use the yet-untried tools at their disposal under the law.   \xe2\x80\x9cWhile significant progress has been made to strengthen our financial system, I believe the [Dodd-Frank] Act did not go far enough."  He then laid out three ideas meant to end TBTF once and for all.  \n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2  break up large banks into smaller, less connected, less important entities;\n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2  turn what remains of the large banks into public utilities by forcing them to hold so much capital that they can\xe2\x80\x99t fail; and\n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2  tax leverage throughout the financial system "to reduce systemic risks wherever they lie."\n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2  Break up the Banks\n> \n> From the perspective of current laws, breaking up big banks is already a policy avenue available to regulators.  The Federal Reserve, through the Financial Stability Oversight Council, can elect to take a number of actions to deal with banks that it feels are both systemically important and organized in an unstable way.  Section 121 of the Dodd-Frank Act gives the Board of Governors these powers.  \n> \n> So this first proposal \xe2\x80\x93 break up big banks - has been covered here before but just for the sake of argument... which banks need to be broken up most urgently?  Few commentators believe there is an imminent threat demanding action.  \n> \n> Unsurprisingly, the Fed doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that banks are so hopeless that they need to be dissolved.  That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it\xe2\x80\x99s not a possibility under current legislation, however.\n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2   Make Banks \xe2\x80\x9cUtilities\xe2\x80\x9d\n> \n> The second proposal is to push capital requirements for banks so high that they \xe2\x80\x9cessentially turn into public utilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kashkari never explains how exactly high capital reserves turn banks into utilities, but that\xe2\x80\x99s for another time.  \n> \n> He is voicing his support for one of the oldest forms of banking regulations that we still use and use far more now in the Dodd-Frank era \xe2\x80\x93 he wants banks to hold more capital.  Supporters of the law may be heartened by his full-throated endorsement of the law on this score. \n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2   Cribbing from Clinton?\n> \n> The third proposal was just about lifted out of Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s plan to regulate Wall Street \xe2\x80\x93- though the reporting on the speech doesn\xe2\x80\x99t much mention it much.  It is reasonable both from a policy and a political perspective. But he doesn\'t provide further details about his proposal after first outlining it.\n> \n> Kashkari contra Yellen\n> \n> Fed Chair Yellen has been an outspoken proponent of existing banking regulations, making it known that while the job of regulators is not done yet. we\xe2\x80\x99re in a much better situation now than we were before DFA.  During her testimony before House Financial Services, Yellen fielded a question about why she had not yet broken up big banks, saying: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6we [at the Fed]vare using our powers to make sure that a systemically important institution could fail, and it would not be -- have systemic consequences for the country. We\'re doing that in a whole variety of ways.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n> \n> The ways Yellen is referring to include enforcing Liquidity Coverage Ratios, capital reserve requirements, and a rule passed last November forcing the biggest banks to issue long-term debt equal to 18 percent of risk-weighted assets.  \n> \n> Evidently it\'s not enough.  But it is nonetheless uncommon for a newly minted Federal Reserve Bank President to taking to task the Chair of the Federal Reserve\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Governors.\n> \n> \n> \n> Upcoming/Recent Updates\n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2  Municipal Bond Rule\n> \xe2\x80\xa2  Budget (Ir)Resolution\n> \xe2\x80\xa2  Puerto Rico\n> \xe2\x80\xa2  Derivatives Agreement w.

The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (H.R. 644) retools CBP to increase its focus on blocking illegal trade and ensuring that legal trade moves smoothly.\n> \n> The major facets of this legislation are:\n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2  new protections on intellectual property rights\n> \xe2\x80\xa2  new tools to fight currency manipulation\n> \xe2\x80\xa2. a permanent extension of the Internet Tax Freedom Act\n> \n> Said Senate Finance ranking member Ron Wyden:  \xe2\x80\x9cThis bill is about coming down hard on the trade cheats who are ripping off American jobs, and the truth is past trade policies were often too old, too slow or too weak for our country to fight back."\n> \n> Wyden was perhaps the most outspoken Democrat in support of the bill, continuing his role as a strong backer of free trade legislation.  He was a key factor in getting Trade Promotion Authority legislation passed through Congress last summer, splitting from some of his colleagues in voicing support for that act.\n> \n> Unusual Coalition\n> \n> 27 Democrats, 47 Republicans, and 1 Independent voted affirmatively.  Industry groups including the National Retail Federation, as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce were supportive of the legislation.  National Association of Manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 president Jay Timmons said \xe2\x80\x9cif senators want to grow manufacturing in the United States, then they should pass this bill immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\n> \n> Notable \xe2\x80\x9cNay\xe2\x80\x9d votes include Sens. Durbin and Reid, who both expressed disappointment that the legislation was a \xe2\x80\x9cwatered down\xe2\x80\x9d version of a bill previously passed by the Senate.  \xe2\x80\x9dI like that [Senate] version, and that strong language on currency manipulation,\xe2\x80\x9d Durbin said \xe2\x80\x93 that language required Commerce to consider \xe2\x80\x9cundervalued\xe2\x80\x9d currencies to be equivalent to countervailable subsidies.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe conference report that\xe2\x80\x99s back to us now and before the Senate at this moment is a much different bill."\n> \n> Purpose and Provisions\n> \n> House and Senate negotiators agreed on a final customs bill in December.   The House passed the measure 256-158 but the legislation stalled in the Senate over a provision added in conference that permanently extends a moratorium on Internet access taxes.\n> \n> That provision is perhaps the most reported on section in the bill \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s almost certainly the most popular - it applies to localities, states, and the federal government itself.   Sen. Lamar Alexander cited it though as explanation for his \xe2\x80\x9cnay\xe2\x80\x9d vote: "the federal government shouldn\'t be telling the states what their tax structure should be."\n> \n> Another important provision, known as the ENFORCE Act, would require the CBP to more aggressively investigate complaints that companies are evading anti-dumping or countervailing duties on imports by mislabeling or disguising the shipments.\n> \n> The bill includes a new Trade Enforcement Fund to bring trade cases through the WTO, to investigate the implementation of trade requirements by other countries, and to respond to complaints of trade violations.  It also creates a nine-member Advisory Committee on International Exchange Rate Policy, whose members must be comprised of individuals from the private sector who are selected by both chambers of Congress and the President (three members each).\n> \n> Currency Manipulation\n> \n> Currency manipulation has been a long-standing concern of American policy-makers and a particularly contentious issue in global trade relations; claims that China has been chronically undervaluing its currency have made the news for a number of years.  Advocates for stricter enforcement of currency manipulation provisions claim that undervalued currencies operate similarly to export subsidies \xe2\x80\x93 a prohibited practice within the World Trade Organization.\n> \n> The final bill dropped a Senate provision that would have required the Commerce Department to treat undervalued currency as an illegal subsidy under U.S. countervailing duty law.  This provision would have opened the door for compensatory tariffs to be levied against goods which originate from countries which are found to purposely undervalue their currency in order to boost their exports. The bill does, however, include other measures that give the Treasury Department new tools to fight currency manipulation:\n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2  creates a special fund for the CBP to ensure trading partners follow the rules and to bring disputes before the WTO\n> \xe2\x80\xa2  increases funding to the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center\n> \xe2\x80\xa2  establishes the Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee jointly between CBP and Treasury\n> \xe2\x80\xa2  requires CBP to investigate claims from other agencies of evasion of anti-dumping or countervailing duties.\n> \n> Relation to TPP\n> \n> Sen. Majority Leader McConnell has said that the Senate will not vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership before the November elections, so it may come as a surprise to see a bill which deals with enforcing trade deals like TPP pass both houses of Congress.  However this bill\xe2\x80\x99s provisions for protecting IP rights, toughening countervailing duties, and tackling currency manipulation are a necessary prerequisite for agreements like TPP (or the far more nebulous TTIP).  The new age of trade agreements  will deal extensively in issues like intellectual property protection, trade in services, and high-tech product trading; types of commerce which are far more difficult to regulate compared to the trade of physical goods.\n> \n> So, despite the fact that TPP won\xe2\x80\x99t get a vote until after November (and perhaps not in 2016 at all), and may not pass even then, the protections set forward in the customs bill are necessary to allow American companies to continue to compete in the global marketplace.\n> \n> Price of Passage\n> \n> In order to include the permanent extension of the Internet Tax Freedom Act, McConnell had to promise that a vote would be held this year on the Marketplace Fairness Act.  That legislation grants states greater authority to collect sales taxes from online businesses who sell products within their borders.  While McConnell himself opposes the bill, it was the only way to get the customs bill (with the tax amendment attached) unstuck.\n> \n> Just because McConnell has promised it will be brought to a vote doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it will be a smooth process - the Senate passed the Marketplace Fairness Act in 2013 with 69 votes, and most of the lawmakers who voted for it are still in the chamber.  Some lawmakers like Kelly Ayotte, who is facing a tough reelection campaign this year, have vowed to fight tooth-and-nail against it.  Despite these detractors in the Senate, the real battle may occur in the House, where two competing proposals have been brought forward.  \n> \n> \n> Upcoming/Recent Updates\n> \n> \xe2\x80\xa2  Municipal Bond Rule\n> \xe2\x80\xa2  Budget (Ir)Resolution\n> \xe2\x80\xa2  Puerto Rico\n> \xe2\x80\xa2  Derivatives Agreement w.

These appearances allow Yellen to explain the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s, actually the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\xe2\x80\x99s, analysis and projections regarding America\'s economic performance as well as to signal the factors underlying its actions in the months ahead.  \n>>> The rate change in December 2015 was the first time the Fed raised rates since 2006 -- some worry that even a modest increase in rates at this juncture would further slow already limited economic growth after years of uncertainty.\n>>> The Basics\n>>> The bottom line: the FOMC won\xe2\x80\x99t rollback rates in March and it\xe2\x80\x99s not likely to raise them either.  The Fed likes what it sees in the labor market, wage growth looks strong, and emerging market missteps continue to be a threat to the US economy but perhaps not an immediate one.  The next rate move is almost certain to be an increase but it could wait until June or later. \n>>> Yellen reiterated much of the FOMC statement from last month:  the labor market remains strong, but shows some signs of remaining slack, that the low inflation we have seen is caused by \xe2\x80\x9ctransitory\xe2\x80\x9d effects (low energy prices), and that global market uncertainty creates some level of risk for slow growth at home and abroad.  Though Yellen did not make a prediction on how long these transitory market effects would last, a number of forecasts for oil prices show the dip lasting through 2016.\n>>> Expanding on global growth issues, Yellen said "These developments, if they prove persistent, could weigh on the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, although declines in longer-term interest rates and oil prices could provide some offset," she added: "Foreign economic developments, in particular, pose risks to US economic growth." \n>>> \n>>> Partisan Review\n>>> \n>>> The GOP is generally critical of "accommodative" (lower) Fed rates.   High-net-worth individuals benefit the most from high rates through dividends and interest from savings.  Low rates allow more growth for the middle- and lower-classes at the risk of inflation, tacitly supporting Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 progressive fiscal policy goals.  Some conservative economists have gone so far as to blame low interest rates pushed by the Fed in the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s for the market meltdown in 2007, claiming that cheap credit was the cause of the overheated housing market.\n>>> \n>>> Strong Labor Market\n>>> \n>>> Discussing the labor market in greater detail, Yellen pointed to the cumulative increase in employment since 2010 of 13 million jobs.  The rate in January fell to 4.9 percent, 0.8 points below its level one year ago; measures of labor market conditions such as the number of people who are working part-time but want to move to full-time positions and the number of individuals who want to work but haven\xe2\x80\x99t searched recently are also decreasing steadily.  Regarding these broader labor market indicators Yellen testified that \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6 these measures remain above the levels seen prior to the recession, suggesting that some slack in labor markets remains. Thus, while labor market conditions have improved substantially, there is still room for further sustainable improvement."\n>>> \n>>> Forward Guidance\n>>> \n>>> As always, Yellen was careful not to give hints on what the Fed is planning to do in future meetings; speaking on the path forward for the Fed Funds rate Yellen said \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, monetary policy is by no means on a preset course. The actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on what incoming data tell us about the economic outlook, and we will regularly reassess what level of the federal funds rate is consistent with achieving and maintaining maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>>> \n>>> Yellen was asked about the chances of the FOMC rolling back the rate hike it announced in December:  "I do not expect the FOMC is going to be soon in the situation where it\'s necessary to cut rates If the FOMC delayed the start of policy normalization for too long, it might have to tighten policy relatively abruptly in the future to keep the economy from overheating and inflation from significantly overshooting its objective. Such an abrupt tightening could increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession." \n>>> \n>>> Comment on Dodd-Frank\n>>> \n>>> During the Q&A portion of her testimony, Yellen was asked about financial regulation, both in terms of breaking up the banks and enforcing the regulations brought on by Dodd-Frank. \n>>> \n>>> In response to being asked if the Fed is trying to break up the banks, she responded: "We are using our powers to make sure that a systemically important institution could fail, and it would not have systemic consequences for the country." Her answer was interesting, because she\'s not outright saying the banks will be broken up or reduced, just that the Fed is trying to ensure that even if they did fail, it wouldn\'t negatively effect the economy.\n>>> \n>>> Yellen was also asked about the burden of new Dodd-Frank regulations on banks. She responded: "For our part, we\'re focused on doing everything that we conceivably can to minimize and reduce the burden on these banking organizations. We\'ve been conducting an EGRPRA review to identify potential burdens that our regulations impose." An EGRPRA review is connected to the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, which requires regulations imposed on financial institutions to be reviewed by the agencies at least once every 10 years. The purpose is to prevent burdensome regulations that could hinder a bank\'s ability to serve its customers. \n>>> \n>>> The Bottom Line\n>>> \n>>> Fed watchers make their living by trying to predict what the FOMC will or won\xe2\x80\x99t do at their meetings, and on days when Yellen is scheduled to testify before Congress you can bet that they\xe2\x80\x99re listening intently.  While Yellen was careful not to project the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s moves, the general sentiment in the markets is that FOMC won\xe2\x80\x99t be raising rates at its March meeting.  The CME Group FedWatch tool, which estimates FOMC rate hikes based on its futures prices, predicts a 95% probability that the Fed will maintain its current rate target in March.  Some forecasters go even further -- expecting that the funds rate won\xe2\x80\x99t be raised all year. \n>>> \n>>> Traders see the ongoing economic struggles of emerging economies, particularly in China, as evidence that the Fed won\xe2\x80\x99t continue with its scheduled 4 rate hikes this year.  Certainly, considering the testimony today that 1) continued emerging market uncertainty can weigh down the US economy and 2) that poor performance in the US economy would cause the Fed to change course on its rate hike schedule, a link between poor emerging market performance and fewer Fed rate hikes seems plausible.

It tops the $4 trillion mark for the first time.   Despite the historical tendency for lame duck presidential budgets to be treated as scrap paper -- this one won\'t even be accorded the courtesy of a hearing in House Budget -- there are a few noteworthy proposals and initiatives which, if nothing else, are likely to generate discussion on the Hill and off.  \n>>>> That\xe2\x80\x99s the real purpose of this budget -- to help frame the debate in 2016 about where America is headed what the nation\'s priorities should be.  A number of the proposals in this budget resonate with issues and themes already being debated.  Candidates in particular seeking to emphasize support for or opposition to the President have a new set of proposals at their disposal. \n>>>> What is new and noteworthy in the White House budget and what\'s next for it?  Detail below. \n>>>> Special thanks to those of you in NH tonight.  Fingers crossed and stay tuned this way:   http://politi.co/20n5W2w \n>>>> Best,\n>>>> Dana\n>>>> ---------\n>>>> The Obama Administration put forth a myriad of budget proposals revolving around a variety of issues.  Below are thoughts on some of the most significant of these from a fiscal and financial regulatory perspective: \n>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2  $10/Barrel Transportation Tax\n>>>> A perennial favorite of Democrats has made a return in the Obama budget:  a $10.25 per barrel tax on oil, $319 billion in revenue from which will go toward funding \xe2\x80\x9ca 21st Century Clean Transportation Plan to upgrade the nation\xe2\x80\x99s transportation system, improve resilience and reduce emissions."  The proposed tax is a simplified version of \xe2\x80\x9ccarbon taxation\xe2\x80\x9d policies, which aim to tax energy producers and oil companies based on the level of pollution they produce; \xe2\x80\x9ccap and trade\xe2\x80\x9d was a similar policy idea but with more complicated implementation.  \n>>>> The tax will be phased in over five years and levied against oil companies, with the revenue to help fund clean energy initiatives like expanding high-speed rail systems and also to increase national infrastructure spending.  The appeal of this flat-tax on oil is its simplicity \xe2\x80\x93- there is nothing complicated about charging oil companies $10.25 per barrel of oil, meaning there\xe2\x80\x99s no way for them to shirk the charge. \n>>>> Supporting the tax would lend candidates some environmental bonafides, but might be seen as a backdoor  tax on the middle-class. Though paid for by oil companies, the  price is expected to be passed along to consumers through higher prices.  The tax is expected to increase the price of gasoline by 25 cents per gallon.\n>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2  Funding Fin. Reg. Like it Matters \n>>>> Obama proposes to double the budget for Wall Street regulators SEC and CFTC over ten years, beginning with an 11 percent increase for SEC and 32 percent for CFTC in 2017.  Clinton has a lot to like in this particular section \xe2\x80\x93 she\xe2\x80\x99s the only candidate who has defended Dodd-Frank and is campaigning on proposals to strengthen current regulations, including through greater budgets for regulatory agencies.  Leaders for both regulators have complained that their responsibilities far outstrip their budget. \n>>>> The proposal is more realistic than the oil tax, although not necessarily something that will definitely be enacted.  The SEC has called for increased funding recently.  SEC chairman Mary Jo White asked at a House Financial Services Committee hearing in November for $1.8 billion in funding for fiscal 2017.  In a time when Republicans are looking to reduce regulatory burdens against banks, an increase in regulators\xe2\x80\x99 budgets highlights the difference in priorities on Wall Street. \n>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2  Boosting R and D\n>>>> The budget increases R&D funding by four percent for a total of $152 billion in 2017; among changes are a doubling of clean energy research and funding a $1 billion cancer \xe2\x80\x9cMoonshot\xe2\x80\x9d research program aimed at eliminating the disease. \n>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2   Apprenticeship Training Fund\n>>>> The budget establishes a $2 billion mandatory Apprenticeship Training Fund \xe2\x80\x93 meant to double the number of apprenticeships across the United States.  Only HRC has talked about the need for increasing the number of apprenticeships in the country during the election, favoring a tax-credit policy rather than direct funding. \n>>>> Congressional Prospects\n>>>> Obama\xe2\x80\x99s proposal is not only a prelude to battle.  Lawmakers and the administration will have to strike some sort of deal to keep the government running when the current fiscal year ends on Sept. 30 \xe2\x80\x94 most likely a continuing resolution to keep the lights on through the election and early into 2017.  In a sign that Obama isn\xe2\x80\x99t looking for a knock-down spending fight this year, the president\xe2\x80\x99s proposal abides by the discretionary caps for fiscal 2017 set by last year\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan budget deal. \n>>>> Congressional leadership may have a fight on its hands even without Obama making waves \xe2\x80\x93 if the Freedom Caucus membership decides to make its displeasure on the budget known then it could cause rancor amongst the GOP.  In a year when the party is desperate to project an image of capable leadership, in part by passing a complete budget for the first time since 1997, a blow-up between Ryan and the back-benchers would amount to nothing less than catastrophe.\n>>>> At a more granular level, Obama\xe2\x80\x99s blueprint is a grab-bag of Democratic priorities.  The administration is once again calling for expanding early education in his 2017 budget, asking for more pre-K grants, a child care expansion and a small boost to Head Start.  The budget boosts spending for Obamacare Medicaid expansion by $2.6 billion over a decade, designed to be an enticement to the 19 holdout states that have yet to take effect.\n>>>> Republicans and the Budget\n>>>> \n>>>> The Republicans have a different plan for the budget this year, naturally.  Speaker Ryan has stated that he intends to pass the budget and all 12 appropriations through the house -- a feat that hasn\'t been accomplished in two decades.\n>>>> \n>>>> The Republicans have a different plan for the budget this year, naturally.  Speaker Ryan has stated that he intends to pass the budget and all 12 appropriations through the house - a feat that hasn\'t been accomplished since 1997.  Although Ryan and the GOP House leadership hope to gain the faith of the American people back by bringing about the return of regular order, they face a tight calendar and the political implications of an election year -- not to mention internal opposition in the form of the Freedom Caucus.  Should the back-benchers feel their concerns aren\xe2\x80\x99t being adequately addressed, they may try to disrupt the passage of appropriations bills.  The care and feeding of these members on budget matters may be turn out to be one of the toughest challenges Ryan will face this year.\n>>>> \n>>>> -----------------\n>>>> \n>>>> Recent Updates\n>>>> \n>>>> Obama\'s FY17 Budget  (Feb. 9) \n>>>> Tax Talk of the Town  (Feb. 3)\n>>>> Defending Dodd-Frank  (Feb. 2)\n>>>> Fiscal Pol: Deficit/Debt Dormancy (Jan. 28)\n>>>> The Fed Holds Rates, for Now  (Jan. 28)\n>>>> Debate Myths Challenged  (Jan. 25)\n>>>> Regulating the Regulators  (Jan. 21)\n>>>> Sanders\' Tax/Healthcare Policy  (Jan 20)\n>>>> HRC\'s Tax Policy  (Jan. 17)\n>>>> 2016 Tax Agenda on the Hill  (Jan. 16)\n>>>> Glass-Steagall, Take 2  (Jan. 13)\n>>>> 2016 Tax Policy Issues  (Jan. 8)\n>>>> Sanders Proposals/GS & TBTF (Jan. 7)\n>>>> Sanders\' Fin Reg Proposals  (Jan. 5)\n>>>> Year-End Review: Fiscal Policy (Jan. 1)  Year-End Review: Fin.

The word is that Messrs. Ryan and McConnell want to run a smooth, efficient, maybe even a productive ship this year on the theory that voters will reward the GOP in November and that they will forget the record of the last seven years.  The Speaker and the President have had a recent meeting and mini-meeting of the minds on taxes.  That might create the right climate for passage of broad tax reform. \n>>>>> But really the gravitational pull is not toward gravitas, but away from the center, away from the Hill itself.  The GOP presidential nominee might very well have to run against any bipartisan ("Washington") compromise on tax policy, making for an embarrassing intraparty policy conflict at the time the leadership most needs to project unity.\n>>>>> \n>>>>> Amid the turbulence of the broader campaign, where do the various tax discussions in the Hill stand, what bills night come up for votes, is there anything that might pass?\n>>>>> Best,\n>>>>> Dana\n>>>>> ________________________________\n>>>>> Forms of Reform under Discussion\n>>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2 Comprehensive -- Defined as involving a bipartisan trade-off between lowering taxes and broadening the base; closing exemptions, deductions, credits, etc.  Both Democratic candidates have outlined plans to reduce loopholes, such as the "Romney loophole" and the "Bermuda loophole," which allow very rich Americans to avoid paying their fair share. \n>>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2 Corporate -- Many of the issues with the corporate tax system could be addressed through international tax reform, because so many companies earn capital abroad. However, corporate tax reform at home deals with issues like taxing dividends and leveling the playing field between small and large businesses. \n>>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2 International - Deals with foreign earnings of American firms abroad. Specifically, current international tax reform aims at preventing inversions and coming up with a more successful way to tax foreign capital earned by American companies, as well as finding ways to encourage companies to move profits home from abroad.\n>>>>> Forums for Tax Reform\n>>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2 Ways & Means:  Kevin Brady became Chair of the Committee in November 2015. He reportedly hopes to have an international tax reform proposal out of Ways and Means this year.  He says he wants to allow American companies to bring their foreign profits back and invest at home and to lower the corporate tax rate to less than 20 percent.\n>>>>> Brady gave the opening statement at a hearing on \xe2\x80\x9cReaching America\xe2\x80\x99s Potential.\xe2\x80\x9d   For what it\'s worth, he laid out six goals for his committee in the coming months -- and they are ambitious:\n>>>>> \n>>>>> \xc2\xb7 Tax reforms to boost investment and job creation;\n>>>>> \xc2\xb7 Welfare reforms to help more people join the workforce and achieve the American dream.\n>>>>> \xc2\xb7 Health reforms to truly make health care more affordable and accessible; \n>>>>> \xc2\xb7 Trade expansion to open more foreign markets to American goods and services;\n>>>>> \xc2\xb7 Entitlement reforms to strengthen Medicare and Social Security for the long haul and;  \n>>>>> \xc2\xb7 Government reforms to boost efficiency and effectiveness instead of stifling jobs and higher wages.\n>>>>> \n>>>>> Brady\xe2\x80\x99s statement that tax reform will come up in the coming weeks, coupled with Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s recent visit with Obama (specifically to find areas of cooperation), may indicate a broad-based reform package making its way forward in 2016.  Another interesting bullet point is trade expansion, despite McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s promise that TPP won\xe2\x80\x99t be voted on before November. \n>>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2 Senate Finance:   The Senate Finance Committee has its focus set on bipartisan working groups designed to produce tax reform on multiple levels -- individual, corporate, and international. However, there have been many challenges and stalemates along the way because of the stringent partisanship currently ailing the Senate. \n>>>>> This election has been defined, more so than others, by the massively diverse set of tax policies proposed by each candidates \xe2\x80\x93 from flat taxes, capital gains reforms, financial transaction taxes and more.  Sen. Hatch, Chair of Finance, has already called for reform efforts in 2016, targeting international corporate rates specifically \xe2\x80\x93 but it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that Brady is trying to shift him and others toward more ambitious proposals.  Any high profile move Ryan makes here will likely be a controlling factor on tax policy.  \n>>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2 Between the Branches -- Speaker Ryan and Pres. Obama met yesterday to discuss a variety of issues, one of which was related to the Earned Income Tax Credit.  Both hope to expand the credit to include low-earning workers who DON\'T have children.  It\'s unclear how successful their cooperation will be, but at the very least, they share a common goal. \n>>>>> Politico portrayed the meeting as campaign kabuki: \xe2\x80\x9cRather than cut any deals with Obama, Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s hoping to spend 2016 developing what he\xe2\x80\x99s calling a detailed GOP agenda on poverty, taxes, health care and other issues he\xe2\x80\x99s hoping will factor into the presidential campaign and provide a blueprint for House Republicans as they grapple with a new president next year.\xe2\x80\x9d  It\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising to see this given the pressure this election will put on the new Speaker.  He needs to set a strong foundation for his own future, and helping Obama score a tax touchdown on him is not on the top of his list of objectives.  \n>>>>> \n>>>>> During a statement before he met with Obama, Ryan said \xe2\x80\x9cWe will take our conservative principles and we will apply those conservative principles to the problems of the day to offer our fellow citizens solutions to the problems in their daily lives \xe2\x80\xa6. These are not going to be things that we will be able to accomplish with this president still in the White House. It is an agenda for what we will do next year with a Republican president to get our country back on track. This is what 2016\xe2\x80\x99s all about. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a year of ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>>>>> \n>>>>> Political Realities\n>>>>> William Gale and Aaron Krupkin, researchers at Brookings, recently wrote a paper titled \xe2\x80\x9cMajor Tax Issues in 2016;\xe2\x80\x9d Keeping in mind both the current political climate and the probable environment for legislation in 2016, the two researchers write that \xe2\x80\x9cComprehensive tax reform is easy to talk about, but hard to do. The pursuit of sweeping tax simplification is a noble goal, but quixotic.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n>>>>> \n>>>>> At the end of the day 2016 is an election year and any legislative proposals that come forward during it will reflect that.  There are many exciting possibilities for tax reform in 2016, but there is also no reason to think that the political gridlock that has defined Washington for so long will ease up enough while both parties vie for control of the country by drawing contests. \n>>>>> ----------------\n>>>>> Recent Updates\n>>>>> \n>>>>> Tax Talk of the Town  (Feb. 3)\n>>>>> Defending Dodd-Frank  (Feb. 2)\n>>>>> Fiscal Pol: Deficit/Debt Dormancy (Jan. 28)\n>>>>> The Fed Holds Rates, for Now  (Jan. 28)\n>>>>> Debate Myths Challenged  (Jan. 25)\n>>>>> Regulating the Regulators  (Jan. 21)\n>>>>> Sanders\' Tax/Healthcare Policy  (Jan 20)\n>>>>> HRC\'s Tax Policy  (Jan. 17)\n>>>>> 2016 Tax Agenda on the Hill  (Jan. 16)\n>>>>> Glass-Steagall, Take 2  (Jan. 13)\n>>>>> 2016 Tax Policy Issues  (Jan. 8)\n>>>>> Sanders Proposals/GS & TBTF (Jan. 7)\n>>>>> Sanders\' Fin Reg Proposals  (Jan. 5)\n>>>>> Year-End Review: Fiscal Policy (Jan. 1)  Year-End Review: Fin.

Last night\'s narrow win in Iowa provided a big moral victory and took some of the win out of the challenger\'s sails.  It also means that, for at least several weeks, the Democratic nomination contest will continue apace.  And it is likely that Wall Street regulation will likely remain one the  campaign\'s central issues.  \n>>>>>> At the heart of this debate is the Dodd-Frank Act (DFA).   Public opinion is still influenced in the main by memories of the 2008 financial crisis and the recession that followed, so the candidates\' views on DFA get special attention.  \n>>>>>> Below, we re-examine these views and try to clear up the misconceptions that make it hard for voters to identify the candidate best able to defend the protections that DFA provides millions of American consumers, investors, and workers. \n>>>>>> Best,\n>>>>>> Dana\n>>>>>> -----------------\n>>>>>> The assertion that DFA doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do enough to rein in Wall Street has become some sort of progressive shibboleth that as misleading as it is short-sighted and self-defeating.   \n>>>>>> Polling shows the American public believes strong financial regulation is critically needed (74 percent of Democrats, 56 percent Independents, 46 percent Republicans, 64 percent all voters).  Polling has also shown that 66 percent of Americans are either \xe2\x80\x9cnot very familiar\xe2\x80\x9d with or have \xe2\x80\x9cnever heard of\xe2\x80\x9d Dodd-Frank.  It is difficult for reasonable dialogue to be conducted in an environment made up of strong support for regulatory reform on one hand and a lack of knowledge of what is in DFA on the other.\n>>>>>> Any public debate on DFA is hampered by the complexity of the issues involved.  Additionally, there is a perception that it has failed in its objectives.  Beyond the fact that the law isn\xe2\x80\x99t even fully implemented, major financial institutions have already begun restructuring in ways that indicate the law is working properly.   But how many voters know this?\n>>>>>> Has Dodd-Frank Worked?\n>>>>>> The Great Recession and the resulting Dodd-Frank Act changed the trajectory of the financial industry.  The law isn\'t perfect but it is having a stabilizing effect.  Some of the biggest firms on Wall Street -- MetLife, CitiGroup, General Electric -- have shrunk since the law was enacted and as a direct result of its regulations.  Those that haven\'t shrunk are under even more pressure to break up or reduce their size now than they were before Dodd-Frank.\n>>>>>> The candidates are split concerning whether or not DFA is an full and sufficient model for regulating financial markets.  While HRC wants to preserve and protect the progress made by DFA while bolstering certain parts of the law, while Sanders considers the law to be well intentioned yet deeply flawed.  However, questions should be raised about judging the DFA\xe2\x80\x99s efficacy right now - each candidate is forming an opinion on the act despite the fact that DFA hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even reached maturity yet - only about 70 percent of DFA provisions have been implemented.  Beyond the implementation gap is the issue that the results of financial reform cannot be seen overnight.  A piece of legislation as large and multifaceted as Dodd-Frank might take a decade to ripen. \n>>>>>> Even as the greatest effects of DFA remain to be see, recent events indicate that DFA is working as it was intended to.  Any candidate who claims that DFA is in need of major overhaul needs to answer this question: What pressing need is there to overturn a law that has, to this point, largely accomplished its overarching objectives? \n>>>>>> 2016 Candidates and Dodd-Frank\n>>>>>> The candidates in this year\'s primaries have given voters two choices: stick with Dodd-Frank and add some tweaks or repeal it/change it fundamentally. There is only one candidate in the former group - HRC. Every other candidate, including Bernie Sanders, intends to greatly change Dodd-Frank, or get rid of it all together, if elected. With that choice in mind, it is necessary to remember how monumental Dodd-Frank was and the political climate that it was passed in - one with a Democratic majority in both houses.   \n>>>>>> DFA enjoyed widespread support in the years immediately following its passage; Clinton needs to ring the alarm bells that her opponents intend to kill off an effective tool for regulating Wall Street for the sake of trying out unproven strategies that are built more on ideology than policy.  \n>>>>>> Obviously, most Republican candidates would prefer to do away with Dodd-Frank completely as it is greatly disliked by their biggest supporters. Bernie Sanders proposes something similar to Glass-Steagall, but also wants to create a list of the banks that are "too-big-too-fail" and "break them up." He outlined his intentions in legislation he proposed to Congress back in May 2015. Bloomberg Politics notes, "Similar to legislation he introduced in previous years, when Democrats controlled the U.S. Senate, the bill has little chance of advancing."  \n>>>>>> So voters can decide on strengthening a law that is already working to reign in Wall Street\'s risks or abandoning it for either less regulation or poorly aimed regulations. Considering the historical record of these other reform ideas, how can voters be expected to take those suggestions seriously?\n>>>>>> \n>>>>>> \n>>>>>>> On Jan 28, 2016, at 8:19 PM, Dana <danachasin@gmail.com> wrote:\n>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>> Mike & Co. --\n>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>> Ordinarily this time of year, you would perhaps start to spot leaks or hear scuttlebutt about the president\'s spending plans for the next fiscal year, in anticipation of the statutory February White House budget rollout.

Both have proposed extensive new spending plans as part of their primary platform. however, it may be time for the candidates to get serious about the fiscal viability of these plans from a fiscal perspective.\n>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>> Clinton -- Fiscal Stimulus?\n>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>> HRC has proposed a tax package that will raise federal revenue by $500 billion over ten years, to be used for a $350 billion \xe2\x80\x9cCollege Compact\xe2\x80\x9d plan, for tax deductions on health care spending, and to fund an ambitious infrastructure investment package.  Her spending plans are split between those which provide short-term economic stimulus and those which are aimed at providing longer-term boost.  Her $250 billion plan to increase infrastructure investment in the country \xe2\x80\x93 paid for by reviving the \xe2\x80\x9cBuild America Bonds\xe2\x80\x9d program and federal revenue --  works on two fronts.\n>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>> First, hiring middle-class workers in construction, engineering, and the trades the plan puts more money into the hands of people who tend to spend that money quickly.  Second, improving roads, bridges, and tunnels in America the plan will make future transport of goods more reliable, speedy, and safe, all calculated to spur economic growth. \n>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>> The \xe2\x80\x9cCollege Compact\xe2\x80\x9d aims to forgive student loans, lower college tuition, and make community colleges tuition-free.  By removing the burden of debt from young graduates, HRC hopes to free those people up to begin consuming at a higher rate.  The current home-ownership rate for young Americans is distressingly low largely due to their debt burden after college, HRC would rather young Americans take debt on in an equity-building purchase than spend thirty years repaying their college degree.  \n>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>> The Sanders Health Care Tax Bill\n>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>> Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 $14 trillion spending plan, his \xe2\x80\x9cMedicare for All\xe2\x80\x9d proposal, would require the single largest tax hike in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, bringing taxes on the wealthy to levels not seen since Reagan.

The impetus behind this plan is similar to that of Mrs. Clinton \xe2\x80\x93 students with lower debt burdens are going to spend a greater portion of their income on food and entertainment, as well as on equity-investments like homes.\n>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>> Campaign Impact\n>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>> The CBO\xe2\x80\x99s federal budget projections released last week indicated that the annual federal deficit will grow to $1.3 trillion by 2026.  It\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that the CBO report will be linked to the candidates\' spending plans in any meaningful way.  And to be fair, each candidate has put forward proposals to raise revenue equivalent to the costs of their plans (or at least to the extent that their own analyses can be trusted); this is often a rarity amongst politicians running for office and they should be applauded for doing so.  Because of this, both campaigns can claim that their proposals will not raise the federal deficit \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that those claims will remain unchallenged in the future.\n>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>> Tax Foundation Analysis\n>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>> Recent analyses by the Tax Foundation, a group which uses dynamic scoring methods to judge revenue, have found that Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s plan will reduce economic output by 1 percent over a decade, while Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 proposals will lower GDP by a staggering 9.5 percent.

I mean, does anybody in this room think that we\'re going to be discussing a single-payer? ... We\'re not running on any platform of raising taxes." \n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> Far from the cauldron of Congress and the icy campaign trail was an announcement by the Fed with implications for the overall economy and for the election year ahead.  More on the Fed\'s statement and its implications below.  \n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> Please let me know if you have any questions or issue coverage requests. \n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> Best,\n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> Dana\n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> -----------------\n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> The Fed\'s Statement\n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve decided yesterday not to raise rates in January.  Last month, the Fed voted to raise interest rates for the first time in nine years, setting its rate target between 0.25 and 0.5 percent.  Today\'s statement reaffirmed this decision, noting that recent market turbulence had not stayed the Fed from its plan to continue \xe2\x80\x9conly gradual increases in the federal funds rate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Speculation and hope are rife that the FOMC will hold off raising rates in March and wait until June.  \n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> But the statement today indicated no change in the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s plan for previously outlined  rate increases, four 0.25 percent increases this year, with total increases of one percent this year and next.  However, the FOMC is largely comprised of dovish voters, who may change tack if current market corrections continue.   \n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> Market Reaction\n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> The Dow Jones Industrial average is down from 17.759 on December 16 to 15,951 today; the S&P 500 has declined from 2,073 to 1,879 over the same period.  The \n>>>>>>>> Fed however expressed confidence in continuing economic growth, calling low inflation and the decline in energy prices \xe2\x80\x9ctransitory\xe2\x80\x9d and predicting 2 percent inflation in the medium-term as energy prices rise again.  \n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> In a nod to beleaguered investors, the Committee wrote that it \xe2\x80\x9c... is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.\xe2\x80\x9d  So the Fed has, unusually, acknowledged the global scope of its deliberations.  FOMC also indicated a focus on \xe2\x80\x9clabor market indicators [which] will continue to strengthen."\n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> For now, though inflation is running just 0.4 percent, well below its two percent target, the Fed has not disavowed its plan to raise rates four times this year.   This cannot be welcome to global equine markets.  Domestic and global capital markets have already lost roughly ten percent since the December rate hike.  Fed policy may be having a decelerating effect on growth and so could be a marginal drag on Democratic prospects.  \n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> New FOMC Members\n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> The FOMC is made up of rotating board of seven voting members taken from Board of Governors members as well as regional bank officials; these members rotate on an annual basis at the first meeting of each year.  The 2016 committee members are listed below (identified as"hawks," those favoring tight monetary policy or "doves," supporting more accommodative policy). \n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> Janet L. Yellen, Board of Governors, Chair (dove)\n>>>>>>>> William C. Dudley, New York, Vice Chair (dove)\n>>>>>>>> Lael Brainard, Board of Governors (dove)\n>>>>>>>> James Bullard, St. Louis (hawk)\n>>>>>>>> Stanley Fischer, Board of Governors (hawk)\n>>>>>>>> Esther L. George, Kansas City (hawk)\n>>>>>>>> Loretta J. Mester, Cleveland (hawk)\n>>>>>>>> Jerome H. Powell, Board of Governors (swing)\n>>>>>>>> Eric Rosengren, Boston (dove)\n>>>>>>>> Daniel K. Tarullo, Board of Governors (dove)\n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> New members this year are James Bullard, Esther George, Loretta Mester, and Eric Rosengren.  The FOMC consists of 12 voting members, with two nominees awaiting Senate confirmation.  A shift in the balance of power between hawks and doves may occur but the doves hold a slim majority for now.\n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> Code Breaking\n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> Fed watchers have made an art form out of reading between the lines of these policy releases, even the most benign of which can cause huge swings in markets (the Dow dropped over 200 points in the wake of today\xe2\x80\x99s release).  Fed statements are famously difficult to parse but one point was unmistakable: the Fed is keeping a close eye on the labor market -- employment and participation rates, wages, etc. -- as a leading indicator for inflation and overall growth perhaps more than any other variable.  \n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> Campaign Consequences\n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> None of the candidates has commented on today\xe2\x80\x99s release, not surprisingly, but the policy may draw ire from some on the right, who oppose fiat rate-targeting (though it took no action today) and the left, where lowering rather than raising rate is preferred (except for holders of fixed income securities).  \n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> Sen.  Sanders, true to his reputation of standing far outside the Democratic fold, has long opposed the Fed for being too involved with the bankers they are meant to be regulating.  Sanders has called for reform measures at the Fed, including prohibiting people serving on bank boards from serving on the Fed at the same time. \n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> The Fed was confident that economic growth would continue on its steady pace, indicating strength in labor markets and downplaying both financial market reactions and diving commodities prices.  The FOMC sets monetary policy on a long-term basis; the full ramifications of their decisions aren\xe2\x80\x99t felt until months or years out, so any contention that the economy is strong enough to handle higher interest rates is essentially an endorsement of macroeconomic policy in the last few years. Democratic candidates will need to hammer this point home - but it is yet to be seen if voters will understand the message that Democratic policies are responsible for the sunny outlook for the American economy, especially compared to Western Europe, Latin America, and Asia.\n>>>>>>>> Below is the first sentence of the FOMC statement from yesterday, edited to reflect changes from last month\'s statement:\n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> For immediate releaserelease at 2:00 p.m. EST\n>>>>>>>> Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in OctoDecember suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pacelabor market conditions improved further even as economic growth slowed late last year. Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at solidmoderate rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft and inventory investment slowed. A range of recent labor market indicators, including ongoistrong job gains and declining unemployment, shows further improvement and confirms that underutilization of labor resources has diminished appreciably since early this year, points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee\'s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; somedeclined further; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged downare little changed, on balance, in recent months.\n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> --------------------\n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> Recent Updates\n>>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>>> The Fed Holds Rates, for Now  (Jan. 28)\n>>>>>>>> Debate Myths Challenged  (Jan. 25)\n>>>>>>>> Regulating the Regulators  (Jan. 21)\n>>>>>>>> Sanders\' Tax/Healthcare Policy  (Jan 20)\n>>>>>>>> HRC\'s Tax Policy  (Jan. 17)\n>>>>>>>> 2016 Tax Agenda on the Hill  (Jan. 16)\n>>>>>>>> Glass-Steagall, Take 2  (Jan. 13)\n>>>>>>>> 2016 Tax Policy Issues  (Jan. 8)\n>>>>>>>> Sanders Proposals/GS & TBTF (Jan. 7)\n>>>>>>>> Sanders\' Fin Reg Proposals  (Jan. 5)\n>>>>>>>> Year-End Review: Fiscal Policy (Jan. 1)  Year-End Review: Fin.

Shelby, Senate Ba=\nnking Chair, introduced the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015, a g=\nrab-bag of exceptions and exemptions from regulations, mostly for banks with=\nbetween $50 and $500 billion in assets. &nbsp;In a similar vein, Sens Warne=\nr, Portman, and Collins introduced the Independent Agency Regulatory Analysi=\ns Act to require that regulators undertake a cost-benefit analysis of any ru=\nles they wish to implement.</span><br><span></span><br><span>On the flip sid=\ne, Sens.

Warren and Vitter teamed up early in 2015 to introd=\nuce a package of amendments to the Federal Reserve Act =E2=80=93- that bill n=\notably would set forward stricter regulations when an entity is considered i=\nnsolvent, and therefore ineligible for Federal Reserve loans, as well as req=\nuire that the Fed lend money to distressed institutions at market rates.</sp=\nan><br><span></span><br><span>The Regulators\' Agenda </span><br><span></span=\n> <br><span>Under Basel III requirements for large banks to satisfy Liquidity=\nCoverage Ratios (LCR) were adopted by a number of national regulators, incl=\nuding the Federal Reserve. &nbsp;While the Fed has floated a rule change all=\nowing some municipal bonds to count as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA), th=\nat hasn=E2=80=99t stopped Rep.

Wyden proposes that the income be repatriated, taxed, and the revenue be used for infrastructure development. &nbsp;A recent bill by Schumer and Brown (below) would tax the foreign income of any company that moves its headquarters overseas. &nbsp;</span><br><span></span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;preventing inversions: &nbsp;&nbsp;Sen. Wyden proposes making the ownership minimum for a corporate inversion 50% (current law is 15%). &nbsp;Reps Levin and Van Hollen have announced legislation to prevent \xe2\x80\x9cearnings stripping\xe2\x80\x9d by reducing the tax preference for interest payments. &nbsp;</span><br><span></span><br><span>Sens. Schumer and Brown have announced they will introduce two pieces of legislation to tackle inversions \xe2\x80\x93 one to impose an exit tax on companies moving their address overseas, and another to limit earnings stripping. &nbsp;The exit tax proposal enforces the full 35 percent tax rate on all foreign earnings for companies that move abroad; their earnings stripping legislation limits the tax-deducibility of interest payments to 25 oercent, down from the current 50 percent. &nbsp;</span><br><span></span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;territorial system: Brady has mentioned repeatedly that the US must adopt a territorial system to remain competitive, whereby earnings from abroad are not taxed in the US. &nbsp;It\xe2\x80\x99s been a perennial favorite of Republicans but likely will remain a non-starter for Democrats. &nbsp;</span><br><span></span><br><span>Corporate Tax Reform</span><br><span></span><br><span>Many issues solved in international tax reform proposals would affect corporate tax reform efforts \xe2\x80\x93 often the two are considered indelibly linked. &nbsp;Prominent policymakers agree that the corporate rate must be lowered, but the final size of the tax and how it is aimed differ.</span><br><span></span><br><span>Republican proposals generally have rates between 0 and 20 percent, with Democrats above those at 24 percent and 28 percent for Wyden and Obama respectively. &nbsp;New rules on depreciations of assets \xe2\x80\x93 specifically replacing the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery Systems with something less generous \xe2\x80\x93 are being floated as well. &nbsp;Ending the tax-deductibility of debt is a dual-purpose proposal \xe2\x80\x93 useful for preventing inversions (see above) as well as encouraging businesses to fund themselves using equity rather than credit.</span><br><span></span><br><span>Earned Income Tax Credit</span><br><span></span><br><span>A favorite of both Democrats and Republicans \xe2\x80\x93 and notable of Paul Ryan and President Obama. &nbsp;They were rumored to discuss the issue during their first meeting, this past February, after Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s ascension to Speaker. &nbsp;</span><br><span></span><br><span>The EITC is a part of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposal for this year; he suggests to expand the EITC for childless workers and create a $500 \xe2\x80\x9csecond earner\xe2\x80\x9d tax credit. The total cost would be $150 billion. Ryan has proposed something that is very similar. In addition to that, there have been five recent congressional proposals (introduced by Senators Sherrod Brown and Richard Durbin, by Rep. Richard Neal, by Rep. Charles Rangel, by Rep. Danny Davis, and by Senators Patty Murray, Jack Reed, and Sherrod Brown) that would substantially strengthen the EITC for childless workers. All of them, including Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s and Obama\xe2\x80\x99s, would lower the eligibility age to 21, and all would raise the maximum credit \xe2\x80\x94 the Obama and Ryan proposals to about $1,000 and the other proposals to somewhat higher amounts.</span><br><span></span><br><span>The recent focus on the issue makes it likely that something will be done on it soon. If Ryan and Obama can work together on this, it will be a bipartisan light in the gridlocked darkness. </span><br><span></span><br><span>Carried Interest </span><br><span></span><br><span>Senator Tammy Baldwin has released a proposal to tax carried interest as a regular income rather than capital gains. &nbsp;Historically this has been a particularly divisive issue, with lawmakers on the right refusing to entertain the idea. &nbsp;However, recently Republicans have begun to soften on this position \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps after seeing the populist sentiment inspired by their presidential candidates\xe2\x80\x99 own call to end the loophole. &nbsp;</span><br><span></span><br><span>Baldwin released her proposal in conjunction with Sander Levin, who released a version of the bill in the House as well. &nbsp;</span><br><span></span><br><span>The Bottom Line</span><br><span></span><br><span>Any piece of tax reform legislation put forward which reduces revenues would have to find a way to offset its costs. &nbsp;In light of the Obama-Boehner deal on spending limits for 2016 this may be a particularly important issue \xe2\x80\x93 especially as GOP leaders try to keep their right flank in order as they tussle over the spending rules. &nbsp;Conversely, any reform which raises revenue will face strong calls from Republicans to fund tax cuts, and from Democrats to fund infrastructure or other initiatives.</span><br><span></span><br><span>As the year drags on the prospects for comprehensive reform dwindle further \xe2\x80\x93 they were never that great to begin with, despite enthusiasm from party leaders. &nbsp;Even the more modest proposals laid out here may be too divisive to survive, especially in a political environment like this one. &nbsp;Senators can\xe2\x80\x99t be blamed for focusing their efforts on Supreme Court nominees, the budget, their own party candidates, and more.</span><br><span></span><br><span>_________________________________</span><br><span></span><br><span>Future/Recent Updates</span><br><span></span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Wednesday -- SIFI Landscape</span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday-- &nbsp;Financial Nominations </span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Friday -- Update on Tax Bills</span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Monday -- &nbsp;Budget Irresolution </span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Tuesday --</span><br><span></span><br><span> \xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;ERI/Housing</span><br><span> \xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;EU/US Derivatives Deal</span><br><span> \xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Pension Crisis</span><br><span></span><br><span>Tax Bills on the Hill (Mar. 11)</span><br><span>Senate Banking Nominations (Mar. 10)</span><br><span>Survey of the SIFI Landscape &nbsp;(Mar. 9)</span><br><span>Michigan and the Meaning of Flint &nbsp;(Mar. 8) Puerto Rico\'s Debt Crisis &nbsp;(Mar. 5)</span><br><span>Municipal Finance Caucus &nbsp;(Mar. 4) </span><br><span>Flint Bill: &nbsp;Provisions &amp; Prospects (Mar. 2) </span><br><span>Top Tax Bills Handicapped &nbsp;(Feb. 24)</span><br><span>Bigger than the Budget Battle &nbsp;(Feb. 23)</span><br><span>Infrastructure Finance Update &nbsp;(Feb. 18) </span><br><span>Does DFA Fail on Too Big to Fail?

Shelby, Senate Banking Chair, introduced the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015, a grab-bag of exceptions and exemptions from regulations, mostly for banks with between $50 and $500 billion in assets. &nbsp;In a similar vein, Sens Warner, Portman, and Collins introduced the Independent Agency Regulatory Analysis Act to require that regulators undertake a cost-benefit analysis of any rules they wish to implement.</span><br><span></span><br><span>On the flip side, Sens. McCain and Warren\xe2\x80\x99s 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act proposes to split commercial and investment banks in a bid to finally kill off the TBTF problem. &nbsp;Sens. Warren and Vitter teamed up early in 2015 to introduce a package of amendments to the Federal Reserve Act \xe2\x80\x93- that bill notably would set forward stricter regulations when an entity is considered insolvent, and therefore ineligible for Federal Reserve loans, as well as require that the Fed lend money to distressed institutions at market rates.</span><br><span></span><br><span>The Regulators\' Agenda </span><br><span></span><br><span>Under Basel III requirements for large banks to satisfy Liquidity Coverage Ratios (LCR) were adopted by a number of national regulators, including the Federal Reserve. &nbsp;While the Fed has floated a rule change allowing some municipal bonds to count as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA), that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped Rep. Luke Messer from proposing HR 2209 to force regulators allow a greater share of munis to count as HQLA (see Update, Feb. 18).</span><br><span></span><br><span>The Fed is also working on implementing a rule on Single-Counterparty Credit Limits (SCCL), setting boundaries on credit exposure between large banks or major counterparties. &nbsp;The rule is meant to prevent banks from becoming overexposed to other financial institutions, preventing them from taking overly large losses in the event that the counterparty fails. &nbsp;Analysts suspect that firms are nearly $100 billion over the limits imposed by this rule, but Yellen says it is necessary to set a \xe2\x80\x9cbright line\xe2\x80\x9d on credit exposure.</span><br><span></span><br><span>SIFIs Moving Forward</span><br><span></span><br><span>There is no doubt that the upcoming MetLife ruling will be a critical pivot point for how regulators interact with SIFIs. &nbsp;If the FSOC is required to retract the firm\xe2\x80\x99s SIFI status it will open the regulator up for a whole slew of challenges from other banks and institutions. &nbsp;The fate of Congressional proposals to restrict regulator\xe2\x80\x99s efforts, either by determining rules for them or by burdening them with regulations of their own, should be seen as the start of a potential sea change in the regulatory climate. &nbsp;During his Monday meeting, President Obama warned of this: "If there is a significant challenge in terms of regulating Wall Street and regulating our financial sector it is primarily coming from certain members of Congress who are consistently pressuring independent regulators to back off.\xe2\x80\x9d</span><br><span></span><br><span>It is not a bad time to be a SIFI in America \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly much better to be one now than in 2010. &nbsp;While DFA has forced restructuring and streamlining to occur, events like the GE Capital sell-off may prove to be exceptions that prove the rule rather than the new normal for SIFIs, especially if MetLife wins its case against regulators. &nbsp;President Obama was right to point to Congress as the cause of regulatory gridlock; the political will seen after the economic collapse has largely evaporated, giving SIFIs far more breathing room and opening up opportunities to push through \xe2\x80\x9cregulatory reform\xe2\x80\x9d measures.</span><br><span></span><br><span>_____________________________________</span><br><span></span><br><span>Upcoming/Recent Updates</span><br><span></span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Thurs -- &nbsp;Financial Reg.

The broad and deep cuts to state and local budgets affected basic public services most profoundly. &nbsp;Now, as a direct cause of these cuts, the residents of Flint are grappling with an issue no American ever considered possible \xe2\x80\x93 they do not have access to fresh drinking water.</span><br><span></span><br><span>For all the talk of federal aid in infrastructure financing there must be a place made for regular tax payers. &nbsp;These people bear a significant portion of direct funding for infrastructure projects both in their states and municipalities. &nbsp;When those tax revenues are redirected, or when state spending is cut to the point that basic services can\xe2\x80\x99t be provided then taxpayers are right to question what, in fact, their taxes are paying for. &nbsp;</span><br><span></span><br><span>Congressional update:</span><br><span></span><br><span>At the insistence of Democrats, the Flint agreement has been attached to a Senate energy bill introduced by Sen. Murkowski, S. 2012, which is next in line in the Senate following the opioid addiction bill. &nbsp;The energy bill will be voted on soon, providing that things moves quickly (not a sure bet, since Dems may want to vote on certain amendments to the opioid bill). &nbsp;Despite these potential hang ups, Senate leadership hopes to wrap up the energy bill by the end of the week \xe2\x80\x93 giving them some breathing room before the Senate adjourns for Easter recess by March 21. </span><br><span></span><br><span>While Sen. Cruz lifted his hold on the bill last week, Mike Lee has continued to block movement on the legislation. &nbsp;Sen. Lee is claiming that federal aid is not necessary to deal with Flint: \xe2\x80\x9cThe state of Michigan has an enormous budget surplus this year and a large rainy-day fund, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars," the Senator said in a statement.</span><br><span></span><br><span>Flint agreement:</span><br><span></span><br><span>The bill provides $250 million to assist the residents of Flint, Michigan and other American cities experiencing critical problems with their water supplies by increasing funding for Drinking Water Act State Revolving Funds and provide start-up funding for the new Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act. &nbsp;It includes:</span><br><span></span><br><span>\xc2\xb7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$100 million for Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs) accessible by any state with a drinking water emergency. &nbsp;It requires states to submit plans explaining how the money will be spent to address the emergency before funding is provided. &nbsp;&nbsp;Funds that remain after 18 months will be distributed to all states under the existing SRF formula. </span><br><span></span><br><span>\xc2\xb7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$70 million in funding to back secured loans made under the new Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA). &nbsp;A federal investment of $70 million could support secured loans of up to $4.2 billion to address water and wastewater infrastructure needs across the country, according to Sen.

Luis Guti\xc3\xa9rrez: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s a joint responsibility, but it seems to me that all of the responsibility is being weighed on the people of Puerto Rico.\xe2\x80\x9d &nbsp;</span><br><span></span><br><span>Meanwhile Republicans claimed that any plan to restructure Puerto Rican debt was a non-starter; a few hours after the hearing the Republican Study Committee announced it would oppose any plan including such a provision. &nbsp;"Changing the rules mid-game would be unfair to Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s creditors who entered into these arrangements with agreed upon terms and would delegitimize future transactions," said RSC Chairman Bill Flores.</span><br><span></span><br><span>Policy Options</span><br><span></span><br><span>Until recently the two parties have maintained starkly contrasting views on how to best deal with Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s debt crisis \xe2\x80\x93 Democrats have pushed for a forced debt restructuring, with some calling for the island to be granted Chapter 9 bankruptcy protections, meanwhile Republicans called for a financial oversight council to make the tough fiscal decisions necessary for Puerto Rico to maintain its debt obligations without reneging on its agreements.</span><br><span></span><br><span>The administration, through Weiss, has advocated a middle of the road approach. By adopting both proposals and avoiding the further edges of each (no bankruptcy, and no unaccountable board staffed by Wall Streeters), the administration hopes to find compromise between each group. &nbsp;And it seems like it might work.</span><br><span></span><br><span>Finding Compromise</span><br><span></span><br><span>Recently, however, the conservative stance against debt restructuring has lessened \xe2\x80\x93 with some Republicans saying that they could support a PR bill as long as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include Chapter 9 bankruptcy. &nbsp;House Natural Resources chair Bob Bishop has been working on a bill for Puerto Rico that does include some element of debt restructuring, and recently said \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure RSC will be satisfied with what we do \xe2\x80\xa6 to say that some element of [debt restructuring] could be in there, yeah.\xe2\x80\x9d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span>The House is still sticking to its end of March deadline set by Speaker Ryan for putting forward a final bill on Puerto Rico on the floor for a vote. </span><br><span></span><br><span>_____________________________________</span><br><span></span><br><span>Upcoming/Recent Updates</span><br><span></span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Thurs -- Municipal Finance Caucus</span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Fri -- Puerto Rico</span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Mon -- FY17</span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Tues -- 13 D Regs</span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Wed -- &nbsp;TBD</span><br><span></span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;SBC Nominations</span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;ERI/Housing</span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Intl Tax Reform</span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;EU/US Derivatives Deal</span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Pension Crisis</span><br><span></span><br><span>Michigan and the Meaning of Flint (Mar 8) Puerto Rico\'s Debt Crisis &nbsp;(Mar. 5)</span><br><span>Municipal Finance Caucus &nbsp;(Mar. 4) </span><br><span>Flint Bill: &nbsp;Provisions &amp; Prospects (Mar. 2) </span><br><span>Top Tax Bills Handicapped &nbsp;(Feb. 24)</span><br><span>Bigger than the Budget Battle &nbsp;(Feb. 23)</span><br><span>Infrastructure Finance Update &nbsp;(Feb. 18) </span><br><span>Does DFA Fail on Too Big to Fail?

Randy Hultgren and Dutch Ruppersberger announced that they have formed the Municipal Finance Caucus to protect the tax-exempt status of municipal debt and reexamine the way it is treated in financial regulations. &nbsp;In 2015, Hultgren and Ruppersberger sent a letter (reprinted below) to House leadership opposing the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposed 28 percent cap on tax deductions for municipal bonds, signed by over 120 of their colleagues. &nbsp;</span><br><span></span><br><span>Their announcement coincided with the National Association of State Treasurers\xe2\x80\x99 legislative conference in D.C. The same group drafted another letter, signed by more than 600 state and local officials, which urges the leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee to reject curbs to the muni exemption. </span><br><span></span><br><span>Who\xe2\x80\x99s in it?</span><br><span></span><br><span>Right now just the founding representatives have declared their official membership, but it\xe2\x80\x99s foreseeable that some of the 120 representatives that signed the letter to House leadership in 2015 will join as well. &nbsp;It\xe2\x80\x99s also seen a s likely that some Senators will want to join the caucus, but the founders haven\'t made clear if bicameral membership is a priority.</span><br><span></span><br><span>Is it Bipartisan?</span><br><span></span><br><span>Since 2013 Hultgren and Ruppersberger have led bipartisan efforts to draft letters of support for municipal bonds. &nbsp;The signatories to these letters include members from both sides of the aisle. &nbsp;Rep. Ruppersberger focuses mostly on local government and is pretty moderate. Rep. Hultgren is a more orthodox conservative Republican. </span><br><span></span><br><span>What\xe2\x80\x99s the Purpose?</span><br><span></span><br><span>The Caucus plans to defend municipal bonds\xe2\x80\x99 tax exempt status and advocate for regulatory changes which favor those bonds. &nbsp;Proposals to limit the tax-exempt status of these bonds have been floated in recent years. </span><br><span></span><br><span>In addition to calling for the bonds to maintain their tax preferred status, the Caucus will push for the passage of HR 2209, legislation considering municipal bonds as a High Quality Liquid Asset (HQLA) \xe2\x80\x93 a particularly contentious issue because of the disagreement over how flexible these liquidity rules should be from a systemic risk perspective. </span><br><span></span><br><span>Positions Taken to Date</span><br><span></span><br><span>The Caucus founders have opposed Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 2015 proposal to cap municipal bond tax exemption at 28 percent. Rep. Hultgren is also a co-sponsor of HR 2209 \xe2\x80\x93 the bill to set the liquidity for municipal bond assets at Level 2A (see Update, Feb. 18). &nbsp;Hultgren said the liquidity rules are an example of how regulators misunderstand municipal bonds, specifically the frequent serial structure of the their issuances.</span><br><span></span><br><span>Many investors flock to municipal bonds for security. But some federal regulators trying to shore up the banking system aren\'t convinced the bonds would be easy to sell in a crisis. </span><br><span></span><br><span>Division of Opinion</span><br><span></span><br><span>Division of opinion on HR 2099 falls along unusual lines, with Wall Street, Congress and municipal officials challenging bank regulators\' skepticism toward municipal debt. &nbsp;&nbsp;At issue are new rules aimed at ensuring banks can raise enough cash during a financial-market meltdown to fund their operations for 30 days. The requirements mean banks have to hold more cash or securities that are easily sellable. </span><br><span></span><br><span>Regulators don\'t think it is the place of Congress to second guess how they size up securities.

Hultgren sponsored a bill last year entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Modernizing American Manufacturing Bonds Act,\xe2\x80\x9d which was focused on expanding opportunities for qualified small issue manufacturing bonds, particularly by changing the national volume cap set by Congress. </span><br><span></span><br><span>What can be achieved?</span><br><span></span><br><span>Caucuses such as this one don\'t have the best reputation when it comes to getting things done. &nbsp;But rules relating to the liquidity value of capital is one of the few policy &nbsp;areas of any kind where there is bipartisan agreement. &nbsp;Municipal bonds, in particular, have a universal appeal because of their direct link to local and state infrastructure projects. &nbsp;At the very least, the caucus will spark some discussion about the best way to both reform existing methods for funding infrastructure investment and find new ways to fund it. </span><br><span></span><br><span>_________________________________</span><br><span></span><br><span>Recent/Planned Updates</span><br><span></span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Thurs -- Municipal Finance Caucus</span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Fri -- Puerto Rico</span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Mon -- FY17</span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Tues -- 13 D Regs</span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Wed -- &nbsp;TBD</span><br><span></span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;SBC Nominations</span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;ERI/Housing</span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Intl Tax Reform</span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;EU/US Derivatives Deal</span><br><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Pension Crisis</span><br><span></span><br><span>Municipal Finance Caucus &nbsp;(Mar. 4) </span><br><span>Flint Bill: &nbsp;Provisions &amp; Prospects (Mar. 2) </span><br><span>Top Tax Bills Handicapped &nbsp;(Feb. 24)</span><br><span>Bigger than the Budget Battle &nbsp;(Feb. 23)</span><br><span>Infrastructure Finance Update &nbsp;(Feb. 18) </span><br><span>Does DFA Fail on Too Big to Fail?

Inhofe, the lead GOP Senator on the bill, called it \xe2\x80\x9ccommon-sense," and noted that the spending is already programmed and involves no supplemental appropriation. &nbsp;&nbsp;The bill may be ready to move forward after Sen. Cruz lifted a hold he had placed on the bill last week. &nbsp;Sen. Mike Lee is still a hold-out. </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>The bill provides $250 million to assist the residents of Flint, Michigan and other American cities experiencing critical problems with their water supplies by increasing funding for Drinking Water Act State Revolving Funds and provide start-up funding for the new Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act. &nbsp;It also provides:</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;$100 million for Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs) accessible by any state with a drinking water emergency. &nbsp;It requires states to submit plans explaining how the money will be spent to address the emergency before funding is provided. &nbsp;&nbsp;Funds that remain after 18 months will be distributed to all states under the existing SRF formula. </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;$70 million in funding to back secured loans made under the new Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA). &nbsp;A federal investment of $70 million could support secured loans of up to $4.2 billion to address water and wastewater infrastructure needs across the country, according to Sen. Inhofe\xe2\x80\x99s office. &nbsp;All states and all communities with clean water and drinking water infrastructure needs are eligible for this assistance. </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;$50 million for various in authorized health programs for national use to address and prevent impacts from exposure to lead. </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Where will the money come from? &nbsp;&nbsp;The package has been fully paid for -- it redirects appropriations by taking funds from the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Fund, which offers loans for auto companies. </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Does that matter? &nbsp;&nbsp;Per Sen. Inhofe \xe2\x80\x9c[the ATVM is] a failed program that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been used in more than a year and has only issued five loans since 2008."</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>More on ATVM: The ATVM program is authorized to award up to $25 billion in loans; there is no deadline for completing such loan commitments. Congress funded the program in 2009, when it appropriated $7.5 billion to cover the subsidy cost for the $25 billion in loans, as well as $10 million for program implementation. Since the start of the program, DOE has awarded $8.4 billion in loans to five companies. As of January 2015, ATVM has $16.6 billion in remaining loan authority. No new loans have been made since 2011. Two companies \xe2\x80\x94 Fisker and the Vehicle Production Group \xe2\x80\x94 were unable to make payments on their loans, and DOE auctioned the loans off in the fall of 2013. Tesla paid off all of its loan in 2013, nine years ahead of schedule. </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Criticisms of ATVM: The unobligated funds remaining for the program have been a point of contention in recent appropriations debates. The House has voted several times to transfer some of the unused appropriation for the ATVM subsidy costs to other purposes. None of these transfers were enacted. Other legislators have sought to expand the program. Two recent federal reports call for rescinding the program\xe2\x80\x99s unobligated balance: the FY2015 budget resolution reported by the House Budget Committee calls for outright rescission, and an April 2014 GAO report recommends Congress consider taking the same step unless DOE can generate new demand for the program.</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Legislative Strategy: &nbsp;&nbsp;Architects of the bipartisan deal put out a hotline request to see if anyone would object to a series of procedural moves that would split Flint aid off the energy bill (S. 2012), attach it to a House bill (H.R. 4470) sponsored by Reps. Dan Kildee and Fred Upton, allow voice votes on 30 amendments to the energy bill, and allow roll call votes on eight additional amendments. Michigan Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters said Democrats are on board, but in order to achieve unanimous consent, Republicans need to sign on. </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Will it pass? &nbsp;The Flint package and the energy bill amendments would come to a vote only after the Senate gets unanimous consent to some procedural maneuvers. Lee\'s hold went unnoticed earlier when GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz had a hold of his own, which he has now lifted. The Senate had hoped to hold votes on Flint and end debate on the energy bill as early as next week. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>What\xe2\x80\x99s Next? &nbsp;&nbsp;Sen. Stabenow, a key leader on the bill, predicted that \xe2\x80\x9cone way or another\xe2\x80\x9d the package would be voted on in the Senate this week. &nbsp;And while the House hasn\'t decided what it will do if the Flint bill clears the Senate, Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton said it would move quickly.</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>The Obama administration, which declared Flint a federal emergency in January freeing up much-needed funds for the distressed city, has not issued an official stance on the Flint deal. &nbsp;Early in the year the President also made available to the state of Michigan $80 million from a revolving fund for infrastructure repair and improvement. &nbsp;</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>A number of important events are scheduled for the month of March, listed below.</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;March 3 -- Flint is supposed to begin its lead service line replacement project.</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;March 6 -- The 7th Democratic debate will take place in the city of Flint, MI. &nbsp;</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;March 15 -- &nbsp;House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will hold its next hearing on the Flint crisis. &nbsp;On schedule is testimony on the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) by various policy professionals.</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;March 17 -- &nbsp;Hearings resume on SDWA oversight, with Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy scheduled to testify.</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Upcoming/Recent Updates</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Wed -- Flint </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Thurs -- Municipal Finance Caucus</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Fri -- Puerto Rico</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Budget Irresolution</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;13 D Regs</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;ERI/Housing</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Intl Tax Reform</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;EU/US Derivatives Deal</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Pension Crisis</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Flint Bill: &nbsp;Provisions &amp; Prospects (Mar. 2) </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Top Tax Bills Handicapped &nbsp;(Feb. 24)</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Bigger than the Budget Battle &nbsp;(Feb. 23)</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Infrastructure Finance Update &nbsp;(Feb. 18) </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Does DFA Fail on Too Big to Fail?

Without bonds, these governments will lose a significant source of their funding. &nbsp;Per Indiana State Treasurer Kelly Mitchell: \xe2\x80\x9cThis bill helps ensure cash-strapped school districts and municipalities will continue to have access to bonds to finance projects they think are best for their communities.\xe2\x80\x9d </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Rep. Luke Messer, an Indiana Republican who wrote the bill: &nbsp;\xe2\x80\x9cPut simply, our bill requires the federal government to recognize the obvious, that our municipal bonds are some of the safest investments in the world and that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have rules that give preferential treatment to corporate bonds or other countries\xe2\x80\x99 bonds over our own.\xe2\x80\x9d </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>After passing the House with unanimous bipartisan support, a companion bill is expected to be introduced in the Senate this year. &nbsp;</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Municipal Bond Issue</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>After the crisis of 2008, federal regulators adopted international banking standards that require banks to have enough "High-Quality Liquid Assets" to cover their cash outflows for 30 days in case of a future financial meltdown. &nbsp;Now, municipal bonds are not considered liquid assets and therefore cannot be included under the &nbsp;LCR. &nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, financial institutions have been discouraged from holding municipal debt, which means that cash strapped municipalities and school districts may eventually be forced to reduce or even stop work on projects &nbsp;financed with municipal bonds. </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Infrastructure Financing -- Alternative Financing</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Tax-exempt bonds: &nbsp;Exemption from federal taxes and many state and local taxes is possible through the use of municipal bonds. &nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, with the increasing use of PPPs, barriers to this tax exemption have arisen. &nbsp;Treasury has reviewed relevant tax rules and based on their findings and have put forth a proposal for an expanded and permanent America Fast Forward Bond Program as an alternative to tax-exempt bonds. &nbsp;Based on the successful Build America Bond program, \xe2\x80\x9cwould provide an efficient borrowing subsidy to state and local governments while appealing to a broader investor base than traditional tax-exempt bonds [and] would cover a broad range of projects for which tax-exempt bonds can be used.\xe2\x80\x9d </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;Obama\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposal: &nbsp;Obama has also put forth a plan to strengthen local and state government infrastructure projects. His plan relies on a new Federal credit program to support public-private partnerships within the Department of the Treasury. It will provide direct loans to US infrastructure projects developed through PPPs. The Obama Administration believes that private investment is crucial for infrastructure development moving forward, so there should be more flexibility in regards to what PPP is subject to. In addition to that, President Obama has proposed the taxable, direct-pay America Fast Forward bond program to help finance infrastructure. &nbsp;</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>State Infrastructure Banks</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Local governments receive financing in a number of ways. &nbsp;Traditional sources such as tax revenues have been dwindling and local authorities have been relying on federal government loan programs, public-private partnerships, and State Revolving Funds (SRFs). &nbsp;State Infrastructure Banks (SIBs) are a subset of SRFs -- the funds act like a bank, because they don\xe2\x80\x99t own the infrastructure asset, but act as a lender or guarantor to the project sponsor. Per Brookings: &nbsp;\xe2\x80\x9cSRFs rely on principal repayments, bonds, interest and fees to re-capitalize and replenish the fund as a perpetual source of debt financing.\xe2\x80\x9d</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>SIBs generate more investment per dollar than traditional federal and state grant programs. &nbsp;They only exist in 33 states and 10 of those SIBs are currently inactive. A large problem may be compliance with federal regulations. &nbsp;Brookings again: </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\x9cWe found that many SIB officials cite compliance with federal regulations as slowing down the investment process either because of environmental and contractual requirements or due to the lack of flexibility in projects that are not Title 23 or 49 eligible. For states with smaller projects, this may be prohibitively costly compared to the advantage of using the low-cost SIB financing.\xe2\x80\x9d </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Just being called a bank subjects SIBs to regulations that commercial banks are subject to. &nbsp;SIBs are non-for-profit organizations with a goal of increasing infrastructure investment, so they don\xe2\x80\x99t quite fit into the category of the average bank. &nbsp;SIBs may be more successful outside this classification. &nbsp;</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>For or Against Dodd-Frank</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Before Dodd-Frank, particularly in the case of relatively small municipalities, many underwriters forged long-term relationships with municipalities and would provide financial advice before and after a bond issuance. &nbsp;With Dodd-Frank, that relationship changed, with a new \xe2\x80\x9cmunicipal adviser\xe2\x80\x9d category that must register with the SEC and be regulated by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSR). &nbsp;Now, it is widely illegal to provide advice to governmental entities concerning the issuance of municipal bonds, the use of financial derivatives, and the investment of the proceeds of a bond issue to, or on behalf, of a municipal entity or an obligated person unless the adviser is registered with the SEC. </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>HR 2209 appears to address a problem within Dodd-Frank, but it is unclear if it vitiates the law materially. &nbsp;At face value, it appears to be more a technical fix. Dodd-Frank expanded regulations for banking institutions, but the entities that fund state and local governments are far unlike the TBTF institutions that Dodd-Frank was meant to regulate. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Groups like Americans for Financial Reform oppose HR 2209: \xe2\x80\x9cWhile we sympathize with the belief that municipal debt was incorrectly treated under the initial LCR rule, we believe that it is inappropriate to classify such debt as a Level 2A asset. AFR therefore opposes this bill unless a more appropriate liquidity classification is used.\xe2\x80\x9d &nbsp;AFR has previously said it supports treating municipal bonds as more liquid and does not approve the type of classification used in HR 2209, because it goes too far in its treatment of municipal debt as level 2A liquid assets and specifically with micromanaging regulators with this kind of detail and they prefer a Level 2B classification. </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>The bill could provide relief for smaller institutions, so that they can fund infrastructure investment more easily. In terms of Dodd-Frank, it is yet to be decided if it is simply a necessary tweak or a criticism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Looking Ahead</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>HR 2209 could end up being an important issue in the national infrastructure discussion. &nbsp;It brings up questions about how far a state or local government can go before its activities begin to resemble an actual bank. &nbsp;With the growth of PPPs, the private sector is being even more integrated into the process \xe2\x80\x93 should those companies be given tax exemptions, as well? </span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>Upcoming/Recent Updates</span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><span>\xe2\x80\xa2 &nbsp;Derivatives Agreement w.

explain the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s, actually the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\xe2\x80\x99s, analysis and projections regarding America\'s economic performance as well as to signal the factors underlying its actions in the months ahead. &nbsp;</span><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><span>The rate change in December 2015 was the first time the Fed raised rates since 2006 -- some worry that even a modest increase in rates at this juncture would further slow already limited economic growth after years of uncertainty.</span><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><span>The Basics</span><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><span>The bottom line: the FOMC won\xe2\x80\x99t rollback rates in March and it\xe2\x80\x99s not likely to raise them either. &nbsp;The Fed likes what it sees in the labor market, wage growth looks strong, and emerging market missteps continue to be a threat to the US economy but perhaps not an immediate one. &nbsp;The next rate move is almost certain to be an increase but it could wait until June or later. </span><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><span>Yellen reiterated much of the FOMC statement from last month: &nbsp;the labor market remains strong, but shows some signs of remaining slack, that the low inflation we have seen is caused by \xe2\x80\x9ctransitory\xe2\x80\x9d effects (low energy prices), and that global market uncertainty creates some level of risk for slow growth at home and abroad. &nbsp;Though Yellen did not make a prediction on how long these transitory market effects would last, a number of forecasts for oil prices show the dip lasting through 2016.</span><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><span>Expanding on global growth issues, Yellen said "These developments, if they prove persistent, could weigh on the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, although declines in longer-term interest rates and oil prices could provide some offset," she added: "Foreign economic developments, in particular, pose risks to US economic growth." </span><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote

(lower) Fed rates. &nbsp;&nbsp;High-net-worth individuals benefit the most from high rates through dividends and interest from savings. &nbsp;Low rates allow more growth for the middle- and lower-classes at the risk of inflation, tacitly supporting Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 progressive fiscal policy goals. &nbsp;Some conservative economists have gone so far as to blame low interest rates pushed by the Fed in the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s for the market meltdown in 2007, claiming that cheap credit was the cause of the overheated housing

pointed to the cumulative increase in employment since 2010 of 13 million jobs. &nbsp;The rate in January fell to 4.9 percent, 0.8 points below its level one year ago; measures of labor market conditions such as the number of people who are working part-time but want to move to full-time positions and the number of individuals who want to work but haven\xe2\x80\x99t searched recently are also decreasing steadily. &nbsp;Regarding these broader labor market indicators Yellen testified that \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6 these measures remain above the levels seen prior to the recession, suggesting that some slack in labor markets remains. Thus, while labor market conditions have improved substantially, there is still room for further sustainable improvement."</span><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><span>Forward Guidance</span><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><span>As always, Yellen was careful not to give hints on what the Fed is planning to do in future meetings; speaking on the path forward for the Fed Funds rate Yellen said \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, monetary policy is by no means on a preset course. The actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on what incoming data tell us about the economic outlook, and we will regularly reassess what level of the federal funds rate is consistent with achieving and maintaining maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.\xe2\x80\x9d</span><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><span>Yellen was asked about the chances of the FOMC rolling back the rate hike it announced in December: &nbsp;"I do not expect the FOMC is going to be soon in the situation where it\'s necessary to cut rates If the FOMC delayed the start of policy normalization for too long, it might have to tighten policy relatively abruptly in the future to keep the economy from overheating and inflation from significantly overshooting its objective.

Her answer was interesting, because she\'s not outright saying the banks will be broken up or reduced, just that the Fed is trying to ensure that even if they did fail, it wouldn\'t negatively effect the economy.</span><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><span>Yellen was also asked about the burden of new Dodd-Frank regulations on banks. She responded: "For our part, we\'re focused on doing everything that we conceivably can to minimize and reduce the burden on these banking organizations. We\'ve been conducting an EGRPRA review to identify potential burdens that our regulations impose." An EGRPRA review is connected to the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, which requires regulations imposed on financial institutions to be reviewed by the agencies at least once every 10 years. The purpose is to prevent burdensome regulations that could hinder a bank\'s ability to serve its customers. </span><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote

type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><span>Fed watchers make their living by trying to predict what the FOMC will or won\xe2\x80\x99t do at their meetings, and on days when Yellen is scheduled to testify before Congress you can bet that they\xe2\x80\x99re listening intently. &nbsp;While Yellen was careful not to project the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s moves, the general sentiment in the markets is that FOMC won\xe2\x80\x99t be raising rates at its March meeting. &nbsp;The CME Group FedWatch tool, which estimates FOMC rate hikes based on its futures prices, predicts a 95% probability that the Fed will maintain its current rate target in March. &nbsp;Some forecasters go even further -- expecting that the funds rate won\xe2\x80\x99t be raised all year. </span><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><span></span><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><span>Traders see the ongoing economic struggles of emerging economies, particularly in China, as evidence that the Fed won\xe2\x80\x99t continue with its scheduled 4 rate hikes this year. &nbsp;Certainly, considering the testimony today that 1) continued emerging market uncertainty can weigh down the US economy and 2) that poor performance in the US economy would cause the Fed to change course on its rate hike schedule, a link between poor emerging market performance and fewer Fed rate hikes seems plausible. &nbsp;Certainly the trading on Fed fund futures indicates that the markets believe this is the case.</span><br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote

Warren and Vitter teamed up early in 2015 to introd=</span><br><span>uce a package of amendments to the Federal Reserve Act =E2=80=93- that bill n=</span><br><span>otably would set forward stricter regulations when an entity is considered i=</span><br><span>nsolvent, and therefore ineligible for Federal Reserve loans, as well as req=</span><br><span>uire that the Fed lend money to distressed institutions at market rates.&lt;/sp=</span><br><span>an&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Regulators\' Agenda &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span=</span><br><blockquote type="cite"><span>&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Under Basel III requirements for large banks to satisfy Liquidity=</span><br></blockquote><span>Coverage Ratios (LCR) were adopted by a number of national regulators, incl=</span><br><span>uding the Federal Reserve. &amp;nbsp;While the Fed has floated a rule change all=</span><br><span>owing some municipal bonds to count as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA), th=</span><br><span>at hasn=E2=80=99t stopped Rep.

here, the path for Puerto Rico toward ca=</span><br><span>pital markets after anything of the sort would still be an especially painfu=</span><br><span>l one (see: Argentina). &amp;nbsp;Additionally, there are few serious proposals t=</span><br><span>o grant the island full Chapter 9 status. &amp;nbsp;Most opt instead for some fo=</span><br><span>rm of negotiated haircut agreement combined with extending maturities on the=</span><br><span>bonds;

But some federal regulators trying to shor=</span><br><span>e up the banking system aren\'t convinced the bonds would be easy to sell in a=</span><br><span>crisis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Division of Opinion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sp=</span><br><span>an&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Division of opinion on HR 2099 falls along unusual lines=</span><br><span>, with Wall Street, Congress and municipal officials challenging bank regula=</span><br><span>tors\' skepticism toward municipal debt. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At issue are new rules a=</span><br><span>imed at ensuring banks can raise enough cash during a financial-market meltd=</span><br><span>own to fund their operations for 30 days. The requirements mean banks have t=</span><br><span>o hold more cash or securities that are easily sellable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/=</span><br><span>span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regulators don\'t think it is the place of Congress to second g=</span><br><span>uess how they size up securities. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, at a congress=</span><br><span>ional hearing Feb. 11, said legislation would "interfere with our supervisor=</span><br><span>y judgments." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Big banks such as Citigroup I=</span><br><span>nc. and Wells Fargo &amp;amp; Co. have sprung into action in lobbying Congress, a=</span><br><span>long with municipal leaders who fret the rules will diminish bank bond-buyin=</span><br><span>g which could raise borrowing costs on infrastructure projects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;s=</span><br><span>pan&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hultgren also said the caucus will work to update the n=</span><br><span>umber of projects that could be financed by qualified small issue manufactur=</span><br><span>ing bonds, a type of private-activity bond whose proceeds can be used to fin=</span><br><span>ance manufacturing facilities for small- and mid-sized manufacturers. The ta=</span><br><span>x code provisions on small industrial development bonds have not been change=</span><br><span>d since the 1980s, he said. Hultgren sponsored a bill last year entitled =E2=</span><br><span>=80=9CThe Modernizing American Manufacturing Bonds Act,=E2=80=9D which was f=</span><br><span>ocused on expanding opportunities for qualified small issue manufacturing bo=</span><br><span>nds, particularly by changing the national volume cap set by Congress. &lt;/spa=</span><br><span>n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;What can be achieved?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b=</span><br><span>r&gt;&lt;span&gt;Caucuses such as this one don\'t have the best reputation when it com=</span><br><span>es to getting things done. &amp;nbsp;But rules relating to the liquidity value o=</span><br><span>f capital is one of the few policy &amp;nbsp;areas of any kind where there is bi=</span><br><span>partisan agreement. &amp;nbsp;Municipal bonds, in particular, have a universal a=</span><br><span>ppeal because of their direct link to local and state infrastructure project=</span><br><span>s. &amp;nbsp;At the very least, the caucus will spark some discussion about the b=</span><br><span>est way to both reform existing methods for funding infrastructure investmen=</span><br><span>t and find new ways to fund it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;__________=</span><br><span>_______________________&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recent/Planned Upda=</span><br><span>tes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;=E2=80=A2 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Thurs -- Municipa=</span><br><span>l Finance Caucus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;=E2=80=A2 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Fri -- Puerto Rico&lt;/s=</span><br><span>pan&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;=E2=80=A2 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mon -- FY17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;=E2=80=A2 &amp;n=</span><br><span>bsp;&amp;nbsp;Tues -- 13 D Regs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;=E2=80=A2 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Wed -- &amp;nb=</span><br><span>sp;TBD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt; &amp;nbsp;=E2=80=A2 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SBC Nom=</span><br><span>inations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt; &amp;nbsp;=E2=80=A2 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ERI/Housing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;=</span><br><span>&lt;span&gt; &amp;nbsp;=E2=80=A2 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Intl Tax Reform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt; &amp;nbsp;=E2=</span><br><span>=80=A2 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;EU/US Derivatives Deal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt; &amp;nbsp;=E2=80=A2 &amp;=</span><br><span>nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Pension Crisis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Municipal Finance=</span><br><span>Caucus &amp;nbsp;(Mar. 4) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Flint Bill: &amp;nbsp;Provisions &amp;amp; P=</span><br><span>rospects (Mar. 2) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Top Tax Bills Handicapped &amp;nbsp;(Feb. 24)=</span><br><span>&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bigger than the Budget Battle &amp;nbsp;(Feb. 23)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sp=</span><br><span>an&gt;Infrastructure Finance Update &amp;nbsp;(Feb. 18) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Does DFA Fa=</span><br><span>il on Too Big to Fail?

Since the start of the progra=</span><br><span>m, DOE has awarded $8.4 billion in loans to five companies. As of January 20=</span><br><span>15, ATVM has $16.6 billion in remaining loan authority. No new loans have be=</span><br><span>en made since 2011. Two companies =E2=80=94 Fisker and the Vehicle Productio=</span><br><span>n Group =E2=80=94 were unable to make payments on their loans, and DOE aucti=</span><br><span>oned the loans off in the fall of 2013.

None of these transfers were ena=</span><br><span>cted. Other legislators have sought to expand the program.
