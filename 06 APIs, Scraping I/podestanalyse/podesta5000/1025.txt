You're a genius!\n\n \n\nThe Clean Power Plan constitutes a powerful way to incorporate themes that\nwill solidify Obama's legacy and help HRC win in 2016:\n\n \n\n*         Spurring innovation\n\n*         Developing new technology\n\n*         Encouraging entrepreneurialism\n\n*         Enhancing education\n\n*         Increasing jobs\n\n*         Reducing inequality\n\n*         Promoting corporate, industrial, and national competitiveness\n\n*         Ensuring sustainability\n\n*         Reducing global warming\n\n*         Strengthening the U.S. global leadership role on energy,\nenvironment, and climate change\n\n*         Showing how the GOP Establishment, by opposing it, is so out of\ntouch with the future\n\n \n\nThis makes great sense economically and politically, and can appeal to many\nindependents, some Republicans, and the enlightened business community.\n\n \n\nMy only advice is that you ensure that the full potential of the Plan is\nrealized through effective presentation, explanation, and marketing so the\nvoters will understand and appreciate it.\n\n \n\nCheers!\n\n \n\nGlen\n\n"
