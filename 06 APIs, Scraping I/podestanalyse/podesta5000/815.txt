john.podesta@gmail.comb'In advance of our call today, I am circulating a number of the documents we\nhave been working on.  Most of these documents are the same as the ones we\nhad last week with a few exceptions.\n\nWe have updated the Political org chart to make the constituency desks a\ndirect report to the the Political Program Director.  This change is in the\nppt and the leadership council doc.\n\nI have also attached a new document that was developed in concert with\nComms, Paid Media and Huma on Wednesday.  This document is called Jan\nStrategy Memo.\n\nThanks,\nHeather\n'
