Though this ranking system has significant flaws, I wanted to update you on where CAP stands.\n\n\n\nThe results were just released and I\x92m proud to say that CAP is currently ranked 19th in the \x93Top Think Tanks Worldwide (US & Non-US)\x94 category. We moved up six spots this year, and eleven spots over the last two years. We rank 9th in the \x93Top Think Tanks in the United States\x94 category, up one spot from last year. We are also the youngest institution in the top 10. For context on how far we\x92ve come over the years, in 2008 \x96 the first year in which the report mirrored its present format \x96 CAP ranked 17th among US think tanks.\n\n\n\nTwo other noticeable areas of improvement are our jumps to 1st place from 9th in the \x93Best Use of Social Networks\x94 category and to 7th from 11th for \x93Think Tanks with the Best Use of Media.\x94 Our policy rankings also stayed strong, placing us 8th for domestic economic policy, 7th for health policy, 7th for social policy and 8th for innovate policy ideas/proposals. In some areas, we have room to grow, including defense and national security where we rank 25th, and foreign policy and international affairs, where we landed 16th; it\x92s a sign of the oddity of the rankings that there's a substantial gap between these two rankings. It\x92s also worth noting that the media and policy categories are ranked against the global competition, not just US-based think tanks.\n\n\n\nWhile I believe these rankings are imperfectly derived, I wanted to share them because the rankings are shared widely.\n\n\n\nYou can read the full report here<http://repository.upenn.edu/think_tanks/10/> if you are interested.\n\n\n\nThank you as always for all that you do for CAP.\n\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\nNeera\n\n\n"
