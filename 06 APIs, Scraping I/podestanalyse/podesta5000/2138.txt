There are both an institutional statement and a place for any who wish to place their personal comments. Many of you have shared thoughtful and touching statements among our e-mail group, and I encourage you to share them again on this site for a broader readership. The links are below:\n\nFull Statement: http://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/georgetown-law-mourns-loss-professor-warren-schwartz.cfm\n\nIn Memoriam Page: http://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/in-memoriam/warren-schwartz/index.cfm\n\nComments can be submitted here: http://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/in-memoriam-form/new-form.cfm\n\n     Once again, the funeral will be today at 3 pm  at the Torshinsky Funeral Home, 254 Carroll St, Washington DC. , which is very close to the Takoma Metro stop.\n\nPeace,\n\nPeter\n\n\n\n'
