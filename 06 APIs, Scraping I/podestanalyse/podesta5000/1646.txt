We have invited full proposals from 39 of the almost 200 letters of inquiry we received in response to our request for proposals - 26 academic proposals and 13 doctoral.  We are thrilled with the quality and diversity of projects. Full proposals were due in April and are currently out for external review.  Reviews will be compiled and we will complete our internal review process in the coming weeks.\n\nWe will make a preliminary decision on awards the first week in June, at which point we will send full proposals to you for your review.  The purpose of the call in mid-June will be to discuss the projects and gain your approval on our second cohort of grantees.\n\nBelow are the call time slots that we have worked out internally and with the Sandler Foundation.  Please do let me know at your earliest convenience which slot(s) are best for you, knowing that we will only use one hour of the time.  As soon as we have a quorum, I will send a follow-up confirmation to this email.\n\nJune Call Possibilities:\n\nTuesday June 9\n1 hr between 2:30 - 4:30 pm EDT (11:30 am - 1:30 pm PDT)\n\nWednesday June 10 (Preferred, if possible)\n1 hr between 4-6 pm EDT (1-3 pm PDT)\n\nDial In:\n1-888-387-8686, passcode 3269404\n\nMany thanks for your time and we look forward to sharing more information with you the first week of June.\n\nBest,\nEryn\n\nEryn M.
