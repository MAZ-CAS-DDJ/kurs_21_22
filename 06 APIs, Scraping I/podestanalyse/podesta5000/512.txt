But publicly the all\nbut certain Republican nominee is putting his energy into talking about the\nenergy crisis [\x85] Dana, what was McCain\'s basic message today?\n\nDANA BASH: You know it was really interesting Wolf. McCain declared himself\nthe underdog today. That\'s an age-old political move to try to lower\nexpectations but he was also trying to get over his campaign\'s latest\ndifficulty in avoiding be associated with a controversial figure.\n\n[Beginning of Segment]\n\nBASH: A hastily arranged press conference at his campaign headquarters. John\nMcCain wanted to get in the news with a new idea for voter\'s pain at the\npump: allowing states to drill for oil off-shore.\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: Providing additional incentives for states to permit\nexploration off their coasts, would be very helpful in the short term, in\nresolving our energy crisis. That announcement was moved up to try to drive\nthe day\'s story, not be driven by the day\'s campaign fumble that McCain had\nto cancel a Monday fundraiser at the home of Texas Republican Clayton\nWilliams after the campaign was questioned about William\'s controversial\ncomments about women during his 1990 Texas Governors race. Then Williams\ncompared bad weather to rape, saying, "as long at it\'s inevitable, you might\nas well lie back and enjoy it."\n\n[Video of Dana Bash asking McCain a question]\n\nBASH: How did it come to pass that you had this fundraiser planned?\n\nMCCAIN: First of all, my people are not aware of a statement that he made 16\nor 18 years ago. I\'ve forgotten how many years ago it was.\n\n[Back to Segment]\n\nBASH: But a Lexis-Nexis search for what Williams\' is know for in politics,\nhis 1990 Governor\'s race, comes up with multiple references to his comments\nabout women. It was a big campaign issue because he was running against a\nwoman, Ann Richards.\n\n[Old Footage of Ann Richards]\nANN RICHARDS: When I hear remarks like Clayton Williams made, I don\'t care\nwhether it\'s made around a campfire or in a living room or in a formal\nspeech, it indicates a level of thinking that is an embarrassment.\n\n[End Footage]\n\nBASH: Williams is just the latest vetting problem for McCain. Last month\nMcCain rejected endorsements from Pastors John Hagee and Rod Parsley, after\nmonths of controversy around their views of Catholics and Muslims.\n\n[\x85]\n\nBASH: And that fundraiser, originally slated for today will be rescheduled\nfor a new location other than Williams\' house later this summer. McCain made\nclear he won\'t return $300,000 William\'s helped raise, saying "those donor\nare his supporters" and McCain did not answer whether he thinks this will\nhave any impact on his big push Wolf for those women voters. Those women\nvoters, of course, he\'s trying really hard for, in light of Hillary\nClinton\'s defeat.\n\n\nHighlight #2\n*Fox News\' Cavuto Calls Out McCain for Double Talk on Domestic Oil Drilling,\nDonatelli Admits McCain\'s Removal of Drilling Moratorium "May Be a Punt, But\nIt\'s a Long Punt"* (FNC 06/16/08 4:34pm)\nNEIL CAVUTO: Sen John McCain will call tomorrow to lift the moratorium on\nstates that choose to permit exploration off their shores. Carl Cameron,\nwhat\'s going on here?\n\nCARL CAMERON: Sen McCain\'s gonna go to Texas, the heart of the American oil\nindustry, and deliver a speech that does create some real challenges for\nhim. Over the course of this campaign, Sen McCain has suggested that CEO pay\nis disproportionate and way out of whack in the oil industry; the oil\nindustries have been profit-taking and gouging consumers. He\'s even gone so\nfar as to suggest that rising gas prices amount to the equivalent of\ndomestic terrorism, although obviously he was making a sort of hyperbolic\npolitical reference there. *Tomorrow Sen McCain will make this speech. He\nwill beat up on the oil industry but also offer them some oil branches,\nolive branches.* One of them will be to lift the moratoria\x97and there\'s a\nwhole series of them\x97on offshore drilling around the country. Now, there\'s a\nlot of states that do have offshore drilling and have not been eager to\nincrease it. There\'s an awful lot of states that don\'t and have absolutely\nno interest in additional\x97it\'s the "not in my backyard" Nimby syndrome. Sen\nMcCain believes that more oil production in the United States is necessary.\nHe is a big, big believer in increasing nuclear energy, as well as renewable\nfuels. He fancies himself the most green, most environmentally-friendly\nRepublican nominee the GOP\'s ever seen. So tomorrow he goes to Texas to talk\nabout that, and he\'s not suggesting that states must drill offshore; he\'s\nonly saying that by lifting the federal moratorium on new drilling they\nwould have a choice and he\'d leave it to them.\n\nCAVUTO: [\x85] *So why do so many feel the Straight Talk Express is having it\nboth ways on this drilling issue: drill more at sea but not on land in\nplaces like the Everglades or ANWR*? Frank Donatelli is a McCain adviser and\na deputy chair of the RNC, RNC\'s no double speak here. That is the part that\nconfuses me. You know: water \x96 fine, have at it, let the states decide, but\ndon\'t touch the land. Am I reading him right?\n\nFRANK DONATELLI: Well no. I think it\'s a moderate position. There are many,\nmany different factors that you have to consider. But when it comes to\ndrilling offshore, the key point to make is, number one, there\'s lots of oil\nand gas there. Number two, can be reached relatively quickly. And when we\'re\nin a [\x85] supply-side crisis like we are, where the price of gasoline\ncontinues to go up it seems without end, It seems that going to the outer\ncontinental shelf and urging stje tates to participate in this, possibly\nwith financial incentives,is the way to get more oil and gas online in the\nquickest way possible.\n\nCAVUTO: But Frank, you know, it confuses a lot of folks who say, well what\nis it? *You\'re gonna explore for more oil? Well yeah I am but in water,\nessentially and not on land. And then people scratch their heads and say,\nwell wait a minute, Straight Talk Express, this ain\'t clear.*\n\nDONATELLI: Well, I think it\'s a question of getting the job done. As I say,\nmost people believe that there\'s lots of oil and gas supplies off of our\nshores that could be reached quickly. The other thing to remember is that we\nnow have a federal ban in place, and the first thing that has to be done [\x85]\nis to get the federal ban lifted. [\x85] Let\' s understand that what Sen Obama\nfavors apparently is to allow gas prices to continue to increase and\nincrease. And when McCain is trying to say with his speeches is wait a\nminute, we\'ve already reached the point where gas prices are far too high.\nIn the short- and medium-term, the best way to counterbalance that is to\nincrease supply and the best way to do that is to allow, under proper\ncircumstances, drilling in the outer continental shelf.\n\nCAVUTO: But it\'s at the edges, Frank.  And I think where most Americans step\nback and say Barack Obama and John McCain are against drilling in ANWR;\nthey\'re against drilling in the continental United States. They are against,\nyou know, ripping up the land. That\'s fine, [\x85] have at it. What isn\'t clear\nis whether John McCain\' s even short-term solution\x97for example, removing the\nfederal gas tax; or saying jump-ball have the states decide this and having\n50 states or the most affected states on the coast decide how they\'re gonna\nhandle exploration of oil off of their coasts. [\x85] *That\'s my impression of\nit. He\'s just punting. He hasn\'t decided or said anything of substance.*\n\nDONATELLI: *Well, it may be a punt but it\'s a long punt.* Because to [\x85]\nremove the federal ban against drilling off of all of our coast and to\nhopefully get state participation\x97and by the way, I think [\x85] $4.50 gas [\x85]\nhas concentrated the minds of maybe some voters and in some cases some\nlegislatures.\n\nCAVUTO: Yeah, but I tell you, it\'s not in Florida, it\'s not in California.\nUnder Republican and Democratic governors alike, they\'ve always said no no\nno no. [\x85] I think the senator knows that if i punt and give back to them,\nthey\'re gonna just do nothing.\n\nDONATELLI: But again, we haven\'t had these kind of gas prices before. And we\nhave not had a proposal that the state should possibly be able to share in\nthe royalty revenue in some way. You\'ve got a lot of states hurting for\nadditional revenue. And we have a national crisis here. [\x85] These are\nextraordinary times. And if we\'re going to break this cycle of gas prices\n$4, $5, $6 a barrel, this is a very practical short-term way to do it.\nSenator Obama is not for it.\n\nCAVUTO: Alright, we shall see. What you say about the states could\npotentially share in revenue, that could be a real deal-maker. Always good\nseeing you.\n\n\nHighlight #3\n*McCain\'s Pro-Life Record Will Hurt Him with the Female Vote *(MSNBC\n06/16/08 05:38pm)\nCHRIS MATTHEWS: John McCain continues to speak glowingly about Hillary\nClinton in an obvious effort to court Clinton supporters. But are Clinton\'s\nwomen voters so disillusioned by their democratic candidates lost that they\nare willing to desert their party and go vote for Republican John McCain\ninstead. [\x85] Senator Obama is beating John McCain among women by 19 points,\nwhite women by 7 but McCain leads among suburban women by 6.  [\x85]\n\nHIEDI HARRIS: [\x85] John McCain\'s going to have to work really hard to get\nsome of those women over, who are Hillary supporters, to his side.\n\nMATTHEWS: Most voters are women. [\x85]  Will most Democratic Women vote\nDemocratic?\n\nAMY GOODMAN: [\x85] It\'s interesting that we are talking about this today,\nMonday, which was the scheduled fundraiser for John McCain at the home of\nthe Texas Oilman, Clayton Williams.  Who is famous for having compared rape\nto bad weather saying you just have to lay back and enjoy it.  He\'s also the\nguy that ran against Anne Richards in 1990 in Texas.  And compared her to a\ncow saying you have to head her, hoof her and drag her through the dirt.  Yes,\nthey cancelled the fundraiser but it\'s very significant.  He\'s very well\nknown for these comments. [\x85]\n\n[\x85]\n\nGOODMAN: I think we won\'t hope if you have policies like John McCain just\nadvocated for on Friday.  When the Supreme Court came down with their\ndecision, [\x85] John McCain said he thought it was one of the worst decisions\nin History.  That\'s very sad. [\x85]\n\nMATTHEWS: Why do you think most women vote Democratic?\n\nHARRIS: A lot of women are very emotional. [\x85]\n\nMATTHEWS: You mean its not hard issues like abortion rights, or social\nsecurity or minimum wage. Logical reasons?\n\nHARRIS: I don\'t think most women under 50 care about abortion rights.  Because\nwomen at that age, [\x85] its always been legal. [\x85]\n\nMATTHEWS: Shouldn\'t they have a concept of it that if the Supreme Court\nmoves further right and there is no longer a right to have an abortion?\n\nHARRIS: I don\'t think it\'s going to change.  I don\'t think no matter who is\non the Supreme Court it\'s going to be over ruled. And the women who are\ncomplaining about it the most are too darn old to get pregnant.  So I don\'t\nthink it\'s a big issue for young ones.\n\nGOODMAN: I think it\'s a very important issue.  And when people learn, and\nthey don\'t know right now, but especially when women learn about John\nMcCain\'s record on reproductive rights, that he\'s 100% against abortion.\nThey are going to be deeply concerned.\n\n[\x85]\n\n*MSNBC Panel Discusses McCain\'s 25 Year History Against Women\'s Health\nIssues* (MSNBC 06/16/08 3:52pm)\nDAVID SHUSTER: John McCain is trying to win over disappointed Hillary\nClinton voters, especially women. But according to a brand new poll by\nNARAL, the pro-choice organization, independent and republican women are\nmore likely to cross over and vote for Barack Obama, instead of McCain.\nObama leads McCain 53 to 40 percent. And this was after respondents were\npresented with the candidates views on abortion[\x85] Sabrina, I wonder if you\nwill acknowledge that John McCain\'s pro-life position means that he\'s at\nodds with, essentially, most women on the issue of abortion.\n\nSABRINA SCHAEFFER: Look, what I think is interesting about this is, we\'re\ntalking about the women\'s vote and sort of assuming that because women share\nthe same anatomy they\'re somehow going to share the same political\nconvictions. And I think that\'s off. It\'s a little ridiculous to think that\nway. I\'m not sure if this is a done deal for Senator McCain. I think he has\nto make the case.\n\nSHUSTER: But Sabrina, can you point us to one poll in which a majority of\nwomen agreed with the pro-life position?\n\nSCHAEFFER: Right, I don\'t know. At this point we\'re five months out of the\ngeneral election and I think to look at any poll numbers and to take them\ntoo seriously at this point is off. I think, especially when we\'re looking\nat women who are known to be making their decisions much later in the game,\nto look at the poll numbers in June, right after when Senator Clinton has\ndropped out of the race, just doesn\'t do much good for anybody.\n\nSHUSTER: Alright, Cecile, maybe I\'m missing something then. Do you think\nwomen will go to John McCain when they hear more about John McCain\'s\nposition on issues of abortion?\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: *Well, actually, I think it\'s a whole basket of access to\naffordable health care for women, and I think John McCain has a 25 year\nrecord with Planned Parenthood on voting against, he\'s voted against\neverything we\'ve supported in terms of making health care more accessible\nand affordable for women. And I think that as women find that out, they\nfrankly go to Senator Obama*. We see in NBC\'s own poll, I think a 19 point\nspread of support of Senator Obama over Senator McCain. And again, certainly\ntoo, Senator Clinton supporters are seeing her record and Senator Obama\'s\nrecord are very closely aligned, their positions are very closely aligned on\nwomen\'s healthcare issues. And Senator McCain, is frankly, just very out of\ntouch on women\'s healthcare needs.\n\nSHUSTER: Cecile, I want to ask you if you\'re a little bit disappointed\nbecause, all of which you said is true but, you haven\'t heard a word about\nit from Barack Obama. It\'s almost as if he doesn\'t want to talk about\nwomen\'s issues right now.\n\nRICHARDS: Oh, actually, I really disagree. In fact, we at Planned\nParenthood, we have a long history of working with Senator Obama on a whole\nhost of women healthcare issues. On affordability, on accessibility of\nfamily planning, breast cancer screening, the like. And I think that,\ncertainly now it\'s a general election you\'re going to see a big focus on\naccess to affordable health care for women. I think in the primary the\ncandidates positions were very similar. I think when you see the difference\nbetween Senator Obama and Senator McCain on these issues, women are going to\ncontinue to move to Senator Obama. In particular, independent and republican\npro-choice women.\n\nSCHAEFFER: I wanted to point out that the PEW Center for Survey Research\njust did another survey and they found that abortion is actually on the very\nbottom of the list in terms of people\'s top priorities. And I think what we\nneed to remember is that women, like men, are going to be voting on some of\nthe big ticket items. National security and the economy. And I think when\npeople see Senator Obama\'s record on national security, when they realize he\ndoesn\'t have any foreign policy experience, that\'s going to be a liability\nagainst him. And when it comes to the economy, especially when we\'re talking\nabout women who are concerned about their financial security and their\nsecurity in the work force, they\'re going to want a president that is not\ngoing to be a traditional tax and spend liberal but  somebody who\'s going to\nhelp us promote more free market policies.\n\nSHUSTER: [\x85] Clarify for us, is it your position and is it John McCain\'s\nposition that abortion should be restricted?\n\nSCHAEFFER: You know, I can\'t speak for Senator McCain. I think that this is,\nyou know, his issues are going to have to, he\'s going to have to speak to\nthe larger issues that are facing women.\n\nSHUSTER: Then speak for the Independence Women\'s Forum. Is it your position\nthat abortion should be restricted?\n\nSCHAEFFER: You know I don\'t actually think that IWFF takes a position on\nabortion.\n\n[\x85]\n\nOur focus is actually on economic issues, on education, on school choice, on\nnational security.\n\nRICHARDS: So I\'d really love to pick up on this one point, because I think\nit\'s important to understand very clearly. Senator McCain has a 25 year\nhistory of voting against women health care issues. He has said, publicly,\nhis commitment is to overturn Roe v. Wade. So, it\'s very clear where he is.\nI think what\'s important in Sabrina\'s mentioning that the economy is an\nimportant issue in this election, and Planned Parenthood absolutely agrees.\nSo I believe that women\'s access to affordable healthcare for themselves and\ntheir families is going to be a paramount issue, and that\'s where I think\nSenator McCain is found incredibly lacking. It\'s not only his position on\nRoe, it\'s his position against opposing women\'s family planning access,\nopposing the programs that support women getting affordable breast cancer\nscreening. This year, he even voted against the program that would have\ncovered children\'s health insurance. So I think on a whole host of\nbread-and-butter economic issues that relate to women\'s health and families\nhealth, Senator McCain has a record that\'s going to really going to cause\nhim problems with women voters.\n\n*Brewer on MSNBC: McCain Continues to Aggressively Seek Clinton Female\nVoters, Yet "Polls Show* *They Are Really Lining Up Behind Barack\nObama" *(MSNBC\n06/16/08 10:33am)\nCONTESSA BREWER: [\x85] can John McCain and Barack Obama be decided by Hillary\nClinton supporters? McCain is aggressively targeting those very voters,\nhoping to sway Clinton loyalists who still harbor lingering bitterness\ntowards Barack Obama.\n[\x85]\nEmily, what do you make of this strategy by John McCain? He has former\nHewlettPackard CEO, Carly Fiorina out there, trying to help him gain\ntraction from women.\n\nEMILY HEIL: And a lot of other things too. I mean, he is a ladies man these\ndays!  He\'s on the view, he\'s hanging out with Ellen Degeneres. You know,\nCarly Fiorina is everywhere for him. He\'s talking about how great a\ncandidate Hillary Clinton was. He\'s really clearly trying to reach out to\nwomen voters. And you know, trying to talk to them about issues. But also,\ntrying to engratiate himself with that voting bloc. Clearly, he thinks\nthat\'s very important and he thinks he can make some gains there.\n\nBREWER: Jonathan, *polls show that women are really lining up behind Barack\nObama.* The only segment of the population that polls show that John McCain\nis doing really well, is white suburban women. Weren\'t those women, who may\nhave been supporting a republican candidate anyway?\n\nJONATHAN CAPEHART: Um, possibly. I mean, these possibly, very well be\n[\x85]  first\nthey were the soccer moms and then they became the security moms after 9/11.\nThose are the voters that Senator Obama and McCain are going to go after\nrather vigorously. Senator McCain, let me start again. Women supporting\nSenator McCain, I think we\'ll see some shifting and some more movement when\nthe two candidates really go at it. Particularly on issues of choice. And\nthe democrats are hoping once women find out Senator McCain\'s record on\nchoice that they will go in groves over to Senator Obama.\n\n*Fiorina Touts McCain\'s Appeal to Women, Also Pushes McDifferent* *From Bush\n* (MSNBC 06/16/08 01:07pm)\nANDREA MITCHELL: Why should women turn to John McCain, who for a majority of\nwomen in America is on the opposite side of Roe vs. Wade.  Also skipped a\nvote on equal pay, voted against requiring health care plans to cover birth\ncontrol, voted against family planning programs.  These are all majority\npositions amongst women\'s groups.\n\nCARLY FIORINA: [\x85] John McCain, [\x85], has a long record on pro-life.  On the\nother hand I know many, many women, some who are pro-life and some that are\npro-choice who support John McCain because they are not single-issue voters.\n  [\x85] When we look at important issues like healthcare for example, John\nMcCain proposes that every American be able to choose their health insurance\nplan from anywhere in the United States, in other words he would inject\ncompetition into health Insurance.  That\'s important because for some women\nhealth insurance covers Viagra for example but it doesn\'t cover birth\ncontrol and competition would provide a choice for many women. [\x85]  John\nMcCain\'s proposal for portable health insurance programs, that is health\ninsurance that individuals own, not the company for whom they are employed\nis very important to women.  Because women are frequently the last hired,\nthe first fired, they are more likely to be self-employed.  [\x85]\n\nMITCHELL: Even though Barack Obama has a very big lead nationally among\nwomen, in a key cohort, white suburban women, McCain is ahead 44 to 39.\n\nFIORINA: [\x85] A large number of women who were Clinton supporters were open\nminded enough to listen to John McCain. [\x85]\n\nMITCHELL: One of the drags on McCain, very frankly, is George W. Bush. [\x85]\n\n[Visual of Bush quote]\n"I want it to be said about George W. Bush that when he finishes his\npresidency, he looked in a mirror as a man who did not compromise his core\nprinciples for the sake of politics or the Gallup poll or the latest, you\nknow, whatever. You can\'t lead in this world if you are chasing something as\ntemporary as a popularity poll."\n\nMITCHELL: [\x85] The issue is he might not care about his popularity and he may\nstick to his principles but it does as a practical matter make it a lot\nharder for John McCain.\n\nFIORINA: Well this is the number one talking point for the Democratic Party,\nthat John McCain is just like George Bush.  They believe it\'s the strongest\nargument they have against John McCain.  Unfortunately it\'s just not true.  The\nAmerican people understand John McCain opposed George Bush on global warming\nand climate change; He opposed George Bush on the issue of Guantanamo Bay,\n[\x85]\n\n[Mitchell struggles to cut in]\n\nMITCHELL: [\x85] He took a position after the Supreme Court decision last week,\npraising the descenters, and saying that he agreed with Justice Roberts and\nthe other justices that believe that the writ of Habeas corpus should not be\nextended to those prisoners.\n\nFIORINA: Well, that is correct but they are different issues. [\x85] We are in\nessence giving enemy combatants the same rights that we give to American\ncitizens.

The moral gap in this campaign is huge. Barack Obama\nsupporters are all fired up. Two-thirds of Obama supporters say they are\nextremely or very enthusiastic about voting for president this year. John\nMcCain supporters, not so much. Only one-third feel fired up. Four years\nago, there was almost no difference in enthusiasm between George W. Bush\nsupporters and John Kerry supporters. Everybody was fired up. After 8 years\nof the Bush presidency, republicans are demoralized. McCain is trying to\ndeal with it. Look at expectations, most voters believe Obama is going to\nwin in November. So are democrats singing, "happy days are here again?"\nActually, they\'re a little worried. Obama\'s running only a few points ahead\nof McCain. 42 percent of voters believe Obama\'s race will make it more\ndifficult for him to get elected. That concern is higher among democrats.\nObama also has a problem with seniors. He sometimes sounds like he\'s leading\na youth movement. Republican have been making steady gains with seniors for\nat least 16 years. McCain now leads Obama by 8 points among voters 65 and\nolder. Obama is trying to deal with it. The greatest generation, the one\nthat lived through the depression and World War II was strongly democratic,\nthey\'re passing from the political scene. Obama is trying to rally a new\ngeneration of democratic voters to replace them.\n\n*McCain\'s Base Support and Straight Talk Image is Crumbling* (MSNBC 06/22/08\n08:04pm)\nKEITH OLBERMANN: [\x85] Only 52% of Republican primary voters approve of John\nMcCain as their candidate.  [\x85] That lack of enthusiasm extending to members\nof the house and senate.  The hill reporting last week that at least 14\nRepublican members of congress having refused to endorse or publically\nsupport Senator McCain.  Nearly one dozen others refused to answer the\nquestion. [\x85]\n\n[Clip of McCain]\n\nOLBERMANN: [\x85] of the 3200 individuals that gave to Mayor Giuliani and\nGovernor Romney\'s campaigns, only 113 of them, 3.5% have also since given to\nSenator McCain.  That might explain why McCain was unwilling to say no to\nany of the money raised by Clayton Williams.  [\x85]\n\n{Clip of McCain]\n\nMCCAIN: First of all my people were not aware of a statement that he said 16\nor 18 years ago. I\'ve forgotten how many years ago it was.  [\x85] The people\nwho contributed were supporters of mine not supporters of his. So when we\nfound out that this was planned there we said no, we\'ll reschedule it and\nwe\'ll do it somewhere else and I understand that he\'s not attending.\n\nOLBERMANN: [\x85] Mr. Williams is not attending, Senator McCain is still\nplanning however to except all the 300,000 dollars [\x85].\n\nRICHARD WOLFFE: [\x85] you cannot separate the man from the money. [\x85] And in\nthis case for John McCain that\'s built his brand around the idea of straight\ntalk, people want to see him dealing straight, in a straight and honest way\nwith this kind of issue. I\'m not sure that in taking the money but rejecting\nthe guy that is necessary a piece of straight talk.\n\n[\x85]\n\nWOLFFE: This enduring suspicion and mistrust about McCain from big pieces of\nhis own party, its not just the financial backers of people like Giuliani or\nRomney. But the Bush money machine, which was this formidable enterprise for\ntwo election cycles, really has not rallied around John McCain. That\'s\ncausing him problems now and it looks like it will cause him problems going\nforward.\n[\x85]\n\n\nHighlight #5\n*Jack Cafferty Highlights Historically Bleak Odds That Face the McCain\nCampaign *(CNN 06/16/08 4:30pm)\nJACK CAFFERTY: Don\'t bet on John McCain becoming the next President of the\nUnited States. That is the message coming from several presidential scholars\nand historians. Politico reports, these historians paint a bleak picture for\nMcCain. They also say Barack Obama has the best chance for any democrat\nperhaps since Roosevelt beat Hoover in 1932. The historians say it should be\nan overwhelming democratic victory, noting McCain is facing one of the worst\npolitical environments for the party in power since World War II. There\'s\nalso this, only twice in the 20th century has the candidate from the same\nparty from a two-term president go on to win the White House. The last time\nit happened, in 1988 was when President Bush\'s dad replaced Ronal Reagan.\nBut remember, Reagan was more than twice as popular as the current president\nis now.\nMcCain does have some advantages, including the fact that most people don\'t\nsee him as a traditional Republican. Also, he could appeal more to moderates\nthan Obama if the public would end up seeing the democrat as far left. And\nMcCain might benefit from left over divisions in the democratic party from\nthe long running primary season. Meanwhile, a new Gallup poll suggests the\nAmerican people agree with these historians, 52 percent of those surveyed\nthink that Obama will win regardless of who they support. 41 percent say\nMcCain. And the world is weighing in too. A PEW poll, 25,000 people in 24\ncountries found that in all but two nations people put more faith in Barack\nObama than in John McCain to do the right thing when it comes to world\naffairs. One of the two exceptions, that would be the United States.\n\n\n\n\n-- \nGregory E.
