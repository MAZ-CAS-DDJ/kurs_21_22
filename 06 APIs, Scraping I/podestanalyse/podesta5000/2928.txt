Among other things, you would like to cut -- and\ncorrect me if I\'m wrong -- the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25\npercent. Is that right?\n\nMCCAIN: Absolutely. Absolutely.\n\nBLITZER: Because what he says and what Democrats, a lot of Democrats, say,\nthat would be a corporate bonanza for ExxonMobil. They would get an extra $4\nbillion.\n\nHere\'s the question. Should ExxonMobil be excluded from that cut in the\ncorporate tax rate?\n\nMCCAIN: Oh, of course not. We should -- we should be cutting corporate tax\nfor every business in America.\n\nYou know, Barney Frank just said, we\'re going to take some of that money\naway from the rich people. That\'s what Obama is all about. That is what this\nis about. Let me tell you -- let me tell you, we tried a windfall profit tax\nback during the days of Jimmy Carter, OK? We tried it. It didn\'t work.\n\nBut the important thing is, if you talk to the CEO of FedEx, Fred Smith, if\nyou talk to the CEO of Cisco, John Chambers, you talk to Meg Whitman, former\nCEO of eBay, you know what they will tell you? They will tell you, they pay\ntheir full 35 percent. And you know what else they will tell you? When they\nhave the ability to go overseas, unfortunately, they do go overseas.\n\nAnd you know why? Because we\'re paying -- they\'re paying 35 percent,\nfull-freight, no evasions or escapes from the taxes. They\'re paying\nfull-freight. And they will show you their tax returns. And guess what? If\nthey go to Ireland, they\'re only paying 11 percent. So, where are they going\nto go where they can create wealth and create jobs? It\'s simple, fundamental\neconomics.\n\nSo, to somehow allege that a company or corporation that can be\ninternational is not going to go where they pay the lowest taxes and can\ncreate the most jobs is just foolishness. The last time we practiced this\nkind of isolationism and protectionism that Senator Obama espouses and\nhigher taxes was a guy named Herbert Hoover.\n\nBLITZER: We have another question from a viewer, Frederick Allier (ph) of\nDoylestown, Pennsylvania. He says he\'s an independent. Normally, he says, he\nvotes Republican, but he says he lost -- you lost his vote this time because\nof what he called negative campaigning. Here\'s his question.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMCCAIN: Have you got anybody who says they have changed their mind, and they\nsupport me?\n\nBLITZER: Yes. Yes, there are.\n\nMCCAIN: You got a question from them, Wolf? I would love to hear that.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBLITZER: Here\'s -- here\'s -- here\'s his question.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: My question to you is about tax cuts. How can you explain\nto the American people that tax cuts are going to solve our economic issues,\nmight it be for the rich or the poor, whomever it is for, when they really\nhaven\'t worked for the last eight years?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMCCAIN: All I can say to him is that, look at history. Look at history.\n\nYou raise taxes during economic crisis times, as we did in -- in -- back in\nthe time of Herbert Hoover, you send the country into a depression. I\'m not\ngoing to do that.\n\nWe have a fundamental difference of opinion. Some people think you have got\nto spread the wealth around. You have got to raise taxes. As I said, Barney\nFrank and others said, we\'re going to get those rich people and we\'re going\nto take the money from them? Fine, if that\'s what they want to do.\n\nAnd I can hardly -- it\'s -- it\'s incredible to think of Speaker Pelosi,\nHarry Reid and Barack Obama with the tax-and-spend policies that they did in\nthe past and that they espouse now and might happen in the future. It\ninvigorates me to keep my campaign going, and going hard. I don\'t want that\nto happen to America.\n\nBLITZER: Social Security, it\'s a potential problem out there for our\nchildren and grandchildren.\n\nMCCAIN: Sure.\n\nBLITZER: And you have said, nothing is off the table as far as coming up\nwith some solutions, long-term solutions, to Social Security.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMCCAIN: That\'s the way you negotiate, and that\'s the way you negotiate and\nget solutions.\n\nBLITZER: Right now, there\'s a cap at $102,000 for Social Security payroll\nwithholding tax. Are you open, as part of an effort to save Social Security,\nto letting that -- that cap go up?\n\nMCCAIN: I\'m obviously against it. And I want to tell you again, the way you\nsucceed in negotiations -- and I have done it many times across the aisle,\nwhether it be Ted Kennedy, or Russ Feingold, or Joe Lieberman, or -- or\nanybody else -- is, you sit down and you negotiate.\n\nYou go in with your negotiating positions. I will go in with my negotiating\noppositions. My position is that I won\'t raise taxes on anybody.\n\nBLITZER: What about increasing the retirement age from 65?\n\nMCCAIN: I am going in that I won\'t -- I will have -- there are things on the\ntable we will negotiate.\n\nRonald Reagan, Tip O\'Neill, 1983, went in, negotiated, and came out and\nsaved Social Security. Guess what? That\'s what the American people want from\nus. That\'s what I have done all the time I have been in the Congress of the\nUnited States.\n\nAnd -- and -- and, so, for me to say that anything, but I\'m going to do what\nI saw two great leaders, Tip O\'Neill and Ronald Reagan, do is -- it\'s just\nfoolishness.\n\nBLITZER: So, raising the retirement age..\n\nMCCAIN: The Democrats -- the Democrats insist -- the reason why we couldn\'t\n-- couldn\'t get agreement in 2005 is because the Democrats insisted, as a\nprecondition, that we raise taxes.\n\nSo, guess what? We never sat down at the table together. The Americans want\nus to sit down together, Wolf. And, so, all I can tell is, I will sit down\nwith them. I have worked with them before. I will sit across the table from\nthem.\n\nI\'m against tax increases. I\'m against a lot of the bad things that -- that\n-- that a lot of the people support. But I will get a result, and we will\nsave Social Security.\n\nBLITZER: And how do you feel about raising the retirement age?\n\nMCCAIN: I feel very strongly that I will sit down with the Democrats, and we\nwill negotiate out something that will save Social Security, because that\'s\nour obligation to future generations of Americans. And you can ask me, you\nknow, for the next half-hour, if you would like.\n\nBLITZER: All right.\n\nMCCAIN: I mean, that would be kind of fun. And my answer is going to be the\nsame. I will sit down and negotiate, the way have I done in the past, which\nSenator Obama has never done, whether it be in judicial nominations, or\nwhether it be in immigration reform, or ethics or lobbying reform. He always\nwent home to the Democrat leadership.\n\nBLITZER: Let\'s talk a little bit about your support -- and correct me if I\'m\nwrong -- you did support President Bush\'s plan to overhaul Social Security\nand allow Social Security recipients to use about 10 percent of their Social\nSecurity savings in the stock market. That collapsed, obviously. It didn\'t\ngo forward. Knowing what we know now about the volatility of the stock\nmarket, is that still a good idea?\n\nMCCAIN: The reason why the talks collapsed is because the Democrats insisted\non agreeing to tax increases before we sat down. So, let\'s -- let\'s -- let\'s\nunderstand history.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBLITZER: What about private Social Security...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMCCAIN: OK. That\'s what they wanted to do.\n\nBLITZER: ... investments in the stock market?\n\nMCCAIN: And all this other stuff was -- was worth negotiating.\n\nAnd I will protect, as president of the United States, the Social Security\nbenefits of retirees and future retirees. I will protect those benefits and\nI will do whatever is necessary to protect those benefits. And I have said\nthat time over time.\n\nEvery -- every even-numbered year, the Democrats run out, scare the senior\ncitizens, say, they\'re going to raise your taxes, they\'re going to destroy\nSocial Security -- same old stuff. I have seen it for, oh, so -- more years\nthan I can count.\n\nI\'m not scaring any senior. I\'m going to preserve their -- and protect their\nSocial Security benefits, despite what ads may be run, and the senior\ncitizens, as well as all citizens in this country.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBLITZER: And the notion of a 10 percent, using 10 percent in the stock\nmarket?\n\nMCCAIN: They know me about -- about how I\'m going to fix Social Security,\nand I\'m going to make their Social Security the best I can, and we will\npreserve the benefits that they have, and I will protect Social Security.\n\nBLITZER: And the 10 percent?\n\nMCCAIN: And I will protect Social Security.\n\nBLITZER: All right.\n\nMCCAIN: And I will sit down at the table with the Democrats. And, by the\nway, we can keep -- you know, this is -- I will give you this -- this is --\nI\'m telling you, I\'m going to protect Social Security.\n\n(CROSSTALK) BLITZER: All right.\n\nMCCAIN: And that\'s what I have done my entire career. And I will do what\nRonald Reagan and Tip O\'Neill did. And that is save Social Security and make\nAmericans aware that, unfortunately, present- day retirees are -- have --\nworking Americans today are not going to receive the same benefits as\npresent-day retirees, unless we fix it. Now, I think I can do it, convince\nthe American people that we will sit down together.\n\nBLITZER: Let\'s move on and talk about national security.\n\nMCCAIN: Good.\n\nBLITZER: If you\'re elected president, of the United States, do you believe\nAmerica\'s enemies, whether terrorists or hostile governments, would test you\nduring the first six months of your presidency?\n\nMCCAIN: I\'ve already been tested. And I\'m astonished and amazed to hear\nSenator Obama pre -- Senator Biden predict that the untried, untested\nPresident Obama will be tested by our enemies. And we may not agree -- his\nown backers may not agree.\n\nLook, I\'ve been tested. Senator Biden referred to the Cuban missile crisis.\nI was there. We came that close, as historians say, to a nuclear exchange.\n\nSenator Biden expects his own running mate, expects Senator Obama to be\ntested in that way?\n\nI mean that\'s a remarkable statement.\n\nBLITZER: Because usually (INAUDIBLE)...\n\nMCCAIN: That should concern all Americans.\n\nBLITZER: ...they are tested early on by hostile powers out there.\n\nMCCAIN: They know I\'ve been tested. They know I\'ve been tested. I\'ve been\ntested many times.\n\nBLITZER: The U.S. -- the Bush administration...\n\nMCCAIN: And the thing that probably may encourage them a little is that\nSenator Obama has been wrong. He was wrong about the surge in Iraq. He still\nfails to acknowledge that he was wrong. I mean remarkable.\n\nHe was wrong when he said the Georgians should show restraint. He was wrong\nwhen he said he would sit down across the table from Ahmadinejad, Chavez and\nthe Castro brothers. He was wrong about those.\n\nSo I can understand why the American people might be concerned, particularly\nwhen his own running mate says he\'s going to be tested.\n\nBLITZER: All right...\n\nMCCAIN: I\'ve been tested, my friend.\n\nBLITZER: We\'ve got a limited amount of time, so I just want to get a couple\nof things in before I let you go. Iraq, a very important issue.\n\nMCCAIN: Sure.\n\nBLITZER: Right now, we still 140,000, 150,000 troops in Iraq. The Bush\nadministration seems to be close to what\'s called a Status of Forces\nAgreement with the Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nuri Al- Maliki. It\ncalls, in the draft agreement, at least, for complete withdrawal of forces\nfrom villages and cities by July 30th of 2009 and out of the country by\nDecember 31st 2011.\n\nIf you\'re elected president, would you, as commander-in-chief, honor this\nagreement if, in fact, it\'s formalized?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, with respect, Wolf -- and you know better, my friend. You know\nbetter. It\'s condition-based. It\'s conditions-based. And Ryan Crocker, our\nambassador in Baghdad, said if you want to know what victory looks like,\nlook at this agreement. So you know better than that, Wolf. You know it\'s\ncondition-based. And that\'s what the big fight was all about.\n\nBLITZER: So you accept this -- what\'s on the table right now\n\nMCCAIN: I\'ve always said we would be out based on conditions and honor in\nvictory and not defeat. And it\'s very clear to any observer now that if we\nwould have done what Senator Biden wanted to do -- break Iraq up into three\ncountries -- if we\'d have done what Senator Obama to do, which was immediate\nwithdrawal and setting firm dates for it, we\'d have probably been defeated\nin Iraq.\n\nAnd the problem there is we would have had increased Iranian influence. We\'d\nhave had sectarian violence on the increase. And probably we would have had\nto go back.\n\nSo it\'s a big -- a big issue, a big issue for the American people. And I\nunderstand why it\'s not on the front pages or the lead in CNN, because we\nhave a relatively secure environment that\'s getting more secure.\n\nBLITZER: Colin Powell was pretty biting in his criticism. He said you were a\nlittle unsure of how to deal with the economic crisis. You seem to have, he\nsaid, a different approach every day. He sensed you didn\'t have a complete\ngrasp of the economic crisis the American people are going through right\nnow.\n\nI wonder if you\'d like to respond to Secretary Powell.\n\nSEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R-AZ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I respect General Powell.\nBut I respectfully disagree. I especially disagree when he said -- the\ncomments that he made about Governor Palin, the most popular governor in\nAmerica, a governor who knows energy issue, a $40 billion pipeline reformer,\ntook on the governor of her own party. And I hope that sometime General\nPowell will take time out of his busy schedule to meet with her. I know\nshe\'d be pleased to meet with him.\n\n*\n*\n\n*Highlight #2*\n\n*Brian Williams Interviews John McCain and Sarah Palin *(NBC 10/22/08\n06:36pm)\n\nBRIAN WILLIAMS: Senator, I will begin with your observation on the tarmac.\nYou came in today, there is not one, but two planes with your name on the\nside. You immediately started reminiscing about the depth of New Hampshire,\nyou and your garment bag coming off the commercial flight. So here you are,\nyou are down, you are down in money. How do you stay up?\n\nMCCAIN: Down in money. Down in the polls. We got them just where we want\nthem.\n\nWILLIAMS: What do you mean by that?\n\nMCCAIN: I mean that\'s when we do best, really, Brian. I have always done\nbest when we are running a little bit behind and got to catch up. That\nsomehow I have been very blessed. We seem to catch fire and lately we have\nseen in the last several days, week, ever since the debate we have seen some\nuptick and we have three, four points to go and we can win this thing. >>\n\nWILLIAMS: Did this campaign get out of your control? Here\'s what I mean -- a\nlot of people who know you well saw you take that microphone from that woman\nin Wisconsin and for the first time in a long time they said, there, that\'s\njohn McCain.\n\nMCCAIN: Brian, they either haven\'t been paying attention or don\'t want to.\nIn my speech at the convention, I spoke of my admiration for senator Obama,\nthe fact that he had motivated so many people. I have said continuously, my\nrespect for him. That doesn\'t change my view that there are stark\ndifferences. When I am president there is not going to be an international\ncrisis that he can -- that senator Biden can guarantee. I am not going to\nraise people\'s taxes in a bad economy. Look, we have got very big\ndifferences. But I have always been respectful of senator Obama. And he is\nnow spending more money than any campaign in American history on negative\nads against me. That\'s fine. The American people are paying attention.\n\nWILLIAMS: You mention senator Biden\'s comment the other day about, a new\npresident and a test of the new president\'s mettle, one of your closest\nfriends in the senate, Joe Lieberman said on face the nation, our enemies\nwill test the new president early. And it has happened throughout modern\nhistory.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, look -- I have been tested. They know me, they know me very\nwell. I have been tested. Senator Biden said it. What if Sarah or I had said\nit? Oh, my god, it would have been terrible. Imagine. His own running mate\nsaid it\'s because he is young and new and untested. That\'s why senator Biden\nsaid mark my word, mark my words, what he said, there is going to be an\ninternational crisis. And then he compared it to the Cuban missile crisis.\nMy friend I was in the Cuban missile crisis. I was on the aircraft carrier\n"enterprise" in the ware wing. We were close to nuclear war. I wouldn\'t\npredict that. That is remarkable. When a vice presidential candidate\npredicts because a young untested president is going to face an\ninternational crisis like the Cuban missile crisis. Unbelievable. Americans\nknow I have been tested.\n\nBRIAN WILLIAMS: [Governor Palin], yesterday you tied this notion of an early\ntest to a new president to this notion of preconditions that you both have\nbeen hammering the Obama campaign on. First of all what in your mind is a\nprecondition?\n\nSARAH PALIN: You have to have some, diplomatic strategy going into a meeting\nwith some one like Ahmadinejad or Kim Jung Il . . . that would seek to\ndestroy America or our allies. It is so naive and so dangerous . . . to\nproclaim they would be willing to sit down with a leader like Ahmadinejad\nand just talk about the problems, the issues that are facing them. So that\nis some ill-preparedness right there. But following up with your comment\nabout Biden also, when Biden, what he had done the other night to his\nDemocrat donors in talking to them in a fund raiser, warning mark my word\nthere will be an international crisis if Barack Obama is elected, he was\nconfirming what he had been saying all along in the primary race. He had\nwarned voters that Barack was not prepared yet to be president. And that the\npresidency is not a place for on the job training.\n\nWILLIAMS: When he says the new president will be tested though, I am missing\nhow that is different from senator Lieberman saying, quote, "our enemies\nwill test the new president early. "\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: Look, I don\'t know when Joe Lieberman said that. Joe Lieberman\nis supporting me. The main reason, probably, he thinks America will be safer\nand more secure with me as president. Otherwise he wouldn\'t have crossed\nparty lines and come over almost unprecedented and support my candidacy. So\nI don\'t know exactly what Joe Lieberman was saying, but I know that Joe\nLieberman is convinced that this country and this world will be a lot safer\nplace with me president. If he thought there was some kind of equivalency,\nhe probably would have stayed in his own party as far as which nominee he\nsupported. But I want to go back again to Sarah\'s point. And that is -- that\nwe now have a guarantee, saying because he is young and untested, that\'s\nwhat part of senator Biden\'s rant was and because he was young and untested\nand . . . then Senator Obama will probably do what the donors don\'t agree\nwith. This is probably one of those moments in American political history\nthat stands out. And I think the American people are going to pay attention.\n\nPALIN: I think it is the most telling comment that has been made yet on this\ncampaign trail in all of these months. I think that has been the most\nsignificant comment, that is my personal opinion on this. For Biden too, to\nhave been the one to say he would be so honored to run on a McCain ticket\nbecause he knew that way if Senator McCain is elected president that our\ncountry would be better off. I think there is significance there too in the\ncomment made.\n\nWILLIAMS: Let me ask you both about what must have been a hurtful Sunday for\nyou especially, you Senator McCain, Colin Powell\'s endorsement of Barack\nObama and Governor, respectfully, the heart of his quote, about Governor\nPalin, Senator McCain, "I don\'t believe she is ready to be president of the\nUnited States which is the job of vice president. And so that raised some\nquestion in my mind as to the judgment that Senator McCain made." When you\nheard those words from a man you have known for a long time, what was your\nreaction, saying basically we have little to judge these future leaders on\nexcept for the big decision of picking a running mate?\n\nMCCAIN: I know that if General Powell had wanted to meet Governor Palin we\ncould have arranged that easily number one. Number two is then obviously\nGeneral Powell does not know governor Palin\'s record. Reform, governor,\n24,000 employees I believe of the state of Alaska, negotiated a $40 billion\nnatural gas pipeline by taking on the oil and gas interests, took on the\ngovernor of her own party who is incumbent. Stood up against corruption, cut\ntaxes, gave her constituents money back, shares my world view, has frankly\nin all due respect, a son, who has got his life on the line right now in\ndefense of freedom, and that\'s not qualified? Tell me what is qualified? I\nam overjoyed to have a person who is a real reformer. What Americans want\nright now more than anything else they want us to reform the way we do\nbusiness in Washington and they want our economy put back on track. Here\'s a\nproven record. And so, all I can say is, I see all these attacks on governor\nPalin. I don\'t live in a bubble. But those people obviously, are either not\npaying attention to, or don\'t care about the record of the most popular\ngovernor in the United States of America.\n\nPALIN: And, look, let me interrupt . . . I am not going to toot my own horn\nbut I have more executive experience than even Barack Obama has, dealing\nwith multibillion dollar budgets, thousand of employees in position as\nmayor, manager, regulator of oil and gas, and governor. Let\'s not forget in\nthis context of one endorsement, of, um Senator, um-- Colin Powell\'s, that\nyou have received the endorsement of at least four former secretaries of\nstate and hundreds--\n\nMCCAIN: Five secretary, former secretaries of states.\n\nPALIN: Five! And hundreds of retired top US brass and US military brass that\nsee also in John McCain the ability to win the wars and to keep our nation\nsafe and of course, those who are in more economic minded also who is\nendorsing John McCain because they know too that he will get our economy\nback on track. He will reduce taxes on our small businesses and on our\nfamilies so that we can keep more of what we produce and earn so we can hire\nmore people as business owners. That\'s how jobs are created. That\'s how the\neconomy gets rolling. He has got that in him. He has got that in his plan\nand that\'s recognized. I am appreciative of the endorsements you have\nreceived.\n\nMCCAIN: Kissinger, George Shultz, Larry Eagleburger and Al Hague. All of\nthose have been strong supporters of mine, plus 200 or more retired generals\nand admirals and mine. I am more proud of that.\n\n*\n*\n\n*Highlight #3*\n\n*McCain Quotes Hoover on Baseball *(FNC 10/22/08, ad aired during World\nSeries Coverage)\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS: When Depression struck down the roaring \'20s, Americans\nfaced a bleak and uncertain future.\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: "Next to religion, baseball has furnished a greater impact on\nAmerican life than any other institution." - President Hoover.\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail lori@progressiveaccountability.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
