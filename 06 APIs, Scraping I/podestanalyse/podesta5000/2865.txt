If we fall short, we could \neasily lose.\n\nThis is the final push -- and there are a lot of folks \nwho need to hear from you:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Start-Calling-Now\n\nAnd make sure to sign up for your get-out-the-vote \ncall shift:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Call-Tool-Shifts\n\nIt's in your hands. I'm proud to have you on my side.\n\nBarack\n\n\n\n----\nTime is running out.
