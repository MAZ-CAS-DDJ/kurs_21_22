These fees ensure that our public\nsector unions can continue their fight for fair wages and benefits that\nteachers, nurses, child care workers, EMTs, and so many others deserve who\nserve our children and our communities day in and day out.  These workers\ndeserve to be part of the strong middle class in America and their unions\nhelp to make it so.  I will be watching this case closely and will be\nstanding firmly united behind our unions in their fight for their right to\nbargain collectively for the higher wages that reflect the value of their\nwork.\n\nOn Tue, Jun 30, 2015 at 9:59 AM, Maya Harris <mharris@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n> We support crafting a statement.
