john.podesta@gmail.comb' I think this is where we are at this very moment (5:43pm, Sat)\r\nI want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and the people of Charleston for hosting us here on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  When I was a teenager, my youth minister took me to hear Dr. King speak in Chicago.  And his moral clarity helped set me on a path of service.  It\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that on the last day of his life, Dr. King was in Memphis fighting for the dignity and higher pay of working people.  That\xe2\x80\x99s still our fight today. The next President has to get the economy working and incomes rising for everybody\xe2\x80\x94and especially those who have been left out and left behind for too long. But the next President also has to keep our country safe, and take on the quiet challenges that keep families up at night, like autism and Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s and addiction.  We need someone who can be a President for all Americans, and do all aspects of the job. That\xe2\x80\x99s the challenge, and I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to get it done.\r\n\r\n'
