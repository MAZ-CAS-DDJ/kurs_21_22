His birthday is coming up next week, and\nI\'m always inspired by his increasing energy to do *more*.\n\nSo for President Clinton\'s birthday on August 19, I want to show him how\nmuch we all appreciate his ever-growing passion and selfless leadership in\nchanging lives around the world. *Will you join me in wishing President\nClinton a very happy birthday by signing this card? You can even add your\nown personal message.*\n\n*Send President Clinton your best wishes: Click here to sign his birthday\ncard before we deliver it on August 19!*\n<https://action.clintonfoundation.org/pub/cc?_ri_=X0Gzc2X%3DWQpglLjHJlYQGk1un5unlzgHXeWmppUR9kSg3irzbsmIu9hb5VXtpKX%3DCDDCY&_ei_=Emmmp5f1yv3vAfHXcRsGGQEPCQwaIkkmCt7lgu2wR3ZkJekAWHKde6H21m9PaVQce3y5iSECqRSn9dIH4RlKaa3q7Rq5x9IL3M.>\n\nSome of you may know that President Clinton was the catalyst for my\nbecoming much more involved in charity and philanthropy. In fact, the\nPresident himself came to Philadelphia 10 years ago to the launch of the\nJBJ Soul Foundation; he has also been to the Soul Kitchen in Red Bank, NJ.\nPresident Clinton and I are both driven by the same simple goal: *to help\npeople live their best life stories*. Through the work of the Clinton\nFoundation, he\'s dedicated to unleashing human potential and empowering\nindividuals to shape their own futures.\n\nWhether he\'s traveling to Africa to meet one-on-one with the thousands of\nfarmers whose lives have been changed by the Anchor Farm Project, or\nproviding over 17 million kids in more than 29,000 schools access to\nhealthier food and physical education \xe2\x80\x93 President Clinton is impacting more\nlives around the world each and every day.\n\nBut he isn\'t finished yet. There\'s more work to do, more barriers to\novercome, more communities to transform, and more people to uplift. I am\nconfident President Clinton and the Foundation will continue leading the\ncharge to overcome these challenges for many years \xe2\x80\x93 and many birthdays \xe2\x80\x93to\ncome.\n\nI hope you\'ll join me in wishing President Clinton a very happy birthday.\n\n*Add your name and a personal message to President Clinton\'s birthday card\nbefore August 19!*\n<https://action.clintonfoundation.org/pub/cc?_ri_=X0Gzc2X%3DWQpglLjHJlYQGk1un5unlzgHXeWmppUR9kSg3irzbsmIu9hb5VXtpKX%3DCDDCY&_ei_=Emmmp5f1yv3vAfHXcRsGGQEPCQwaIkkmCt7lgu2wR3ZkJekAWHKde6H21m9PaVQce3y5iSECqRSn9dIH4RlKaa3q7Rq5x9IL3M.>\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Jon Bon Jovi\n\nDonate\n<https://action.clintonfoundation.org/pub/cc?_ri_=X0Gzc2X%3DWQpglLjHJlYQGk1un5unlzgHXeWmppUR9kSg3irzbsmIu9hb5VXtpKX%3DDRRRY&_ei_=EolaGGF4SNMvxFF7KucKuWPIJsAiJ56b3L30hWQEKd06uMTvxKVC.>\n\n\nThe Clinton Foundation convenes businesses, governments, NGOs, and\nindividuals to improve global health and wellness, increase opportunity for\ngirls and women, reduce childhood obesity, create economic opportunity and\ngrowth, and help communities address the effects of climate change.
