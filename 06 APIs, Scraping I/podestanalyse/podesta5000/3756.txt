Perry said\nprivate companies, the US government, and foreign allies should work\ntogether more closely on cyber-security; Perry said allies aren\xe2\x80\x99t sure if\nthey can trust the US, particularly Israel, given US involvement in Iran\nnuclear talks; Perry said the US can eliminate ISIS with the help of Middle\nEast allies, but they will have to learn they can trust us first; quoted\nTony Blinken that our plan to eliminate ISIS is working; Perry said we had\nthe opportunity to eliminate ISIS and Assad several years ago, but POTUS is\nmore interested in making a deal with Iran than combating ISIS with\nregional allies; Perry said the government is allowing some veterans to\nfall through the cracks, as demonstrated by the VA scandal, and that\xe2\x80\x99s one\nof the reasons he\xe2\x80\x99s running for president; Perry deflected as to whether\nBush made his announcement yesterday to draw attention away from Perry\xe2\x80\x99s\nannouncement; quoted HRC, saying a Federal Court declared voting\nrestrictions signed into law by Perry purposely discriminated against\nminority voters, and that Perry applauded the gutting of the Voting Rights\nAct; Perry said it makes sense to have to show an I.D. in order to vote;\nPerry and hosts mocked HRC about flying on a private plane, rather than\ncommercial; Perry said HRC is taking on the people of Texas, and \xe2\x80\x9cdissed\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe people of Texas with her remarks about their voting I.D. laws; Perry\nsaid he\xe2\x80\x99s empowered minorities across the state; Perry said Texas has the\nhighest high school graduation rates for Blacks and Hispanics in America.\n\n*CNN's New Day:* Segment on HRC's voting rights speech. CNN reporters claim\nthat HRC is calling for drastic change to current voting laws. Reporters\nstate that voting actions are done state by state, and that it may be\ndifficult for HRC to actually act upon this. They claim that this proposal\nis very bold, but also common sense. The United States has needed laws to\nmake voting easier and more continent for people. Reporters question\nwhether or not she will be able to deliver upon her suggested proposals.\nReporters state that during her speech she called out her Republican\nopponents, but this may have legitimatized them instead of hurting them.\nReporters claim that HRC has had a switching political issues record with\nher changing her attitudes towards issues frequently. For example,\nreporters claimed that HRC went from not supporting driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses for\nillegal immigrants to supporting drivers licenses for illegal immigrants.\nHRC has gone from believing that same sex marriage is a state by state\nissue to believing that it is a constitutional right. Rick Perry claims\nthat he will be very different this time around. Reporters say that Rick\nPerry cannot be counted out. Reporters claim that he is a great retail\npolitician. CNN reporters claim that Perry could do well in some of the\nearly states. Rick Perry is maybe the only candidate who is leading with\nevery type of voter in the Republican Party.\n\n*MSNBC's Morning Joe:* Began show discussing Rick Perry\xe2\x80\x99s announcement and\nchances in the Republican primary. Noted Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s gaffe on Iraq again and\ndiscussed the contrast between Rubio and Bush. Moved on to Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\nand the article about a centrist Democratic Party and mentioned he is\ntrying to run a campaign left of HRC but Sanders already occupies that\nposition. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley hopes to win by running as a progressive\nalternative to HRC. Showed clip of his announcement speech. Talked about\nthe 2007 WaPo op-ed that he wrote with Harold Ford entitled \xe2\x80\x9cOur Chance to\nCapture the Center.\xe2\x80\x9d Read a quote from the article. This seems to be an\nindication that the party has moved left, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have voters in the\nprimary interested in a centrist-Clinton type. Interesting contrast between\nwhat O\xe2\x80\x99Malley was saying a few years ago and what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying now. It\nreflects the reality, where is he going to run against HRC if not to her\nleft? She can move to the center more easily. Argued Sanders has more\nbuilt-in support and \xe2\x80\x9cstrikes a nerve with the Democratic left that\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley is still struggling to hit.\xe2\x80\x9d Think neither is a huge threat to HRC\nbut Sanders will get more traction.\n"
