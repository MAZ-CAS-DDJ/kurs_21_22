That might sound grim, but it's the truth.\n\nTomorrow night marks a critical ad buy deadline for us -- exactly 25 days to go. It's our last chance to turn things around.\n\nJohn, we're urging you -- please don't wait until tomorrow. We need you to chip in today.\n\nJohn Podesta\nSuggested Support: $5.OO\nCan you rush an urgent $5 or more to help us get back on track?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/foustq42014?refcode=em_FR_2014.10.09_b2_tf_ldnd&amp;amount=25&amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=DC&amp;zip=20016&amp;phone=2162818851&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=&amp;recur_weekly=true\n\nIf we win this race, it'll be because of what you did in moments like this.\n\nThanks,\n\nTeam Foust\n\n\nThis message was emailed to: podesta@law.georgetown.edu\n\nTo unsubscribe from this email list, please paste this URL into your browser: \nhttp://act.foustforvirginia.com/unsubscribe\n\nPaid for by John Foust for Congress\n\n"
