john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi dear ones..sorry for length .My clear choice. Neither change nor continuity.but  The different way. The new way. HRC declares the old way of building partisanships flying the special interest flags. Is the root cause of America becoming the Status Quo. Nation where we as a nation are weak and a victim of change.  No when we are our best. We are a nation of doers and dreamers. Builders and architects of the future we do not predict or fall victim of the future. We create the future.\r\n\r\nShe champions with clear vision and grit. We will build not the partisans ships. But rather the Ship of State flying the American Dream flag\r\n\r\nHRC champions 3 to 5 max. Game changing ideals   Declaring not on my watch will the miracle of America be held hostage. To the politics of political cronyism on both sides.\r\n\r\nHRC has a once in a lifetime to declare.  I am in it to unleash the entrepreneurial energy of the America spirit.\r\n\r\nWhere no one is to good and everyone is good enough where our government. Is inspired by the core ideal. That our people have better ideas than our politicians\r\n\r\nNet. I am running to insure that what was. Is not the road map of what can be. Has a leader that knows it is not about us anymore. But about them the  new and Next generation. And that America. Will be the noble and courageous  nation for the core ideals that when we are our best. We create the future. And we are called. To champion freedom and a way of life. Where we shall not rest till everyone everywhere has the god given right to live up to his or her full potential.\r\n\r\nNet net HRC becomes the Means to a noble new beginning . Not the the hero but the great enabler of the new dreamers of  next   Sorry for the the long thought love and hugs to all\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n\r\nOn Jun 28, 2014, at 8:01 PM, "PIR" <preines.hrco@gmail.com<mailto:preines.hrco@gmail.com>> wrote:\r\n\r\nTwo things I thought everyone might find interesting that are getting missed in the noise: attached is a piece running in The New Republic this week, one of the more insightful pieces of late that puts the landscape into far more context than you usually see, ties together a lot of things that are currently only being discussed in isolation of each other.  The second is below, it\'s by someone I otherwise find to be insufferable, but it\'s a smart piece on the "3rd Term Curse" that takes a closer look at the instances where someone has tried to succeed their own party after two terms, and why they won or lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Truly Hard Choice: Change Or Continuity?\r\nBy Fareed Zakaria\r\nThe Washington Post\r\nJune 26, 2014\r\n\r\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s problem is not her money. Despite the media flurry over a couple of awkward remarks she made, most people will understand her situation pretty quickly \xe2\x80\x94 she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t born rich but has become very rich \xe2\x80\x94 and are unlikely to hold it against her. Mitt Romney did not lose the last election because of his wealth. Hispanics and Asians did not vote against him in record numbers because he was a successful businessman. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s great challenge will be to decide whether she represents change or continuity.\r\n\r\nClinton will make history in a big and dramatic way if she is elected \xe2\x80\x94 as the first woman president. But she will make history in a smaller, more complicated sense as well. She would join just three other non-incumbents since 1900 to win the White House after their party had been in power for eight years. She would be the first to win who was not the vice president or the clear prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 of the incumbent president.\r\n\r\nThe examples will clarify. Since 1900, the three were William Howard Taft, Herbert Hoover and George H.W. Bush. Six others tried and lost: James Cox, Adlai Stevenson, Richard Nixon, Hubert Humphrey, Al Gore and John McCain. Interestingly, even the three successful ones had only one term as president.\r\n\r\nA caveat: Beware of any grand pronouncements about the presidency because in statistical terms there have not been enough examples, and if you vary the criteria, you can always find an interesting pattern. The Republican Party broke almost every rule between 1861 and 1933, during which it held the presidency for 52 of the 72 years.\r\n\r\nBut the challenge for Clinton can be seen through the prism of her predecessors \xe2\x80\x94 should she run on change or continuity? The three who won all pledged to extend the president\xe2\x80\x99s policies. They also ran in economic good times with popular presidents. That\xe2\x80\x99s not always a guarantee, of course. Cox promised to be \xe2\x80\x9ca million percent\xe2\x80\x9d behind Woodrow Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s policies, but since Wilson was by then wildly unpopular for his signature policy, the League of Nations, Cox received the most resounding drubbing (in the popular vote) in history.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the candidates had an easier time distancing themselves from unpopular presidents. McCain was clearly a rival and opponent of George W. Bush. Stevenson was very different from Harry Truman, but he was, in effect, asking for not a third term for the Democrats but a sixth term \xe2\x80\x94 after 20 years of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Truman. Shortly before the 1952 election, Stevenson wrote to the Oregon Journal that \xe2\x80\x9cthe thesis \xe2\x80\x98time for a change\xe2\x80\x99 is the principal obstacle ahead\xe2\x80\x9d for his campaign. After all, if the country wants change, it will probably vote for the other party. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time for a change\xe2\x80\x9d was Dwight Eisenhower\xe2\x80\x99s official campaign slogan in 1952.\r\n\r\nThe most awkward circumstance has been for vice presidents trying to distance themselves from their bosses. Humphrey tried mightily to explain that he was different from Lyndon Johnson without criticizing the latter. \xe2\x80\x9cOne does not repudiate his family in order to establish his own identity,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say. Gore faced the same problem in 2000, though many believe that he should not have tried to distance himself so much from a popular president who had presided over good times. As Michael Kinsley noted, Gore\xe2\x80\x99s often fiery and populist campaign seemed to have as its slogan: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve never had it so good, and I\xe2\x80\x99m mad as hell about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToday the country is in a slow recovery and President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s approval ratings are low. This might suggest that the best course would be for Clinton to distance herself from her former boss. But Obamacare and other policies of this president are very popular among many Democratic groups. Again, the three people in her shoes who won all ran on continuity.\r\n\r\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s recent memoir suggests that she has not yet made up her mind as to what course she will follow. The book is a carefully calibrated mixture of praise and criticism, loyalty and voice, such that she can plausibly go in whatever direction she chooses.\r\n\r\nThe world today is different. And Clinton is in a unique position, especially if she can truly mobilize women voters. But history suggests that choosing change or continuity will truly be her hard choice.\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<Noam Scheiber.pdf>\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\nThis e-mail is intended only for the named person or entity to which it is addressed and contains valuable business information that is proprietary, privileged, confidential and/or otherwise protected from disclosure.
