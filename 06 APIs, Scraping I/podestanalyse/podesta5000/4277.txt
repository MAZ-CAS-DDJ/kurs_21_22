longtime friends and supporters \xe2\x80\x93 bio video should\noffer good launch of a longer term effort on this (akin to the Hillary I\nKnow effort of past campaign).\n\n-         Feel like we have mapped out a good start here \xe2\x80\x93 but there is not\nenough unpredictable, unconventional ideas in here for her or campaign, so\nwill keep at that.\n"
