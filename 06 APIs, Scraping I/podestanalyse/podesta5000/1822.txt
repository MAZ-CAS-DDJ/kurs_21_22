Tough sledding on the NSA issues over there.\n Sharp\npolitical problem for their leadership.  They need to show some progress\nengaging USG on surveillance policy, but they understand the challenges\nand don't want to risk alignment on critical interests.  Meanwhile, the\ndamage from loss of trust in the market is causing significant\ndisruptions -- losses for US vendors and over-spend on security for\nGerman firms.  A central issue is the perception in the German business\ncommunity that NSA is engaged in widespread industrial espionage, that\ncrypto standards are hacked, and secure communications with US service\nproviders is non-existent.\n\nOn this issue of industrial espionage and commercial trust - I think we\nhave an opportunity to score points for both sides.  As a practical and\nlegal matter, we are already in broad agreement.  But implementing that\nthrough the development of shared standards would heal wounds in both\npolitics and markets.  Not saying this would be easy - devil is in the\ndetails.  But worth considering in light of your trip.  My former deputy\nfrom State is at a think tank in Berlin these days (he has a German\nwife) - and he has his fingers on the pulse and talks to many of the key\nGerman leaders.  He developed the attached concept paper (2 pages) with\nGerman politicos in mind.  Probably colors outside the lines of the\nState Dept strategy - but worth a look.\n\nI have no business interests/disclosures to make. Just an idea.\n\nI shared my thinking with Merkel's CoS Altmaier and spokesman Steffen\nSeibert.\n\nAlec\n"
