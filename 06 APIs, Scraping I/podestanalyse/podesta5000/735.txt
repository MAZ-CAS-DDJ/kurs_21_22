I don\'t disagree with that.\r\nThe American Automobile Association strongly recommends it."\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYet the www.johnmccain.com <http://www.johnmccain.com/>  campaign\r\nwebsite continues to mock the idea, trying to raise money by offering\r\n"Obama Tire Gauges" to potential contributors.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"McCain\'s double-speak is very revealing," Friends of the Earth Action\'s\r\nDavid Hirsch said. "McCain\'s campaign is attacking Obama for supporting\r\nwhat McCain himself acknowledges is a good idea.  McCain is clearly\r\ninterested in scoring cheap political points instead of supporting real\r\nenergy solutions.  This is the tired old politics of the past, and for\r\ndecades, it has prevented us from reducing our consumption of fossil\r\nfuels.  No wonder voters are demanding change."\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMore on McCain\'s comments yesterday can be found at:\r\nhttp://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/2008/08/05/mccain-takes-air-out-of-tire\r\n-pressure-debate/.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<http://issuealliance.box.net/shared/obj05wzk0k> ###\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFriends of the Earth Action (www.foeaction.org\r\n<http://www.foeaction.org/> ) provides extra muscle to our sister\r\norganization, Friends of the Earth, in legislative battles affecting our\r\nenvironment.
