But we only get the money if you step up.\n\nHayworth is drowning us out on the airwaves, and we need to raise $11,123 more by Monday to defeat her. We\'re counting on you to contribute $250 toward that so we can win. Every dollar you give will double!\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20141017pm-ld&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\nThanks,\n\nTeam Maloney\n\n\n\n--\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com. \n\nTo unsubscribe from the Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress email list, please click here:\n\nhttp://action.seanmaloney.com/page/unsubscribe/?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\n\n\nPaid for by Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n\n\n\n'
