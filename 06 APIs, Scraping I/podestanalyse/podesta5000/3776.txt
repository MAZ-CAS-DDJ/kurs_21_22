We need both.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in here something like this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are our brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, our parents.  These are our families and they need help. In America, we don\xe2\x80\x99t turn our back on people who need help.  We are at our best when we lift people up and don\xe2\x80\x99t leave anyone behind.  We need to lift these people and families up, get them the help they need and stop leaving them behind. That\xe2\x80\x99s what my plan will do. \xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\nFrom: speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com [mailto:speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com] On Behalf Of Ann O\'Leary\r\nSent: Wednesday, September 30, 2015 10:08 AM\r\nTo: Kristina Costa\r\nCc: Speech Drafts; Speech Writers; Sara Solow\r\nSubject: Re: For review/approval: TPs for Thursday substance abuse event\r\n\r\nTwo quick points:\r\n1)Might be good to slam Rand Paul\'s comment that "if you work all day long, you don\'t have time to do heroin" as contrast/out of touch with the woman who says we are sick people trying to do well\r\n2) agree with Huma and would add that it would be good to do more to highlight great plans MA has put in place to address problem and any measures of success they have had (from Sara\'s background memo)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nAnn O\xe2\x80\x99Leary\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n(510) 717-5518 (cell)\r\n\r\nOn Sep 29, 2015, at 2:13 PM, Kristina Costa <kcosta@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:kcosta@hillaryclinton.com>> wrote:\r\nTeam,\r\n\r\nAttaching two pages of TPs for HRC\'s substance abuse event Thursday in Boston.
