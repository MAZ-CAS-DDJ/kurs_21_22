I am proud of my service as an official of the United States government through two Administrations, working in Bosnia, Kosovo, Southeast Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe-- but I believe that the election of Barack Obama represents a sea-change in relations between America and the global community.  I\'m proud of my involvement in the campaign and transition-- not just for myself, but also for what my selection says about the Indian-American community.  This campaign has truly sought out the voices and talents of South Asian Americans in a way never before seen-- and I have every expectation that this attitude will be carried over to the new Administration.\n\n     "A presidential transition is always a time of wild rumors and unfounded gossip, so I\'d like to set to rest a few baseless reports that have been circulating on the Internet:\n          --First, I\'ve never been affiliated-- in any way, shape or form-- with any Indian political party or similar group.  To clear up one false rumor: I\'ve never been affiliated with the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), or any such organization.  I\'ve never been involved in Indian politics, and never intend to do so.\n          --Second, my personal politics have nothing in common with the views espoused by such groups.  I\'ve always condemned any politics of division, of ethnic or religious hatred, of violence and intimidation as a political tool.  That\'s why I\'ve devoted so much of the past two years to the candidacy of a figure who truly does represent my personal political views: Barack Obama.\n         --Third, some Internet rumors have attempted to link me to Hindu Nationalist groups through a variety of tenuous connections: Relief work I\'m proud to have helped coordinate following the Gujarati earthquake of 2001, or cultural and religious affiliations of some of my family members, or apolitical humanitarian work I\'ve been privileged to do as a founder of the NGO Indicorps and as the Director of Global Development for Google.org.  I have no ties to any such groups, and never have.  We saw too much guilt by association during the presidential campaign-- and we saw such tactics decisively repudiated by the American people.\n\n    "I am delighted with what the victory on November 4 says about my country, and about our place in the world.  For too long, Americans of South Asian descent have been made to feel as if we can\'t be proudly desi yet fully American.  For too long, we\'ve had to ask ourselves whether we can overcome this unfair and baseless exclusion.  Last Tuesday-- to my enormous pride and satisfaction-- America gave its reply: Yes, We Can!."\n\nFrom: Denis McDonough\nSent: Monday, November 10, 2008 3:30 PM\nTo: Sonal Shah; Dan Pfeiffer; Chris Lu\nCc: John Podesta; Gayle Smith; Mona Sutphen; john.podesta@gmail.com\nSubject: RE: India Saga\n\nSonal -\n\nWill you please out together such a draft statement for us to look at and work on?\n\nTHanks,\nDenis.\n\nFrom: Sonal Shah\nSent: Monday, November 10, 2008 2:20 PM\nTo: Denis McDonough; Dan Pfeiffer; Chris Lu\nCc: John Podesta; Gayle Smith; Mona Sutphen; john.podesta@gmail.com\nSubject: India Saga\n\nDenis, Chris and Dan:   I am writing to get some guidance from you in managing the India press frenzy about my alleged right wing politics and terrorist tendencies.  Denis since we last talked the stories have multiplied and gotten nastier, feeding on each other.\nIssue:\n\nThere stories are in the Indian press,  in general US and South Asia/US related blogs.  In sum, they are accusing me of being a right wing Hindu fundamentalist and supporting the communal violence in Gujarat.  See some of the articles below - the rest are more of the same.  I generally would not worry about this stuff (they tried this before) except due to my position, it has gotten more intense and frankly crazy.   There are hundered of blog posts and articles on this and without any responses, the rumors are feeding on each other.   More interestingly, they were planning a public campaign to embarras the President-elect and have me resign.   I had several calls from prominent folks in India saying the best way to counter the lies and rumors was to put something out there denying the allegations.   Others suggested doing a controlled interview.\n\nOptions:\n\nThere are several options of what I could do:\n1) continue to ignore\n2)  write a strongly worded statement clearly stating my position\n3) do a controlled interview\n\n Next Steps:\n\nI would like to get your guidance on how to proceed with this.  Personally think option 2 will put it to rest, but have less experience with this stuff.  I suggest to get this done today, so we can get into the India news cycles for tomorrow and the let the surrogates (who are fully prepared to do) take over from there.\n\n\nThanks!\nSonal\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nhttp://www.panasianbiz.com/2008/11/07/indian-american-sonal-shah-appointed-obamas-advisor/#comment-5387\nhttp://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Sonal-Shah-appointed-Obama-s-transition-team-adviser/382248/\nhttp://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/3quarksdaily/2008/11/obamas-indian-t.html\nhttp://wordpress.com/tag/sonal-shah/\nhttp://bodyontheline.wordpress.com/2008/11/08/more-on-divided-loyalties-this-time-its-the-economy/\nhttp://freethedalit.blogspot.com/2008/11/obama-advisor-sonal-shah-has-rss-vhp.html\nhttp://letusbuildpakistan.blogspot.com/2008/11/yet-another-controversial-obama.html\nhttp://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=&id=c92bdef7-a366-47df-bf51-daae396caeec&MatchID1=4816&TeamID1=6&TeamID2=1&MatchType1=1&SeriesID1=1212&PrimaryID=4816&Headline=Obama+team+member%2c+Sonal%2c+has+VHP+links\nhttp://www.persecution.in/node/3462\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/page/community/tag/VHP\nhttp://lucius-caesar.livejournal.com/28668.html\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Will_Sonal_Shah_give_Modi_visa_power/articleshow/3690558.cms\nhttp://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/005506.html\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/saints/gGxZfm\nhttp://www.dictatorshipwatch.com/2008/11/08/the-many-faces-of-sonal-shah-obamas-indian.html\nhttp://www.sacw.net/article257.html\n'
