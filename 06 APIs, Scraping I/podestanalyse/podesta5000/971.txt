john.podesta@gmail.comb'I have also been told that they are going with the straight \xe2\x80\x9cfour words\xe2\x80\x9d\nfix approach \xe2\x80\x93 and putting the R\xe2\x80\x99s feet to the fire -- but would be good to\nconfirm with Denis.\n\n\n\n*From:* Ann O\'Leary [mailto:aoleary@hillaryclinton.com]\n*Sent:* Wednesday, June 17, 2015 12:03 PM\n*To:* John Podesta; Jake Sullivan; Maya Harris; Kristina Schake; Jennifer\nPalmieri\n*Subject:* King v. Burwell intel\n\n\n\nI talked to Jeanne Lambrew this morning.  A couple of notes:\n\n\n\n(1) John - She says that they will share info with us on their strategy but\nshe\'s not authorized to do it; needs to be on the John-Dennis level.  Would\nbe great if you could check in with Dennis;\n\n\n\n(2) From comms perspective, Josh Dorn (former CAPer) now working for Anita\nDunn and Hilary Rosen is really handling outside response and he is great.\nI\'ve been in touch with him, but didn\'t quite realize what a big role he\nhad.  Jen/Kristina - Would be great to get your team on with me and Shapiro\nfrom our team to talk to them.  Let me know the right person from your team\nto do it with us.\n\n\n\n(3) Jeanne did confirm that their overall strategy is to quickly pivot to\nCongress and point fingers that we want a "fix" and Rs want to "repeal" -\nthey\'ve tested it and it works well.  They recognize that any\nadministrative fix is going to land them right back in court.\n\n\n\n(4) If we win, they also think it is an opportunity for us to really\neducate the public about the benefits of the ACA and hope we\'ll help to do\nthat\n\n\n\n-- \n\nAnn O\'Leary\n\nSenior Policy Advisor\n\nHillary for America\n\nCell: 510-717-5518\n'
