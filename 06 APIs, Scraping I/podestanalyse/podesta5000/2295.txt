I\'d pull that trick with a lot of folks, tell them she wants to talk to them, set up a date in the future, watch them all suddenly behave.\n\n\nFrom: "robbymook@gmail.com<mailto:robbymook@gmail.com>" <robbymook@gmail.com<mailto:robbymook@gmail.com>>\nDate: Wednesday, December 17, 2014 at 10:51 PM\nTo: PIR <pir@hrcoffice.com<mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com>>\nCc: CDM <Cheryl.mills@gmail.com<mailto:Cheryl.mills@gmail.com>>, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com<mailto:nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>>, Huma Abedin <Huma@clintonemail.com<mailto:Huma@clintonemail.com>>, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com<mailto:dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>>, Jake Sullivan <jake.sullivan@gmail.com<mailto:jake.sullivan@gmail.com>>\nSubject: Re: Axelrod\n\nHuma and i were discussing earlier today.

"And what would the future look like under another President Clinton, and I suspect that\'s what she\'s taking her time working through now, but she has to answer that question."\n\nLiberal groups have been pushing forward with an effort to convince Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to challenge Clinton from the left on economic issues.\n\nMoveOn.org<http://MoveOn.org>, one of the groups, announced Monday that it has passed 100,000 signatures on its "Run Warren Run" petition. Warren insists she is not running but always phrases the denial in the present tense, which some see as leaving the door open.\n\nAsked if there is an opening for Warren, Axelrod said, "I suppose there is."\n\n"My suspicion is that what she\'s doing is trying to influence how Hillary frames her candidacy and the issues she focuses on," Axelrod said. "I think Elizabeth is very sincere about her concerns about what\'s happening in the American economy, and Hillary hasn\'t yet said what exactly her program will be, what she\'s running on. I think Elizabeth knows she\'s got maximum leverage by still being in the conversation."\n\nMany of Axelrod\'s fellow Obama campaign alumni are now working for Clinton\'s campaign-in-waiting in some capacity. Jim Messina, Obama\'s 2012 campaign manager, for example, signed on as co-chairman of the pro-Clinton super-PAC Priorities USA.\n\nTwo more top campaign aides, Mitch Stewart and Jeremy Bird, have joined Ready for Hillary.\n\n'
