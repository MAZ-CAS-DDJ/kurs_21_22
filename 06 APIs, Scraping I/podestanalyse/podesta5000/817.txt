john.podesta@gmail.comb'\n\nDear\xc2\xa0John D.,\n\nThis afternoon, I voted against the latest fast track deal in Congress that would smooth the way for yet another bad trade deal at the expense of American workers.\n\nInstead of fast-tracking trade deals, we should be fast-tracking the middle-class!\n\nWe should create millions of jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges. We should invest in our schools and access to college. We should give hardworking folks a living wage.\n\nInstead Congress is trying to fast track the TPP trade deal that would reward countries like Japan who manipulate their currencies \xe2\x80\x93 at the expense of American jobs.\n\nTo be extremely clear: when other countries cheat on their currency, it hurts American businesses and costs American workers their jobs.\xc2\xa0\n\nClick here to sign the petition. Tell Congress: Don\xe2\x80\x99t fast track another bad trade deal. Fast track the middle-class!\n\nhttp://www.stabenowforsenate.com/action/say-%E2%80%9Cno%E2%80%9D-more-bad-trade-deals-cost-american-jobs\n\nI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll join me in this fight.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nDebbie Stabenow\nUnited States Senator\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n----------------------------------------------\n|    Paid for by Stabenow for U.S. Senate    |\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nStabenow for U.S. Senate\nP.O.
