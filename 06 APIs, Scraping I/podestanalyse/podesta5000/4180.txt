We hope you had an enjoyable and restful holiday break.\n\nPlease review the following important reminders:\n\nRegistration/Add-Drop/Waitlist:  Add/Drop and Waitlist activity for Spring 2016 courses begins today and ends on Tuesday, January 26. The Spring Waitlist Lottery will be run daily at 3:00 p.m. through Friday, January 22nd; if you wish to be included in a daily lottery run, you must add yourselves to the waitlist before 3:00 p.m. each day.    Note: If you are already on a waitlist, please do not waitlist yourself again, as this will affect your date priority.  Please also note that registration services in MyAccess will be temporarily unavailable for a few hours each evening while the waitlist lottery is being processed.  Waitlist winners will have until 3:00 p.m. the day they are offered the seat(s) to claim.  If you fail to claim the seat(s) by the deadline, you will forfeit the seat(s).\n\nIf a course is NOT professor-permission, enrollment is processed through the daily waitlist lottery.  Please note that a professor may NOT approve your enrollment in a waitlisted course.\n\nYour Spring 2016 schedule must be finalized by 3:00 pm on January 26, 2016.  Any requests to drop a course after this deadline will result in a withdrawal from the course which will be reflected as a "W" on your transcript.\n\nLLM students may schedule an appointment to meet with an advisor by contacting the Office of Graduate Programs at 202-662-9036 or gradprog@law.georgetown.edu<mailto:gradprog@law.georgetown.edu>.\n\nFall 2015 Grades:  Fall 2015 grades deadline was noon on Friday, January 15, 2016.
