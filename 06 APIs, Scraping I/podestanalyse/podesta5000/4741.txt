I think it best to simply say that some of our AR based supporters have offered to reach out to individual W family members to discuss best ways to support HRC and given the visible support they have given charters and TFA we want to make sure we can do this. And, if a particular effort doesn't make sense, do others like joint accts. thx\n\nJos\xc3\xa9 H. Villarreal\njhv.cg@att.net\n210-744-7060\n\nSent from my iPhone"
