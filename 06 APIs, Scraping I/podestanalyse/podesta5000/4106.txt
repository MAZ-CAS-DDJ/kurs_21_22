Jeb Bush said he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnot sure we need half a billion dollars for women\xe2\x80\x99s health issues.\xe2\x80\x9d  He\xe2\x80\x99s got no problem giving away billions to the super-wealthy and powerful corporations, but I guess women\xe2\x80\x99s health just isn\xe2\x80\x99t very important. \n> \n> \xc2\xb7      Governor Bush, try telling that to the mom who caught her breast cancer early because she was able to get a screening.  Was her health not worth the money?  Tell it to the teenager who avoided an unwanted pregnancy because she had access to contraception.  Tell it to everyone who was protected by an HIV test.\n> \n> \xc2\xb7      Governor Bush, you say you\xe2\x80\x99re learning to show America \xe2\x80\x9cyour heart.\xe2\x80\x9d  Well today you showed America\xe2\x80\x99s women your contempt.  \n> \n> \xc2\xb7      Now, of course, he\xe2\x80\x99s scrambling to clean up the mess.  The Bush campaign claims what he meant to say was that we should just defund Planned Parenthood.  Maybe someone should clue Jeb in to what Planned Parenthood actually does \xe2\x80\x93 it provides vital health care to millions of American women. \n> \n> \xc2\xb7      I\xe2\x80\x99ve been fighting for women and families my entire adult life, and I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of the double speak.  I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of women being shamed and blamed and dismissed.  This isn\xe2\x80\x99t complicated: When you attack Planned Parenthood, you attack women\xe2\x80\x99s health.  And when you attack women\xe2\x80\x99s health, you attack America\xe2\x80\x99s health.  \n> \n> <2015-08-04 CO stump talking points 7pm.docx>\n"
