Jeremiah\nWright, a front John McCain and the GOP have avoided.\n\n"There\'s Rev. Jeremiah Wright and his church, to which Obama contributed\n$26,000 over the years, even as Wright spouted anti-American hatred,"\nLaPierre writes in a list of Obama\'s "friends."\n\nThe mailing also included a wallet card  (below) listing what the NRA claims\nare Obama\'s positions on guns, though they are not in fact his campaign\npositions, and in many cases it seems flatly to contradict them. The NRA\nclaims Obama wants to bar the use of firearms for home defense and ban the\nmanufacture and sale of handguns. How the group reaches those conclusions is\nunclear. In one case, though, it interprets an Illinois proposal he backed\nto close gun shops near schools and parks as a plan to "close down 90\npercent of the gun shops in America."\n\nAccording to the campaign\n(.pdf)<http://www.barackobama.com/issues/additional/Obama_FactSheet_Western_Sportsmen.pdf>,\nObama "will protect the rights of hunters and other law-abiding Americans to\npurchase, own, transport, and use guns for the purposes of hunting and\ntarget shooting."\nHe\'s also said he believes there is an individual right to bear arms.\n\nThe mailing appears in full, with criticism, on an online bulletin\nboard<http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=2913644&userid=0&perpage=40&pagenumber=65#post347349084>,\nbut NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam confirmed its validity.\n\n\n*By Ben Smith 12:42 PM*\ncomments (31)<http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0808/NRA_Obama_most_antigun_candidate_ever_will_ban_guns.html#comments>\n  |\npost comment   |\npermalink<http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0808/NRA_Obama_most_antigun_candidate_ever_will_ban_guns.html?showall>\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
