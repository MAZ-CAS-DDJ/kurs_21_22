The 18 Eurozone leaders will meet on Sunday at 4pm, followed by a meeting of the 28 EU leaders at 6pm.  Some members of the Eurogroup were pushing for a conclusion that would have given a mandate to begin formal negotiations; but other member states, particularly the Germans and the Finns, refused to sign on.  Many countries remain concerned about the \xe2\x82\xac80 billion financing gap identified by the IMF as Greece\xe2\x80\x99s needs over the next 3 years.\r\n>\r\n> A document has surfaced in the press allegedly summarizing a hard line German position that Greece must either commit to additional reforms and put aside assets in escrow for later privatization or else leave the Eurozone for five years. While officials have not acknowledged the veracity of the document, its contents match positions that the German finance ministry has taken in the past, and hence it underscores Chancellor Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s challenge in managing her own domestic politics surrounding Greece.  Importantly, however, we are hearing that most of Greece\xe2\x80\x99s European creditors have now accepted that debt relief will be necessary in any new program, though reportedly a number of countries are concerned about the magnitude of this relief.  The most likely option is extending the maturity of Greece\xe2\x80\x99s debt and further reducing interest rates, as Germany has indicated that providing outright nominal hair-cuts is a redline. For the Greeks, this will make passing and implementing reform more palatable, but for Greece\xe2\x80\x99s European creditors it will further complicate the politics of providing Greece with a third program.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> ----- Original Message -----\r\n> From: DMCOS\r\n> Sent: Saturday, July 11, 2015 06:11 PM\r\n> To: 'ami@presidentclinton.com' <ami@presidentclinton.com>\r\n> Cc: 'Jon@presidentclinton.com' <Jon@presidentclinton.com>; 'John.podesta@gmail.com' <John.podesta@gmail.com>; 'Tina@presidentclinton.com' <Tina@presidentclinton.com>; Wang, Ya W.
