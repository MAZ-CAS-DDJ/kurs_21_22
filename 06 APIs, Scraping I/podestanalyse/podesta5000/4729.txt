Charles Gonzalez of Texas and Rep.\nRobert Brady of Pennsylvania have noticed a "disturbing\npattern" of incidents, raising concerns about voting rights in\nColorado under Gessler\'s watch-culminating in his lawsuit\nto prevent the mailing of ballots to tens of thousands of legally\nregistered voters in Denver. [1]\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=cV0EkUOrQT0aZwlOeKcmZg\n\n"Given the diversity of the state of Colorado, and particularly\nthat of Denver County, there is a high likelihood that the barrier to\nvoting Secretary Gessler seeks to impose on these eligible citizens\nand registered voters will have such a discriminatory result in\nviolation of the Voting Rights Act," the letter states.\n\nGessler\'s irresponsible and reckless move to suppress the vote\nin Denver, coming after so many other lapses in judgment and partisan\ngames from Gessler in his short time in office, is on the verge of\nbecoming a nationwide scandal. Thanks in part to thousands of\nProgressNow Colorado members who have already spoken out against\nGessler\'s vote suppression, he may not get away with this one!\nIf you haven\'t already, please take a moment to sign our\npetition demanding that Gessler immediately stop his attempt to deny\ntens of thousands of legally registered voters in Denver ballots.\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=SQQXr4B-sFIEOGsBlQ1TKw\n\nWe will deliver your signatures and comments to Gessler\'s\noffice, the press, and other elected officials no later than Friday.\nIf you\'ve already signed the petition, please forward this email to\nanyone you know who would be interested.\n\nI can tell you it\'s very heartening to see the massive response\nagainst Gessler on this issue. It\'s still a bit of a shock to\nsee a Secretary of State trying to prevent people from voting, but\nworking together, we are going to stop him from succeeding. Thank you\nfor doing your part.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlan Franklin\n\nDonations\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=LNEtimWAZl8g-0G5-kXfgg\n\n\n\n\xa9 2010 ProgressNow Colorado.
