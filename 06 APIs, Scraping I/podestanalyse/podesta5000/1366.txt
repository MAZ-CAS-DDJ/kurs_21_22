john.podesta@gmail.comb'Team \xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n\nIn advance of the 11AM call with HRC, pulling together an email on\nrecommendations for ad traffic going forward (a summary spreadsheet also\nattached of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening now \xe2\x80\x93 but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include next steps, that\xe2\x80\x99s\nbelow). Please let me know if we should include, or cover, more with HRC.\n\n\n\n*Basic Strategy: *Fundamentally, in the Midwest states, we must be in a\ncore economic barriers lane.  *Yesterday, we completed an ad-test that\nlooked at a number of our spots up against his trade ad*. Based on those\nresults \xe2\x80\x93 and what we learned in several nights of focus groups \xe2\x80\x93 we\nbelieve we should be making a dual economic argument \xe2\x80\x93 going after\ncorporate greed + a forward-looking vision to create jobs.  Our research\nalso shows that this is the best strategy to inoculate against incoming\nattacks on trade.  We also need to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re informing/mobilizing\nour African American and Hispanic base.\n\n*What that means in terms of creative: *\n\n\n\n\xc3\x98  For the core broadcast/cable buy:\n\no   In the corporate greed lane, we run a combination of \xe2\x80\x9cValeant\xe2\x80\x9d\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiuprRC4K2Y&feature=youtu.be> and \xe2\x80\x9cJohnson\nControls <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIssKIHfUAI&feature=youtu.be>\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93\nthese continue to test very well in every way that we test it.\n\no   In job creation lane, we recommend bringing in \xe2\x80\x9cForward\xe2\x80\x9d -- a\nforward-looking jobs spot being finalized this am (current link below) that\nwas the highest performing in our recent ad-test.  After viewers watched\nhis Trade ad and \xe2\x80\x9cForward\xe2\x80\x9d, we saw an increase in our attributes (+10-15),\nimproved favorability (+5) and we gained traction in the horserace (+4\nswing).\n\nForward: https://hfa2016.app.box.com/s/syz3fjgkdq86o59lda09dxcba51fmhie\n\no   The team is also finalizing a .60 spot \xe2\x80\x93 using HRC\xe2\x80\x99s VO from recent\nevents \xe2\x80\x93 focused on economic barriers.  This would be a \xe2\x80\x9cbigger\xe2\x80\x9d spot with\nsome lift.\n\n\n\n\xc3\x98  African American:\n\no   Running a unique African American track \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cStand\xe2\x80\x9d\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTuWlHb9LuE&feature=youtu.be> \xe2\x80\x93 on AA\nheavy programing in St. Louis, Chicago, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Raleigh,\nCharlotte and Orlando.\n\no   AA radio (both Morgan Freeman\n<https://soundcloud.com/hillary-clinton-976818877/imagine-hillary-clinton-6/s-IL6Rn>\nand Kerry Washington\n<https://soundcloud.com/hillary-clinton-976818877/fight-for-us-hillary-clinton-4/s-AQYjE>,\ntargeted by age) in all major markets. (Note: Bernie is doing no AA radio)\n\no   GOTV mail dropping to expanded AA target universe\n\no   Very robust digital mobilization and election education\n\no   Newspaper ads across all markets\n\n\xc3\x98  Hispanic:\n\no   Running SL TV ad on Univision in Florida markets and in Chicago \xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x9cValentia\xe2\x80\x9d <https://youtu.be/AKMSuTI8XRk>\n\no   Spanish language radio in Florida, Chicago (Gutierrez\n<https://soundcloud.com/hillary-clinton-976818877/pasion-profunda-hillary-clinton-1/s-Voo95>)\nand Cleveland\n\no   Digital education/GOTV in Florida\n\no   Newspaper ads in Florida and Chicago\n\n\xc3\x98  College: We\xe2\x80\x99re running the college debt\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wDcKPnbgfQ&feature=youtu.be> ad on cable\nsystems in college towns all across MO/OH/IL\n\n\xc3\x98  Using paid media to drive earned media:\n\no   Tomorrow, the campaign will run the Shonda Rimes/other actresses ad\nthree times on ABC during primetime in all March 15 markets. The press and\ndigital teams will be rolling it out in a way to maximize amplification.\n\no   On Monday, the campaign is working to place a 3-minute \xe2\x80\x9cMothers of the\nMovement\xe2\x80\x9d <https://app.frame.io/f/0IhDYJLn> ad on in the key networks.  The\npress team would roll it out on Sunday.\n\n\n\n*Spending: *\n\n\xc3\x98  We\xe2\x80\x99re outspending or even with Sanders in all of the key March 15\nmarkets.\n\n\n\xc3\x98  We\xe2\x80\x99re also running fairly robust AA radio, Sanders is not running any.\n'
