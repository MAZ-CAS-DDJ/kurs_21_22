This Tuesday afternoon Senator Harry Reid will bring the repeal of "Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell" to the floor of the United States Senate for a vote. The policy has been a monumental failure for our nation\'s military and has both excluded and discharged qualified men and women from service. Repeal of DADT has been a legislative priority for VoteVets.org. It is imperative that all Americans, regardless of their race, religion, creed, or sexual orientation be afforded the opportunity to serve.\n \n*Call your Senators and ask them to vote for a repeal of Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell TODAY* - *Click here to look up your senators and their phone numbers* [ http://hq-org2.democracyinaction.org/o/6676/getLocal.jsp ]\n \nWe are losing too many qualified men and women due to this policy.\n \nWest Point Cadet Katharine Miller, 9th in her class and the epitome of what our nation\'s military is seeking in its officer core recently offered her resignation. Cadet Miller explained to her superiors that she could no longer comply with the military\'s "Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell" policy.\n \nLt. Colonel Victor Fehrenbach, an 18 year veteran of the United States Air Force and F-15 pilot is currently awaiting discharge over DADT. Taxpayers have spent over twenty five million dollars on his training and he has returned this investment with faithful and honorable service. Lt. Col. Fehrenbach received nine air medals, one for heroism and flew numerous combat missions in Afghanistan.\n \nHow many more service members will be affected and at what cost to the morale of our military? Our nation can no longer afford to lose its best and brightest due to this travesty. We cannot afford to lose another Katharine Miller or Victor Fehrenbach.\n \nA recent poll of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans show that over 70 percent feel it is personally acceptable to them for gays and lesbians to serve openly.\n \nBoth Admiral Michael Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates have called for the repeal of DADT. \n\n*Call your Senators and ask them to vote for a repeal of Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell TODAY* - *Click here to look up your senators and their phone numbers* [ http://hq-org2.democracyinaction.org/o/6676/getLocal.jsp ]\n\n \nThank you for your support.\n \nSincerely,\n \nJon Soltz\nIraq War Veteran\nChairman, VoteVets.org \n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n\nVoteVets.org \n\n [ http://www.facebook.com/pages/VoteVetsorg/8501031021 ]  [ http://www.twitter.com/votevets ]  [ http://www.youtube.com/votevets ] \n\nYou are subscribed to this list as john.podesta@gmail.com.
