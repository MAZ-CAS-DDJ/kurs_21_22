john.podesta@gmail.comb'All - some options for the SOS blank:\n\nWhen the Chinese were resisting joining in the sanctions against Iran, I went to Beijing and laid it on the line with their top leadership.  They joined us and the result was the most effective sanctions coalition in history, which paved the way for the current diplomacy.  \n\nWhen the Chinese, Indians, and Brazilians were working together to avoid responsibility for helping to fight climate change, President Obama and I crashed a meeting of their leaders and didn\'t leave until they agreed to share the burden.\n\nBefore the Arab Spring, when others were tiptoeing around, I went straight into the Arab capitals and told the leaders that their countries were sinking into the sand.  \n\nWhen Putin and his cronies interfered in the Russian elections, I stood up and called him out.  He blamed me for starting the protests that rocked Moscow - I was proud to stand with everyday Russians calling for democracy.  \n\nIf these don\'t work can try more. \n\n> On Apr 4, 2015, at 11:02 PM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com> wrote:\n> \n> Easter Mass calls.
