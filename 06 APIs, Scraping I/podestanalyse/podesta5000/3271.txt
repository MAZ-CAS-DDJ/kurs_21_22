I won't stop until this shutdown is over.\n\nI'm committed to ending this crisis, but I need your help. Sign your name to end the shutdown:\n\nhttp://action.cheribustos.com/page/ocs/Shutdown/l9stfxlt?source=em_2013.10.11_cb\n\nThanks for taking action,\n\nCheri  \n\n\n\n\nThis message was emailed to: john.podesta@gmail.com\n\nTo unsubscribe from this email list, please paste this URL into your browser: \nhttp://action.cheribustos.com/unsubscribe\n\nPaid for by the Friends of Cheri Bustos\n\n"
