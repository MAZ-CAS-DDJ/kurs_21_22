Although exciting, so many conflicting priorities can be challenging\nto manage. Sometimes we forget to stop and breathe, we put our own\nself-care on the back burner and mindlessly forge ahead. For 2015-16, I\ninvite you to try a different approach. This year, many of our GUWellness\nactivities, programming and workshops are designed to compliment each other\nso that we deepen our community\xe2\x80\x99s journey of living a mindful and\ncompassionate WHOLE life. Try it. Who knows? You might love it. Need some\ninspiration?

This\nnew amenity, in addition to our existing commuter shower, has made it\neasier for our staff members to adopt active and environmentally-friendly\ncommuting practices. Halley Lisuk, Business Manager for the Dean\'s Office,\nexplains how the new racks help her enjoy a more active commute: "After\nbiking in from Falls Church it\'s great to not have to worry about finding a\nplace on campus that is secure and covered for my bike. I feel like it\'s\nthe equivalent of having a garage for your car at home or a reserved\nparking spot at work. You don\'t have to think about taking the time to find\na spot or worry that you\'ll have to circle the block multiple times in\nhopes of finding a place to put your bike. It certainly motivates me to\nride in more frequently and takes away one more excuse not to do so." The\nSFS Dean\'s Office is proud to be the first (but hopefully not the last!)\noffice on the main campus to provide secure, convenient, indoor bicycle\nparking available to its staff members. ~Submitted by Greg Miller. *Do you\nhave a wellness idea/story to share?
