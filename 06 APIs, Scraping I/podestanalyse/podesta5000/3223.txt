It discusses POTUS position on RFS in context of carbon/Paris/investment. The message is definitely making its way into key states. With the EPA rule coming out (probably Monday), we are concerned that these "distribution waivers" are still in the program (see POTUS letter above for refresher on that problem). It is absurdly easy to get them out, but anyway. I have also attached some recent communications from Congress/UAW on the issue in case you missed them. In the event these waivers are still in the final rule on Monday, my undisguised self-interest is to have important people distance themselves from that decision. If these waivers become the perceptive law of the land, we will lose a ton of investment. I am always available if you want to chat. Happy thanksgiving. -b\n\nR.
