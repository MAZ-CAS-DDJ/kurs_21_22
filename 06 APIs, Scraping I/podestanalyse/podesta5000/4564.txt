john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hello All,\nJust got off the phone with our tracker, Kelli, on the ground in Sparks, NV.\nBelow are the notes from our call.\n\n*BIG HIGHLIGHTS: *\n*\n\n   - Asked if he would raise taxes, answers point-blank "No"\n   - Says CA drillers told him yesterday they could get offshore oil within\n   a matter of months, so don\'t listen to these estimates of 5 years out, etc.\n   - Says Obama wants peace but he still opposes strategy that any rational\n   person can see succeeded in Iraq\n   - Tells disabled woman about to lose her home that he supported ADA years\n   ago and we need to update it\n   - Says he\'s also "a quote \'survivor\' " of cancer, but it\'s been 8 years,\n   gives mini "commercial" about wearing sunscreen etc.\n   - Tells woman the chances of her nephew surviving Afghanistan are good\n   but he\'s putting himself in harm\'s way; we will soon have a "new strategy"\n   in Afghanistan\n   - Says he "relish[es] being the underdog," Hits Obama on public financing\n   - Says he is a "proud conservative" but he believes government needs to\n   "help people who can\'t help themselves"\n   - Cindy likens McCain to the Rwandan women she recently visited\n\n\n*\n*Sparks, NV: McCain Town Hall 07/29/08\n(Disclaimer: The following are notes, not direct quotes. If you\'d like a\nquotable transcript or video of any part below, please email us.)\n\nBackground Details\n\n   - Approx. 1000 people (Mostly white middle age couples and students from\n   the high school)\n\n\n   - Huge sign that says "Country First"\n   - Also in audience were ROTC members in dress uniforms - seated up front\n   along with cheerleaders (presumably from high school)\n   - About 10 protesters after the event, including antiwar protesters and a\n   Ron Paul supporter supporting GOP but not McCain\n   - Mayor of Sparks gives introductory remarks - tells crowd to expect a\n   "secret guest speaker" (turns out to be Cindy McCain)\n   - Cindy introduces her husband\n      - Last week I went to Rwanda with ONE.org. Rwanda is a country that is\n      and will be taken into the future by women, after forgiving the\nperpetrators\n      that raped them  and left them for their dead. They want not only what\'s\n      best for their children but what\'s best for their country.\n      - I found a comparison - my husband was kept as a POW in Vietnam for 5\n      years, he suffered and overcame many things and then he reconciled with\n      Vietnam. My husband embodies everything that is great about\nAmericans. "My\n      husband, like the Rwandan women" is the essence of hope and courage.\n\n\nSpeech Highlights\n\n   - TY to Cindy, I\'m very proud of the work she\'s done around the world.\n   - 17 years ago, Cindy was doing good work with a medical team in\n   Bangladesh at an orphanage run by Mother Teresa\'s nuns. Cindy brought 2\n   babies to USA, one of them had a severe cleft palate, and she is now our\n   daughter, Bridget and she has enriched our lives.\n   - TY to Mary Vesco, principal at Reed High, TY to Gov. Brian Kilicky, to\n   Mayors Gino Martini and Brian Kachell (former Reno mayor)\n   - Story about winning his Senate seat only to be called by a campaign\n   aide about changing garbage days but she didn\'t want to bother the mayor\n   because she didn\'t want to bother an important man like that. TY to mayors.\n   - This is the essence of democracy.\n   - I love this state. We in AZ are angry because you steal our water. I am\n   grateful to visit a fellow western state that faces the same challenges of\n   water, Native Americans, etc. I understand the issues. NV will be a swing\n   state and I will win it.\n   - 1 more story- AZ is the only state where mothers don\'t tell their\n   children that some day they can grow up and be POTUS. But I will be able to\n   reverse that unhappy history.\n   - I\'ll make it quick because the purpose of the Townhall meeting is for\n   me to listen to you. I would never be able to understand the issues\n   important to you without these hundreds, maybe thousands, of town halls.\n   Service to c\n   - I\'ve been called a maverick, sometimes meant as compliment sometimes\n   criticism. What it really means is understand who I work for: not a party,\n   not a POTUS, a special interest, myself - I work for you.\n   - I spoke up against an administration for a strategy in Iraq that will\n   allow us to bring our troops home in honor.\n   - I spoke up against my party for out-of-control spending.\n   - I spoke up against my Administration and both parties in Congress on\n   the energy bill.\n   - My independence hasn\'t always made me friends in DC.\n   - I\'ve had pundits adn politicians tell me this isn\'t smart, but I don\'t\n   answer to them, I answer to you. Country first.\n   - We need to change the way government does business, from security to\n   education to education to ATC. All these functions of govt were designed\n   before the rise of the global economy.\n   - We have to change the way things are done.\n   - It\'s hard trying to do the Lord\'s work in satan\'s city.\n   - Obama is an impressive speaker, I applaud his success - everyone should\n   be proud of his accomplishments. My problem is that what he says and what he\n   does are 2 different things. He makes things harder. He says he wants to\n   change DC but his solution is to make govt bigger. He\'s asked for millions\n   in earmarks. Not me.\n   - Obama said he would only tax the rich, but pretty much anythign he can\n   tax, he\'ll tax more. I will keep taxes low, not because I want to protect\n   the rich but because it keeps jobs at home.\n   - Obama says he wants energy independence but he doesn\'t want nuclear, he\n   doesn\'t want research in an electric car.\n   - Obama says the problem isn\'t that gas prices are too high but that they\n   rose too fast. Gas prices may not matter to him, but they do to you.\n   - We ought to start with drilling offshore so we can bring down the cost\n   of gas. We can do it.\n   - Nuclear power works.\n   - We are spending $700B to bad people with foreign oil dependence. We can\n   get off of this.\n   - Sen Obama says he wants peace but even today he opposes the strategy\n   that has succeeded in Iraq and will succeed in Afgh. No rational person can\n   look at the on-the-ground situation in IRaq and say the surge hasn\'t\n   succeeded. The last 5 brigades that were part of the surge are on their\n   way home\n   - I want to thank them. How do you (Obama) do that and tell them great\n   job but you lost?\n   - In war and peace, I\'ve been an imperfect servant. But nothing ever\n   mattered more to me than the honor of serving America and nothing ever will.\n   - If you elect me POTUS, I assure you I will always put country first.\n   America wants that type of person. I will stand for you. And we will\n   disagree from time to time.\n   - A long time ago far away in a POW camp in N Vietnam, I was offered an\n   opportunity to return home early but it was against our code of conduct. A\n   brave friend of mine, Everett Alvarez was there and he had been there first.\n   It was a hard decision, but I put my country first.\n   - Asks vets to raise their hands so we can thank them. You are a constant\n   motivation to me to do the right thing.\n   - Now we\'ll begin the part you really came for.\n\n\nQuestion & Answer\n\n   - [woman has problem with microphone. McCain jokes that the microphone\n   \'is brought to you by the Democratic National Committee\'\n   - 1Q) I\'m a 4th generation farmer. No one else will be a picker than\n   Mexicans. Now we can\'t find enough of them. If not, I\'m worried we won\'t get\n   the food Americans need. It is happening. Farmers are going out of business.\n      - MCCAIN: Agriculture is important. American farmers are the best in\n      the world. What you\'re talking about is the failure on the part\nof Congress\n      to get immigration reform, get border security, get a legit\ntemporary worker\n      program and solve the illegal immigration problem. The temp\nworker program\n      would mean people can come to this country, work for a couple of\nyears and\n      then go back to their home country. That\'s different the process for\n      citizenship, where they get a green card. This can be done legally not\n      illegally.\n      - Brings me to another problem. I was in Colombia and Mexico. The drug\n      cartels are taking over Mexico. We\'ve got to work with Calderon. This Mex\n      President wants to take control of Mexico over the drug cartels.\nWe have to\n      secure our borders. Drugs are part of the problem, people coming over and\n      killing Americans.\n      - You have my sympathy, we need a temporary worker program.\n\n\n\n   - [WW2 vet yelling against idea of Mexicans needed to supply labor -\n   advocated child labor instead]\n      - MCCAIN: One of the things we can\'t do at town hall meetings is not\n      yell or else we\'ll all be yelling at each other. I will come to you next.\n\n\n\n   - 2Q) I\'m scared/horrified about our national debt. How the hell are we\n   going to pay for it?\n      - MCCAIN: I don\'t think that I\'m scared. But Americans are not\n      appreciative that we let spending get out of control and we mortgaged our\n      futures. Congressional approval is down to 9% - how do you get lower than\n      that? We Republicans, to our shame, let spending get out of control. With\n      legislation like the Medicare Prescription Drug bill, which is a\ngood bill\n      but we didn\'t pay for it.\n      - The 1st thing Ill do after I\'m sworn in as POTUS is sit down with\n      the Dems and say let\'s fix Social Security. For once we can put\nthe country\n      first and not mortgage a young man\'s future.\n\n\n\n   - 3Q) [WW2 vet that had been yelling] modify child labor laws to supply\n   labor force we need (instead of Mexicans)\n      - MCCAIN: I still think we need a child labor law that works.\n\n\n\n   - 4Q) I became disabled, which means I can\'t go back to teaching and I\n   have 2 kids. I get $600 / month from SSI. My house that I\'ve had for 15\n   years is going to go into re-foreclosure. How can you help?\n      - MCCAIN: I am proud I was one of the key sponsors to ADA.\n      - Americans w/ adn w/o disabilities are hurting with cost of gas,\n      staying in their homes.\n      - We\'ve also got to look at ADA and update it to make sure it\'s able\n      to do what it was supposed to do\n      - In the short term, I\'d be happy to look at your case personally and\n      make sure you can provide for your children.\n      - NV was one of the hardest hit by housing crisis. Make sure people\n      can stay in their homes. My plan is to make sure you can get a\nFHA 30-year\n      guaranteed loan at new value. When you decide to sell house, 1/3\nof selling\n      price each goes to govt, to lender and to you.\n      - [McCain\n\n\n\n   - 5Q) [small girl asks question] If you\'re POTUS, will you raise our\n   taxes?\n      - MCCAIN: No. And that\'s one of the big differences between me and\n      Obama.\n      - Let me mention one of the key areas: capital gains. He wants to\n      raise taxes on them. When he tells you he\'s only going to tax\nthe rich, pay\n      attention, some people are surprised to find themselves in that category.\n      - The worst thing in these tough economic times is to raise taxes and\n      I won\'t do it.\n\n\n\n   - 6Q) I, too, am a cancer survivor. What would you do about stem cell\n   research? We need the help.\n      - MCCAIN: A few days ago, I attended LAnce Armstrong\'s Livestrong.\n      - I support stem cell research - very tough decision - because I\n      believe it can help America. There have been tremendous advances in skin\n      cell research, which I hope will make this debate academic.\n      - I\'m also excited about the huge development that was the mapping of\n      the human genome.\n      - I also am a "survivor" but it\'s been 8 years. If you\'ll listen to a\n      quick commercial from me: stay out of the sun, use sunscreen.\n\n\n   - FOLLOWUP: What are my nephew\'s chances of coming home from Afghanistan\n   alive?\n      - MCCAIN: His chances are good but he\'s going into harm\'s way to\n      protect our freedom. It\'s important that we use the same strategy that\n      succeeded in Iraq, something OBama fails to understand. He doesn\'t\n      understand this is jsut a political position you can change your position\n      on.\n      - Narcotraffic problem in Afghanistan, command strucutre problem that\n      i won\'t go into.\n      - Petraeus is about to take on a greater role. We will soon have a new\n      strategy in Afghanistan and we will succeed. Dont underestimate the\n      evil of the Taliban.\n\n\n\n   - MCCAIN: I was on the USS Arisocany (?) - I flew off that carrier. It\n   sunk.\n\n\n\n   - 7Q) What\'s it going to take to get Congress to release the ban on\n   drilling?\n      - MCCAIN: It\'s because we have a Congress that is not responsive to\n      the will of the American people. When Bush announced he was lifting\n      the ban, the price of oil went down. Yesterday I met with CA drillers\n      and they said they could get oil within a matter of months\nbecause they are\n      already right next to existing oil sources. So don\'t listen to these\n      estimates of 5 years out.\n\n\n\n   - 8Q) I am a family-owned business owner. We have been importing from\n   Belarus for 16 years, and now there are these sanctions. The DOS had no idea\n   about the # of companies that are affected by this. They produce products\n   for US Forest Service. How does your foreign policy with countries like\n   Belarus-- will you take into account how it affects\n      - MCCAIN: First, Obama opposes OCS drilling, nuclear power, gas tax\n      holiday and all the things we need to do to become energy independent.\n      - I have never been to Belarus - I tried to go once but Lukeshenko\n      prevented me. All I know is that he\'s a brutal dictator. We have\nto stand up\n      to dictators. Sometimes we have to be able to take a hit on our\neconomy to\n      stand up to this. I\'m sorry, I\'ll see if we can ameliorate the effects on\n      businesses. The most noble words ever written are that we are all created\n      equal, all. One of the things I\'m most proud of USA is that we stand\n      up to dictators adn fight for people all over the world, not militarily.\n\n\n\n   - 9Q) You\'re ahead in most recent Gallup poll. Does that change anything?\n      - MCCAIN: Frankly I\'m surprised. I\'m the underdog in this race. I\'ll\n      need everyone of you to get out of there and vote etc. I relish being\n      the underdog. I am taking public financing according to the law. Obama\n      is the first since we passed campaign finance reform not to take\nit. He said\n      he would if I would. He looked into the camera on the last\ndebate with HRC\n      and said he would call me up and work it out with me - I\'m still\nwaiting for\n      the phone to ring. Hello? So it\'s about who\'s going to keep your word.\n      - I\'m happy about where we are in the polls.\n      - I\'m waiting for him to come join me. Maybe we can learn things from\n      being together. I\'ve almost ahd to resort to the gimmick of\nhaving an empty\n      chair.\n\n\n\n   - 10Q) I\'m a conservatives and I think a lot of us are voting against\n   OBama more than for you.\n      - MCCAIN: What do you disagree on? A: Gang of 14, ANWR, falling in\n      with climate change crowd, campaign finance reform, etc.\n      - MCCAIN: I stand up against my party when I disagree with them.\n      - Gang of 14 preserved one of the fundamental operating principles of\n      Senate. I am proud to have supported Justice Roberts. Obama is too\n      ideological.\n      - Climate change is real and we have to address it. Suppose I am wrong\n      and we adapt all these green technologies and I\'m wrong, all\nwe\'ve done is\n      given our kids a cleaner planet. But what if I\'m right? And USA\nis so great\n      that we will be the best at producing green technologies. I\nbelieve it\'s the\n      future of our economy. I want to build 45 nuclear power plants, creating\n      700k new jobs.\n   - We have members of Congress residing in jail. I stood up against\n      corruption.\n      - I am proud to be a conservative. I try to follow the lead of Reagan.\n      Also, it\'s healthy for us to disagree.\n\n\n\n   - 11Q) What are you going to do with our trade policies in regards to\n   bringing our (manufacturing) jobs back to America?\n      - MCCAIN: I believe in free trade. I also think there are places we\n      have failed. I will open markets to our products. The great problem is we\n      have failed to support the displaced worker. In OH, MI, etc. there are\n      families who were hurting before the subprime lending\ncrisis.Americans are hurting and we haven\'t even talked about health\ncare and we\n      should. We need to go to community colleges and retrain and\neducate. And if\n      it\'s an older worker, I will supplement their income while they take a\n      lower-paying job and get retrained.\n      - Technology has been great to get people better jobs, but we\'ve left\n      people behind. And now on top of that, we\'ve had these hard\neconomic times. I\n      am a proud conservative, but one of the key functions of government is to\n      help the people who can\'t help themselves. I have plans for job\n      retraining, for energy independence, etc etc, and I will do that without\n      raising your taxes.\n      - Social Security is going bankrupt, Medicare, job creation,etc. - fix\n      it together, Dems and GOPs. I\'ve reached across the aisle with Lieberman,\n      Feingold, Kennedy. The message I get from these town halls is\nstop fighting\n      with each other, put your country first.\n\n*\n\n-- \nSara DuBois\nTracking / Communications Manager\nProgressiveAccountability.org\nsara@progressiveaccountability.org\n202-609-7681 (office)\n410-967-7306 (cell)\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
