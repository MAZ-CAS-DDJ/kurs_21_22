Here is why:\n\nEven more attacks on women and their access to affordable healthcare\nA Congress that refuses to raise the minimum wage while giving HUGE tax breaks to their special interest allies\nNonstop attempts to attack the president and even possible impeachment!\n\nWe can't stop this from happening on our own though. We need another $60,000 by Friday at 6 pm so that we can expose the truth about the Tea Party's real agenda.
