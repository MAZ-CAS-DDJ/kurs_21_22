He has represented his district in California for four decades and has been at the forefront of virtually all major health legislation enacted during this time.  A champion of low-income health coverage and a stalwart defender of the Medicaid program, one of the first national leaders to focus on and get resources to respond to the HIV/AIDS crisis, a leading voice on tobacco control, a force behind major food and drug legislation...the list goes on and on.  The O'Neill Institute Colloquium on National and Global Health Law is honored and pleased to host one of our great living Americans for his reflections on past successes and set-backs as we look ahead to the major health challenges facing the country and the world.  This session will feature a conversation with Georgetown Law Professor Tim Westmoreland, one of Mr. Waxman's longest serving congressional staff members, in a look back as a way to help understand and tackle emerging and ongoing issues for the Congress and the Nation.\n\nClick here to view the full press release.<http://georgetown.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=c0c8575a47&e=c51ad89a20>\n\nThe O'Neill Institute Colloquium is open to all students, faculty, staff, and interested members of the public.\n\nThe hashtag for this event is #oneillcolloquium.\n\nFor more information on O'Neill Institute events, please visit http://www.law.georgetown.edu/oneillinstitute/<http://georgetown.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=429ba60d9c&e=c51ad89a20>\n\n\n[Blog]<http://georgetown.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=ea3e259c15&e=c51ad89a20>  [Facebook] <http://georgetown.us5.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=c8bfa22178&e=c51ad89a20>   [Twitter] <http://georgetown.us5.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=c607fdfeb5&e=c51ad89a20>   [RSS] <http://georgetown.us5.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=218bd90978&e=c51ad89a20>\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 The O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.
