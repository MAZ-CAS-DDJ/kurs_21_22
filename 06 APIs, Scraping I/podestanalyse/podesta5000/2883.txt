Hillary Rodham Clinton* @HillaryClinton: The science is clear: The\nearth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork\n<https://twitter.com/hashtag/vaccineswork?src=hash>.

Clinton regularly used her grandmother status as a\nrhetorical tool while campaigning for Democrats in 2014.\n\n\n\nFederal health officials have expressed concern over a recent measles\noutbreak that has been fueled by skepticism among some parents of infant\nvaccination schedules. Measles is a disease that children a regularly\nvaccinated against.\n\n\n\nThe issue has become political, despite the fact that claims like vaccines\nleading to childhood autism have been debunked by scientific research.\n\n\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky questioned the safety of vaccines when he said\nhe had "heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who\nwound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines."\n\n\n\n"I\'m not arguing vaccines are a bad idea. I think they\'re a good thing. But\nI think the parents should have some input," he said during an interview on\nCNBC.\n\n\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, when asked about the issue, said that he\nchoose to vaccinate his children, but added, "Parents need to have some\nmeasure of choice in things as well, so that\'s the balance that the\ngovernment has to decide."\n\n\n\nFormer Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, who is also exploring a 2016 run,\ntold Buzzfeed that while she thinks vaccinating for the measles makes\nsense, the decisions should be up to the parents.\n\n\n\nBut renowned neurosurgeon Ben Carson, also a potential Republican\npresidential candidate, broke from the pack and defended mandatory\nvaccinations.\n\n\n\n"Certain communicable diseases have been largely eradicated by immunization\npolicies in this country and we should not allow those diseases to return\nby foregoing safe immunization programs, for philosophical, religious or\nother reasons when we have the means to eradicate them," he told Buzzfeed.\n\n\n\nBut Carson aside, these comments from Paul, Christie and Fiorina contradict\nwith what Clinton tweeted and President Barack Obama said in an interview\non Sunday.\n\n\n\n"I understand that there are families that, in some cases, are concerned\nabout the effect of vaccinations," Obama told NBC News before the Super\nBowl. "The science is, you know, pretty indisputable."\n\n\n\nBoth Obama and Clinton have altered their opinions on this issue, though,\nbecause during the 2008 presidential nomination fight, the two left the\ndoor open to vaccines causing autism and other issues.\n\n\n\nObama said the science was "inconclusive," while Clinton wrote in an\nanti-vaccine questionnaire that she was "committed to make investments to\nfind the causes of autism, including possible environmental causes like\nvaccine."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Hill: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary eyes Brooklyn for campaign HQ\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/231525-hillary-eyes-brooklyn-for-campaign-hq>*\n\n\n\nBy Amie Parnes\n\nFebruary 2, 2015, 7:25 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton is focused on housing her 2016 campaign headquarters in New\nYork City \xe2\x80\x94 potentially in Brooklyn, which has emerged as a leading\ncontender.\n\n\n\nInsiders say Clinton aides are looking at Brooklyn as a possible location,\nand that an office in White Plains, near the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99s Chappaqua, N.Y.,\nhome, has been all but ruled out.\n\n\n\nFor months, some in the Clinton universe thought that setting up the\ncampaign in or around White Plains, a middle-class enclave with dozens of\noffice parks, would be a good home for the former secretary of State\xe2\x80\x99s\nsecond presidential campaign.\n\nBut using Brooklyn for its headquarters could be a useful symbol for a\ncampaign that hopes to win over young people and has already been attacked\nby Republicans as \xe2\x80\x9cold news.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe borough is New York City\xe2\x80\x99s most populous, and has had a renaissance\nover the last decade as many of its neighborhoods have been transformed. It\nis also one of the most ethnically diverse areas of the United States \xe2\x80\x94\nanother aspect Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team will want to highlight as it seeks to attract\nminority voters.\n\n\n\nIt would provide a stark contrast from the locale where Clinton based her\n2008 presidential campaign: the Washington, D.C., suburb of Ballston, Va.\nBack then, Team Clinton was housed in a stodgy former Immigration and\nNaturalization Service building.\n\n\n\nThe former first lady has a personal office in midtown Manhattan, separate\nfrom the office space in midtown she has at the Clinton Foundation, where\nshe has worked since leaving the State Department in 2013. Her husband,\nformer President Bill Clinton, also has a personal office in Harlem.\n\n\n\nClinton is currently huddling with a small team of aides to craft plans for\nthe 2016 campaign, including a potential start date for her bid.\n\n\n\nThe would-be presidential campaign contender hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet reached a consensus\non when exactly she\xe2\x80\x99ll enter the race, but some insiders say it\xe2\x80\x99s looking\nmore and more likely that she\xe2\x80\x99ll do a pre-launch in April to \xe2\x80\x9cget things\ngoing,\xe2\x80\x9d as one put it.\n\n\n\nAides are still examining a formal start date in July, but a pre-launch\ncould be spent fundraising and building out the campaign staff, some\nClinton allies say.\n\n\n\nThe allies say a soft rollout makes sense for Clinton because it would be\ndifficult for her to remain on the sidelines for the next five months.\nTaking an initial and informal step, which wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be accompanied\nby the traditional bells and whistles, would bring a sense of closure to\nthe will-she-or-won\xe2\x80\x99t-she phase while giving her some breathing room to\nprepare for the next steps on both the policy and politics fronts.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the preference would be to wait longer so that she\xe2\x80\x99s not firing on\nall cylinders until July,\xe2\x80\x9d one ally said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that time would be used\nto continue making a lot of decisions with less time on the road. That\npiece of it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really come until 3rd quarter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nReady for Hillary, the super-PAC created to lure Clinton into the race two\nyears ago, will begin to shut down as soon as Clinton forms any kind of\nexploratory committee or pre-launch. Donors to the political action\ncommittee have been told in private conversations that the outside\norganization would not compete with Clinton for money and would start to\nwrap up work as soon as she indicated she would be entering the race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Associated Press: \xe2\x80\x9cEMILY\'s List to honor Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://m.apnews.com/ap/db_268798/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=SUjRlg8K>*\n\n\n\nBy Ken Thomas\n\nFebruary 3, 2015\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton will be honored next month by EMILY\'s List, a\nDemocratic fundraising powerhouse, as she considers a potential 2016\npresidential campaign that could make her the first woman to win the White\nHouse.\n\n\n\nEMILY\'s List, which works to elect Democratic women who support abortion\nrights, said Tuesday that Clinton would appear at its 30th anniversary\nawards gala in Washington on March 3. The former secretary of state will\nreceive the group\'s We Are EMILY Award to honor her leadership "as a\nfighter for women and families," said Stephanie Schriock, the group\'s\npresident.\n\n\n\nSchriock said Clinton has "dedicated her life to bettering the lives of\nwomen and families and has inspired the next generation with a focus on\nincreasing economic empowerment across the country and around the world."\n\n\n\nThe political action committee has been among the Democratic groups laying\nthe groundwork for a Clinton campaign, holding events promoting the idea of\nelecting the nation\'s first female president and commissioning polling on\nU.S. interest in sending a woman to the White House. Schriock, who has been\nmentioned as a potential senior campaign aide for Clinton, noted that the\ngroup has backed Clinton since her 2000 Senate election in New York.\n\n\n\nClinton is the leading Democratic contender for the White House and is\nwidely expected to announce another presidential campaign in the coming\nmonths.\n\n\n\nThe group will also honor former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., for her\n"commitment to community" and dedication to women and families. Giffords\nwas gravely wounded in a 2011 shooting during a political event she held at\na Tucson, Arizona, shopping center. Six people were killed and 13 were\ninjured, including Giffords.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*New York Times: First Draft: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton to Be Inducted Into\nIrish-American Hall of Fame\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/02/02/hillary-clinton-to-be-inducted-into-irish-american-hall-of-fame/>*\n\n\n\nBy Amy Chozick\n\nFebruary 2, 2015, 5:11 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton will be inducted into Irish America magazine\xe2\x80\x99s hall\nof fame next month, giving her an early opportunity to try to charm a\ncritical voting bloc.\n\n\n\nOn March 16, Mrs. Clinton will deliver a keynote address to a network of\nhigh-profile Irish-Americans who each year honor elected officials and\nothers and give them a chance to address the St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day-themed\nluncheon.\n\n\n\nPrevious inductees include former President Bill Clinton, Vice President\nJoseph R.

It is about issues, they have higher turnout, and I think a\nbetter system than our system where we had to raise $1.1 billion to run an\nelection campaign, though it was really fun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*CNN: \xe2\x80\x9cPoll: Clinton sweeps GOP foes save Bush tie in Florida\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/03/politics/hillary-clinton-republicans-swing-states-quinnipiac-poll/>*\n\n\n\nBy Jeremy Diamond\n\nFebruary 3, 2015\n\n\n\nWashington (CNN)Hillary Clinton is leading top Republican contenders in\nthree crucial swing states by hefty margins, but she has two scenarios\nwhere she could be evenly matched, according to a new poll.\n\n\n\nClinton has double digit leads over each of her would-be GOP foes for the\npresidency in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, with the exception of ties in\nFlorida when matched up against the state\'s former Gov. Jeb Bush and in\nOhio against current Gov. John Kasich, according to a Quinnipiac University\npoll released Tuesday. No candidate has won the presidency since 1960\nwithout winning two of those three crucial states.\n\n\n\nOther native sons didn\'t fare as well against the former secretary of\nstate, with Clinton still topping Florida\'s Sen. Marco Rubio 49% to 39% and\nalso leading Pennsylvania\'s former Sen. Rick Santorum by 10 points in his\nstate.\n\n\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie flopped to Clinton by double digits in each\nof the three states, according to the poll, including in neighboring\nPennsylvania where he caps at 39% to Clinton\'s 50%, according to the\nQuinnipiac survey of 881 voters in that state.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s lead in the polls also match her favorability ratings, which\ntopped 50 percent according to Quinnipiac polling in all three states.\n\n\n\nAnd the former first lady also owes some of her success to her appeal to\nwomen voters who gave Clinton an edge in every theoretical match-up. Even\nin Florida where she ties Bush, Clinton still wins over the female vote by\nan 11-point margin.\n\n\n\nWith 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney opting out of the\npresidential race after spending three weeks leaning toward a third run,\nthe GOP establishment has been looking toward Bush as the party\'s\nstandard-bearer.\n\n\n\nBut the son and brother to two former presidents will have to overcome\nstruggles with voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania, where he trailed Clinton by\n11 and 15 points, respectively, according to the Quinnipiac survey of more\nthan 900 voters in each state.\n\n\n\nChristie, who is also ramping up his political operation and trying to\nseize on the vacuum of donors freed up by Romney, faces 11- to 18-point\ndeficits against Clinton in the three swing states.\n\n\n\nOther candidates offered up as the Republican alternative to a Clinton\npresidency include former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a social\nconservative who loses to Clinton by at 15 to 20 points in the three\nstates. Huckabee also sought the Republican nomination in 2008.\n\n\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who represents the libertarian wing of his\nparty, also faces at least a 12-point deficit against Clinton in the swing\nstates.\n\n\n\nThe poll is still a very early indicator of the race and Clinton, a former\nfirst lady and secretary of state, continues to enjoy a higher profile than\nthe potential Republican candidates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Real Clear Politics: \xe2\x80\x9cChris Matthews: Hillary \xe2\x80\x98Could Really Rule This\nCountry,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98This Country Needs Somebody To Get Control of It\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/02/02/chris_matthews_hillary_could_really_rule_this_country_this_country_needs_somebody_to_get_control_of_it.html>*\n\n\n\n[No Writer Mentioned]\n\nFebruary 2, 2015\n\n\n\nChris Matthews praised a potential Hillary Clinton presidency where "she\ncould really rule this country" as a result of a decisive electoral victory.\n\n\n\n"This country needs somebody to get control of it," Matthews said about a\nClinton presidency on the Monday broadcast of his MSNBC show.\n\n\n\n"I think she should go for a 55% victory, 54% victory because then she\ncould bring the House in, she could bring the Senate in and she could\nreally rule this country.

Trey Gowdy\xe2\x80\x99s decision to seek a review of the materials, first\nhighlighted in a series of Washington Times stories last week, carries\nconsequences for the 2016 election in which Mrs. Clinton is expected to\nseek the presidency. It could also move the committee to examine the\nstrained relationship between the State Department and Pentagon, which\nsharply disagreed over the 2011 war in Libya and the response to the\nterrorist attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi a year later.\n\n\n\nThe Times reported last week that U.S. intelligence did not support Mrs.\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s story of an impending genocide in Libya that she used to sell the\nwar against Moammar Gadhafi\xe2\x80\x99s regime. The newspaper also unveiled secretly\nrecorded tapes from Libya that showed that the Pentagon and Democratic\nCongressman Dennis Kucinich so distrusted her stewardship of the war that\nthey opened their own diplomatic channels with the Gadhafi regime.\n\n\n\nThe tapes included candid conversations and allegations that Mrs. Clinton\ntook the U.S. to war on false pretenses and was not listening to the advice\nof military commanders or career intelligence officers.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cChairman Gowdy and the committee are aware of the details reported by The\nWashington Times, and we are reviewing them as part of the committee\xe2\x80\x99s\ninquiry into Benghazi,\xe2\x80\x9d Benghazi Committee spokesman Jamal Ware announced\nMonday.\n\n\n\nThe emergence of the tapes and a new line of inquiry immediately had\nrepercussions, especially on the political front where the 2016 president\nrace has heated up.\n\n\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a 2016 GOP hopeful who has been intensely\ncritical of Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s handling of the 2011 Libya intervention, said\nthe stories demonstrate she is not the right person to lead the country or\nthe nation\xe2\x80\x99s military.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillary\xe2\x80\x99s judgment has to be questioned \xe2\x80\x93 her eagerness for war in Libya\nshould preclude her from being considered the next Commander in Chief,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Sen. Paul, who opposed the Libyan intervention at the onset.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want someone in that office with wisdom and better judgment\xe2\x80\xa6 We created\nchaos in Libya \xe2\x80\x93 as a result many arms have gone to Syria which are now\naiding jihadi terrorists. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fathom how Hillary Clinton could\nbecome Commander and Chief after this,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman have declined any comment about the tapes.\n\n\n\nThe Times reported that on one of the tapes, a Pentagon liaison told a\nGadhafi aide that Army Gen. Charles Jacoby, a top aide to Adm. Mullen,\n\xe2\x80\x9cdoes not trust the reports that are coming out of the State Department and\nCIA, but there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing he can do about it,\xe2\x80\x9d the Pentagon liaison said,\noffering a candid assessment of tensions within the Obama administration.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you that the President is not getting accurate information so\nat some point someone has to get accurate information to him\xe2\x80\xa6 I think about\na way through former Secretary Gates or maybe to Admiral Mullen to get him\ninformation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, chairman of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Crime,\nTerrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, said the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s\nactions were \xe2\x80\x9chighly unusual,\xe2\x80\x9d but said that it would make sense for the\nPentagon to want to make sure their Commander in Chief was getting accurate\ninformation.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s unusual to have the military say wait a minute, that\xe2\x80\x99s not\ntrue,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Poe said in a telephone interview with the Times. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a\nfalse report from the Secretary of State, and then the military holding a\ncompletely different view of what\xe2\x80\x99s taking place.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey wanted [the president] to have facts \xe2\x80\x93 facts as opposed to what\nSecretary Clinton was hoping the facts would be; that Moammar Gadhafi was\nkilling innocent women and children. That was was a false narrative. So, it\nwould make sense that they would want to get that information straight to\nthe president and not go through the Secretary of State,\xe2\x80\x9d he added\n\n\n\nIn reaction to the Times final installment of the series on Monday, which\nrevealed secret Libyan intelligence reports that linked NATO supported\nrebels to al-Qaeda, Rep. Louie Gohmert said the news was not a complete\nsurprise.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring the Obama-Clinton hunger to enter a bombing war in Libya, some of\nus knew the rebels included al-Qaeda but we did not know the full extent of\ntheir involvement,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo we pleaded for U.S. restraint. With\nbombing in their heart and radical Islamists whispering in their ears, the\nObama-Clinton team would not even entertain offers of a ceasefire and\npeaceful transition of power. While acting under U.N. approval to prevent\natrocities, it appears the Obama-Clinton bombing barrages caused atrocities\nthat sent a country into chaos which is continuing today.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Times series about the Libyan intervention was also picked up across\nthe Atlantic.\n\n\n\nBritain\xe2\x80\x99s Daily Mail described the story as \xe2\x80\x9cstunning\xe2\x80\x9d declaring that,\n\xe2\x80\x9c[Sec.] Clinton will face tough questions about her march to war against\nMoammar Gadhafi if she runs for president.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Poe said that he believes the series will prompt new questions,\nespecially with the current state of military and political affairs in\nLibya.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned Benghazi is not going away,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Poe said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\nthe U.S. would give in and arm rebels and criminals to overthrow Col.\nGadhafi, and then mislead the world on that is shameful. We now have chaos\nin Libya\xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99 undoing of a country. Gadhafi was no saint, but\nwhat we have now are gangsters and jihadists running the country. We have\nchaos because the US intervened in a deceitful way.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, the administration is making more of an effort to protect\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s involvement than they are in finding out the truth about\nwhat was really behind the overthrow of Gaddafi by the U.S.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Des Moines Register: \xe2\x80\x9cO\'Malley looks to seize on Clinton\'s absence from\nIowa\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/02/02/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-iowa-democrat-caucus-president-iowa-poll/22753007/>*\n\n\n\nBy Jennifer Jacobs\n\nFebruary 2, 2015, 9:47 p.m. CST\n\n\n\nAs some Iowa Democratic activists voice frustration with what one called\nthe "arrogance" of Hillary Clinton, liberal rival Martin O\'Malley intends\nto seize on her absence from Iowa and the presidential race.\n\n\n\nThere\'s just a tiny seed of support here for the two-term former governor\nof Maryland, who left office in January. He ranks dead last in a Democratic\nfield of six potential contenders, a new Iowa Poll shows.\n\n\n\nBut O\'Malley, who has pitched himself as a results-driven progressive,\nwants to see if he can build on support for a White House bid during two\ntrips here, one in March and one in April, aides told The Des Moines\nRegister Monday.\n\n\n\nIowans said this is a prime time for an alternative contender to make\nheadway. Vexation with Clinton has bubbled to the surface in the wake of\nnews reports that she may delay the timetable for her presumed campaign.\n\n\n\n"I honestly don\'t know who I\'ll caucus for in 2016, but I do know that if\nshe wants my support she\'ll need to be here organizing like any other\ncandidate," Heather Matson, who was a member of the Iowa Democrats\' state\ncentral committee until last month, wrote on Facebook last week. "All this\nsays to me is that her advisers think it\'s a good idea to keep the mystery\ngoing to avoid competition. Get in the game or don\'t. But don\'t leave Iowa\nDemocrats without options and undermine the value of the caucuses."\n\n\n\nIt\'s a "terrible idea" for Clinton to put off a campaign until summertime\njust because she foresees no major challenge for the nomination, agreed\nformer state Rep. Phil Wise.\n\n\n\n"(It) would indicate a total lack of understanding of recent political\nhistory," Wise wrote on Facebook.\n\n\n\n"Arrogance will cost her," Des Moines activist Nancy Bobo, founder of Women\nfor a Stronger America and a strong early supporter of President Barack\nObama, wrote in response to Wise and Matson.\n\n\n\nFor his upcoming Iowa trip, O\'Malley will speak March 20 at the Scott\nCounty Democratic Party\'s "Red, White and Blue Dinner," according to Lis\nSmith, spokeswoman for O\'Malley\'s political action committee, O\'Say Can You\nSee.\n\n\n\nHe will also be in Des Moines on April 10 for the Polk County Democrats\'\nfourth annual Spring Awards Dinner, Smith told the Register. He has booked\ntrips to two other early states as well, South Carolina at the end of\nFebruary and New Hampshire in March.\n\n\n\nFor O\'Malley, who in his spare time is also the lead singer/guitarist in a\nBaltimore-based Irish folk-rock band, there\'s nowhere to go but up in Iowa.\nJust 1 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers in the new Des Moines\nRegister/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll rank him as their first choice for\nthe nomination.\n\n\n\nThe poll shows Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state who made two trips\nto Iowa last year, would dominate the field in Iowa if she runs. While\nClinton enjoys nearly universal recognition, 78 percent of likely\nDemocratic caucusgoers don\'t know enough about O\'Malley to form an opinion.\n\n\n\nTwo other bottom-tier contenders on the Democratic side \xe2\x80\x94 U.S. Sen. Bernie\nSanders of Vermont, a liberal independent, and former U.S. Sen. Jim Webb of\nVirginia \xe2\x80\x94 both have limited appeal, O\'Malley\'s supporters contend.\n\n\n\nO\'Malley has a lot of growth potential and can spend a lot of time here,\nhis backers say. O\'Malley wrote an opinion piece for Monday\'s New York\nTimes that goes after the Obama administration for off-shore drilling on\nthe Altantic Coast.\n\n\n\nLast year, O\'Malley flew to Iowa for a couple of high-profile events:\nspeeches to several hundred Democrats at the Iowa Hall of Fame Dinner and\nthe Iowa Democratic Party Convention in June. Although O\'Malley remains\nrelatively unknown to rank-and-file Democratic caucusgoers, he cached a\nreservoir of goodwill with Iowa\'s most hardcore activists by doing\ntwo-dozen events here last year, campaigning and fundraising for state and\nfederal candidates during the midterm elections.\n\n\n\nAltogether, O\'Malley\'s PAC gave $46,000 to Iowa candidates and two party\norganizations, the Pottawattamie County Democrats and the Iowa Democratic\nParty, PAC records show. O\'Malley deployed one of his PAC staffers, Brad\nElkins, to Iowa in September to serve as Jack Hatch\'s political director in\nthe governor\'s race, and in mid-December retained Jake Oeth, who was U.S.\nSenate candidate Bruce Braley\'s political director, as his Iowa consultant.\n\n\n\nTop Iowa activists said Democrats are hungry for visits, especially as GOP\npotential candidates blanket the state and draw national headlines at\nevents like U.S. Rep. Steve King\'s Iowa Freedom Summit.\n\n\n\n"Hillary is NOT a shoo-in when it comes to Iowa caucuses," Kim Weaver,\nchairwoman of the O\'Brien County Democrats and a member of the Iowa\nDemocrats\' state central committee, wrote on Facebook. "If she thinks so,\nit will be a mistake she lives to regret \xe2\x80\x94 just my opinion anyway."\n\n\n\nWeaver was writing in response to a piece Wednesday on Slate.com on "why\nHillary Clinton needs to fight hard for Iowa" and a report Thursday in\nPolitico that Clinton is "strongly considering delaying the formal launch\nof her presidential campaign until July."\n\n\n\nThe draft-Clinton super PAC Ready for Hillary is doing a 99-county tour in\nIowa, but that\'s not enough, the activists said.\n\n\n\n"Ready for Hillary can be doing all the events they want, but until the\ncandidate herself is in the state shaking hands at small events and having\nthose personal conversations with Iowans, it doesn\'t translate to solid\nsupport," Matson wrote.\n\n\n\nClinton, whose last Iowa visit was before the fall elections, is currently\nthe first choice for 56 percent of likely caucusgoers, the poll shows.\nMassachusetts U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren gets 16 percent support. Vice\nPresident Joe Biden is at 9 percent. Sanders is at 5 percent, and Webb is\nat 3 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sec.
