Hulu claims that the No on 67 ad is too 'controversial' to\n   air on their site because it addresses 'the subject matter of abortion.'\n\n   While Hulu regularly runs commercials for political issues and political\n   candidates, the censorship of this ad is inexplicable and disheartening.\n   Millions of Colorado women and families would be negatively affected by\n   Amendment 67. Highlighting the criminalization of those who provide or\n   receive safe abortion services, contraception, and in vitro services is\n   not 'controversial'--it is necessary.\n\n   [3]Sign the petition to demand Hulu allow the ad to run.\n\n   We have started a Twitter campaign #HuluLetHerSpeak to reverse Hulu's\n   decision and ask you to [4]sign the petition, which will be delivered to\n   Mike Hopkins, CEO at Hulu.\n\n   Thanks for doing your part to stand up for Colorado women and families,\n\n   The Team at ProgressNow Colorado Education\n\nReferences\n\n   Visible links\n   1. http://act.progressnowcolorado.org/sign/hululetherspeak/?t=1001&akid=1529.326349.GkyBA-\n   2. http://act.progressnowcolorado.org/sign/hululetherspeak/?t=1002&akid=1529.326349.GkyBA-\n   3. http://act.progressnowcolorado.org/sign/hululetherspeak/?t=1003&akid=1529.326349.GkyBA-\n   4. http://act.progressnowcolorado.org/sign/hululetherspeak/?t=1004&akid=1529.326349.GkyBA-\n \n\nYou can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time:\nhttp://act.progressnowcolorado.org/cms/unsubscribe/unsubscribe/?akid=1529.326349.GkyBA-\n\n\nReferences\n\n   Visible links\n   1. http://progressnowcolorado.org/education?akid=1529.326349.GkyBA-\n\n"
