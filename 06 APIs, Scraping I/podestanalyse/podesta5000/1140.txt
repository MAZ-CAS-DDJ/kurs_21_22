He thought yesterday was great and was pleased.  He is, however, worried (and he will always be worried) \x96 that we\x92re not breaking through to the Bernie voters as much as needed. He feels that we have to keep \x93selling\x94 HRC personally in addition to the \x93stakes are high\x94.\n\nRobby, he\x92s also asking about a question he said he asked you to be polled \x96 and I really can\x92t quite figure out what he\x92s asking.  Do you have a clearer understanding?\n\n\n\n"
