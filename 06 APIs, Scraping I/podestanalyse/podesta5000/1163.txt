Please review and comment.\n\n \n\nAs for the session itself, we will do some Q-and-A drills before we start\nthe mock.   So we won't get through this entire mock, but we will use pieces\nof it.  I will send around a proposed agenda later today.\n\n \n\nAnd of course, Karen will be having a baby on Tuesday early morning, so,\nshe'll probably be an hour or two late for our 9am start.\n\n \n\nRon\n\n \n\n \n\n"
