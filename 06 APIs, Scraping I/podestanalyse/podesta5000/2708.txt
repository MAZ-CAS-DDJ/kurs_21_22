Was he not paying attention to his own press\nclips?  And now he wants to address it? I know he obviously wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the\ngovernor... but still.\n\n\n\n*From:* Zachary Petkanas [mailto:zpetkanas@hillaryclinton.com]\n*Sent:* Wednesday, February 24, 2016 10:52 AM\n*To:* Christina Reynolds <creynolds@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Cc:* Maya Harris <mharris@hillaryclinton.com>; John Podesta <\njohn.podesta@gmail.com>; Zerlina Maxwell <zmaxwell@hillaryclinton.com>;\nTeddy Goff <tgoff@hillaryclinton.com>; Milia Fisher <\nmfisher@hillaryclinton.com>; Tony Carrk <tcarrk@hillaryclinton.com>;\nAdrienne Watson <Awatson@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Subject:* Re: Vermont has 4th highest Afro-am incarceration in USA\n\n\n\n+ Watson\n\n\n\nWatson and I were talking about this yesterday.
