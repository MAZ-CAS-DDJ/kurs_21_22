john.podesta@gmail.comb'John/Gene -\n\nAmy is profiling WJC and the foundation for the Times, she was in Africa with us and is just now sitting down to write.\n\nShe asked me for "two people who have worked for him in the past who also know about the foundation."\n\nCongrats, you\'re both winners.\n\nFor now, her story is trending in the direction of "Clinton Foundation as a Family Business," Chelsea was on the trip with us, she\'s obviously very curious about HRC\'s post-State plans, etc.\n\nOn the HRC front, WJC made no news in his interview with Amy and said all the same things he\'s been saying (he\'ll support her in whatever she decides, she wants to rest, write a book, work on women & girls, etc.).\n\nAre both of you two ok chatting with her about the foundation and, if so, is there anything I can get either of you?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nmm\n\n\n'
