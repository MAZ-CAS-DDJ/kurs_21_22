After serving only\ntwo and a half years in office, he has quickly established a\nreputation as one of the most inappropriately partisan, corrupt, and\nscandal-plagued public officials in the history of of the state of\nColorado. \xa0The "Honey Badger" takes what he\nwants--now he wants to be Governor!\xa0\n\nAnd it gets worse: Gessler\'s chief opponent for the Republican\nnomination for Governor in 2014 as of now is Tom Tancredo, the\ngreatest national embarrassment Colorado has produced in a generation.\nTancredo\'s hateful anti-immigrant crusades have made him a\npariah even among most national Republicans--but in Colorado, Tancredo\nenjoys enough support that he could actually win the nomination.\n\nClick here to donate to ProgressNow Colorado. Your gift will be\nimmediately put to use to expose Gessler\'s and Tancredo\'s\nindefensible records.\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=dh6AJzYS8D8n_QDuJw3c5A\n\n\xa0\n\nAs the state\'s chief elections officer, Gessler has consistently\nsought to undermine the rights of legal Colorado citizens to vote. At\nthe same time, Gessler has slashed fines for fellow Republicans who\nbreak campaign finance law and used his office\'s discretionary\nfunds as a partisan piggy bank--money he attempted to quietly repay\nlast week before news of his gubernatorial run surfaced.\n\nAlien vs. Predator\nMeanwhile, despite all the progress being made to reform our\nnation\'s broken immigration system today, Tancredo wants to turn\nColorado into a hateful throwback. At a time when some conservatives\nrecognize that it\'s time to resolve this longstanding problem in\na fair and humane way, Tancredo stands as a symbol of xenophobia and\nbigotry instead of what\'s right for America.\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=ri_8Nluz8OsneHFZm5Q8fA\n\nAt ProgressNow Colorado, our job is to vigorously hold the right wing\naccountable every day, in election years and off years alike.
