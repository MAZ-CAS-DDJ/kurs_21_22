john.podesta@gmail.comb'League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund\n\n\nDear John,\n\nThere are only 43 days until the election, and only 12 hours until our LCV Victory Fund fundraising deadline. This is your last chance to help us meet our $75,000 goal to stop Big Oil and Dirty Coal from stacking Congress with their cronies and crippling the EPA\'s ability to reduce global warming pollution from the nation\'s biggest polluters.\n\nOur planet\'s future is at stake - please, make your donation before it\'s too late.\n\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=Msbi9LIluW6R2G6NcIq4UQ..\n\nAs election season starts to sizzle, Big Oil\'s allies are doing everything possible to take the focus off the environment. Corporate special interests are spreading lies and distortions, and sinking millions into sleazy ads to try and defeat environmental leaders like California Senator Barbara Boxer, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet, and Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold.\n\nLCV Victory Fund\'s job is to make sure the public knows that these lawmakers support a pro-environment agenda and have been outstanding\nleaders on environmental issues.\n\nWe\'re flooding swing states and districts with canvassers, running hard-hitting TV, internet and radio ads to make sure voters know where candidates stand, and we\'re keeping clean energy issues front-and-center - through November 2nd and beyond. \n\nBecause there\'s one thing LCV Victory Fund and Big Oil agree on: If voters\nknow the truth, Big Oil\'s cronies and Dirty Dozen members like Roy "Big Oil"\nBlunt in Missouri, failed Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina in California and\nRep. Michele Bachmann in Minnesota won\'t win on Election Day.\n\nWe\'re spreading the truth. But we need a solid count on our resources by midnight tonight - and if we don\'t reach our $75,000 goal, we might have to scale back our activities just when we need to be ramping them up.\n\nThe LCV Victory Fund needs your immediate support - please don\'t wait any longer. \n\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=9pbD0jQSUlISeHCZWQsjYw..\n\nI agree with Robert Redford - Big Oil and Dirty Coal have polluted the halls of Congress long enough.\xa0\xa0 It\'s time to end their lies, replace the Dirty Dozen with pro-environment lawmakers, and get on with the clean energy future our planet so urgently needs.\n\nThank you for your support at this critical moment.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGene Karpinski\nPresident, LCV Victory Fund\n\nPaid for by LCV Victory Fund, www.lcv.org, and not authorized by any\ncandidate or candidate\'s committee.\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nTo review our Privacy Policy,  click here .\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=edMvvfW4PrJfOcIFlq5xlQ..\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=rvLOIoHw4_7lL7z5fWokkLH_TLL_dV6B&cid=0\n\n'
