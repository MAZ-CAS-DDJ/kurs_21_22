I am honored and flattered that you thought of me for the position. \n\nAfter further reflection and conversation with Scott, I wanted to let you know that I don't think it's the right for for me at this time. \n\nBut thanks again for thinking of me. And I will continue to do what I can to help on the outside. \n\nHope you enjoy the holidays with your family. \n\nBest,\nMichele \n\nSent from my iPhone \nso please forgive typos!\n(202) 285-5493"
