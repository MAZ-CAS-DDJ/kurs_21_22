john.podesta@gmail.comb'<!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="content" -->Friend,\n\nMitt Romney\'s 47 percent comment was out of touch. This is\nworse.\n\nLast night, the Washington Post published excerpts of Ken\nCuccinelli\'s upcoming book that show exactly what he\nthinks about senior citizens and the middle class: they\'re\ngovernment dependents who are looking for "goodies."\n\nThese are Ken Cuccinelli\'s true colors -- and, unlike\nRomney, he\'s not even trying to hide them.\n\nReject this ideological extremism by ensuring Cuccinelli is \nnever elected governor. Help us hit 1,000 donors before\ntonight\'s midnight deadline -- we\'re just 286 donors away.\n\nWill you make a $5 donation and send a message to Ken\nCuccinelli that his views have no place in Virginia?\n\nhttps://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/8102/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=7888\n\nVirtually every word the Washington Post published from\nCuccinelli\'s book makes my blood boil -- but this one about\nelected officials is the worst:\n\n"One of their favorite ways to increase their power is by\ncreating programs that dispense subsidized government\nbenefits, such as Medicare, Social Security, and outright\nwelfare (Medicaid, food stamps, subsidized housing, and the\nlike). These programs make people dependent on government.\nAnd once people are dependent, they feel they can\'t afford\nto have the programs taken away."\n\nIf you believe that this divisive extremism has no place in\npolitics, Terry needs your help today.\n\nMake a $5 donation before midnight tonight and make sure we\ndon\'t fall short of our grassroots donor goal:\n\nhttps://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/8102/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=7888\n\nThis is what we\'re up against -- and I hope you are fighting\nalongside Terry to reject Ken Cuccinelli\'s vision for\nVirginia.\n\nThanks,\n\nRobby Mook \nCampaign Manager \nTerry McAuliffe for Governor\n\nDONATE NOW: https://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/8102/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=7888\n\n_______________\n\nThis message was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.
