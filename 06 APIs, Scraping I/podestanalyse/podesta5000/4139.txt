We've been working with Giulia Marchiori Ceresal, our\nEuropean deputy finance director. Sorry for not flagging for you sooner,\nbut the event came together at the very last minute-- Giulia wasn't sure\nshe could find an appropriate location that would be convenient to your\nClimate Works dinner.\n\nHer proposed venue would be about a 30 minute taxi ride from your Climate\nWorks dinner-- HFA will pay for transport. It is a conference room at an\nAmerican law firm Wilk Auslander LLP (Rue P\xc3\xa9colat 5, 1201 Gen\xc3\xa8ve,\nSwitzerland). The group would be small (8-10 expats) and the format will be\na mix and mingle with informal remarks. Apparently although it is a law\nfirm conference room, it is a very informal setup (with a fireplace and\nsofas, etc.). Giulia will send us exact details in her briefing tomorrow.\n\nWe did not raise for this. This is just a meet-and-greet with current\ndonors and prospects to identify leadership when we plan to return for\nsignificant fundraising in the next quarter.\n\nI know that you left the office without your stump speech cards, so I have\nreattached that text for you. Giulia can print these and bring to you (I\nwill ask if she can do vertical speech cards).\n\nGiulia will be Geneva for the day and to run logistics. She is working on a\nfull brief and will send first thing tomorrow morning-- including Q&A for\nDems Abroad. Below is the proposed tick-tock, with drive times & flight\ninfo.\n\nDoes this plan sound OK to you?\n\n*________*\n\n*7:40 AM Arrive in Geneva*\n               United Flight 974\n               Confirmation #D2GFC0\n\n*8:00 AM Crowne Plaza Hotel Shuttle-- *5 minute ride\n*8:10 AM **(note that Climate Works is also happy to cover a taxi if the\nairport                            shuttle isn't convenient in the moment)*\n\n*8:10 AM Unscheduled time*\n*4:30 PM *Crowne Plaza Hotel\n               Louis-Casai Avenue 75, 1216 Cointrin, Switzerland\n\n*4:30 PM  **DRIVE--* 15-20 minute taxi ride* (paid for by HFA)*\n*4:45 PM *\n\n*5:00 PM **HFA Meeting*\n*6:20 PM *Wilk Auslander LLP,  Rue P\xc3\xa9colat 5, 1201 Gen\xc3\xa8ve, Switzerland\n\n6:20 PM  *DRIVE-- *20-30 minute taxi ride *(paid for by HFA) *\n*6:50 PM*\n\n*7:00 PM Climate Works Board Dinner Cocktails*\n*7:30 PM* Creux-de-Genthod, Bistrot Room, 29, Route du Creux-de-Genthod, 1294\n                 Genthod\n\n*7:30 PM* *Climate Works Board Dinner*\n               Creux-de-Genthod, Bistrot Room, 29, Route du\nCreux-de-Genthod, 1294\n               Genthod\n\n*9:30/10 PM Climate Works drives board members back to Crowne Plaza Hotel*\n\n-- \nMilia Fisher\nSpecial Assistant to the Chair\nHillary for America\nmfisher@hillaryclinton.com\no: 646.854.1198 c: 858.395.1741\n\n<JDP stump bullets.docx>\n"
