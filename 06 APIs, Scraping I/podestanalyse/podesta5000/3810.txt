I passed on your note, and here\xe2\x80\x99s her email address when you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to reach out: Andrea_E_Purse@who.eop.gov<mailto:Andrea_E_Purse@who.eop.gov>\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\nEryn\r\n\r\nEryn M. Sepp\r\nSpecial Assistant to the Counselor to the President\r\n202-456-1404\r\nEryn_M_Sepp@who.eop.gov\r\n\r\nFrom: Matt Wanning [mailto:tmwred@gmail.com]\r\nSent: Wednesday, November 05, 2014 2:21 PM\r\nTo: john.podesta@gmail.com; Sepp, Eryn; Podesta, John\r\nSubject: John, Hope you are well. Matt Wanning from John Catsimatidis office, NYC\r\n\r\nJohn has been awhile.. President Clinton's administration to be exact.  If you recall I work for John Catsimatidis, wealthy New York businessman and close to Fr. Alex.\r\n\r\nJust to refresh, Catsimatidis is a billionaire here in the City whose wealth is derived from real estate, refineries, supermarkets and airlines, and these days he also has a radio program which airs on Sunday mornings.  Details below.\r\n\r\nI am not quite sure how or if you can help with this, but John told me to contact you.  As you can see from the attached list I have call-in guests from every walk of life and elected office, but I have not been able to get anyone from the administration, largely because I don't know anyone from the administration.\r\n\r\nI have calls into almost every cabinet office and agency but so far no luck and I would seriously like to balance this program with a few representatives of President Obama.\r\n\r\nWe tape during the week at the convenience of the guests.  The program airs on Sunday mornings.  To everyone's surprise the program is growing in popularity.\r\n\r\nSo I will leave it at this.  If there is anyway you can help, or extend some credibility to his call, it would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n9-10am EST Sundays\r\nJohn Catsimatidis radio\r\n970AM Radio dial New York\r\nStream: >http://am970theanswer.com<<%3ehttp:/am970theanswer.com/%3c>\r\nLinks: Cats\xe2\x80\x99Rountable past programs<%3ehttps:/soundcloud.com/catsroundtable%3c>\r\nCall in #: 877-970-2999\r\n\r\n\r\nDr.  Anthony Fauci, Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\r\nVice President Richard Cheney\r\nGovernor Rick Perry  R-TX\r\nGovernor Bill Richardson\r\nRabbi Shmuley Israel\r\nU.S. Senator Charles Schumer\r\nGovernor David Paterson\r\nGovernor George Pataki\r\nDonald Trump\r\nGovernor Mitt Romney\r\nGovernor Ed Rendell\r\nUS Senator Bob Portman\r\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz\r\nVP Dan Quayle\r\nMort Zuckerman\r\nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal\r\nCongressman Paul Ryan\r\nAmbassdaor John Negroponte\r\nFormer Florida Governor Governor Charlie Crist\r\nRev.
