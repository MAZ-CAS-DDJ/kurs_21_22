Jan  Schakowsky, D-IL, released \nthe following statement expressing her unequivocal  support for a robust \npublic health insurance plan. Rep. Schakowsky, a member  of the House Energy & \nCommerce Committee has been a strong voice in  support of such a plan.\n\n"Many Members of Congress -- including myself  -- will not support a health \ninsurance reform bill that does not break the  strangle hold of private \ninsurance companies on our health care system.   That requires that consumers \nhave a choice of a robust public health insurance  plan.  I will support \nnothing short of a robust public health insurance  plan upon implementation, no \ntriggers.  I believe Congress will pass and  the President will sign such a \nbill this  Fall."\n\n\n\n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
