We wanted to make sure that each of your campaigns\n\nThese donors join a diverse coalition of Americans\x97from business and religious leaders to military officials\x97who are calling on candidates to propose concrete solutions to the climate crisis. We hope you will share this with Secretary Clinton.\n\nSincerely,\nJenna Narayanan\nNextGen Climate Action\n\n\nRead the letter<https://nextgenclimate.global.ssl.fastly.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/50by30-Donor-Action-Letter.pdf> below:\n\n________________________________\n\nOctober 8, 2015\n\nDear Candidates and Elected Officials\x97\n\nWhen it comes to climate change and clean energy, America is on the brink of something huge. Nationally we are seeing clean energy starting to compete head-to-head with fossil fuels \x97 and win. In the first half of 2015, renewables account for more than two-thirds of new electricity generation across the United States. On a level playing field, these renewable resources are already in many cases the cheapest electricity options for new installations. This is fantastic news for consumers, but even better news for American jobs. In 2014, the solar industry was the top job creator in the whole energy sector. And accelerating the shift to clean energy would lower electricity bills and add millions more well-paying jobs right here in the United States.\n\nThe clean energy revolution is finally happening but in order to lead\x97or even be competitive\x97we need leaders who are willing to keep pushing the envelope and accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy.\n\nThat is why we\x92re calling on candidates and elected officials to demonstrate bold leadership and lay out a clear and concrete plan to achieve at least 50 percent clean or carbon-free energy by 2030. Reaching this goal would more than triple renewable energy in our country\x97putting us on the pathway to a 100 percent clean energy economy by 2050 and millions of new jobs.\n\nThis goal, which should serve as the minimum starting point for candidates and elected officials truly committed to accelerating America\x92s transition to a clean energy economy, will give our businesses the tools they need to do what they do best\x97innovate, create, and lead the world.  More importantly, it will show the American people that our leaders are getting serious about climate change and finally standing up for our kids.\n\nThe leadership we have already seen from many of you encourages us, but now is the time to double down. American business is ready. Voters are looking for solutions. Today, we call on all candidates from both political parties, up-and-down the ballot, to put forward their own concrete, detailed clean energy plans so that the American voters can decide for themselves who has the best solution to grow our clean energy economy and address climate change.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nWendy Abrams\n\nLinda Rosenberg Ach\n\nGary Arabian\n\nDoug & Leslie Ballinger\n\nJames Balog\nFounder and Director, Earth Vision Institute and Extreme Ice Survey\n\nJanice & Matt Barger\n\nKathleen C Barry, PhD\n\nAnne Bartley\n\nAndrew A.
