From its $15 million summer ad campaign defending the Iraq\nstrategy to its six-figure effort in the House special election in Ohio, the\ngroup has put Democrats on notice that its agenda will go far beyond the\nconservative principles of its largest financial backers.\n\n"We\'re a permanent political operation here in town. We\'re not going to be\nJohnny One Note," said Joe Eule, executive director of the expanding group,\na nonprofit organization that many are describing as the\nMoveOn.org<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/MoveOn.org?tid=informline>of\nthe right.\n\nThe current Freedom\'s Watch staff of about 20 will be more than doubled in\nthe coming months. In December, the group lured Ed Patru, the message chief\nfor House Republicans, away from Capitol\nHill<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Capitol+Hill?tid=informline>to\nrun its aggressive communications arm.\n\nThe group\'s offices, above the posh Caucus Room restaurant downtown, are\nbeing outfitted with a modern studio so the staff can send ads to TV and\nradio stations across the country on a moment\'s notice.\n\nAnd Freedom\'s Watch will have money -- a lot of money. While initial reports\nsuggested a budget of $200 million, people who have talked to the group in\nrecent weeks say the figure is closer to $250 million, more than double the\namount spent by the largest independent liberal groups in the 2004 election\ncycle.\n\n"I\'m happy to have any help I can get on the battlefield," said Rep. Tom\nCole <http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/c001053/>(R-Okla.),\nchairman of the National\nRepublican Congressional\nCommittee<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/National+Republican+Congressional+Committee?tid=informline>,\nwhich has badly trailed its counterpart, the Democratic Congressional\nCampaign Committee<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Democratic+Congressional+Campaign+Committee?tid=informline>,\nin fundraising.\n\nIndependent groups have been a staple of American politics since election\nlaws five years ago prohibited national parties from raising unlimited\namounts of money from wealthy individuals, unions and corporations. In the\nlast presidential campaign, the liberal groups America Votes and Media Fund\nspent about $100 million apiece on a get-out-the-vote effort and a TV attack\ncampaign, respectively.\n\nOn the right, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth spent $22 million attacking the\nmilitary credentials of the Democratic presidential nominee, Sen. John F.\nKerry <http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/k000148/>(Mass.).\nIn 2005 and 2006, the conservative Progress for America spent tens\nof millions of dollars supporting the Supreme Court nominations of Chief\nJustice John G. Roberts\nJr.<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/John+Roberts+%28Chief+Justice%29?tid=informline>and\nJustice\nSamuel A. Alito\nJr.<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Samuel+Alito?tid=informline>\n\nFederal laws prevent independent groups from directly advocating or opposing\nspecific candidates, so most of these groups tend to disappear as quickly as\nthey arrive, folding when the election or the debate they are trying to\ninfluence concludes. MoveOn.org is an important exception. Founded a decade\nago to urge Congress to censure President Bill\nClinton<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Bill+Clinton?tid=informline>for\nhis affair with Monica\nS. Lewinsky<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Monica+Lewinsky?tid=informline>and\n"move on," the group grew into a leading liberal voice.\n\nEnter Freedom\'s Watch.\n\n"There is a sense among those contributing to Freedom\'s Watch that MoveOn\npowerfully filled a void in the left, that rallied support in the left, that\nraised money from the left, that mobilized the left," said Ari Fleischer, a\nformer Bush press secretary and a Freedom\'s Watch founder. The other\norganizers are Bradley A. Blakeman, another former Bush White House\nofficial, and Mel Sembler, a\nFlorida<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Florida?tid=informline>strip-mall\nmagnate who served as Bush\'s ambassador to\nItaly <http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Italy?tid=informline>\n.\n\nWes Boyd, who co-founded MoveOn.org with his wife in their home in\nBerkeley<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Berkeley?tid=informline>,\nCalif.<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/California?tid=informline>,\nsaid the two groups are fundamentally different because his liberal\norganization was set up outside the influence of Democratic\nParty<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/U.S.+Democratic+Party?tid=informline>operatives\nand is funded primarily by small-dollar donors around the\ncountry.\n\nFreedom\'s Watch, on the other hand, is "doing attack ads by Beltway\noperatives, financed by billionaires, at the request of the White House,"\nBoyd said by e-mail. "MoveOn helps millions of real people get engaged and\nbe heard and is solely funded by these same people."\n\nFor much of the debate over campaign finance legislation earlier this\ndecade, Republicans argued that Congress should rein in independent\npolitical groups, known as 527 organizations because of the part of the tax\ncode that governs them. Because those groups leaned primarily Democratic,\nthe Democrats resisted.\n\n"Now they\'re reaping what they sowed," Cole said.\n\nMany 527s have faced tight scrutiny from the Federal Election\nCommission<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Federal+Election+Commission?tid=informline>,\nso some operatives -- including the Freedom\'s Watch founders -- have decided\nto open political groups under a different section of the tax code that has\nreceived little attention from regulators, according to legal experts.\n\nThe organization was conceived at a Florida meeting of the Republican Jewish\nCoalition last spring with the initial aim of defending Bush\'s policies in\nIraq and Iran<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Iran?tid=informline>.\nBut like its inspiration and antagonist, it has moved on.\n\nThe aggressively negative anti-illegal-immigration ads that ran during the\nOhio special election race strayed far from Middle\nEast<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Middle+East?tid=informline>policy,\nbut the ad campaign -- like the group itself -- was bankrolled\nlargely by Sheldon G. Adelson, a Las\nVegas<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Las+Vegas?tid=informline>casino\nexecutive who last year pledged an unprecedented $200 million to\nJewish and Israeli causes.\n\nAdelson personally wrote an $80,000 check to Freedom\'s Watch on Dec. 7,\naccording to Federal Election Commission documents, just four days before\nthe election that gave Republican Robert Latta the House seat representing\nthe district around Bowling\nGreen<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Bowling+Green?tid=informline>.\nBehind a blood-red foreground, the group\'s ad showed Latinos hurrying under\nfences and being frisked by police as a narrator accused Democratic\ncandidate Robin Weirauch and "liberals in Congress" of supporting free\nhealth care for illegal immigrants.\n\nFleischer said the turn toward the immigration issue should not have been a\nsurprise.\n\n"To us it wasn\'t a broadening" of the mission, he said. "We said prosperity\nthrough free enterprise and domestic issues were going to be on the agenda.\nBut something had to come first, and what came first was the \'surge\' and the\npresident\'s policies in Iraq."\n\nFleischer cautioned that the scope of the group\'s involvement in the 2008\nelections has not been decided. But the roughly $100,000 ad campaign in Ohio\nis a good indication.\n\nAfter Latta won, the DCCC chairman, Rep. Chris Van\nHollen<http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/v000128/>(Md.),\nissued a memo warning fellow Democrats about the new independent\ngroup gunning for them. Van Hollen\'s campaign committee has $31 million,\ncompared with $2.3 million for the Republicans\' committee, but he is deeply\nconcerned that independent groups on the right are now engaged in\ncongressional races while liberal groups are focused on the presidential\nrace.\n\nWhen it comes to political money, "there\'s a whole other universe out\nthere," Van Hollen said he told Democrats. "Don\'t get lulled into a false\nsense of security."\n\nDemocrats are particularly concerned about the impact these groups can have\nagainst vulnerable incumbents from rural districts, where TV advertising is\nless expensive. "Those are congressional districts where a little bit of\nmoney can go a long way," Van Hollen said.\n\nAs an appetizer, Freedom\'s Watch took out full-page ads last fall in the\nlocal newspapers of seven freshman House Democrats from rural districts,\ntargeting their antiwar votes and linking them to Speaker Nancy\nPelosi<http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/p000197/>(D-Calif.).\n\nMany in Freedom Watch\'s donor base -- including Adelson, the chairman and\nchief executive of the Las Vegas Sands\nCorp.<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Las+Vegas+Sands+Corp.?tid=informline>,\nand Sembler, the strip-mall magnate from St.\nPetersburg<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/St.+Petersburg?tid=informline>,\nFla. -- have always been strong supporters of\nIsrael<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Israel?tid=informline>.\nThe group\'s initial ad blitz in defense of Bush\'s troop buildup in Iraq came\nnaturally out of those interests.\n\nTo start, Freedom\'s Watch is raking in huge donations from a few donors, a\nmodel that the NRCC and other federally sanctioned campaign groups cannot\nfollow, because donation sizes are limited by law. And like MoveOn,\nFreedom\'s Watch intends to augment that approach with a grass-roots\nfundraising model that energizes a base of supporters as it brings in money.\n\n"If you\'re going to be a permanent organization that has real impact on\npublic policy, you have to have significant financial supporters and you\nhave to broaden your base," Fleischer said. "We are going to try to do\nboth."\n'
