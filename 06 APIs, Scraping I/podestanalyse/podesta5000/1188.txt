Over the course of twelve days (6 June \xe2\x80\x93 18 June), nine American service members were killed in action in Iraq \xe2\x80\x93 a significant increase in American deaths for that short of a period. In comparison, two Americans were lost in combat in Iraq in all of May.\n\n\nWhat has become abundantly clear is that as long as Americans are in Iraq, they will be a target. Should we stay in Iraq past our deadline, there is no reason to believe that violent attacks won't further increase, leading to more American deaths. The United States will then be forced to either endure the attacks or send in more troops to protect our forces. There is simply no outcome from staying past the Status of Forces Agreement deadline that is acceptable or desirable. \n\n\n*SIGN THIS LETTER WITH ME CALLING ON PRESIDENT OBAMA TO REMOVE US TROOPS FROM IRAQ* [ http://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/6676/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=7255 ]\n\n\nPresident Obama must abide by the deadline set forth by the Status of Forces Agreement with Iraq, and affirm to Prime Minister Maliki that United States troops will be completely out of the country by year's end. \n\nAmerica and our troops have given many years, shed a lot of blood, and lost many lives in Iraq. There is no more we can possibly do for Iraq or its people, militarily. The time has long passed for Iraq to stand on its own two feet, and chart its own future and promote its own security. It is time for us to leave. \n\n*CLICK HERE TO COSIGN MY LETTER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA ON TROOPS IN IRAQ* [ http://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/6676/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=7255 ]\n\n\nPlease join with me in writing to President Obama, calling on him to remove all troops from Iraq by year's end. We'll send all of our signatures to the President, and keep you up to date regarding any news or response to the letter.\n\n\nThanks for your support.\n\n\nSincerely,\nAshwin Madia\nIraq War Veteran\nInterim Chairman, VoteVets.org \n\nPaid for by VoteVets Action Fund\n\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n\nVoteVets.org \n\n [ http://www.facebook.com/pages/VoteVetsorg/8501031021 ]  [ http://www.twitter.com/votevets ]  [ http://www.youtube.com/votevets ] \n\nYou are subscribed to this list as john.podesta@gmail.com.
