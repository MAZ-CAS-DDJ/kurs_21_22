After doing a series of swims in the Antarctic to protect the Ross Sea, he joined forces with a Russian ice hockey star in Moscow and seemed to have taken the Russian media by storm.  He also met the Defense Minister.  We call it speedo diplomacy :) - a little piece from an interview Lewis did, attached.\n\nLet me know if you have any time on Tuesday afternoon and I can try and set something up.\n\nBest,\n\nKaren\n\n\nKaren Sack\nManaging Director, Ocean Unite\ne-mail: Karen.Sack@oceanunite.org<mailto:Karen.Sack@oceanunite.org>\nm: + 1 202.415.5403<tel:%2B%201%20202.415.5403>\nskype: karensack\ntwitter: @karen_sack\n\n"We must protect the ocean as if our lives depend upon it -- because they do." --Sylvia Earle\n\n\n'
