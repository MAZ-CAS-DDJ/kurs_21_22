Most people do not know the next debate is also scheduled for a sham time on a three day holiday weekend Sunday designed to minimize the audience at a key moment in the campaign.  \n\nThe shrewdies that run the campaign seem to believe they are so threatened by a 74 year old socialist that they have to fix the debates in a way that guarantees huge antagonism from his supporters who distrust her already,\nmany of whom are young people and first time participants in politics who will choose to stay home on election day and conclude politics, including Democratic politics and Clinton politics, is a dirty business.\n\nThey also seem to believe that HRC needs to be protected from herself by\nseeking debates that the fewest number of people watch......\n\nThey do not seem to appreciate that she would do a good job in these debates that would lift her low trust ratings, while fixed debates only raise her distrust numbers that are much too high already.\n\nI find this out-of-touchedness amazing and incredible. \n\nThe smart move for HRC tonight would to give Bernie a pass for his campaign's obvious F*CK up over the data, the same way he gave her a pass for her obvious F*CK over her private emails that remain under FBI investigation.\n\nThe idea is to build goodwill among an opposition candidate who cannot win and his supporters who must come out for her to win a general election.\n\nIf anyone in the campaign is not fully aware of the risk they are running, I will be glad to so a special debate prep session where I will play an angry Bernie, sitting across the table from the entire campaign management in a simulated debate where I will take the side of what an angry Bernie would say about various matters where he could easily attack but has not....beginning with what he would say about her paid speeches to big banks....and it would not matter what time of day these debates are held because they would give the sound bites from hell for Hillary that the media saturate coverage ad nauseum for the following days....\n\nAll of HRC's spinmeisters parading to television camera do ZERO to mitigate the lack of trust and enthusiasm among Bernie supporters that is the greatest single danger threat to her election....and when they say on TV today that the DNC is not fronting for the Clinton campaign every Sanders supporter believes they are lying through their teeth and they are right, and if HRC wants to lose the election, this is how to do it.\n\n\n\n\nSent from my iPad"
