We think so, and Clean Water Action members across the country agreed by voting in this year\'s online Ideas for Change in America competition. \n\nThanks from all of us here at Clean Water Action to those of you who helped us win more than 3,000 votes in the final round. \n\nWhile we did not make it into the "top 10," we got very close, and Clean Water Action\'s "Look Upstream to Protect Water and Health" idea was the highest vote-getter in the environment category. \n\nWith your help, Clean Water Action will continue to make the water connection [ http://blog.cleanwateraction.org/2010/02/20/making-the-water-connection/ ] and to look upstream to protect our water and health [ http://blog.cleanwateraction.org/2010/02/25/look-upstream-to-protect-water-health/ ]. You can also check out the top 10 ideas [ http://www.change.org/ideas ]. \n\nAgain, if you voted, thank you for taking the time to support our ideas. \n\nSincerely, \nJohn DeCock \nPresident \nClean Water Action\n\n\n----------------------\nTell a Friend\nDo you know someone who might be interested in learning about our work? <http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/t/201/tellafriend.jsp?tell_a_friend_KEY=3263>Tell them!\n\n\n\nDonate\nSupport Clean Water Action by <https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/t/3991/shop/custom.jsp?donate_page_KEY=2854&tag=email.passiveask>making a donation today.\n\n\nConnect\n\nConnect\n<http://www.facebook.com/pages/Clean-Water-Action/22907478728?ref=nf> Join us on Facebook\n<http://twitter.com/cleanh2oaction/> Follow us on Twitter\n<http://www.youtube.com/cleanwateraction> Check out our YouTube channel\n<http://cleanwateraction.we-care.com/>Shop with a purpose!
