john.podesta@gmail.comb'Bill Bennett repeated the lie on CNN after the debate.\n\nMcCain was not joking with a group of veteran buddies.  His comments came at\na town hall event in South Carolina where media reports did not identify an\naudience member who asked McCain if he would attack Iran.  McCain said later\nthat he was joking with veterans, but that does not appear to be the case,\nand when the media followed up, he made another incredibly insensitive\nremark.\n\nCNN reported<http://www.cnn.com/POLITICS/blogs/politicalticker/2007/04/mccain-sings-bomb-bomb-iran.html>,\nat an April 18, 2007 campaign event in South Carolina: "McCain was asked if\nthere is a plan to attack Iran. McCain began his answer by changing the\nwords to a classic Beach Boys\' song.  "You know that old Beach Boys song,\nBomb Iran?" the Republican presidential candidate said. Then, he sang. "Bomb\nbomb bomb, bomb bomb Iran."\n\nAccording to CNN:\n\nHe finished his answer by discussing the Iran\'s nuclear ambitions and the\ncountry\'s desire to wipe Israel off the map to emphasize the real dangers\nthat it poses to the world.\n"The senator was adding levity to the discussion and the crowd reacted with\nlaughter," campaign spokesman Kevin McLaughlin said. "He went on to discuss\nthe seriousness of issue."\n\n\nNPR had this report:\n\nApril 20, 2007 \xb7 Republican presidential contender Sen. John McCain (AZ)\njoked about bombing Iran this week during a campaign appearance in Murrells\nInlet, S.C.\n\nMcCain was asked by an audience member about possible U.S. military action\nin Iran.\n\n"How many times do we have to prove that these people are blowing up people\nnow, never mind if they get a nuclear weapon. When do we send them an\nairmail message to Tehran?" a man in the crowd asked.\n\nIn response, McCain said, "That old, eh, that old Beach Boys song, Bomb\nIran" \x97 which elicited laughter from the crowd. McCain then chuckled before\nbriefly singing \x97 to the tune of the chorus of the Beach Boys\' classic\n"Barbara Ann" \x97 "Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, anyway, ah ...."\n\nThe audience responded with more laughter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AP reports that McCain was asked Thursday about this and the attention\nit\'s getting and had this to say:\n\n"Please, I was talking to some of my old veterans friends," he told\nreporters. "My response is, Lighten up and get a life."\n\n*When reporters asked if the joke was insensitive, McCain said: "Insensitive\nto what? The Iranians?"*\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
