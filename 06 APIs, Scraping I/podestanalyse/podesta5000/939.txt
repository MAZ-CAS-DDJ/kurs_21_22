john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear Friend,\n\nEven after the BP catastrophe, Pat Toomey still wants to drill in the Great Lakes.\n\nYesterday, Erie\'s No.1 newscast reported on Pat Toomey\'s visit there:\n\n"Toomey believes drilling for oil and natural gas can be performed safely in Lake Erie ... The current BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico has not changed his mind. Toomey has received nearly $100,000 from the oil and gas lobby \xe2\x80\xa6 Residents we spoke with who live on the shoreline are against ANY type of drilling \xe2\x80\xa6 A big difference between the water in Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico - we have a Great Lake here to rely on for drinking water for millions of people, down there in the Gulf they are not drinking that sea water." -- ABC affiliate WJET- TV\n\nLake Erie \xe2\x80\xa6 Pennsylvania \xe2\x80\xa6 our environment \xe2\x80\xa6 needs protection from Pat Toomey:\n\nVIDEO: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=ejune18linkv\n\nWe URGE YOU to please make a contribution, whatever you are able to afford, to help us complete an expanded version of this video and make it "viral" across the internet with multiple ads on multiple websites.\n\nContribute: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=ejune18link1\n\nThe expanded video will be a key major issue that begins to expose the extreme views of Pat Toomey ... while galvanizing support for our campaign.\n\nThe majority of Americans oppose expanded offshore drilling in our oceans \xe2\x80\xa6 now Pat Toomey is advocating for drilling in our FRESHWATER GREAT LAKES -- the major drinking source of water for millions of Americans! His views are too radical for Pennsylvania and for the nation.\n\nHelp us complete this video, and get it advertised across the internet, because... "don\'t it always seem to go, that you don\'t know what you got till it\'s gone" \xe2\x80\xa6 help us protect Lake Erie!\n\nBest regards,\nRich Sestak\nCampaign Director\n\n\nContributions are not tax deductible.\n\nContribute: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=ejune18linkb\n\nVolunteer: http://JoeSestak.com/volunteer\n\nUnsubscribe: http://JoeSestak.com/unsubscribe \n\nSestak for Senate\nPO Box 1936 Media, PA 19063\n\n(610) 891-8956\n\nPaid for by Sestak For Senate'
