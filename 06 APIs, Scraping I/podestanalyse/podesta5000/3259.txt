They\'re now saying our chances of holding onto this seat are "diminishing" and we have a "big problem."\n\nIf we\'re going to win this thing and keep Congresswoman Hayworth from taking her radical Tea Party politics to Washington we\'re going to need your help. We need to raise $8,834 by midnight tonight if we want to keep our ads up on air.\n\nWE\'RE COUNTING ON YOU: Give $250 or more to stop this race from slipping away.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20141013-ld&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you!\n\nTeam Maloney\n\n\n\n--\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com. \n\nTo unsubscribe from the Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress email list, please click here:\n\nhttp://action.seanmaloney.com/page/unsubscribe/?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\n\n\nPaid for by Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n\n\n\n'
