When I ran it by you originally, you had planned on reaching out to John Podesta for input.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDavid Halperin, Senior VP of the Center for American Progress & Director of Campus Progress, has invited WJC to speak at their 6th annual Campus Progress National Conference on July 7, 2010, in WDC. Campus Progress is part of the Center for American Progress and works with and for young people to promote progressive solutions to key political and social challenges. WJC attended this event last year.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n'
