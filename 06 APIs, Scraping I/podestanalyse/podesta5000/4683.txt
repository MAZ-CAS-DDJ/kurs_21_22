It\xe2\x80\x99s a place close to my\n> heart.  When I was 24 years old, I went there for the summer to register\n> voters for Democratic National Committee.

I met parents running\n> small businesses, teaching their kids the value of hard work, that\n> everything good in life is worth working for.  They were a lot like my\n> father.\n>\n>\n>\n> A lot of the people I met that summer weren\xe2\x80\x99t registered because they\n> didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe their vote would matter.  And that\xe2\x80\x99s not because they were\n> cynical \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s because they had never seen anything to convince them\n> otherwise.\n>\n>\n>\n> I spent a lot of time that summer thinking about why voting is important.\n> Of course, elections help determine the direction of our country.

That what we do and think and believe\n> really does have an impact on our future.\n>\n>\n>\n> We may be up against Super PACs and billionaires.  But Donald Trump and\n> the Koch Brothers, for all their money, they get only one vote on Election\n> Day, just like everyone else.\n>\n>\n>\n> One person, one vote.  That\xe2\x80\x99s what we believe. And no one should be able\n> to take that vote away from us.\n>\n>\n>\n> That\xe2\x80\x99s why we can\xe2\x80\x99t close our eyes to attacks on voting rights across the\n> country.  They don\xe2\x80\x99t just threaten the trustworthiness of our elections.\n> They threaten what it means to be a citizen.  To be an American.\n>\n>\n>\n> In Alabama, without an ID, you can\xe2\x80\x99t vote.\n>\n>\n>\n> Yet Governor Bentley and his administration announced plans this month to\n> close 31 driver\xe2\x80\x99s license offices across the state.  They just so happened\n> to include every single county where African Americans make up more than 75\n> percent of registered voters.  What a coincidence!\n>\n>\n>\n> The closings will make getting driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses and personal\n> identification cards much harder for many African Americans, putting up new\n> barriers to voting.\n>\n>\n>\n> As many Alabamans have said in recent days, that\xe2\x80\x99s just dead wrong.\n>\n>\n>\n> The Governor and his administration are insisting the closings had nothing\n> to do with race.  Maybe they really believe that.  But the facts tell a\n> different story.\n>\n>\n>\n> The efforts to roll back voting rights in Alabama are a blast from the Jim\n> Crow Past.\n>\n>\n>\n> Fifty years after Rosa Parks sat and Dr. Martin Luther King  Jr. marched\n> and John Lewis bled, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe Americans are still forced to\n> fight for their right to vote\xe2\x80\x94especially in places where the civil rights\n> movement fought so hard all those years ago.\n>\n>\n>\n> Governor Bentley and other Republicans in Alabama have offered the same\n> excuses we\xe2\x80\x99ve always heard to justify laws that disproportionately affect\n> people of color\xe2\x80\x94or, for that matter, low-income people, women, young\n> people, and seniors.\n>\n>\n>\n> It reminds me of that old saying: \xe2\x80\x9cYou find a turtle on a fence post, it\n> didn\xe2\x80\x99t get there on its own.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>\n>\n>\n> Institutionalized racism doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just happen.  People make it happen.\n>\n>\n>\n> But for every Republican governor working to dismantle voting rights,\n> there are Americans determined to keep marching forward.\n>\n>\n>\n> I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of everyone in Alabama who leapt into action to confront this\n> injustice.\n>\n>\n>\n> So here\xe2\x80\x99s my message to you today: Don\xe2\x80\x99t give up.\n>\n>\n>\n> Keep marching.  Keep demanding justice.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t stop until you get it.\n> You\xe2\x80\x99ve got people all over America rooting for you and standing with you.\n> I am one of them.  And I will never turn my back on you.\n>\n>\n>\n> It\xe2\x80\x99s time for Governor Bentley and the Alabama legislature to listen to\n> their constituents and reverse the decision to close the DMV offices.  Not\n> tomorrow.  Not eventually.  Right now.\n>\n>\n>\n> And they should do more than that.\n>\n>\n>\n> Alabama is one of 17 states with no early voting.

They\xe2\x80\x99re citizens, too.  Nothing about having been in prison\n> changes that.\n>\n>\n>\n> Alabama should stop requiring people to provide proof of citizenship when\n> they register to vote.  It\xe2\x80\x99s demeaning, it\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory, and it has to\n> end.  Too many people don\xe2\x80\x99t have access to their birth certificate or\n> passport\xe2\x80\x94for example, college students who are living away from home.\n>\n>\n>\n> We should be doing everything we can to get more people involved in our\n> political process, not turning them away when they try to participate.\n>\n>\n>\n> And I\xe2\x80\x99m not just picking on Alabama.  This state is not alone in limiting\n> voting rights.  I wish you were \xe2\x80\x93 but you aren\xe2\x80\x99t.  Many states have passed\n> laws that make voting harder.\n>\n>\n>\n> And since the Supreme Court gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights\n> Act, the situation has gotten even worse.\n>\n>\n>\n> Some people seem totally fine with this situation.  They\xe2\x80\x99d keep pushing\n> our country in this shameful direction.  And that includes many of the\n> Republican candidates for president.\n>\n>\n>\n> Jeb Bush says he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t reauthorize the Voting Rights Act because voting\n> conditions have improved since it was passed.  As Justice Ruth Bader\n> Ginsburg put it, that\xe2\x80\x99s like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm\n> because you\xe2\x80\x99re not getting wet.  If a law is working, we should let it keep\n> working.\n>\n>\n>\n> When recently asked about voter ID laws, Marco Rubio replied, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the\n> big deal?\xe2\x80\x9d\n>\n>\n>\n> John Kasich restricted early voting in Ohio after the 2008 election, when\n> 77 percent of early voters in the most populated county were African\n> American.\n>\n>\n>\n> What part of democracy are all these candidates so afraid of?\n>\n>\n>\n> Many of the leaders and activists who marched and fought for the right to\n> vote are no longer alive to stop these abuses.  But we are.  And we have an\n> obligation to act.\n>\n>\n>\n> First, Congress should put principle ahead of politics and pass the Voting\n> Rights Advancement Act.  This bipartisan bill would restore the full\n> protections of the Voting Rights Act.\n>\n>\n>\n> Second, we should set a standard across this country of at least 20 days\n> of early, in-person voting\xe2\x80\x94including opportunities for weekend and evening\n> voting.  We should make it easier for people to cast their ballots.\n>\n>\n>\n> Third, we should enact universal, automatic voter registration, so every\n> young person in every state is automatically registered to vote when they\n> turn 18, unless they opt out.  I applaud California for beginning to\n> implement a similar approach last week.  More states should follow their\n> lead.\n>\n>\n>\n> These steps alone won\xe2\x80\x99t solve everything.  But we owe it to future\n> generations to fight back against attacks on voting.  We owe it to them to\n> make sure our voting system works for a modern America.\n>\n>\n>\n> We need to meet this moment with the bravery and determination of those\n> who came before us.  It\xe2\x80\x99s time for leaders in every party, at every level\n> of government, to be on the right side of history.\n>\n>\n>\n> And once again, the movement can start right here in Alabama.\n>\n>\n>\n> I know the challenges we face are daunting.
