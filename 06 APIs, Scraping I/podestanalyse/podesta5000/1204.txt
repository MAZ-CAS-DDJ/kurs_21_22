As some of you may know, Tyrone has been out of the office for some time due to medical reasons, and we had deeply hoped for a better outcome. Tyrone\x92s family is in the process of preparing to take Tyrone back to St. Louis; however, we hope to hold a memorial service for Tyrone on campus at some point in the future.\n\nPlease keep Tyrone and his family in your thoughts and prayers.\n\nSincerely, Bill\n\n\n\nSent from my iPhone\n'
