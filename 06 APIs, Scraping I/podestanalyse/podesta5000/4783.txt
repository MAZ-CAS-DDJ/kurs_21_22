But if you work at Wal-Mart, and you are\n> paid so little that you still need food stamps to put groceries on the\n> table, what does more money in stockholders\' pockets and an uptick in GDP\n> do for you?"\n>\n> Wal-Mart is a regular bogeyman for Big Labor, but it is also a\n> particularly tough attack for Mrs. Clinton to echo, since she served on the\n> retailer\'s board of directors for six years when her husband was the\n> Arkansas governor. The tie was regularly brought up by supporters of Mrs.\n> Clinton\'s opponents during the 2008 presidential primary campaign and\n> remains well remembered in Iowa, where *several Democrats  raised it\n> unprompted during interviews last week*\n> <http://www.wsj.com/articles/top-iowa-democrats-slow-to-rally-around-hillary-clinton-1420418121>\n> .\n>\n> "Even though they don\'t exist anymore, her connections to Wal-Mart, those\n> don\'t sit well," said Jennifer Herrington, the Democratic Party chairwoman\n> in Page County. "People still talk about it. The sense is that not much has\n> really changed."\n>\n> *Bill Clinton was just as bad as the Republicans*: "Pretty much the whole\n> Republican Party - and, if we\'re going to be honest, too many Democrats -\n> talked about the evils of \'big government\' and called for deregulation. It\n> sounded good, but it was really about tying the hands of regulators and\n> turning loose big banks and giant international corporations to do whatever\n> they wanted to do."\n>\n> Part of the Hillary Clinton argument is that her husband\'s presidency\n> presided over the economic growth of the 1990s. But here Ms. Warren takes\n> direct aim at Mr. Clinton\'s record on deregulation and harkens back to his *1996\n> State of the Union address and its signature line*\n> <http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=53091>, "The era of big\n> government is over."\n>\n> *NAFTA was a bad deal*: "Look at the choices Washington has made, the\n> choices that have left America\'s middle class in a deep hole... The choice to\n> sign trade pacts and tax deals that let subsidized manufacturers around the\n> globe sell here in America while good American jobs get shipped overseas."\n>\n> Labor has long been sour on free-trade agreements, and Mr. Obama during\n> the 2008 campaign said he would renegotiate it, though that never happened. *Mrs.\n> Clinton at the time also said she would seek a better NAFTA deal with\n> Canada and Mexico*\n> <http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB120459602445109371?mod=rss_Politics_And_Policy&mg=reno64-wsj>,\n> but it becomes politically difficult for her to offer substantive critiques\n> of her husband\'s White House record.\n>\n> *Mr. Clinton wasn\'t good for the middle class*: "So who got the increase\n> in income over the last 32 years? One hundred percent of it went to the top\n> 1%. All of the new money earned in this economy over the past generation --\n> all that growth in the GDP -- went to the top. All of it."\n>\n> Here Ms. Warren makes a potent argument that Mr. Clinton - and by\n> association, Mrs. Clinton - had the same results for the middle class as\n> Republican presidents. By tying the records of the Reagan, Clinton, Obama\n> and two Bush administrations together, Ms. Warren paints herself as the\n> outside-the-system crusader her supporters want her to be.\n>\n>\n'
