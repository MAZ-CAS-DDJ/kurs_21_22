Hope all\'s well with you and the family in this pre-election year...\n\nWe have a possible reason to visit Washington DC for an event on Fri, 17-Apr-2015.\nIdeally, for us, we\'d fly in that Friday morning, stay the weekend and come back home Sunday night (or) Monday morning.\nWould we have a chance to meet on any of those dates?\nWe could fly in a day earlier on Thu, 16-Apr-2015 if that works better.\n\nIf possible, we\'d love to also meet John & Mary Podesta.\nThey\'ve always been so gracious and kind to us.\nEmail addresses I have for both of them are no longer valid.\nPlease tell them we asked about them and would be delighted to host an evening on any of those days.\nOf course, we\'d be tickled if we could all get together...\n\nWarm Regards, Ashok\n\nAmrita & Ashok Mahbubani\nThe EKTA Foundation\n6 King Georges Way\nHuntsville AL 35824\nCell: + 1 256 337 1953<tel:%2B%201%20256%20337%201953> (Amrita)\nCell: + 1 256 468 9103<tel:%2B%201%20256%20468%209103> (Ashok)\n\n\n------------------------\nThis email was scanned by BitDefender.\n\n------------------------\nThis email was scanned by BitDefender.\n'
