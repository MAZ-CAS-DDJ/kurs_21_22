john.podesta@gmail.comb'Ok, I did a few things:\n\n1. On the message box, I did some formatting to tighten it.  Some of it was\nreading like a list of things, rather than a framework.  I highlighted\nwhere I did anything significant.  Dan, please make sure I didn\'t de-HRC\nthe language.  I also added a little language at the top of each section to\nshow how it related to the central box.\n\n2. I added this into the larger document (and have attached as a PDF for\npeople who may have issues with the formatting).  Oren, can you run the\ntargeting by anzo again?\n\n3. I added a theory on how we can have a "rudder" for scheduling.\nEssentially, we break the schedule up into phases that are anchored by\npolicy, but we we deliberately design to reinforce character traits.  I\'m\nnot married to it at all, but this is the sort of framework I\'m hoping we\ncan finalize next weekend.\n\nCan folks give a look...if we\'re good, we ship it off.\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Jul 3, 2015 at 12:35 PM, Jennifer Palmieri <\njpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\n> Hey - you know what this sounds like??\n>\n> Hillary Clinton!\n>\n> So exciting!\n>\n> I would put "clean" before "energy" and add climate to one of the\n> challenges we could harness American power to combat.\n>\n> Sent from my iPhone\n>\n> On Jul 3, 2015, at 11:47 AM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com> wrote:\n>\n> Add clean before energy?
