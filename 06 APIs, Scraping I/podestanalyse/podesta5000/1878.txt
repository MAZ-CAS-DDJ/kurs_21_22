john.podesta@gmail.comb'Beth just got in touch with me and is hoping to get your signature for\nthe HVF papers tomorrow. Apparently they need your signature on one\ndocument, which is a document of the directors of Hillary Victory Fund\nadopting the bylaws and appointing officers. They are incorporating\nthe joint committee on Wednesday and all of the directors (you, Beth,\nand Erin Stevens) need to sign the document.\n\nShe would have a Perkins staffer (Rachel) come meet you to sign the\npapers. Would she be able to drop by your house in the mid-morning\nbefore you head to the airport?\n\nShe could conveniently also bring over the printed briefing and TPs for Geneva.\n\nThanks!\n\nMilia Fisher\n(858) 395-1741\n'
