OK - essentially end Medicare as we know it, cut taxes for Big Oil, hold disaster aid hostage to other cuts in vital services and cut more taxes on billionaires.\n\nHayworth's using her personal wealth to jumpstart her attacks on Sean. Sean needs a grassroots response to match her $100,000 in the next 48 hours - will you help him respond?\n\nDonate $250 or more now! Make sure Sean has what he needs to respond to Hayworth and Rove's dishonest attacks.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20140206-d&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\nThe last off-year election was 2010 - you remember, the rise of the Tea Party? Well, they were defeated in 2012 and see 2014 as their opportunity for a comeback. That's what Hayworth's thinking. Add in that Hayworth - a Planned Parenthood-attacking, anti-choice, anti-worker extremist - is fronting her own cash, and it's clear she means business this time.\n\nWe have to gear up, too. Sean needs to raise $100,000 in the next 48 hours to keep pace and fight back. Will you help now?\n\nClick here to give $250 or more in a New York minute. Hayworth's in. This can't wait.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20140206-d&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\nThank you,\n\nPaul\n\n\nContribute -- https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20140206-d&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.\nTo unsubscribe from the Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress email list, please click here: http://action.seanmaloney.com/unsubscribe\n\n\nPAID FOR BY SEAN PATRICK MALONEY FOR CONGRESS\n\n\n"
