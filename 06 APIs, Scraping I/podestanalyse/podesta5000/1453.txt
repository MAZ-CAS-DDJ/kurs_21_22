john.podesta@gmail.comb'Fellas - \n\n \n\nDennis was asked to write an article about transition for Sunday\'s\nOutlook, and he did it.  He says that he argues that this transition\ncannot be "business as usual" and there cannot be a lull in efforts to\nstop Iran\'s nuclear program. \n\n \n\nHe is identified in the byline as someone who gives advice to BO.  \n\n \n\nI would have preferred Dennis not write this or at least not be publicly\nidentified as one of our advisers, but we are where we are.  If you all\nhave serious heartburn, please let me know and I will go back at Dennis.\n\n\n \n\nThanks, \nDM \n\n'
