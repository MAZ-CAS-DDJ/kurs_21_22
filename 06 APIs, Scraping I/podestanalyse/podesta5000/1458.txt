But press will hate this.\nWe will lose ground with them because of it.  (I am still for doing it).\nActual voters should see and see before the hearing.\n\n\n\n*From:* Robby Mook [mailto:re47@hillaryclinton.com]\n*Sent:* Thursday, October 1, 2015 7:17 PM\n*To:* Oren Shur <oshur@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Cc:* John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>; Jennifer Palmieri <\njpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Subject:* Re: Benghazi - paid media update\n\n\n\nLet's def discuss when we review scripts but I think we gotta do this in IA\nand Nh.  Our thesis is that our stuff doesn't cut through as well because\nit doesn't intersect w the crap they hear about her on the news.  I feel\nlike this is the kinda stuff we need to do to actually move numbers right\nnow.\n\nAt least worth trying this month.  If numbers don't move then we can go\nback to plan A.\n\n\nOn Oct 1, 2015, at 7:13 PM, Oren Shur <oshur@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\nJust wanted to send a quick update on where we are following today\xe2\x80\x99s HRC\ncall:\n\n\xc3\x98  All three TV firms are script writing, we\xe2\x80\x99ll review drafts tomorrow\nafternoon.  Research had pulled for us some of our best news clips.  The\ntrick, of course, is to connect Benghazi to emails in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s\ncredible.  But we discussed different ways to do it.\n\n\xc3\x98  The difficult part here is testing \xe2\x80\x93 if we want to ship something early\nnext week, our testing options are very limited, and I feel like we really\nneed to understand whether voters will believe that we can credibly\nconflate Benghazi and emails.  But we do have groups tonight and tomorrow\nafternoon \xe2\x80\x93 so tonight, we\xe2\x80\x99re testing some video clips tonight in the\ngroups and this spot that the digital team mocked up:\nhttps://app.frame.io/f/2Kh530dn\n\n\xc3\x98  GMMB is working on a more polished spot for tomorrow afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s groups.\n\n\nLooking ahead to next week, I think we still need to resolve whether this\nis limited to a national cable buy or whether we\xe2\x80\x99re really going into IA\nand NH with this (currently mixed opinions on team).  To do the latter,\nwe\xe2\x80\x99d be pulling other spots off the air before otherwise planned.\n\n\n\nPlease let me know if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to further discuss any of this.\n\n\n\nOren\n"
