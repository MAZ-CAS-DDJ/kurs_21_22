I am delighted that you may be able to find time for a visit on April 25th and will look forward to hearing from Eryn.\n\nAlso, I am attaching a formal invitation to our rising sea levels retreat that will be held at Sunnylands on Friday, October 10 through Sunday, October 12.\n\nAt the retreat, we will gather a group of leaders from several fields including government, science, media, and philanthropy to discuss how to advance and provide leadership for effective sea level rise adaptation strategies. In addition to HSH Prince Albert II of Monaco and Margaret Leinen of Scripps, confirmed participants include President Anote Tong of Kiribati, former President of Costa Rica, Jose Figures, Jean-Pascal van Ypersele the Vice-Chair of the IPCC, Jane Lubchenco, former Administrator of NOAA, and Gary Knell, President of National Geographic.\n\nI do hope that you will be able to join us in October.\n\nBest,\n\nGeoff\n\n\nGeoffrey Cowan\nPresident\nThe Annenberg Foundation Trust at Sunnylands\n350 S.
