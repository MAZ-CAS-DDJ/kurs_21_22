john.podesta@gmail.comb"Dear John,\n \n   FIrst Happy New Year and congratulations on overseeing an outstanding transition.  With apologies--I am intruding with a recommendation--for Bob Taylor.  You may know his wife Vicki Jackson, a colleague at Georgetown Law.  Bob is an outstanding lawyer and great human being.  We've known the family for twenty years.  He's also particularly well qualified for one of these positions.  He served as the first Deputy General Counsel of DOD for Environment and Installations under Perry, Cohen and was even continued for a year under Rumsfield.  He was encouraged by Jeh Johnson to put his hat in to be a general counsel--and of course was an early supporter of Obama.  \n \n   I know you have much more pressing issues, but perhaps you could send this on to whomever is working on these positions.\n \nWith appreciation,\nJudy\n"
