john.podesta@gmail.comb'John --\n\nHere\'s something Mitt Romney actually joked about with pride -- \nand plenty of scorn -- while formally accepting the Republican \nnomination for president of the United States:\n\n"President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the \noceans and heal the planet."\n\nAnd the crowd went wild.\n\nIt is nothing short of terrifying to imagine a party that openly mocks \nclimate change taking back the White House.\n\nThat\'s what we\'re up against -- join Environmentalists for Obama \nto fight back:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Join-Environmentalists-for-Obama\n\nThe contrast between our candidate and theirs couldn\'t be any \nclearer.\n\nPresident Obama has more than doubled the amount of \nelectricity we get from wind and solar over his first term -- and \nhis plans for wind power are expected to help grow the wind \nindustry to support 100,000 jobs by 2016. Both Romney and \nRyan want to kill the wind production tax credit, which could \ncome at the expense of 37,000 American jobs. Oh, but they \nwould keep giving $4 billion in tax breaks to Big Oil every \nsingle year. \n\nAnd just this week, while President Obama\'s administration \nfinalized historic fuel economy standards to double our vehicles\' \nmileage by 2025 and cut carbon pollution from vehicles in half, \nthe GOP adopted a platform that could kill investments in clean \nenergy, and calls on Congress to prohibit the EPA from moving \nforward with new greenhouse gas regulations.\n\nSurprise, surprise -- according to the Los Angeles Times, the \nplatform "was written at the direction of the Romney campaign," \nmaking it heavily influenced by Big Oil interests.\n\nSo there you have it -- the stakes for clean air, clean water, and \nclean energy jobs couldn\'t be higher.
