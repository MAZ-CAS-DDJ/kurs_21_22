This is a special event at which the staffers who receive our holiday gifts prepare a bounteous feast for the faculty.  If you can help us distribute the gifts, please mark your calendar.  We\'ll let you know where and when we\'ll assemble.\n\n            This is a reminder that if you would like to contribute to the Staff Holiday Gift Fund and haven\'t yet, please do so at your earliest convenience.  We have already purchased the VISA cards, in our annual act of faith in the faculty\'s generosity, in order to have the cards shipped to us in time for distribution at the lunch, and our confidence has annually and unfailingly been rewarded.\n\n            As our last memo indicated, the Fund is used to buy gifts for our corner assistants, as well as mail-room, switchboard and Faculty Support Services personnel.  Each of our 24 staffers will receive a festive gift bag with a VISA debit card, a holiday card and a box of Godiva chocolates. The suggested contribution this year is $80, but any amount will be welcomed.  We feel that a high faculty participation rate is as meaningful as the final amount we receive.\n\n            You may give your contribution to any one of us.  Please make checks payable to "Joseph A. Page."  If you have any questions, we\'d be delighted to answer them.\n\n            Heartfelt thanks to those who have already contributed.\n\nJoe Page                      Jim Feinerman\nJosh Teitelbaum         J.
