She won't have a podium so I've written up a few bullets she can digest ahead of time on 3 key topics: K-12, guns and immigration. Each have an Arizona focus.\n\nI have Bernie contrast in guns, and Trump/Arpaio contrast in immigration... and I've included Bernie contrast in immigration, too, though I'm not sure we're doing that.\n\nLet me know what you think.  Thanks!\n"
