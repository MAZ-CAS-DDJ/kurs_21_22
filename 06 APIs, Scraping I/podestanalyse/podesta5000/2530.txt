I\'d focus on the fact they\'re still\ntrying to fight the progress we\'ve made, and repeal the Affordable Care\nAct...50 votes, 2 Supreme Court decisions and they still want to return to\nthe days of....\n\nHope this is helpful.\n\nThanks\n\nMandy\n\nMandy Grunwald\nGrunwald Communications\n202 973-9400\n\n\n> On Jun 25, 2015, at 9:28 PM, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com\n<javascript:;>> wrote:\n>\n> Team, we checked in with Gov. McAuliffe and he\'s hoping that tomorrow HRC\nwill talk about 1) Health care, 2) guns, 3) all the progress they\'re making\nin VA; 4) why she\'s running or President.  That\'s what I\'ve done in the\nattached draft, along with a fair amount of GOP contrast. See what you\nthink -- especially all you McAuliffe alumni out there.\n> Thanks\n> Dan\n> <2015-06-25 Virginia JJ 9pm.docx>\n'
