john.podesta@gmail.comb"Hello John, Cheryl, Victoria and Jennifer - Although I continue to respond\nto people's sharing of their concerns about the Foundation and/or my\nfather's world by telling them that 1) I hope they will share their\nexperiences/concerns/hopes/fears with Victoria and her team candidly and 2)\nthat it is critical that as we move to professionalize the Foundation for\nthe future that professionalism starts with this process - people continue\nto share things with me.  Although I continue to not respond or engage\nbeyond what I outlined above, I do think - and my mother strongly agreed as\na lawyer - that I should pass along to you Victoria and your team and to\nyou John and Cheryl the below as more information (factual or suspected or\nimagined). Particularly in advance of what I understand will be an\nintermediate conversation with Doug tomorrow. I continue to want - and to\ntry - to disintermediate myself from this muddle, edify the corporate audit\nand existential process we are in - while also being a responsible board\nmember, daughter and person.\nIn that vein, I was told or experienced the following since we had our\nmeeting last week Victoria:\n\n-  today that Doug reached out to someone at Harry Walker (who represents\nmy father on all speaking arrangements), to ask for a full list of all his\nspeeches, how much he was paid for each speech, and told the contact person\nat Harry Walker that all speeches should now go through him, not Terry\nKrinivic (the scheduler)\n- that Ilya physically saw/caught Justin a couple of days ago reading his\nbberry and loading the same spyware onto his computer that he loaded onto\nBari's computer\n- a secret service agent told Marc (my husband) that Justin had asked\nanother secret service agent to lie about the parking pass absurdity [we\ncan talk about this really ridiculous anecdote offline]\n- multiple people shared with me how upset they were at hearing how Justin\nreferred to my father in the last week - in very derogatory ways widely\nsadly\n- Oscar told my father he knows Justin reads his emails\n- my father was told today of explicit examples at CGI of Doug/ Teneo\npushing for - and receiving - free memberships - and of multiple examples\nof Teneo 'hustling' business at CGI - and of people now having quit at CGI\n- that Doug told Jon Davidson he was never going to forgive him for not\nreporting that Dad met with John (ie you John) on Sunday and that how could\nJon forget who he really worked for\n- Doug told Terry Krinivic she would never work again in this town if she\ndidn't back him up on everything\n- Ilya believes Hannah and Justin have taken significant sums of money from\nmy parents personally - some in expenses - cars, etc. - and others directly\n\nAs ever, on some of the above I am sure there are three sides as my\ngrandmother would say - his, hers and the truth. On others, it seems more\nclear. All of it makes me very sad. Thank you all for your help. The only\npeople I am sharing the above with are you, my mother and my father. Please\nlet me know as ever if you have any questions or advice.\nThank you,\nChelsea\n"
