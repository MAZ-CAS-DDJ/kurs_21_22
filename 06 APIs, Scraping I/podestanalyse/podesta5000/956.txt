As indicated in our meeting, when we receive a request from\none transition team for a document or meeting, we plan to both (i)\nnotify the other transition team of the request and (ii) make available\nany document response or meeting option.\n\n\n\nTo that end, I am writing to let you know that the McCain transition\nteam has requested a meeting next week between its lead personnel rep\nand members of the Presidential Personnel Office.  We are accommodating\nthe request and would be glad to do the same for your team, if desired.\nWe ask that, consistent with past practice, any requests for documents\nor meetings come to me in writing so that we have a record of the\nrequest and can jump-start the process (drafting an NDA for the meeting\nparticipants to sign, scheduling the meeting, notifying the other\ntransition team, etc.).\n\n\n\nAlso, we are working to get the Presidential Personnel binders cleared\nfor transmittal as well as to determine the feasibility of GSA procuring\na robust IT system/database suitable for both the transition and the\nWhite House.  I\'ll keep you updated on our progress.  Please let me know\nif there is anything else I can do to help.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nBlake\n\n\n-- \nSent from Gmail for mobile | mobile.google.com\n'
