You need to be able to construct a persuasive legal argument in support of a client?s case while telling your client?s story.\n\nA Brief Guide to Brief Writing is the third in a series of practice guides by experienced litigator, Janet Kole. Covering topics that include ethical principles, lower court/appellate court distinctions, and JDAs, the author\'s honest and direct guidelines will help shape the brief writing of both veteran and new attorneys. Her lively instructions on the craft of writing are summarized in seven Persuasive Writing Rules of Thumb: \n\nGrab the reader with your best, most equitable reason for why your client should win. \nUse acceptable but informal formal language. \nUse plain, jargon-free language. \nUse metaphors, allegory, and shorthand phrases very sparingly. \nKeep your sentences and paragraphs short. \nUse active voice where possible. \nShow the court that your story is the best, don\'t tell the court that it is. \n  \n \n \n \nOther Products You May Like \nBuy Chasing Paper: The Keys to Learning About and Loving Discovery\n\nJanet S.
