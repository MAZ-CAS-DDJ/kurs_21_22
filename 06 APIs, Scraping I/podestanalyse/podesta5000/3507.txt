I had not been pushing because the names I had been hearing seemed so strong.  Now the only strong name I'm hearing is Governor Granholm. Andy Stern says he will back me if Teddy does. I've talked to Gerry Shea who will discuss with Sweeney, and I've talked with Reich, Alexis Herman and Tom Glynn who have all encouraged me.  I would very much like to talk to you.  I'll be on and off cell today at 202-997-0483. Home over the weekend is 202-686-4141..  Thanks in advance.  This is obviously very important to me and I wouldn't put myself forward if I didn't think I can do a great job. \r\nSent from my Verizon Wireless BlackBerry"
