john.podesta@gmail.comb'John - \n\n \n\nThis is the memo that Larry Strickling gave to Don and Julius on the\noutside policy advisory groups.  I spoke to Larry, and as far as he\nknows, no one has started evaluating the 4,000 people on these groups to\nsee who have really been the superstars and deserve to be considered for\ntransition/administration positions.  I think Pete is contemplating\nLarry helping with that on the transition.  The only question is whether\nhe should start that analysis before Nov. 4.\n\n \n\n--Chris\n\n \n\n'
