john.podesta@gmail.comb'Thanks. Get in touch when you\'re in DC.\nOn Feb 10, 2015 6:05 PM, "Erika Rottenberg" <erika.rottenberg@gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hi John,\n>\n> As you may remember, we spoke at the Big Data conference at UC Berkeley.\n>\n> I believe you\'re going to be heading up HRC\'s campaign, should she\n> decide to run.\n>\n> I stepped down as LinkedIn\'s long-term General Counsel this past fall,\n> and would welcome the opportunity to help Hillary win. In addition to\n> having great Silicon Valley and legal connections, I would bring to\n> the campaign policy expertise, especially in the internet arena. I\n> also have a long term commitment to social issues, having started my\n> career as a special education teacher, and a track record of\n> non-profit board service, including Girl Scouts of Northern California\n> and the Silicon Valley Law Foundation.  And, at the risk of stating\n> the obvious, women\'s leadership issues.\n>\n> I thrive on navigating uncharted, complicated waters diplomatically,\n> and am known for my exceptional judgment, \'getting things done\' and\n> being values-driven (eg., firm believer in democratic values,\n> especially given my global internet experience).\n>\n> I will have the time and energy to devote to electing our nation\'s\n> first woman president - and would welcome the opportunity to discuss\n> joining the campaign in a meaningful way.\n>\n> I can be reached via email or phone, 650.417.5722.  I will also be in\n> DC the week of March 9 for CDT\'s (center for democracy and technology)\n> Board meeting and Tech Prom should you wish to meet.\n>\n> Warm regards,\n> Erika\n> www.linkedin.com/in/erikarottenberg/\n>\n> PS I have a "clean" background, am discreet and loyal, and am happy to\n> provide references, both in and out of government.\n>\n>\n'
