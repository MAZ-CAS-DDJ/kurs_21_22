That Congressman, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, was in Chicago today endorse Joel Pollack for the 9th Congressional District.\n\nIn response, 150 senior citizens, disabled, and concerned citizens from Illinois Alliance for Retired Americans, Illinois Main Street Alliance, Access Living, SEIU, Americans United for Change and Citizen Action/Illinois came together outside the Four Seasons Hotel to greet the ranking Republican Member of the House Budget Committee with a wave of "Hands Off My Social Security and Medicare!" signs, protesting his risky privatization scheme that would mean huge benefit cuts and trillions of dollars in debt for our grandchildren<http://www.ncpssm.org/news/archive/vp_inflated_solvency_gap/>.\n\nSpeakers at the protest included William McNary, Citizen Action Co-Director; Keith Kelleher, President of SEIU Healthcare Illinois & Indiana; Katie Jordan, Senior Citizen Illinois Association of Retired Americans; and Lorraine Mora-Chavez, Jobs with Justice.\n\n "It is irresponsible and unnecessary to talk about radically changing Social Security" said Katie Jordan of Illinois Alliance of Retired Americans.  "The purpose of Social Security is to keep our most vulnerable people from falling into poverty.  It is not another stock in your portfolio."\n\n"Representative Paul Ryan\'s radical plan to eliminate Social Security as we know it was rejected by the American people in 2005, and is opposed by 85 percent of Americans today"  stated William McNary Co-Director of Citizen Action/Illinois.  "Paul Ryan\'s \'roadmap\' puts Americans at risk when they can least afford it."\n\nAt this event, IARA released "Social Security Works for Illinois" ( link ).<http://socialsecurity-works.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Social-Security-Works-for-Illinois_August-24_Definitive_Final.pdf>  The report highlights the impact Social Security has on the families and economy of Illinois.  Social Security provides benefits to 1,948,600 people in Illinois (nearly 1 out of 6 residents) and it lifts 772,000 Illinois residents out of poverty.\n\nAfter the event a group of 5 crashed the fundraiser and chanted "HANDS OFF SOCIAL SECURITY".  They were quickly escorted from the room.\n\nWashington Post\'s Ezra Klein calls the \'reforms\' detailed in Ryan\'s budget proposal "nothing short of violent." <http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/02/rep_paul_ryans_daring_budget_p.html> Indeed, according to an in-depth analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities<http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=3114>: "[T]he Ryan plan would raise taxes for most middle-income families, privatize a substantial portion of Social Security, eliminate the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance, end traditional Medicare and most of Medicaid, and terminate the Children\'s Health Insurance Program. The plan would replace these health programs with a system of vouchers whose value would erode over time and thus would purchase health insurance that would cover fewer health care services as the years went by."\n\n-30-\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
