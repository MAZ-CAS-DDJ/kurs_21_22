The goal of of this effort is to fundamentally change the composition of the electorate in a number of states to better reflect the composition of the general population.  It is designed to meet this goal in a strictly nonpartisan manner, consistent with the mission of any private foundation.\n\nAlthough this would be a large and relatively expensive undertaking, it is hard to envision a better tribute to the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nI am happy to explain notable changes from earlier versions if you\'d like to talk.\n\nBest,\n\nBill\n\nP.S. Attaching a Word and PDF version of the same document.\n\n--\n[http://i1284.photobucket.com/albums/a574/ali_cp/RobertsESig_zpse1421d73.png]\n'
