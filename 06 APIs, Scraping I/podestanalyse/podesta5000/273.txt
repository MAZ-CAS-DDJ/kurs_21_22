On the ISDS provision, it would be helpful to remind people what she wrote in her book two years ago.  And maybe use that language as a rebuke to this deal -- something like "this doesn\'t achieve the level and fair playing field I had hoped for.  There are still too many special favors."  Or something like that.\n\n\nWe should be focused on ending currency manipulation, environmental destruction, and miserable working conditions in developing countries, as well as harmonizing regulations with the EU. And we should avoid some of the provisions sought by business interests, including our own, like giving them or their investors the power to sue foreign governments to weaken their environmental and public health rules, as Philip Morris is already trying to do in Australia. The United States should be advocating a level and fair playing field, not special favors.\n\n\n\n\n\nMandy Grunwald\nGrunwald Communications\n202 973-9400\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: John Anzalone <john@algpolling.com>\nTo: Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com>; Speech Drafts <speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com>\nSent: Tue, Oct 6, 2015 7:03 pm\nSubject: RE: DRAFT: TPP statement\n\n\n\nyou have no easy task here but I do feel like there are too many competing interests in the statement.  On one hand you praise Obama while opposing his efforts and actions.  Then you dissect the agreement in praise and criticism.  And you take a swipe at Republicans for creating the environment that drives part of her opposition which feels forced and a way to lesson the blow to opposing the president.  And the arguments against are so policy driven that I feel the American worker gets left out as the real reason to oppose it.  But them again, beggars can\'t be choosers.  If this is what it takes to get an opposition position so be it.  But I feel this type of approach, while sensitive to the Obama Administration, may get its own share of criticism for trying to balance her opposition and having it both ways.  I would favor more of the paradigm of how we approached the Keystone opposition.  More black and white.\n\n\nAgain, I am sensitive to the tough position you are in crafting this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com [speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com] on behalf of Dan Schwerin [dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com]\nSent: Tuesday, October 06, 2015 5:50 PM\nTo: Speech Drafts\nSubject: DRAFT: TPP statement\n\n\n\n\nHere is a draft statement opposing TPP. It\'s long, but covers a lot of ground. The goal here was to minimize our vulnerability to the authenticity attack and not piss off the WH any more than necessary.  See what you think. Our hope is to release this tomorrow.\nThanks\nDan\n\n\n\n\n\n'
