john.podesta@gmail.comb'John, it is a great point. Job well done tonight in the debate. Another point I would note is that Secretary Clinton\'s substantive, strong, yet inclusive approach towards the ISIS issue also steals the thunder from Trump\'s "making America great again" rhetoric. What makes America great is confronting challenges by strengthening our values, not weakening them.\n\nI look forward to connecting soon.\n\nBest,\n\nKamran\n\n__________________________________________\nKamran S.

As discussed, I want to do whatever I can by way of sharing ideas, raising funds, recruiting campaign volunteers, and anything else that can help with your campaign. I hope my small efforts to introduce you to a growing group of professionals like myself will be able to boost your important work for Secretary Clinton\'s campaign.\n\nI come to NY frequently and would welcome the opportunity to sit with you and discuss the best way to coordinate our efforts. If you will be in NY Jan 5, I will be free that day to meet you at any time and place convenient for you.\n\nBest wishes for a joyous and happy holiday season,\n\nKamran\n\n---------------------------------------\nKamran S.
