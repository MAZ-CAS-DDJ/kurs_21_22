The ads - part of a $1 million buy - thank the\nmembers for showing leadership and taking action for real health\ninsurance reform.  \n\n \n\nSEIU President Andy Stern said, "After decades of talk about reforming\nour healthcare system, the House took action. Not surprisingly, big\ninsurance, the Chamber and other special interests who want to derail\nreform have lined up to intimidate leaders who had the audacity to\nbelieve that we need a healthcare system that works for all Americans.\nWith the future of our economy and the future of the American dream at\nrisk, there\'s no more time to lose."\n\n \n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, together with Big Insurance, has spent\nmillions of dollars on attack ads to scare Congress into protecting the\ninsurance industry\'s monopoly and their multi-billion dollar profits at\nthe expense of the American people. \n\n \n\nThe Affordable Health Care for America Act will finally hold insurance\ncompanies responsible for their legendary abuses that put profits over\npeople - denying care when people need it most, discriminating because\nof gender or pre-existing conditions, and gouging individuals and\nbusinesses with astronomical rate increases every year.\n\n \n\n"Real leadership requires the courage to look past the next election and\ndo what is right for the next generation. These members of Congress said\n\'no\' to big insurance and \'yes\' to reform that ends the stranglehold\ninsurance companies have on our healthcare system. It\'s this type of\nbold leadership that deserves support," continued Stern.\n\n \n\nThe television spots will run for one week on broadcast and cable in\neight districts:\n\n \n\nIN 02 - Congressman Joe Donnelly\n\nIN-08 - Congressman Brad Ellsworth\n\nIN 09 - Congressman Baron Hill\n\nME 02 - Congressman Mike Michaud \n\nND AL - Congressman Earl Pomeroy\n\nNH 02 - Congressman Paul Hodes\n\nNV 03 - Congresswoman Titus\n\nVA 05 - Congressman Tom Perriello\n\n \n\nAudio of Ad\n\nDocumentation \n\n \n\nAfter decades of talk about healthcare reform what\'s changed?\n \nCosts have skyrocketed\n\n \n\nOver the past 10 years, employer-sponsored family health premiums have\nrisen 131 percent, to $13,375 annually, more than three times faster\nthan average worker wages.
