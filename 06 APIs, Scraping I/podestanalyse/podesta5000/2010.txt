john.podesta@gmail.comb'John --\n\nIt\'s been 9 months since we founded End Citizens United PAC -- a grassroots funded-effort to get big money out of politics.\n\nIn such a short time, we\'ve been able to accomplish truly groundbreaking things. Thanks to you.\n\nClick here \xe2\x86\x92 Take our brief Year End Survey to give us your input >>\n\nhttp://act.endcitizensunited.org/Year-End-Survey\n\nOne major way we\'ve made a difference in our first year is by supporting pro-reform Democrats all across the country.\n\nSo far, we\'ve endorsed nearly 7O candidates running for the House and Senate. Here\'s what some of them had to say about End Citizens United:\n\nEndorsed Candidates On ECU: \n"End Citizens United PAC\'s work is critical to building a broad coalition pressuring lawmakers to pass the Constitutional Amendment to reverse Citizens United."\n-- Sen. Michael Bennet, U.S. Senator in Colorado "Proud to have the support of End Citizens United. All Americans should have an equal say in who represents them."\n-- Rep. Tammy Duckworth, Running for Senate in Illinois\n"I was recently honored to receive the endorsement of End Citizens United, the grassroots movement to overturn the court\'s decision."\n-- Rep. Patrick Murphy, Running for Senate in Florida\n"I look forward to working with End Citizens United to keep [campaign finance reform] as a central part of the conversation in 2016, and I appreciate their support for this campaign."\n-- Rep. Rick Nolan, U.S. Congressman in Minnesota\n\nEvery one of our endorsed candidates has filled out the official End Citizens United PAC candidate questionnaire. In their responses, they showed a true commitment to campaign finance reform.\n\nJohn, these candidates are running in some of the MOST competitive races in the country.\n\nTo make sure that our allies have the resources needed to take on the Koch Brothers, we\'ve contributed nearly $35O,OOO directly to their campaigns -- and helped raise an additional $63,OOO for these candidates from small dollar donors (with an average gift of $1O!).\n\nJohn, we want to hear what you think about our strategy. Should we continue to endorse and financially support Democrats in the Election Year?\n\n\xe2\x80\x8b Please answer our really short 2015 Year End Survey right now >>\n\nhttp://act.endcitizensunited.org/Year-End-Survey\n\nOnward,\n\n-EndCitizensUnited.org\n\n\nPAID FOR BY END CITIZENS UNITED PAC\n\nhttp://act.endcitizensunited.org/page/s/less-emails\n\n'
