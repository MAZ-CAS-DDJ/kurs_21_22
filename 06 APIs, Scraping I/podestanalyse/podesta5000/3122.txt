One issue I didn't resolve is how much we'd\nwant her to still participate in scheduling if she does the HQ job.  I\nthink it's helpful for her to participate in calls and meetings because\nshe's the institutional memory--and that's always invaluable.\nAt the same time, I don't want people confused about who is in charge (i.e.\nthe scheduler needs to be in command of that process).  I think good\nmanagement can solve for that, but was curious what you think.\nThanks for your help on this.\n"
