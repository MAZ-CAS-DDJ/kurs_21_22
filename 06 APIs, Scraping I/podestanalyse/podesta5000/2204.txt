There isn't a conflict with the code of\nconduct, which Jack has signed, but it could raise a challenge in trying to\nhave a candidate discussion on issues related to teacher compensation and\naccountability. I've communicated this to Mark G. and sent Jack an email\nreiterating the importance of the confidentiality of the communications\nassociated with the transition project. I wanted to make you aware of this\ndynamic.\n\nBest,\nCassandra\n"
