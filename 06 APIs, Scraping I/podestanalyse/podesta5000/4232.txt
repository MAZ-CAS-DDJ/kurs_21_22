You'll remember I'm\nrunning for Congress in MD (Chris Van Hollen's vacated seat, MD-08) and my\nwife Michele Jawando is Vice President, Legal Progress at CAP.\n\n\xe2\x80\x8bPer our conversation, I am following up and I would love a chance to\nconnect about my candidacy in more detail.\n\nT\xe2\x80\x8bhe\nlas\n\xe2\x80\x8bt few \xe2\x80\x8b\nmonths have been a\n\xe2\x80\x8bn absolute\xe2\x80\x8b\n haul between fundraising and getting together a strong team\n\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\x8b\n\xe2\x80\x8b and I'm feeling confident about my position at this point in the\ncampaign.\n\n\nI'd like to get your input on attracting national donors that have \xe2\x80\x8ban\ninterest in my candidacy, specifically around issues of criminal justice,\neducation and civil rights.
