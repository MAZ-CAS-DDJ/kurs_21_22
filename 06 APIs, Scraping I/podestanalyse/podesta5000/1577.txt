Service is\nactually pretty good: wash, dry, and fold in 24 hours.  In a typical day I\ndirty a pair of boot socks, a pair of underpants, an undershirt, a pair of\nathletic socks, a pair of PT shorts, and a PT shirt.  Throw in a uniform\ntop and pants and I am at 20 items every three days.\n\nI learned yesterday that under the terms of the contract, the US taxpayer\npays $25 per bag of laundry.  Assuming I have to drop a bag every three\ndays, the taxpayer will pay $250 per month or $1,750 over the course of\nthis deployment on my laundry alone (mind you, we haven\'t even factored in\ntowels and sheets).  One of my coworkers has seven laundry bags and drops\noff a load of laundry every single day ($5,250 over a 210 day deployment).\n\nI\'ll kindly ask that you join me in being quietly appalled by this.  To the\nextent you wish to describe to others, please do not quote me by name.\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Gabe Podesta <gpodesta@gmail.com>\nDate: Fri, Mar 28, 2014 at 3:04 PM\nSubject: Afghan Commerce\nTo: John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>, Mary Podesta <\npodesta.mary@gmail.com>, Mae Podesta <mpodesta@gmail.com>, Megan Rouse <\nmeganrouse@gmail.com>, Gordon Rouse <rouse.gordon@gmail.com>, Gabriel Rouse\n<gabriel.rouse@gmail.com>, "ms.maribel.rouse@gmail.com" <\nms.maribel.rouse@gmail.com>, Judge Thomas Spieczny <tspieczny@epcounty.com>,\nKitty Spalding <spalding@elp.rr.com>, Molly Spieczny <\nmolly.spieczny@gmail.com>, Joseph Spieczny <spieczny@gmail.com>, Nspieczny <\nnspieczny@aol.com>, Manya Scheps <manyascheps@gmail.com>, Tosh Scheps <\ntscheps@elon.edu>, Tony Podesta <podesta@podesta.com>, Catherine Chieco <\ncrchieco@gmail.com>, Todge Spieczny <todges2000@yahoo.com>, cynthia\nspieczny <fenwickstar@yahoo.com>\n\n\nWhen I learned that I was deploying to support a contracting command, I\nfigured I would learn about the Afghan economy. What I hadn\'t figured was\nthat those lessons would have nothing to do with my official duties.\n\nWhen I stepped off the helo pad at Camp Phoenix and into my office for the\nfirst time I was immediately introduced to GS-15 DoD employee. She asked me\nhow many "cartouches"I wished to purchase. A cartouche, I learned, is a\ncheap pendant necklace engraved on one side with an English name and on the\nother with the same name in Dari (or so they claim; it may well say Go Home\nAmerican Swine for all any of us know). I initially demurred but eventually\nrelented and agreed to purchase three. Even that compromise was met with an\nincredulous look and a puzzled "just three?" The interaction seemed odd but\nI figured that I just happened to arrive as a bulk order was being placed\nand that purchases like this were atypical. I was wrong.\n\nMy coworkers spend multiple duty hours each and every day shopping at the\nbazaars. They buy jewelry. They buy rugs. They buy electronics. They buy\nfur coats. Fur coats! Not a day goes by without someone coming into my\noffice to show off a new purchase. My Afghanistan workplace is Project\nRunway and I\'m Tim Gunn--I disapprove of everything around me and hope\neveryone will be sent home.\n\nYesterday a handful of them reviewed their bank statements to figure out\nhow much they\'ve spent since being here. Consensus was between five and ten\nthousand dollars.\n\nThroughout my life I\'ve been called cheap. Throughout my life I\'ve been\ncalled crotchety. So maybe this is just a continuation of the same but I\nthoroughly disapprove. Rather than speak up, however, I sit here meekly and\nfeign agreement with the ridiculous notion that a mink fur will look\nresplendent at the Dyess Officers\' Club in Abilene, TX when she redeploys\nthis summer.\n\nHope you are well.  Love and miss you all.  And no, I will not put in\npurchase orders for you.  Gabe\n\n\n\n-- \nGabe Podesta\n'
