john.podesta@gmail.comb'What do you think of the proposed structure I sent the saturday b/f last?\nAttaching it again.  It essentially creates a full-time Personal office of\nthe President headed by a new CEO/COS.  That person -- who is unaffiliated\nwith any of the entities or Teneo -- b/cs the decisionmaker on the\nallocation of the President\'s time and management and implementation of the\nPresident\'s desires with respect to each activity.  Doug and Justin advise\nthat person but do not make final decisions or have final implementation\nauthority on any matters - which is consistent with what Doug has said he\nseeks - the ability to recommend but for others to be accountable for\nmaking the ultimate decisions.  This does turn on who we can hire to be\neffectively an alter ego for WJC as this is role Doug played b/f Teneo --\nBruce never did.\n\nHappy to do a call today or any day this week if we pick the time.\n\ncdm\n\nOn Tue, Dec 6, 2011 at 6:12 PM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n> ---------- Forwarded message ----------\n> From: John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>\n> Date: Tue, Dec 6, 2011 at 6:12 PM\n> Subject: Re: Fw: FYI\n> To: aj66@nyu.edu\n> Cc: Bruce Lindsey <BruceRLindsey@aol.com>, Victoria B Bjorklund\n> <vbjorklund@stblaw.com>, Jennifer Reynoso <jreynoso@stblaw.com>, Terry\n> McAuliffe <terry@tdmca.com>\n>\n>\n> We need to move to a resolution of this quickly.\n>\n> On Tue, Dec 6, 2011 at 2:34 AM,  <aj66@nyu.edu> wrote:\n> > John, Bruce, Terry, Victoria, Jennifer - fyi re: below.
