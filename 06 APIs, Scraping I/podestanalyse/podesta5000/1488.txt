When the Fight for $15 stages its next protests on April 15, child care workers are expected to demonstrate alongside the home care workers and airport workers who have joined the campaign since its launch.\r\n\r\nMary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, which backs the Fight for $15, told Fortune that child care workers protesting alongside fast-food workers illustrates a dual crisis: underpaid working parents are struggling to pay for child care and those who care for others\xe2\x80\x99 children are struggling to take care of their own.\r\n\r\nChild care workers in the U.S. earn median pay of $9.38 per hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics<http://www.bls.gov/ooh/personal-care-and-service/childcare-workers.htm>. That is comparable with the earnings of food preparation workers\xe2\x80\x94$9.28 per hour<http://www.bls.gov/ooh/food-preparation-and-serving/food-preparation-workers.htm>\xe2\x80\x94and retail sales employees\xe2\x80\x94$10.29 per hour<http://www.bls.gov/ooh/sales/retail-sales-workers.htm>\xe2\x80\x94and is especially measly when weighed against child care workers\xe2\x80\x99 role in early childhood education.\r\n\r\nResponsive, sensitive, and secure adult-child attachments are developmentally expected and biologically essential for young children; their absence signals a serious threat to child well-being, according to a 2012 study by the National Scientific Council on the Developing Child<http://developingchild.harvard.edu/resources/reports_and_working_papers/working_papers/wp12/>. Findings such as these help explain the child care industry\xe2\x80\x99s growing expectation that its workers have college degrees. The share of Head Start teachers with an associate or bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree grew by 61%; for assistant teachers, it increased by 24%<http://www.irle.berkeley.edu/cscce/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ReportFINAL.pdf> between 1997 and 2013.\r\n\r\nAnd yet child care workers regularly earn less than adults who take care of animals<http://www.bls.gov/ooh/personal-care-and-service/animal-care-and-service-workers.htm>. Indeed, Head Start achieved its goal of having at least half of its teaching force hold a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s or advanced degree in early childhood education by September 2013, but its employees\xe2\x80\x99 salaries have not kept up with inflation since 2007<http://www.irle.berkeley.edu/cscce/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ReportFINAL.pdf>.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you look back over the last 25 years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned so much about early childhood development. We have a 21st century set of expectations [about childhood development], but in many ways we still have a 20th century view of work and pay structure [for child care workers],\xe2\x80\x9d says Marcy Whitebook, director of the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at the University of California, Berkeley. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a gap between the expectations and promise of early childhood and the way we think about the people who do the work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat gap is putting the quality of child care at risk. Research<http://www.irle.berkeley.edu/cscce/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Then-and-Now.pdf> points to wages as a key factor in the retention of high-qualified teachers, which, in turn, is the best predictor of whether a child care center maintains quality over time.\r\n\r\nLow wages inflict additional harm on the individuals who are providing the care.\r\n\r\nCorrine Hall, a 53-year-old from Raleigh, North Carolina who has worked in child care for 30 years, told Fortune she currently earns $8.25 per hour serving as a substitute caregiver at various child care centers. She was laid off from a full-time job two years ago. In the three decades she has worked in the field, she\xe2\x80\x99s never earned more than $13 per hour. Her low wages forced her to use food stamps earlier in her career as she cared for two daughters by herself. She has little savings for retirement. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to fall back on. Hopefully social security will be around. Other than that and my family, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much all I have,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\r\n\r\nHall is far from alone in her reliance on public assistance. In 2012, 46% of child care workers\xe2\x80\x94versus 25% of the nationwide total workforce\xe2\x80\x94was a member of a family enrolled in at least one of four public support programs: the Federal Earned Income Tax Credit, Medicaid and the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Health Insurance Program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, according to a 2014 study by the Berkeley Center<http://www.irle.berkeley.edu/cscce/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ReportFINAL.pdf>.\r\n\r\nUnderlying the wage issue is the high cost of child care itself, which makes industry workers\xe2\x80\x99 poor pay all the more surprising. For parents, full-time infant care costs<http://usa.childcareaware.org/sites/default/files/19000000_state_fact_sheets_2014_v04.pdf>\xe2\x80\x94on average\xe2\x80\x94between $4,560 and $16,549 per year, depending on the state and child care center setting. For a four-year-old, it ranges from $4,039 to $12,320. The Berkeley Center\xe2\x80\x99s analysis shows that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a two-fold increase in the cost to parents for early childhood services since 1997. At the same time, child care workers have experienced no increase in real earnings, even as payroll and related expenses make up 80% of the cost of a child care program<http://usa.childcareaware.org/sites/default/files/19000000_state_fact_sheets_2014_v04.pdf>.\r\n\r\nWhere is the increased cost of child care going, if not to workers? Deborah Phillips, a professor of developmental and child psychology at Georgetown University who worked on the 2014 Berkeley study, put it bluntly: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have no idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhillips surmises that the increased expense could be related to the growth of for-profit childcare centers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Rachel Demma, policy director at the Early Care and Education Consortium, which represents child care centers, says most for-profit providers make very little profit and, like their non-profit counterparts, spend the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of their revenue on staffing expenses. She said the growing cost of child care could be due to fluctuations in state reimbursement rates to providers that serve needy families. M-A Lucas, director of the Consortium, points to stricter caregiver-to-child ratios and the increased prevalence of labor-intensive infant care as two potential reasons for the skyrocketing costs and stagnant worker pay.\r\n\r\nThe answer to a second question may be just as hard to pin down: who will pay for child care workers\xe2\x80\x99 higher wages?\r\n\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s little disagreement that parents are already paying enough. Lucas says she\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the wages of the child care workforce, but her organization\xe2\x80\x99s stance is to \xe2\x80\x9cadvocate for policies that won\xe2\x80\x99t shift the burden of increased program costs to families.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhitebook from the Berkeley Center says early childhood education should be a public good. \xe2\x80\x9cLike public education, not everyone has to use it, but it should be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresident Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s recent proposal for a $3,000 child care tax credit<http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/01/20/state_of_the_union_president_obama_declares_childcare_a_must_have_not_a.html> and some states\xe2\x80\x99 and cities\xe2\x80\x99 introduction of universal pre-kindergarten offer some hope, as does the Department of Defense\xe2\x80\x99s Military Child Care Act, which successfully established new quality standards for the department\xe2\x80\x99s child care providers and linked teachers\xe2\x80\x99 training to their pay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople have solved this problem,\xe2\x80\x9d Phillips says. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are multiple ways to do this; it\xe2\x80\x99s just about making it a national imperative for private and public entities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nPeter Colavito\r\nDirector of Government Relations\r\nService Employees International Union (SEIU)\r\n1800 Massachusetts Avenue, NW\r\nWashington, DC 20036\r\n(202) 730-7727\r\n\r\n"
