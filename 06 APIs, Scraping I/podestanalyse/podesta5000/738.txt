RAND estimated it pays for itself (primarily in  \nchild abuse savings) within four years and ultimately saves four times  \nits cost.\nIt now serves fewer than 20,000 moms. The Obama agenda calls for  \nexpanding it to serve all 570,000 low-income, first-time moms each  \nyear.  The cost to fund the full program is probably under $2.5  \nbillion a year. Since it would take at least a couple years to recruit  \nand train enough nurses, this would not require a huge immediate price  \ntag, but others know far more than I about what could be spent how  \nquickly while maintaining quality.\nThere are two complementary approaches that could enable the program  \nto begin expanding quickly.\n1) Expanding an existing funding stream: A currently-small ($10.178  \nmillion in FY08) grants program that\x92s a part of the Child Abuse  \nPrevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) in the U.S. Department of Health  \nand Human Services (they\x92ve just completed the competition for this  \nFY08 first year of funding).  I\x92ve appended, at the bottom of this  \nemail, the language from the FY08 Consolidated Appropriations Act that  \ncreated this stream.\n2)  To the extent there is a way to get more substantive provisions  \ninto the Economic Recovery plan, you could build on two pending  \nbipartisan bills from which provisions could be embedded:\n             (a) the Healthy Children and Families Act (HCFA, S. 1052  \nand H.R. 3024) would establish a state option for evidence-based  \nvoluntary early childhood nurse home visiting to be a reimbursable  \nhealth service through Medicaid and SCHIP (this bill has not yet been  \nreported out of committee in either House or Senate).  Like the CAPTA  \napproach above, this option would have the logistical advantage that  \nit would be amending an existing funding stream rather than creating a  \nnew program.  The hitch is that states would be unlikely to add an  \noptional service like this unless they could use other federal funds  \n(like those under CAPTA) to meet what would otherwise be the state  \nFMAP share.\n\t\tOR\n             (b) the Education Begins At Home legislation (EBAH, H.R.  \n2343 and S. 667), which would authorize a funding stream to states to  \nsupport evidence-based voluntary early childhood home visitation (this  \nbill has been reported out of the House Education and Labor Committee,  \nbut has not yet been passed in either chamber).\nIn combination, the infusion of immediate funds through the CAPTA Home  \nVisiting stream for program infrastructure and training and perhaps  \nhelp with the state Medicaid match in the short term, coupled with the  \nHCFA approach that would establish  through Medicaid reimbursements an  \nentitlement funding source would jump-start the early childhood home  \nvisiting effort.\nWarmly,\nSandy\n----\n>                  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008\n>                     (H.R. 2764; Public Law 110-161)\n>    DIVISION G--DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND\n>         EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008\n> Child Abuse State Grants and Discretionary Activities\n>      The amended bill includes $64,802,000 for Child Abuse\n> State Grants and child abuse discretionary programs\x85.\n>      Within this amount, $10,178,000 is provided for a home  \n> visitation initiative to support competitive grants to States to  \n> encourage investment of existing funding streams into evidence-based  \n> home visitation models, instead of $10,000,000 as proposed by the  \n> House and the Senate.
