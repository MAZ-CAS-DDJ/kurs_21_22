Its findings highlight the likelihood of large scale climate-induced migration, which threatens to saturate labor markets and place downward pressure on wages and working conditions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is estimated that the number of environmental migrants may reach one billion by 2050. The effects will be particularly concentrated in countries like Bangladesh. It is important to understand how this migration will impact labor markets and social and political stability,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Sabina Dewan, the Executive Director of JustJobs Network.\n\nThe report proposes policy recommendations for governments, trade unions, NGOs and the private sector to take immediate action to mitigate the devastation, through expanding job-creating sectors like renewable energy, investing in skills training for migrant workers, and establishing worker protections and safety nets.\nVIEW REPORT (http://justjobsnetwork.org/climate-change-livelihoods/)\nFeatured EVENT\n\n\n** JJN PARTICIPATES IN THE ATLANTIC DIALOGUES 2015 (http://justjobsnetwork.org/events/atlantic-dialogues-2015/)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n#http://justjobsnetwork.org/events/atlantic-dialogues-2015/ Earlier this month, JustJobs Network's Deputy Director Greg Randolph visited Morocco to speak at the Atlantic Dialogues (http://www.atlanticdialogues.org/) , an annual high-level gathering of the most influential public- and private-sector leaders from around the Atlantic basin for open, informal discussions on cross-regional issues. Mr Randolph spoke at a session on bringing prosperity and security to cities, wherein panelists explored how cities and regions can play an important role in shaping policy and leading change.\n\nMr Randolph's remarks paralleled the points he made in a recent article (http://justjobsnetwork.org/blog/re-examining-the-link-between-urbanization-and-economic-growth-2/)  on the JustJobs Network blog, which explored the tenuous relationship between urbanization, jobs and economic growth.\n\n\nVIEW EVENT (http://justjobsnetwork.org/events/atlantic-dialogues-2015/) http://justjobsnetwork.org/video-the-changing-climate-of-livelihoods/\nFEATURED VIDEO\nhttp://justjobsnetwork.org/global-network/#ituchttp://justjobsnetwork.org/blog/how-are-farmers-in-coastal-bangladesh-coping-with-climate-change/\n\n\n** H (http://justjobsnetwork.org/blog/can-indias-love-for-tea-help-tea-growers-affected-by-climate-change/) Ow are Farmers in Bangladesh coping with Climate change (http://justjobsnetwork.org/blog/how-are-farmers-in-coastal-bangladesh-coping-with-climate-change/) ?\n------------------------------------------------------------\nBangladesh has a million hectares of land affected by soil salinity. It\xe2\x80\x99s a problem that occurs in the hot, dry season in coastal Bangladesh. Timothy Russell of the International Rice Research Institute spoke to the JustJobs Network about how rice farmers are handling this problem and the role of researchers in helping them adapt.\n\nVIEW VIDEO (http://justjobsnetwork.org/blog/how-are-farmers-in-coastal-bangladesh-coping-with-climate-change/) http://justjobsnetwork.org/blog/myanmar-times-can-myanmars-minimum-wage-avoid-the-pitfalls-of-bangladeshs-garment-sector/\nFROM THE BLOG\nhttp://justjobsnetwork.org/global-network/#ituchttp://justjobsnetwork.org/blog/why-renewables-are-not-just-about-climate-change/\n\n\n** W (http://justjobsnetwork.org/blog/is-abenomics-helping-to-increase-female-labor-participation-in-japan/) hy renewables are not just about climate change (http://justjobsnetwork.org/blog/why-renewables-are-not-just-about-climate-change/)\n------------------------------------------------------------\nJustJobs Network's Research Associate Jit Shankar Banerjee recently published a blog on why India\xe2\x80\x99s policies on renewable energy should not focus only on meeting international standards of emissions. Investments in renewables should also prioritize job creation and the provision of energy to the country\xe2\x80\x99s poorest.\n\nView BLOG (http://justjobsnetwork.org/blog/why-renewables-are-not-just-about-climate-change/)\n\n\n============================================================\n\n** Home (http://justjobsnetwork.org/)\n/  ** Mission (http://justjobsnetwork.org/mission/)\n/  ** Research (http://justjobsnetwork.org/category/just-jobs-index/)\n/  ** Events (http://justjobsnetwork.org/classification/event/)\n/  ** About Us (http://justjobsnetwork.org/history/)\n\n** Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/justjobsnetwork)\n** Twitter (http://twitter.com/JustJobsProject)\n** LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/5074964?trk=tyah&trkInfo=tarId%3A1411931313673%2Ctas%3Ajustjobs%2Cidx%3A2-2-6)\n\nYou received this email because you've subscribed to Just Jobs Network.
