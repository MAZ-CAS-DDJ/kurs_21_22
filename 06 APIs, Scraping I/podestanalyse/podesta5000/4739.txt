Instead of\ndrilling for dirty energy we should be promoting efficiency and\nclean, renewable energy to address our nation\'s growing energy\ncrisis. \n\nTell your Members of Congress to resist calls for drilling and\ninstead promote efficiency and clean energy solutions!\nhttp://action.lcv.org/campaign/june_drilling/6kk3b5997wdkitb?\n\n*********\nSupport LCV\n<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT\nsize=2><STRONG>Become an LCV monthly pledge\npartner!</STRONG></FONT></FONT></P>\n<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"\ncolor=#434343><FONT color=#101010 size=2><FONT face="Verdana,\nArial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#434343><A\nhref="https://secure.ga4.org/01/january_sustainer/nR7zLkNKqCvoL?"><IMG class=imageBorder\nstyle="BORDER-RIGHT: #523e2b 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #523e2b 1px\nsolid; BORDER-LEFT: #523e2b 1px solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px;\nBORDER-BOTTOM: #523e2b 1px solid" height=70 alt="Support LCV"\nsrc="http://img.getactivehub.com/an2/custom_images/lcvorg/LCV_leaf_70x70.gif"\nwidth=70 align=left border=0></A><FONT color=black>The election\n- only&nbsp;five months away - is our best shot at addressing\ncritical priorities&nbsp;like reversing global warming and\nachieving a clean energy future.&nbsp; <STRONG>Every minute and\nevery cent matter!&nbsp; </STRONG>Pledging a monthly gift to LCV\nwill go a long way to help us achieve victories on Capitol Hill\nand at the ballot box.</FONT><BR></FONT><BR><BR\nstyle="FONT-SIZE: 12px"><FONT color=#434343><STRONG><A\nhref="https://secure.ga4.org/01/january_sustainer/nR7zLkNKqCvoL?">Click here to become an LCV\nmonthly pledge partner\ntoday!</A></STRONG></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>\n\n*********\nGetting Results\n\nSecond Annual Lobby Day a Success!\nLast Wednesday, LCV board members, staff, and state league\nmembers met with about 50 Members of Congress and staff to lobby\nfor immediate action on serious environmental issues, such as\nglobal warming.
