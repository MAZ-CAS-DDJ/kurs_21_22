Lorella has been very helpful and is\nworking hard  with  our Latino base but we need to improve our visibility\nwith a local,  well recognized Latino or Latina on staff . Sen Sanders has\nhired a Latina state director and  is taking full  advantage of the\nsituation.  We need this person to involve our high profile Latino and\nLatina  surrogates , like Ken Salazar, Federico Pena, Lucia Guzman,\nChrisanta Duran   and our state Latino electeds up and down the Front\nRange  .  We need to work Latino media outlets and generally energize this\nkey constituency in the three weeks before our caucus. We need this now.\nKen Salazar, Federico Pena and  Alan Salazar, among others, should be\nconsulted about their ideas asap  and the  right person to do the job.\n\n\n\nHRC is here next Saturday  night for our state Democratic dinner. We should\nhave this in place before this before then . We will then have two weeks to\ngo. No 2008\n\n\n\nThanks, Jim.\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nThis message and any attachments are intended only for the use of the\nindividual or entity to which they are addressed.
