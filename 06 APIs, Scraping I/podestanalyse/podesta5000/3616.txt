The World Bank estimates 550 million people \xe2\x80\x93 nearly half of the population \xe2\x80\x93 lack electricity in Africa. Photograph: NASA/Reuters\n> Most Americans take turning lights on for granted. But one in five people in the world still can\xe2\x80\x99t plug anything in. The World Bank estimates 1.2 billion people lack electricity all together \xe2\x80\x93 resulting in millions of premature deaths yearly \xe2\x80\x93 and many more have undependable or unaffordable electricity service.\n> \n> A high majority of those without electricity live in India, which averages 5.3 people per household, and in African countries, which range from 4.5 to 6.5 people per household, according to UN and World Bank data. By dividing 1.2 billion by 4.5, the most conservative number of residents per household, we can estimate that roughly 250 million households lack electricity.\n> \n> Meanwhile, solar photovoltaic cells, batteries and LED lights have grown so cheap and durable that an \xe2\x80\x9coff-grid\xe2\x80\x9d household \xe2\x80\x93 spending less than it would dole out on kerosene over two years \xe2\x80\x93 can harvest enough electricity to power lights and charge a cellphone for decades. In Africa, for example, companies such as Azuri Technologies and M-KOPA Solar already sell \xe2\x80\x9cpay-as-you-go\xe2\x80\x9d electrification systems for as little as $1.50 per month.\n> \n> At $200 each for these systems, a total of $50bn in loans \xe2\x80\x93 over several years \xe2\x80\x93 would be enough to finance the electricity to light up dark homes in Africa and India.\n> \n> These loans would immediately improve lives in the world\xe2\x80\x99s poorest households and substitute renewable energy for some of the dirtiest fossil fuels. But progress so far has been slow and small. In spite of some big government goals \xe2\x80\x93 such as US government\xe2\x80\x99s Beyond the Grid initiative, which plans to invest $1bn to get power to 20 million people in Africa in five years, and India\xe2\x80\x99s goal, missed in 2012, to get electricity to every household by 2019 \xe2\x80\x93 experts figure broad electrification will take decades. \n> \n> All this adds up to an enormous opportunity for US multinationals to make history with bold game-changing investments that will bring a billion people into the global economy \xe2\x80\x93 and to profit in the process.\n> \n> \n> Children in Kisima, Kenya, studying at night using a flame on a stick. Photograph: Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty Images\n> Right now, US companies are sitting on international profits 200 times greater than the $50bn needed for these loans. But bringing home more than $2tn in profit would cost billions in corporate taxes. So companies wait, find ways to park their funds overseas and hope for an unlikely tax holiday as their \xe2\x80\x9cproblem\xe2\x80\x9d grows. Just last year, these idle overseas amounts grew 11.8%.\n> \n> Some companies have enough in overseas billions \xe2\x80\x93 take Apple\xe2\x80\x99s $138bn, GE\xe2\x80\x99s $110bn, Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s $93bn, IBM\xe2\x80\x99s $52bn, Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s $48bn and Google\xe2\x80\x99s $48bn \xc2\xad\xe2\x80\x93 that just one of them could take on the whole job singlehandedly. Another lender could jump in to finance bigger systems for households or villages, or to fund renewable replacements for the sooty biomass that 2.5 billion people now use for heating and cooking (resulting in approximately 1.5 million deaths from fumes and smoke annually).\n> \n> A corporate pioneer could create a giant working capital fund, move quickly with pilot projects and experienced local partners, then get big fast with savvy international intermediaries. Sure, there are investment obstacles today. But there are also smart people \xc2\xad\xe2\x80\x93 CEOs, CFOs, sustainability teams and others \xe2\x80\x93 who could certainly identify and hurdle these barriers for a first-mover advantage on an opportunity of this size.\n> \n> Investments would be loans, and investments in promising commercial ventures, not philanthropy, and a successful program could set margins to yield competitive returns.\n> \n> Unlike microfinance for individuals, working capital funds would go to companies \xe2\x80\x93 experienced manufacturers and vendors \xe2\x80\x93 that would supply the systems. With this funding, these companies could grow manufacturing, education and marketing efforts, sales and collections.\n> \n> Cellphone-enabled pay-as-you-go technologies that provide validation codes when installment payments are received reduce the risk of nonpayment to the companies. And these systems stop working if they are stolen or if their electricity is diverted, further reducing the risk.\n> \n> The world would applaud any company that enabled a billion people in villages and rural areas to get light and connectivity, stop spending $36bn a year on kerosene and join the global economy.\n> \n> This move would represent a groundbreaking, successful and profitable response \xe2\x80\x93 well beyond business as usual \xe2\x80\x93 to both inequality and climate change. It would quickly improve global living standards while slashing greenhouse gases and black carbon. \n> \n> Which company will step up to put its cash to good use, take a big bite out of fossil fuels and light up the world?\n> \n> Daniel M Kammen, a physicist, is the director of the University of California at Berkeley\xe2\x80\x99s Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory. He directed the World Bank\xe2\x80\x99s renewable energy and energy efficiency programs from 2010 to 2011, and has been a contributing lead author for the UN\xe2\x80\x99s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for the past 15 years.\n> \n> Felix Kramer is an entrepreneur, climate activist, cleantech advisor and investor.
