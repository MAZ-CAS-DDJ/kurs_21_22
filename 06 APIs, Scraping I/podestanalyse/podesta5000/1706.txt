When you add it to the 10% who are still processing this issue and maybe waiting if there is more too it then it shows this is a pretty big chunk of voters.  Winning over those 10% becomes our challenge.  If there is no new twist to the story naturally we probably win them over on other issues \n\nJohn Anzalone\nAnzalone Liszt Grove Research\n334-387-3121.

Another 10% are still trying to sort it out.  We will keep it up for a couple of days to see if we see any movement.  Interestingly enough 7% is about the number who "volunteered" the email controversy in our nationwide polls as something that bothers or concerns them about HRC.\n>>> \n>>> Raw results are below but we will be getting some crosstabs later.\n>>> \n>>> John Anzalone\n>>> Anzalone Liszt Grove Research\n>>> 334-387-3121\n>>> \n>>> PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS: john@ALGpolling.com\n>>> www.ALGpolling.com\n>>> \n>>> twitter: @AnzaloneLiszt\n>>> \n>>> \n>>>> \n>>>> \n>>>> Here you go. 70% of Dems said the issue is being blown out of proportion, 15% said they haven\'t made up their mind yet, and 5% weren\'t familiar with the issue.
