john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\n\nWe know you\'re getting quite a few emails from us lately. Ok, a whole lot of emails.\n\nThey usually go like this: "SuperPACs! Rove! Deadlines!"\n\nSo let us step back from the rhetoric.\n\nBrad takes pride in fighting for the issues you care about most -- from growing our economy, to protecting our environment, to helping women earn equal pay for equal work.\n\nHe wants to keep fighting for Illinois -- for you. But outside groups and right-wing special interests are gearing up to spend an unprecedented amount of money to try and defeat us.\n\nNext week we have a critical FEC fundraising deadline. And so far, we\'ve been neck and neck with Republican Bob Dold every step of the way.\n\nTo pull ahead, we must have a strong showing.\n\nJohn, this is Brad\'s first reelection campaign. If you\'re able, please make a donation to help us keep fighting for Illinois.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/schneidersep2014?refcode=em_FR_2014.09.26_b1_sfc_all&amp;amount=25&amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=DC&amp;zip=20016&amp;phone=2162818851&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=&amp;recur_weekly=true\n\nTogether, we will be successful.\n\nThanks,\n\nSchneider for Congress----\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.\n\nTo unsubscribe, go to: \n  http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/unsubscribe\n\n'
