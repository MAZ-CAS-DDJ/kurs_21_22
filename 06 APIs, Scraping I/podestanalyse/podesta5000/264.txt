johnpodesta@gmail.comb'\nJoe...\n\nWonderful seeing you and the family again. I was pleased to see you looking so good. I was most appreciative of all Joan did in the preparation of the hors d\xe2\x80\x99oeuvres and that wonderful apple tart for desert after dinner. She went to a lot of effort. Please thank her for me.\n\nPer our conversation, I am attaching a \xe2\x80\x9cTeaser\xe2\x80\x9d I prepared with Valerie Red-Horse (our financial advisor) which has been and is still being sent to a variety of potential investors for my Resort Ship Project. It gives one a quick look at the scope of the Project. If they are interested, we give them access to a \xe2\x80\x9cDrop Box\xe2\x80\x9d we have set up that contains the Business Plan and other pieces of confidential information. I thought you would find this huge potential money-maker interesting...it is keeping me young...!!!  Make sure your tuxedo is ready for the opening night party two years hence...!!!\n\nDinner was fun with everyone We will have to do it again soon. Please stay positive and do everything the doctors suggest. You are a good man and God will watch over you. When you get down, feel free to call me. As I think you know, I can always think of something positive to share with you.\n\nRegards to all with a special thanks to Joan for being such a gracious hostess.\n\nLove...\n\nYour friend...George\n\n\n\nGeorge S.
