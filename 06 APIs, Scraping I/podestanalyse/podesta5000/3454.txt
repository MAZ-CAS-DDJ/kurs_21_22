His ISIS warnings based on our present U.S. STRATEGIES resonated . He stressed the need to partner with moderate Islam to defeat ISIS. He constantly debated that we must take the fight  to Syria and Iraq with 20000 troops along with our Sunni Allies [Turks; Kurds] while establishing a no fly zone.  He HAS A PLAN BASED ON YEARS OF EXPERIENCE  WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH HIM OR NOT .  \nOTHER REPUBLICAN WINNERS :\n1}Donald Trump ,he was not taken down  even though he has no strategy in dealing with not only ISIS but Putin and his Iranian compatriots while keeping the killer Assad in power. He is the master of soundbites. Jeb got it right The Donald is totally educated by cable -t.v. He is always the smartest guy in the room. He is real and the Republican candidate to beat.\n2}Jeb Bush, he took on Trump`s lack of foreign policy experience and questioned his leadership. He finally showed some emotion and passion. May be too little too late.\n3} Carley Fiorina ,she was deliberate in her analysis . She knew the name of foreign leaders based on her personal experiences as a CEO OF HEWLETT -PACKER. He is an attack personality ,no nonsense , private sector media executive who will prove to be an important vice-presidential attack candidate for the Republican nominee.\n4} Chris Christie , he was effective during his limited sound bites. His critique of both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz , minimized their future effectiveness. Donald Trump owes him.\n\nTHE DEMOCRATS:  HILLARY`S EARLIER FOREIGN POLICY NARRATIVE DEFINED HER LEADERSHIP VS. THIS INEXPERIENCED GROUP OF WANNABEES.\nHILLARY is not running for a 3 rd term for either her husband or President Obama . She is running on her own foreign experiences and intellect .  In terms of the Middle -East ,ISIS IN PARTICULAR, Hillary stated the establishment of the NO-FLY ZONE  in Northern Syria , along with aggressive bombing known ISIS STRONGHOLDS  , special forces troops on the ground in conjunction with our Muslim Sunni partners , disruption of the isis social media recruitment network, and identifying ISIS killers who are already radicalized here at home , makes Hillary a war-time President. Hillary understands that ISIS is a varsity team that is both well-funded and has a destructive caliphate plan to destroy western civilization.\n Who best protects the values that have made U.S. the greatest nation in the world? Personally, I look forward to the billion person watch of a Hillary -Donald debate ,one on one. Keep in mind , who knows the names and has the experience and insights in dealing with  say the likes Putin ,Isis, Iran.[ who happen to respect Hillary`s strength, resolve,  and intellect]. We are in this miss up to our eye-balls. Our country is greatly divided and quite frankly insecure from both an economic as well as an homeland security perspective. Hillary Clinton shines in her leadership and confidence. It is not about party loyalty, it`s about the  personal and financial security of your families. It`s not about rhetoric but respected experience. No more San Bernardino's; no more Paris`. We are at war like none other with a determined Radicalized Jihadist Sect of Muslim ...Our moderate Muslim  FAMILIES  worldwide and they are in the billions, will work to destroy ISIS  ,as they continue to speak out. ISIS KILLS MORE Muslims than any other religious group in order to enforce their caliphate. ......MERRY CHRISTMAS, HAPPY NEW YEAR , AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS..PEACE ON EARTH WILL BE A GOAL LIKE NEVER BEFORE.  MAY GOD GIVE US THE FORTITUDE.\n\t\n"
