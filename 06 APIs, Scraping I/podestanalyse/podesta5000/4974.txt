This year, we have advanced to the "finalist" category, in the area of economic opportunity, which puts us in the top 21 schools in the country (5 at the Presidential level, 16 at the Finalist level).  As you know, this is an award that is immensely gratifying to me, personally, and I am delighted to see the good work of our faculty, staff and students recognized in this way.  I think our founders would be pleased to see that the college and the city they brought into being are continuing their partnership over 175 years later....\n> \n> Best,\n> \n> Teresa\n> \n> -- \n> TERESA AMOTT\n> President\n> \n> Knox College\n> 309-341-7211  |  Fax: 309-341-7856\n> www.knox.edu\n> \n> \n> To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to trustees-user+unsubscribe@knox.edu.\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to trustees-user+unsubscribe@knox.edu.\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to trustees-user+unsubscribe@knox.edu.\n'
