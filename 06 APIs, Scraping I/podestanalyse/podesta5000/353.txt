The lyrics tell the story of a woman\'s response to domestic\nabuse from the point of view of her daughter.\n\n"The fact that the McCain/Palin campaign is using a song about an abused\nwoman as a rallying cry for their Vice Presidential candidate, a woman who\nwould ban abortion even in cases of rape and incest, is beyond irony,"\nPeters says. "They are co-opting the song, completely overlooking the\ncontext and message, and using it to promote a candidate who would set\nwomen\'s rights back decades. I\'ve decided to donate the royalties from\n\'Independence Day\' during this election cycle to Planned Parenthood, in\nSarah Palin\'s name. I hope with the additional income provided by the\nMcCain/Palin campaign, Planned Parenthood will be able to help many more\nwomen in need."\n\nTo join Gretchen in donating to Planned Parenthood on behalf of Sarah Palin\nlog on to:\nhttps://secure.ga0.org/02/pp10000_inhonor\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
