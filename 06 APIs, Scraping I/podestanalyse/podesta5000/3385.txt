(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)\nTHE BIG IDEA:\n&#8212;\xc2\xa0Donald Trump fares better in online and automated polls than in more traditional surveys conducted by live callers. A slight but statistically-significant gulf has stubbornly persisted over the six months since the billionaire Republican upended the race for the White House.\nDartmouth political scientist Kyle Dropp thinks \xe2\x80\x9csocial desirability bias\xe2\x80\x9d is at play. In other words, people are afraid to tell another human being that they support the Republican because, even though they like him, they know about his controversial statements and do not want to be judged negatively.\nThis has happened before. Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, for example, both underperformed in the polls when they were running for governor of California because a certain segment of the electorate did not want to publicly support an actor. (Reagan is viewed very differently today than he was in 1966.)\nDropp, the executive director of polling for Morning Consult, conducted a controlled study last week to explore which kinds of Republicans and right-leaning independents respond differently to an automated call, an internet survey and a real person on the other end of the line.\nOverall, Trump pulled 38 percent in the internet poll and 32 percent in the live-caller poll. Jeb Bush, in contrast, garnered the same percentage online as on the phone. Most of the difference can be chalked up to education and engagement.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmong adults with a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree or postgraduate degree, Trump performs about 10 percentage points better online than via live telephone,\xe2\x80\x9d Dropp writes this morning\xc2\xa0on the Consult. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, among adults with some college, Trump performs more than 10 percentage points better online. Conversely, Republicans with a high school education or less favored Trump on the phone over online.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was also a split between engaged voters\xe2\x80\x94people who say they are very interested in the election, or have previously voted in primaries or midterms\xe2\x80\x94and the general registered voter population,\xe2\x80\x9d he continues. \xe2\x80\x9cTrump\xe2\x80\x99s advantage in online polls compared with live telephone polling has a spread of eight to nine percentage points among these engaged voters.\xe2\x80\x9d (See the methodology here.)\n&#8212; Generally, Trump performs much better among those who are less educated and less informed. These blue-collar voters, like everyone else, are likely to have friends with similar backgrounds and views. Because support for Trump is widespread, there is less of a social stigma in backing him. Indeed, it may be a badge of honor.\nInterestingly, Ben Carson tends to perform better in live-caller polls than in online polls. Social scientists believe this might be explained by Republicans who are eager to demonstrate, when speaking to another person on the phone, that they can support an African-American candidate for president. But they perhaps don\xe2\x80\x99t feel pressure to do that when they perceive that their response will\xc2\xa0be more anonymous.\nThe Post\xe2\x80\x99s in-house polling guru, Scott Clement, said other explanations should be considered for the divergence in Trump&#8217;s numbers, \xe2\x80\x9csuch as different ways respondents hear and read response options or the level of effort respondents give to answering questions with a live interviewer providing motivation vs. an automated or web survey.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe big question is which mode is \xe2\x80\x98correct,\xe2\x80\x99 or better reflects respondents&#8217; true support,\xe2\x80\x9d Clement emails.\nA Trump spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.\n&#8212; This is a global trend: Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, says that anti-immigration, working-class parties in Europe also do better in online polls than live-caller ones. \xe2\x80\x9cSupport for immigration and globalization are perhaps the only political sentiments that unite elites from both business and the academy, from right and left,\xe2\x80\x9d Olsen wrote in The Atlantic\xc2\xa0recently. \xe2\x80\x9cOpenly supporting an anti-immigration candidate can risk social opprobrium, ridicule, or worse. In other words, for every group of vocal Trump supporters, there are probably a lot more who just don\xe2\x80\x99t advertise it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n&#8212; Not picked up in any of the forms of polling: Trump\xe2\x80\x99s lagging organization. \xe2\x80\x9cA successful ground game is crucial in Iowa because of the state\xe2\x80\x99s complicated method of caucus voting, but the Trump campaign has lagged in reaching some of its own benchmarks,\xe2\x80\x9d the New York Times\xe2\x80\x99 Trip Gabriel reports. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Iowa director predicted that he would recruit a leader for each of the state\xe2\x80\x99s 1,681 Republican precincts by Thanksgiving. Instead, the first major training session for precinct leaders, heavily promoted in emails and conference calls, drew only about 80 people to West Des Moines last weekend, with about 50 participating online. \xe2\x80\xa6 Mr. Trump has about 15 paid Iowa staff members, compared with 36 working for a \xe2\x80\x98super PAC\xe2\x80\x99 supporting Ben Carson that is organizing in his behalf in Iowa.\xe2\x80\x9d Before the 2008 caucuses, Barack Obama had over 200 paid staff members in more than 60 offices across Iowa.\xc2\xa0Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s John McCormick reports from Iowa this morning that Trump supporters may need less guidance on how to caucus than widely assumed.\n&#8212; The narrative \xe2\x80\x93 Evangelical elites coalescing behind Cruz over Rubio: Tom Hamburger scoops details of a post-Christmas retreat for Cruz with more than 100 evangelical leaders flying in to Cisco, Texas, on Dec. 28. The event includes a rally and concert but also hours of closed-door visiting time for Cruz with leading religious broadcasters, megachurch ministers and pastors from early states. The Cisco fly-in is one of three carefully-planned meetings that are already boosting Cruz with a critical constituency that he believes can make the difference for him in Iowa, South Carolina and the majority of the states voting and caucusing on Super Tuesday The Texas senator won the backing of a key evangelical coalition after a secret Dec. 7 meeting in which top national activists agreed to roll out a stream of endorsements, many timed for maximum impact between now and March 1.\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n&#8212;\xc2\xa0A car plowed into pedestrians on the sidewalk on the Las Vegas Strip last night, killing one person and injuring 37 people, six critically.\xc2\xa0The Review-Journal reports\xc2\xa0that a woman &#8212; in her 20&#8217;s, apparently from Oregon and driving a\xc2\xa01996 Oldsmobile &#8212; was arrested shortly after the crash after fleeing the scene. The deputy police chief said terrorism has been ruled out,\xc2\xa0but that the crash is being investigated as intentional. &#8220;Police are getting a warrant for a blood test, but (they said) she wasn&#8217;t exhibiting extreme impairment,&#8221; the R-J relays. &#8220;A 3-year-old toddler in the car with the driver was unharmed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n&#8212; Miss Universe host Steve Harvey announced Miss Colombia as the pageant&#8217;s winner, but it was actually Miss Philippines.\xc2\xa0It led\xc2\xa0to a bizarre ending where Miss Colombia had to take off the crown after she thought she won. The screw-up is\xc2\xa0a weird sort of vindication for Trump, who sold control of the pageant after NBC and Univision cut ties with him in June.\nWatch the looks on everyone&#8217;s faces in this 90-second video:\n(YouTube)\nTrump took advantage of the moment:\n\n&#8220;@Themyamccurry: Where&#8217;s @realDonaldTrump when you need em? #MissUniverse2015&#8220;\n\xe2\x80\x94 Donald J.

(Nicki Kohl/Telegraph Herald via AP)\n&#8212; &#8220;Smart strategy or overconfidence? Rubio plays hard-to-get with voters,&#8221; by Sean Sullivan and Karen Tumulty: &#8220;Marco \xc2\xadRubio no doubt wants to sit behind the big desk in the Oval Office. What is not so clear is how hard he is willing to work to get there.\xc2\xa0Republican activists \xe2\x80\x94 including many who appreciate Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s formidable political gifts and view him as the party\xe2\x80\x99s best hope for beating Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 say they are alarmed at his seeming disdain for the day-to-day grind of retail politics. Even some staunch supporters are anxious. &#8216;Rubio has not put in the face time that he really needs to have, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think,&#8217; said Al Phillips, an influential South Carolina pastor who backs Rubio. &#8216;I think that\xe2\x80\x99s been somewhat to his detriment.&#8217;\xc2\xa0That may be, as some of his allies fret privately, a sign of overconfidence in his own abilities&#8230; &#8220;Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s relative indifference toward wooing key activists contrasts with his eagerness to land top donors.

Rather than leave behind lives of crime, some adherents are using their illicit talents to finance recruiting rings and travel costs for foreign fighters even as their backgrounds give them potentially easier access to cash and weapons, posing a new kind of challenge to European authorities. &#8230;\xc2\xa0The picture now emerging of the Islamic State\xe2\x80\x99s machinations in Europe is distinct from the development of al-Qaeda, which relied heavily in its early years on ostensibly pious recruits and wealthy foreign sponsors.&#8221;\nBig setback for Big Oil &#8211;&gt; &#8220;As decision nears, opposition builds to offshore drilling along Atlantic Coast,&#8221; by Joby Warrick in Virginia Beach:\xc2\xa0&#8220;When then-Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) first pushed the idea in 2010, it was easy to find Virginians who favored oil and gas drilling along the Virginia coast, even in this tourism-dependent city of 450,000. The city council voted 8 to 3 that year in support of the giant offshore rigs, betting, along with the mayor, that &#8216;there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be money made.&#8217;\xc2\xa0But that was before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and before oil prices began their historic slide. At its December meeting two weeks ago, the same city council abruptly reversed course, voting to rescind its 2010 resolution after some of the city\xe2\x80\x99s biggest business alliances campaigned against drilling. &#8230; &#8220;The Obama administration is expected to finalize by early spring a plan that could allow limited oil and gas development off the coasts of four Southeastern states \xe2\x80\x94Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia. All four have heavily supported drilling in the past. But lately, resistance to the plan appears to be growing, particularly in coastal towns where politicians and business leaders are expressing doubts about whether oil and gas can deliver the economic benefits the industry\xe2\x80\x99s backers claim.&#8221;\nRhode Island Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo (AP Photo/Steven Senne)\n&#8212; Rhode Island&#8217;s freshman governor is a rising star, a Democrat\xc2\xa0willing to take on Big Labor without antagonizing state\xc2\xa0employees.\xc2\xa0The Post&#8217;s editorial page editor, Fred Hiatt, today\xc2\xa0contrasts Gina Raimondo&#8217;s\xc2\xa0willingness to take on tough problems with the\xc2\xa0congressional penchant for passing the buck. Four key paragraphs:\n\n&#8220;Raimondo stands out on a number of counts: a Democrat elected in a year when even Massachusetts was choosing a Republican governor; a woman, when 44 states are led by men; perhaps oddest of all, a Democratic reformer of state pensions. During four years as state treasurer, Raimondo infuriated Rhode Island\xe2\x80\x99s public employee unions, but she nonetheless went on to win the 2014 Democratic primary for governor and the general election.&#8221;\n&#8220;After 18 months of negotiations, almost all of the unions agreed this year to a court settlement that preserves most of the reform. And Raimondo\xe2\x80\x99s first budget directed much of the savings (about $300\xe2\x80\x89million per year) to programs that will help the next generation, including more prekindergarten classes, school construction and a scholarship fund for community college students.&#8221;\n&#8220;Raimondo, who is backing Hillary Clinton for president, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t try to sell voters on fiscal responsibility for its own sake. She says she wants the Democratic Party to be the party of growth and innovation, to be pro-business and pro-government.&#8221;\n&#8220;Rhode Island is tiny (just over 1 million people), and maybe politics that work there can\xe2\x80\x99t work on a larger stage. Still, you can\xe2\x80\x99t help wishing that a bit of her philosophy might rub off on Washington: &#8216;Don\xe2\x80\x99t ignore big problems,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t try to pretend that problems are smaller than they are.'&#8221;\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n&#8211;Pictures of the day:\nPost sportswriter Dan Steinberg chided Redskins general manager Scot McCloughan &#8220;for being so damn buttoned up all the time.&#8221; McCloughan was celebrating the Redskins 35-25 victory over the Buffalo Bills:\n(@dansteinberg)\nMississippi Sen.

And in the throes of a seven-day, 12-city swing to demonstrate strength beyond the early-voting states, Mr. Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s flattery seems at times to have taken a new form: imitation.\xc2\xa0In ways cosmetic and substantive, Mr. Cruz has in recent days seemed to more closely resemble the man he has been chasing \xe2\x80\x94 or, more precisely, quietly drafting behind \xe2\x80\x94 for months. &#8230; \xc2\xa0Perhaps most notably, Mr. Cruz has sharpened his already uncompromising language, eager to retain his own hold on popular anger against the political class, and to demonstrate conservative purity amid attacks from Rubio over immigration and national security policies.\xc2\xa0He has coined a new phrase, &#8216;undocumented Democrats,&#8217; to describe those in the country illegally, and beefed up sections of his stump speech focused on immigration.&#8221;\n&#8212; New York Times, &#8220;Hospitality and gambling interests delay closing of billion-dollar tax loophole,&#8221; by Eric Lipton and Liz Moyer: &#8220;In the span of a mere 11 days this month, $1 billion in future federal tax payments vanished.\xc2\xa0As congressional leaders were hastily braiding together a tax and spending bill of more than 2,000 pages, lobbyists swooped in to add 54 words that temporarily preserved a loophole sought by the hotel, restaurant and gambling industries, along with billionaire Wall Street investors, that allowed them to put real estate in trusts and avoid taxes.\xc2\xa0They won support from the top Senate Democrat, Harry Reid of Nevada, who responded to appeals from executives of casino companies, politically powerful players and huge employers in his state. And the lobbyists even helped draft the crucial language.\xc2\xa0The small changes, and the enormous windfall they generated, show the power of connected corporate lobbyists to alter a huge bill that is being put together with little time for lawmakers to consider. Throughout the legislation, there were thousands of other add-ons and hard to decipher tax changes.&#8221;\n&#8212; Politico, &#8220;Sanders data controversy spotlights powerful gatekeeper,&#8221; by Nancy Scola:\xc2\xa0&#8220;At the heart of the Bernie Sanders data mess is a firm that functions as the digital plumbing of the Democratic Party: NGP VAN. Democrats are nearly wholly dependent on it, which is why the breach \xe2\x80\x94 the company says it\xe2\x80\x99s the first in its nearly 20-year history \xe2\x80\x94 and the Sanders campaign\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent cutoff from the system is so rattling the party.\xc2\xa0While Sanders may have defused the flap by apologizing to Clinton during Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s debate &#8230;\xc2\xa0the extent of the damage done to both campaigns isn\xe2\x80\x99t yet clear. If nothing else, it\xe2\x80\x99s reminded Democrats of the risks of leaning so heavily on one private company to provide its technology infrastructure.\xc2\xa0How such an unsexy suite of software with an impenetrably acronymed name became both the fulcrum and the soul of Democratic politics \xe2\x80\x94 &#8216;I [heart] the VAN&#8217; stickers are everywhere at gatherings of progressive field operatives \xe2\x80\x94 is a story of first-mover advantage and persistence.&#8221;\nHOT ON THE LEFT\nFox News confronts Carly Fiorina for a made-up story\xc2\xa0about a military general.\xc2\xa0From Talking Points Memo: &#8220;Chris Wallace grilled Fiorina (for saying) that Gen. Jack Keane &#8216;retired early&#8217; after a quarrel with President Obama. Keane himself appeared on Fox News and denied Fiorina&#8217;s claim.\xc2\xa0On Sunday, Wallace asked her about it. &#8216;But then there&#8217;s Keane who never served in the Obama administration, Wallace said. &#8216;Says he&#8217;s never spoken to Barack Obama. Weren&#8217;t you just flat wrong about that?&#8217; &#8216;Well, I was wrong about Keane, yes. He is the exception that proves the rule,&#8217; Fiorina said.&#8221;\nHOT ON THE RIGHT\nChristie calls Jeb a hypocrite for insulting Trump.\xc2\xa0From the Washington Examiner: While campaigning Sunday in New Hampshire, Christie criticized Bush for calling Trump a &#8220;jerk&#8221; after Bush told Trump at last week&#8217;s debate that he couldn&#8217;t &#8220;insult his way to the presidency.&#8221;\nDAYBOOK:\n&#8212; What&#8217;s happening today on the campaign trail: Christie will make three stops in New Hampshire, and will hold a town hall in New London at 6 p.m. Ben Carson will attend a business tour in Manchester and a Christmas celebration in Concord.\xc2\xa0Bernie Sanders is holding a town hall meeting in Sioux City, Iowa, at 7 p.m. Central.
