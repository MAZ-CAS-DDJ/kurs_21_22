Some of them were temporary  census jobs.  But the bulk \x96  including the \nloss of 26,000 teachers \x96 came from layoffs caused by the fiscal  crunch of \nstate and local governments.  State and local governments cut jobs at the \nfastest rate in almost 30  years.  The loss in jobs would have  been even more \nmassive if Democrats in Congress had not passed a bill to aid  state and \nlocal government before they adjourned for the August recess.  That bill was \npassed over virtually  unanimous Republican opposition. \nThe Republicans have traditionally offered four major elixirs as their  \nprescriptions for economic growth: \n1) Cut taxes \x96 especially for the  wealthy.  In fact, of course,  tax \nbreaks for the rich are mainly about giving more money to the Republicans\x92  major \nconstituency \x96 the wealthiest of our citizens.  The fig leaf they have used \nto cover  this self-serving policy used to be described as \x93supply-side\x94 \neconomics: the  idea that if you give the wealthy and big corporations more \nmoney they will  automatically invest it in new economic ventures that \ngenerate jobs.   \nOf course this proposition completely ignores actual economic  history.  \nThe Bush tax cut policy  was in place for much of the last decade.  But his \nadministration created net increase of zero new private sector  jobs \x96 zero.   \nIn fact, of course, it is still in  place today \x96 due to expire at the end \nof the year, unless Republicans have  their way \x96 and it has done absolutely \nnothing to create new jobs.  In fact, just the  opposite. \nRight now, corporations and the rich are rolling in cash.  Why don\x92t they \ninvest it, expand  capacity and create jobs growth?  Simple.  There is not \nenough  demand.  To have economic demand you  need consumers who want to spend \nmoney.  But tax cuts for the rich have just turbo charged the overall \ntendency of  our economy \x96 and especially the overgrown financial sector \x96 to \nconcentrate  more and more money in the hands of the top 2%.  And that means \nthere is less and less  for ordinary people to spend on goods and services \nand not enough demand to  entice all of those corporations to expand and hire \nmore workers, which in turn  further depresses demand. \nAnd what is even worse, tax cuts for the wealthy deprive the government  of \nfunds that it can use to jumpstart demand and end this vicious cycle -- \nwhich  leads me to prescription number two. \n2). Cut government  spending.  It should be lost on  no one that the \nproximate cause of the reduction in employment last month was  layoffs by state \nand local governments. Much of the fiscal pressure on state and  local \ngovernment came from the end of funding from the original federal stimulus  bill \nwhich was opposed by most Republicans.  Of course the Republicans also worked  \nlong and hard to stall the additional $22 billion aid package for state and \n local governments that finally passed Congress in August. And they assured \nthat  the package proposed by Democrats was cut in half before it could get \nthe 60  votes needed to get out of the Senate.   \nIn fact, cutting  government spending before the private sector has \nachieved sustained job growth  is a recipe for economic disaster.  \nLong-term structural federal deficits that are too large in relation to  \nthe total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) can in fact create a drag on long-term  \neconomic growth.  They can create  upward pressure on interest rates that \ncan choke economic activity. And by  over-stimulating the economy they can \nalso cause inflation. \nBut that is not our problem today.  Just the opposite.  Interest  rates in \ngeneral are at their lowest in decades \x96 as are the interest rates for  \ngovernment debt. And the problem today is not inflation in our currency, but the \n much more pernicious problem of potential deflation. \nIn this situation, the Republican argument that cutting government  \nspending will help create jobs is kind of like a doctor telling you that the  \nsolution to your anorexia is to go on a diet and get more exercise.   \n3). Cut back on the regulation of  corporate behavior.  That  certainly \nworked well during the Bush years.  Pretty much everyone acknowledges that  the \nderegulation of the financial sector was mainly responsible for the \nreckless  behavior of the big Wall Street banks that threw the economy into free \nfall and  cost eight million Americans their jobs late in 2008.  Republican \nproposals to allow Wall Street  and other big corporations to resume their \norgy of recklessness and greed are a  recipe for another major financial \ncollapse \x96 not long-term economic  growth. \n4). Use monetary, instead of  fiscal, policy to increase the money supply \nand lower interest rates.  Republican economists of the  Monetarist School \nthat was once headed by University of Chicago right wing icon Milton Friedman  \nhave contended for years that the perils of the business cycle could be \ndampened  virtually entirely by using monetary policy.  So, the argument goes, \nyou don\x92t have to  use fiscal policy \x96 the spending of government \x96 to \nrestore economic  health.   \nThe problem is that while the Fed has the ability to make important  \nmid-range course corrections in the direction of the economy, monetary policy  has \nshown itself incapable of dealing with an economic catastrophe of the  \nmagnitude that happened in the fall of 2008.  The Fed has exhausted virtually \nall of  the tools of monetary policy and the economy is still barely creating \nnew  jobs.  Interest rates have been  lowered about as far as they can go.  \nThe Fed has massively expanded the money supply.  It probably can take \nadditional steps to  make credit more available, but no one thinks that monetary \npolicy by itself can  turbo charge employment growth. \nIn other words then, every one of the four major Republican prescriptions  \nfor economic growth has demonstrated itself to be ineffective \x96 or downright \n poisonous \x96 in the real world of today\x92s real economy.  \nBut Republicans continue to bray on about the need to cut taxes, cut  \nspending and cut regulation as if it were not as plain as the nose on your face  \nthat these proposals have proven themselves utter failures.  \nSo why haven\x92t the Democratic  policies of President Obama been able to \nrestore employment to its pre-recession  levels?  The answer is simple: not  \nenough of a good thing. \nFirst and foremost, those policies did in fact prevent another Great  \nDepression.  They brought the  economy out of a death spiral.  The  non-partisan \nCongressional Budget Office and most other mainstream economists  agree that \nthe first stimulus will in fact create or prevent the loss of 3.5  million \njobs.  Had it not been  passed the job losses caused by the financial \ncollapse would have increased by  50%.  \nIn fact, even a cursory look at the numbers \x96 and the economic trend  lines \n\x96 before and after President Obama took office, shows a stark contrast  \nbetween the Bush and Obama eras.  \nPrivate sector job losses  increased steadily from February, 2008 until \nJanuary, 2009.  In October, 2008 over 700,000 jobs were  lost.  In December, \n2008, 680,000  jobs were lost, and job losses peaked at almost 800,000 in \nJanuary, 2009.  \nThe month after President Obama took office private sector job losses  \nsteadily began to shrink \x96 accelerated by passage of the stimulus bill in March, \n 2009.  Private sector job growth  turned positive in October 2009, dropped \ninto negative territory again in  November and it has been positive ever \nsince.  \nManufacturing job losses accelerated steadily from December, 2007 until  \nthey peaked at 280,000 jobs lost in the last month of the Bush Presidency,  \nJanuary, 2009.  Since then they  steadily declined and for the last seven \nmonths the economy has actually created  over 180,000 new manufacturing jobs \x96 \nowing both to the stimulus bill and the  auto industry rescue plan that were \nboth assailed by the  Republicans. \nRetail sales dropped precipitously from $373 billion in August, 2008  until \nit bottomed out at $335 million in December 2008.  Since President Obama\x92s \ntook office, it  has increased steadily back into the range of $365 billion. \nGDP growth went from a negative  4.0% in the third quarter of 2008 to a \nnegative 6.8% in the fourth quarter of  2008.  Then the losses began to  abate \nafter President Obama took office and dropped to a negative .7% in the  \nsecond quarter of 2009 after the stimulus bill was passed. It has been in  \npositive territory ever since. \nOver $17.5 trillion of household wealth was wiped out from the third  \nquarter of 2007 until the first quarter of 2009.  Then after the stimulus bill \nwas passed  it began to rebound.  Households  have now regained 35% of the \nwealth lost in the last two years of the Bush  Administration \x96 a gain of \nalmost $6 trillion. \nWe still have an enormous way to go to achieve sustained long term  \neconomic growth, but let\x92s remember that in 2008 the economy fell into the  deepest \nrecession it has faced in 60 years.  The last time Republican policies led \nus  to such a downturn in the early 1930s, it took the public sector \nspending of  World War II to return the country to sustained economic growth.  \nRoosevelt, of course, was not lucky enough to have the  benefit of the economic \nhistory he himself would write.  He experimented with substantial economic  \nstimulus \x96 but not nearly enough to get the economy into a self-sustaining \ncycle  of long-term growth.  In fact, in  1938, he was convinced by his own \ndeficit hawks to decrease spending and the  result was a new downturn in \nemployment and a shrinking GDP.  Roosevelt was not able to muster the  country\x92s \npolitical will to apply the massive amounts of governmental stimulus  \nnecessary until Emperor Hirohito made it a matter of national survival by  \nattacking Pearl Harbor.   \nDuring World War II the  public sector not only powered the beginning of a \ncycle of sustained economic  growth, it did so while tax rates on the rich \nwere near confiscatory levels \x96  91%.  So much for the dampening  effects of \ntaxes on the wealthy.  These expansionary policies began a period of \nsustained economic growth  that would last 40 years and create the modern American \nmiddle class.  \nI\x92m a pilot.  To make an  airplane fly, you have to get it up to a critical \nspeed that allows the lift  created by the wing to offset the force of \ngravity.  Once you achieve that velocity, the  plane can rotate off the runway \nand fly away.  But if it never achieves that speed, it  will never take off.  \n \nThe same is true with sustained economic growth.  Until the economic growth \nachieves a  velocity adequate to assure that jobs are being created faster \nthan natural  population growth; until enough wages are flowing into the \npockets of ordinary  consumers to allow them to start spending at a pace where \nbusinesses will invest  and expand employment, the economy will keep rolling \ndown the runway, but never  take off. \nThe only force powerful enough to get the economy to takeoff speed is  \ngovernment stimulus.  \nIn an airplane you never reduce power until you achieve that critical  \nvelocity needed to take off.  The  same should be true with the economy.  If you \nwant the economy to pick up enough speed to achieve  self-sustaining \ngrowth, you keep revving up the engine of fiscal stimulus until  it lifts in the \nair.  Then \x96 and  only then \x96 can you begin to back off on the power. \nIn early 2009 America needed a much larger economic  stimulus that the \nRepublicans \x96 and some deficit hawk Democrats \x96 would allow  Congress to pass. \nTo get 60 votes in the Senate, conservative Democrat Ben  Nelson and \nRepublican Susan Collins insisted that the stimulus bill be  substantially reduced \nin size.  And  the threats of the deficit hawks had already convinced the \nAdministration to  reduce their stimulus proposal to levels well below what \nmany Administration  economists believed were necessary.  But the \nAdministration needed to pass some stimulus and to their credit,  they did.  Now we need \n more. \nLet\x92s be clear.  The reason  we needed \x96 and still need \x96 such a large \namount of stimulus is that the Bush  economic policy had driven us into the \ndeepest economic ditch since the Great  Depression.  We need a lot of  economic \nfirepower to get us out of that ditch \x96 more than has been necessary in  60 \nyears. \nSo to escape a period of long-term  economic stagnation, we need an major \nshot of additional stimulus now.  But we will never get it \x96 at least in  the \nnear term \x96 if Republicans take control of one of the houses of Congress.  \nInstead we will get Republican prescriptions for the economy that are not  \njust worthless -- but toxic.  We  will get policies that will endanger our \nchildren\x92s futures and our competitive  position in the world.  \nRobert Creamer is  a long-time political organizer and strategist, and \nauthor of the recent  book:  Stand Up Straight: How  Progressives Can Win, \navailable on _Amazon.com._ \n(http://www.amazon.com/Listen-Your-Mother-Straight-Progressives/dp/0979585295/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1213241439&sr=8-1\n)  \n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
