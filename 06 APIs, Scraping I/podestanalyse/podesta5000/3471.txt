Details are being\nworked out about dates and venues.\n\nThe most likely stops would be key Democratic turnout counties, with the\nheaviest probability being Charleston, Columbia, Orangeburg or other sites\nthat are part of the state\xe2\x80\x99s traditional Democratic voting bloc.\n\nSouth Carolina state director Clay Middleton said no area is off the table\nin terms of where she may stop for her first appearance in seven years.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re expanding where she will go for her first visit here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re making sure she is able to connect with everyday Americans as she\nhas in the other states.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nClinton, who announced her 2016 campaign about 10 days ago, has already\nvisited Iowa, site of the leadoff caucus. She is in New Hampshire this\nweek, which holds the leadoff primary in January.\n\nThe South Carolina stop also represents a return to where her 2008\npresidential ambitions were dealt a major setback, after Barack Obama\ntrounced her with a stunning ground game fed by a huge turnout among black\nvoters and the young.\n\nObama carried the state with 55 percent of the vote in the multi-candidate\nfield, while Clinton finished a distant second, with 27 percent.\n\nObama carried every county in the state except Horry County \xe2\x80\x94 home to\nMyrtle Beach \xe2\x80\x94 which went to Clinton, and Oconee County, which went to\nformer U.S. Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, a native son born in\nSeneca.\n\nWhile Clinton is widely seen as the front-runner for the Democratic\nnomination, the campaign is not taking for granted any aspect of what\xe2\x80\x99s at\nstake. She has hired staff here and is far ahead of any potential\nchallenger in terms of collecting support.\n\nWhen she does come to South Carolina, Clinton is likely to follow the same\nformat as she has elsewhere so far by hitting smaller venues. The New\nHampshire stops have included a small campaign house party, a community\ncollege and a round-table discussion with students.\n\nWord of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s pending South Carolina visit comes as the state\nDemocratic Party will meet this weekend in Columbia for its annual\nJefferson-Jackson dinner on Friday, and also the state party convention on\nSaturday.\n\nWhile the gathering is expected to draw hundreds of activists to the\nColumbia Metropolitan Convention Center, it will also attract several\nDemocrats with similar White House ambitions, among them former Rhode\nIsland Gov. Lincoln Chafee and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley. Others\nwill be represented by surrogates including Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe,\nwho will be there for Clinton.\n\nOn Friday night, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., will deliver the keynote\naddress at the Jefferson Jackson Dinner.\n\nDemocratic Party leaders were quick to point out that while Republicans\nboast that South Carolina is their party\xe2\x80\x99s first primary in the South, it\nwill be the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 first Southern duel as well.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the \xe2\x80\x98First in the South\xe2\x80\x99 Primary for the Democratic Party, we are\nlooking forward to visits from all of the potential presidential\ncandidates, and hearing them share their vision to continue growing our\nnation\xe2\x80\x99s economy, ending inequality of all kinds, and investing in our\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s future,\xe2\x80\x9d state Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison said in\na statement promoting the convention.\n\nBoth the Democrats and the Republicans will hold their presidential\npreference primaries in February 2016. Dates have not been announced.\n\n\n--\nJosh Schwerin\nSpokesperson\nHillary for America\n@Josh Schwerin\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "HRCRapid" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n'
