As to the HRC emails, the report explicitly states that\nnone of those emails bore classification or dissemination-limitation\nmarkings.  It goes on to say that its own IC IG review of the 55,000 pages\ndetermined that at least 4 of these emails should have been classified\n\xe2\x80\x9csecret\xe2\x80\x9d on account of them containing IC information subject to such\nclassification and that a thumb drive containing these emails is presently\nin the possession of David Kendall (that would be me) at Williams &\nConnolly.  The matter has been referred to counterintelligence officials at\nState and the IC (National Counterterrorism & Security Center) and the FBI.\n\n\n\nThis appears to be the only reference to a \xe2\x80\x9creferral\xe2\x80\x9d in the notification.\n\n\n\n*David E.
