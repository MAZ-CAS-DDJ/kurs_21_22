And what's more disturbing, in the\npast 11 years, 90 percent of the people who tried have\npassed the required background check.\n\nOne piece of legislation isn't going to prevent every gun\nviolence tragedy, but closing this loophole is one step that\nCongress can take today that will go a long way toward\nmaking our communities safer.\n\nAdd your name to show your support for common-sense gun\nsafety measures, like closing this loophole:\n\nhttps://my.barackobama.com/Close-No-Fly-Loophole\n\nThe legislation to close this loophole has existed for years\nand it continues to have bipartisan support in Congress. But\nan extreme vocal minority, backed by the gun lobby, has\nprevented the kind of reform that we need.\n\nRight now, people on the No-Fly List can walk into a store\nand buy a gun. If a person suspected of terrorism is barred\nfrom boarding an airplane, that person should not be allowed\nto purchase a weapon of war.\n\nKeeping our communities, our families, and our children safe\nis a priority and a responsibility that we all have to each\nother. OFA volunteers have been urging members of Congress\nto do something about gun violence, and closing this loophole \nis one practical and urgent step they could take.\n\nAdd your name to show your support:\n\nhttps://my.barackobama.com/Close-No-Fly-Loophole\n\nThanks,\n\nJennifer\n\nJennifer Warner \nNational Organizing Director \nOrganizing for Action\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for Action\n\nContributions or gifts to Organizing for Action are not tax deductible.\n\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo update your address, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/change-address?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe from these messages, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscription\nOrganizing for Action, P.O.
