We're dedicated to doing what Democrats do best -- connecting with voters one-on-one and getting Democrats to the polls.\n\nIf you agree that having one-on-one conversations with voters is the key to Democrats winning in 2016, please...\n\nFollow us here: http://www.turnoutpac.org/\n \nIn the wake of Citizens United, we can't plan to match the Koch brothers attack ad for attack ad... or we'll just keep losing. We need to do the hard work on the ground to get Progressives and Democrats out to the polls.\n\nThanks for all that you do,\n\nHarry\n\nHarry Pascal\nProgressive Turnout Project\nCo-Founder\n\n\n\n----\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.\n\nTo unsubscribe, go to: \n  http://go.turnoutpac.org/unsubscribe\n\nPaid for by Progressive Turnout Project and not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.\n\n"
