john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\n\nCongratulations on the terrific report on Big Data. Jim Steyer spent the night with us and was over-the-moon delighted with your recommendations.\n\nThanks so much for taking the time to talk with me about Sunnylands last week. Hopefully we will continue to find exciting ways for the White House to use the facility and to partner with us on important initiatives. In view of our discussion about our missions, goals, hopes and restrictions, I thought it might be useful for me to share the attached copy of the section of the Declaration of Trust that serves as the north star for our work. The Annenbergs greatest wish was that presidents would use Sunnylands as a Camp David of the West for meetings on a range of topics, not just meetings with world leaders, where they could make progress on important issues in a beautiful, relaxed setting.\n\nPlease do continue to think about joining us for our retreat next October on ways to adapt to rising oceans.\n\nIf you ever have any ideas, requests or suggestions for Sunnylands, please let me know.\n\nBest,\n\nGeoff\n\n\nGeoffrey Cowan\nPresident, Annenberg Foundation Trust at Sunnylands\n\nUniversity Professor &\nAnnenberg Family Chair in Communication Leadership\n\n'
