The plan is to field this on\nSunday November 9th. \n\nWe'll do our best to get it to you sooner than Monday, but it will\ndepend on how much work we still need to do on the questionnaire. \n\nThanks, \n\nAna \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: tmatzzie@gmail.com [mailto:tmatzzie@gmail.com] On Behalf Of Tom\nMatzzie\nSent: Thursday, November 29, 2007 8:08 PM\nTo: Ana Iparraguirre; Andrew Baumann; Stan Greenberg; Bryan Fisher\nCc: Begala, Paul; Susan McCue; John Podesta\nSubject: draft survey\n\nHey Guys, what's the ETA on the draft survey? The thinking on delaying\nit into the field was that the campaign wants the weekend and next\nweek to review the draft. I'd like to get the draft soon so we can\nstart working on it.\n\n-Tom\n"
