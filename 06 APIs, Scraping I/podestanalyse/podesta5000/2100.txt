Will you chip in $15 for our legal defense and to\n   keep defending abortion rights?\n                                 [1]Donate Now\n\n   Dear John,\n\n   We\'ve just received a letter from anti-choice extremists threatening to\n   sue NARAL Pro-Choice America unless we shut down our campaign to expose\n   anti-choice "crisis pregnancy centers."\n\n   I want to personally assure you: We will not be intimidated by these\n   bullies. We\'ll never stop fighting for the reproductive rights of all\n   women.\n\n   I know I can count on you to stand with me--and I\'m counting on you to\n   make sure we have the resources for any legal attacks we face while\n   fighting for abortion rights.\n\n   [2]Will you chip in $15 towards our legal defense and to\n   defend abortion rights?\n\n   Crisis pregnancy centers are fake clinics run by anti-choice activists to\n   pressure and intimidate women seeking abortion care.\n\n   You\'ve probably seen their ads on bus stops, billboards, and in shopping\n   malls with enticing slogans like "Pregnant? Need help? Call this number."\n\n   Our campaign to expose fake clinics is aimed at making sure women know the\n   truth before they visit one of these places and calling out their false\n   advertisements. Anti-choice activists know our campaign is working--that\'s\n   why they\'re trying to intimidate us into shutting down.\n\n   We\'re counting on you to make sure we have the resources to keep fighting\n   and if necessary defend ourselves in court against whatever frivolous\n   lawsuits the right wing hits us with. Will you chip in $15?\n\n   [3]Yes, I\'ll donate $15 for NARAL Pro-Choice America\'s legal\n   defense and to defend abortion rights.\n\n   Thank you for helping to make reproductive freedom real for all women.\n\n   Ilyse G.
