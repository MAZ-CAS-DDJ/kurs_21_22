john.podesta@gmail.comb'Good evening-\n\nTwo items to highlight tonight:\n\n1.  Great news! AFT would like to set up a call next week to start\ndiscussing a endorsement roll out.  They are moving forward with a target\ndate of July 11th but nothing is confirmed.  Everything looks on track for\nthat to be the timeline.  AFT would like to have political, comms, whomever\nyou think is appropriate to discuss the strategy behind the roll out.  I\'m\nhappy to pull the call together if you can let me know who and how you\'d\nlike to proceed.\n\n2.  Robby presented at the AFL-CIO Political Director\'s meeting today and\ndid a excellent job!  I\'ve gotten feedback from several unions that they\nfelt Robby\'s presentation was very good.  Robby was asked about energy,\napprenticeship tax credit, fundraising, field staffing and of course trade\n(CWA).  Sanders\' campaign presented afterward and I understand it was\n"respectable but didn\'t change any minds".  Sanders emphasized his $15\nmillion fundraising and his low dollar fundraising (under $37).  If anyone\nwould like additional details, I\'m happy to provide.  Those were the big\ntake aways.\n\nNo new RSVPs today to John\'s HRC reception.\n\n-- \nNikki Budzinski\nLabor Outreach Director\nHillary for America\n646-854-1442 (direct)\n'
