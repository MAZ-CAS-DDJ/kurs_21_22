We can\xe2\x80\x99t try to retrofit the criteria for this statement. We have to stick with what she laid out in June.\r\n\r\nAlso, while we\xe2\x80\x99re opposing this, don\xe2\x80\x99t we want to say something generally about ensuring that American manufacturers can compete around the world and sell their products in more markets.\r\n\r\nI accept the positon we\xe2\x80\x99re taking but she has generally been more pro-trade than anti and we get we need politically by opposing this so shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she say something about the need for American companies to gain access to new markets?\r\n\r\nFrom: speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com [mailto:speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com] On Behalf Of Dan Schwerin\r\nSent: Tuesday, October 06, 2015 9:18 PM\r\nTo: Speech Drafts\r\nSubject: Re: DRAFT: TPP statement\r\n\r\nThanks to all for the feedback. This is indeed a hard balance to strike, since we don't want to invite mockery for being too enthusiastically opposed to a deal she once championed, or over-claiming how bad it is, since it's a very close call on the merits.  Below and attached is a revised draft:\r\n\r\nStatement on TPP\r\n\r\nAs Secretary of State, I called for a strong, fair, and balanced trans-Pacific trade agreement as part of a broader strategy to reassert American leadership in Asia and a robust economic agenda at home to strengthen our ability to compete successfully with anyone in the world.  I salute President Obama and his team for working incredibly hard in pursuit of that kind of deal.  Based on what I have seen so far, however, the final Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) does not do meet the high bar by which we should judge any new trade agreement \xe2\x80\x93 and I cannot support it.\r\n\r\nAs I have said many times, we need to be sure that any new trade agreement will create good American jobs, raise wages, and advance our national security.  The goal is greater prosperity for American families, not trade for trade\xe2\x80\x99s sake.  That is why, as a Senator, I voted against agreements \xe2\x80\x93 like the Central American Free Trade Agreement -- that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think measured up.\r\n\r\nThe Obama administration deserves credit for securing improvements on a range of key issues in TPP, but there are significant flaws that remain unresolved and tip the balance against this agreement.  I believe it will do more harm than good for hard-working American families whose paychecks have barely budged in years while corporate profits have reached near-record highs.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a close call, but this is the wrong agreement at the wrong time.\r\n\r\nWe still need to do more to stop currency manipulation, which costs American jobs and puts our businesses at a disadvantage.  We can\xe2\x80\x99t allow other countries to play by their own rules or exploit American consumers \xe2\x80\x93 something we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen too often over the past 15 years.  We also need to get tougher on unfair subsidies, loopholes, and other underhanded trading practices.  Some progress has been made in this agreement to better protect workers and the environment, but we need to go further, especially when it comes to clear, enforceable assurances that countries will meet their labor obligations under this deal.  And, as I wrote in my book Hard Choices, I remain deeply concerned about a process for settling trade disputes that, despite new improvements, still favors powerful corporations at the expense of everyone else.\r\n\r\nAs President, I will pursue a comprehensive approach to trade that addresses these challenges and prioritizes the needs of American workers and families.\r\n\r\nFirst, I will fight to improve our country\xe2\x80\x99s economic competitiveness based on strong growth, fair growth, and long-term growth.  That\xe2\x80\x99s how we\xe2\x80\x99ll make trade work more for us rather than against us.  We need to close tax loopholes that reward corporations for shipping jobs overseas and instead create more good-paying jobs at home and invest in the sources of American strength, from infrastructure to innovation to clean energy.  Most of all, we have to invest in our people, so every American can get the skills and training they need to compete in the global economy.\r\n\r\nSecond, I will strengthen enforcement of the trade agreements we already have and hold China and others accountable for their unfair trading practices.\r\n\r\nThird, I still believe a strong and fair trans-Pacific trade agreement is both possible and necessary, so I will build on the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s valuable work and negotiate a deal that meets our tests and delivers for everyday Americans.\r\n\r\nFourth, I will bring more transparency and inclusiveness to trade negotiations, including making sure that workers, labor unions, NGOs, and small businesses are well-represented at every stage.  Just as we demand more open and fair markets, we should also demand more open and fair negotiations.\r\n\r\nI will also continue to reassert American leadership in Asia, where so much\r\nof the future of the 21st century will be written.  Our strategic position in the region, the security of allies like Japan and South Korea, and our ability to push China to act responsibly all depend on a strong American leadership.\r\n\r\nAs President, I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep doing what I\xe2\x80\x99ve always done \xe2\x80\x93 fighting for families, fighting for fairness, fighting for you.\r\n\r\n###\r\n"
