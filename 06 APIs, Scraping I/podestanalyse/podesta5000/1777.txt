Whether\nby hackers or spy agencies or social networks, violations of our personal\ninformation have shaken entire industries, corroded relations among\nnations, and bred distrust between democratic governments and their\ncitizens. Polls reflect this concern, and show majorities for more,\nbroader, and stricter regulation\xe2\x80\x94to put more laws "on the books." But there\nwas scant evidence of how well tighter regulation actually worked "on the\nground" in changing corporate (or government) behavior\xe2\x80\x94until now.\n\nThis intensive five-nation study goes inside corporations to examine how\nthe people charged with protecting privacy actually do their work, and what\nkinds of regulation effectively shape their behavior. And the research\nyields a surprising result. The countries with more ambiguous\nregulation\xe2\x80\x94Germany and the United States\xe2\x80\x94had the strongest corporate\nprivacy management practices, despite very different cultural and legal\nenvironments. The more rule-bound countries\xe2\x80\x94like France and Spain\xe2\x80\x94trended\ninstead toward compliance processes, not embedded privacy practices. At a\ncrucial time, when Big Data and the Internet of Things are\nsnowballing, *Privacy\non the Ground* helpfully searches out the best practices by corporations,\nprovides guidance to policymakers, and offers important lessons for\neveryone concerned with privacy, now and in the future.\n\n*Books will be available for purchase.*\n\n\n\n[image: #CONNECT WITH CDT]\n[image: Donate] <https://cdt.org/donate/> [image: FB]\n<https://www.facebook.com/CenDemTech> [image: YouTube]\n<https://www.youtube.com/user/CenDemTech> [image: Twitter]\n<https://twitter.com/CenDemTech> [image: Subscribe]\n<https://cdt.org/#getinvolved>\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\nDeirdre K.
