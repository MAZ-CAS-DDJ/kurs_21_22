Or i could do a call to him at 3. I think it preferable that i not send the cap docs to ptt for printing out. I could print out in morning, get to him at home, and then talk to him about them by phone later.\r\n--------------------------\r\nSent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Sara Latham\r\nTo: Juliana Gendelman\r\nCc: Anna Canfield; Sarah Wartell\r\nSent: Sat Dec 13 18:50:27 2008\r\nSubject: Re: Call Tomorrow\r\n\r\nHe has a 1pm and 2pm conf call, each will last 30-45mins, and I'm not sure what time he plans to come to the office.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Juliana Gendelman\r\nTo: Sara Latham\r\nCc: Anna Canfield ; Sarah Wartell\r\nSent: Sat Dec 13 17:58:25 2008\r\nSubject: Call Tomorrow\r\n\r\nSara,\r\n\r\nJohn said to check with you to see what time he can do a call with Sarah Wartell tomorrow.
