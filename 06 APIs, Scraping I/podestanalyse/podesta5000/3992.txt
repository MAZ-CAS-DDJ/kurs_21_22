The idea would be to do \xe2\x80\x9ctopical drills\xe2\x80\x9d in the\nmorning where we isolate 8 high priority topics (see attached) and run them\nover and over until we are all happy where they stand.  It would be\nincumbent on Bernie (Bob) and Martin (Jake) to try different approaches so\nwe can test different HRC responses.\n\n\n\nWe would give  HRC an extended lunch break to study materials and for us to\nhuddle on advice.  I would propose to give her the attached Cheat Sheet to\nstudy during lunch (perhaps updated based on tomorrow AM).\n\n\n\nIn the afternoon, we would run our usual mock.  The proposed questions are\nattached.\n\n\n\nLet Karen or I know if you have any objections or concerns!\n\n\n\nRon and Karen\n\n<Agenda-Mock-111215.docx>\n\n<HRC16-Debates-2ndDebate-RoadMap-1110-5pm.docx>\n"
