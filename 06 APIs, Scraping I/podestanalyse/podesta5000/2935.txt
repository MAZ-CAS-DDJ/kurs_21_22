(act.myngp.com/Forms/4231274146003158784)\n\nLast year we faced down attacks from right-wing billionaires who tried to buy the election. We expect those same groups and individuals to use the same tactic against my campaign this time. We need your help to send a clear message that their tricks won't work this time or ever!\n\nMake your contribution before\xc2\xa0midnight\xc2\xa0tonight\xc2\xa0by clicking here.
