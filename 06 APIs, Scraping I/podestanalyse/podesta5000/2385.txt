He was very sensitive to my concerns\nabout his criticism of Bernie, I don't expect it to happen again from him, he's\na good guy and we will have breakfast soon.  Just hope nobody in the campaign\nis working this negative side of the street but Joaquin is OK and understood my\npoint completely and we will collaborate going forward...p.s. I told him to run against\nCruz for the Senate!  Brent\n\nSent from my iPad"
