We\'ll also rename it the "Obama-Biden Transition Project".  John has suggested that the five people listed on the incorporation papers will be the five of you.  There\'s nothing you need to do, but the press will obviously get a copy of the legal papers.  I just wanted to give you a heads-up in case you have any concerns.  (And if it makes any difference, we\'re getting directors and officers liability insurance for the transition.)\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------\nChris Lu\nclu@barackobama.com\n312-505-4864 (cell)\n \n'
