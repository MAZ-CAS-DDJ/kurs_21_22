Putnam in his acclaimed book on America\'s growing economic divide, Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis (http://www.amazon.com/Our-Kids-American-Dream-Crisis/dp/1476769893) .\nIn response to Putnam\'s book, TCF senior fellow Richard D. Kahlenberg (http://www.tcf.org/experts/detail/richard-d.-kahlenberg)  has issued a call to action with his latest report, A New Era of Civil Rights (http://apps.tcf.org/a-new-era-of-civil-rights) , urging policymakers to address the forces fueling class inequality. In the piece, Kahlenberg outlines concrete policy solutions that can help to close the widening opportunity gap, including:\n1. a Fair Housing Act for working-class people,\n2. a Brown v. Board of Education policy for low-income pupils,\n3. an affirmative action program in higher education for economically disadvantaged students, and\n4. an amendment to the Civil Rights Act to prohibit discrimination against workers engaged in labor organizing.\n\nRead the Report (https://tcfdotorg.atavist.com/a-new-era-of-civil-rights)\nJoin the conversation online via @TCFdotorg (https://twitter.com/tcfdotorg) .
