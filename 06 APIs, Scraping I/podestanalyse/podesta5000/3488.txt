john.podesta@gmail.comb'Thanks, John.\n\nHi, Teddy.\n\nI read that your digital campaign team is hiring and that sparked my\ninterest.\n\nI just finished a full-time gig as a writer / producer with Funnyordie.com\nand am writing & directing with Jill Soloway\'s Wifey TV on a Bill Cosby\nmusical starring 38 female comedians.\n\nI\'m passionate about Hillary and I\'m passionate about comedy.  I feel as\nthough my knowledge of social media, comedy and the specific comedic acts\nout there right now could be useful to your campaign.  I have a lot of\nideas that I believe could help your campaign reach people on a targeted\nstate or even county level.   I also feel as though the Republicans will\nsay some really dumb things during this process and love to write response\nvideos.\n\nIf this is of any interest to you, feel free to email or call me on my cell\n(below).\n\nI\'ve included links to the last three video\'s I ended my funnyordie run\nwith, including my Climate Change Denial Disorder video, which is where I\nbriefly worked with John before his not-so-graceful-exit from The White\nHouse (he totally tripped while walking down the stairs).\n\n*Climate Change Denial Disorder:* (Written By)\n\nI came up with a disorder that 56% of Republicans in Congress seem to be\ninfected with.\n\nhttp://www.funnyordie.com/videos/9bd64b041b/climate-change-denial-disorder\n\n*Vajaculation  - If You Build It She Will Come: * (Executive Producer -\nWritten and directed by Jill Soloway)\n\nFemale empowerment video taking on the patriarchy.\n\nhttp://www.funnyordie.com/videos/239948621c/how-to-vajaculate\n\n*Dennis Quaid\'s On Set Freak Out*: (Written by)\n\nInitially released on Reddit and was as high as #4 on the front page.\n\nhttp://www.funnyordie.com/videos/61bf1d0ade/dennis-quaid-s-on-set-freakout\n\n\nBest,\nNicol Paone\n(310) 663 - 0326\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Apr 28, 2015, at 2:10 PM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com> wrote:\n\nConnecting the two of you.\nOn Apr 28, 2015 4:56 PM, "Nicol Paone" <nmpaone@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n> Just wanted to send this from my personal email address, which is the best\n> way to reach me.\n>\n>\n> Best,\n> Nicol Paone\n>\n>\n>\n>\n'
