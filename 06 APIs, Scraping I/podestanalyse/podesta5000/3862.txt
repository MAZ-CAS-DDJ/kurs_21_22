They are part of our community.  \n\nOn Dec 4, 2014, at 10:16 AM, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com> wrote:\n\n> Revised below, with some trims and adds:\n> \n> Before I begin today, I would like to say a few words about the pain and frustration that many Americans are feeling today about our criminal justice system.
