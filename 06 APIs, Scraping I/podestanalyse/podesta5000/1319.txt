This is really good.  I hope my comments\nhelped shape this message.\n\n\n\nThe one thing I heard in her super Tuesday speech that I thought that I\nwould avoid is that she said: \xe2\x80\x9cwhether we like it or not, we are in this\nall together\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d    I would advise eliminating the \xe2\x80\x9clike it or not\xe2\x80\x9d  part and\njust say that \xe2\x80\x9cin order to make America whole we must be in this\naltogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOne other small nit is that she says \xe2\x80\x9cwe need to make America whole *again*\xe2\x80\x9d.\nI am not sure when America ever was whole. So thought might be given to\nsaying something like: \xe2\x80\x9cit is time to make America whole; where no one is\nleft out; where all have equal opportunity, where all lives matter, etc\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMy two cents.\n\n\n\nMichael\n\n\n\nMichael Zeldin\n\nSpecial Counsel\n\nBuckleySandler LLP\n\n1250 24th Street NW\n\nSuite 700\n\nWashington, DC  20037\n\nT.  202-349-7928 | F. 202-349-8080\n\nM. 202-258-2770\n\nmzeldin@buckleysandler.com\n<javascript:_e(%7B%7D,\'cvml\',\'mzeldin@buckleysandler.com\');>\n\nwww.buckleysandler.com\n\n\n\n[image: Description: BuckleySandler_emaillogo_smaller]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton lost no time transitioning into a general-election message,\npositioning herself as the opposite of Donald Trump in an optimistic speech\nthreaded with themes of "love and kindness.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDespite what you hear, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to make America great again. America\nhas never stopped being great,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton told supporters after her big\nprimary victory in South Carolina on Saturday night.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we do need to make America whole again," she said to loud applause.\n"Instead of building walls, we need to be tearing down barriers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have so much to look forward to," Clinton said. "There is no doubt in\nmy mind that America\xe2\x80\x99s best years are ahead of us. We have to believe that,\nwe have to work for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s come a long way from her campaign message of "Pick me because I have\nexperience."\n\nClinton mentioned the five mothers by name that she recognized at CNN\xe2\x80\x99s\nDemocratic town hall on Tuesday -- five African-American women who have\nlost their children to gun violence or at the hands of police.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have not been broken or embittered. Instead, they have channeled\ntheir sorrow into strategy, and their mourning into a movement. And they\nare reminding us of something deep and powerful in the American spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d\nClinton said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we stand together, there is no barrier too big to break," she said.\n"Tomorrow, this campaign goes national.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGet complete coverage of breaking news on CNN TV, CNN.com\n<http://www.cnn.com> and CNN Mobile.\n----------------------------------------------\nWatch CNN live or On Demand from your computer or mobile device.\nWatch live CNN news coverage now at http://cnn.it/go\n----------------------------------------------\n\nYou have opted-in to receive this e-mail from CNN.com.\nTo unsubscribe from Breaking News e-mail alerts, go to:\nhttp://cnn.com/EMAIL/breakingnews/unsubscribe.html?l=domestic-adh-bn\nOne CNN Center Atlanta, GA 30303\n(c) & (r) 2016 Cable News Network\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nThis email message (including any attachments) is only for use by the\nintended recipient(s) and is presumed confidential.
