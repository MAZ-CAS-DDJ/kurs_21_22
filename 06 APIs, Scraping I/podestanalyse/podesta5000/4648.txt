john.podesta@gmail.comb'John - Thanks so much for seeing me today.  It was great to catch up.  I sure do appreciate your interest in helping me figure out if there is a good place for me in the Administration.  No matter what, I would like to be helpful to you and the President.  It is always an honor and a privilege to serve.  Thanks again.  Best,  Monica\n\nSent from my iPad'
