john.podesta@gmail.comb'We are organized as the preferred 501c4 model. Lindner is using an LLC for\nCommon Sense Issues. That is something to consider--all the direct spending\nwould be moved to the LLC and it would have to manage its expenses and Cash\non Hand at the end of the year so it is going down close to zero. It would\npay income taxes on whatever is left Cash on Hand at the end of the year but\nthat might be a small price to pay for the advantages of anonymity and\nflexibility. The tax liability is entirely on the LLC in that circumstance.\nFor what it is worth, our lawyers are looking into the LLC model too.\n\nOn Dec 19, 2007 9:41 AM, Tara McGuinness <tara.mcguinness@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n> "Democrats are expected to hold that lead during the 2008 cycle.

These 501(c) organizations don\'t have to\n> disclose their donors.\n>\n> Data from two nonpartisan organizations that track campaign finance -- the\n> Center for Public Integrity and the Center for Responsive Politics -- show\n> that election-cycle spending by 527 organizations rose from $171 million in\n> 2000 to $316 million in 2002 to $653 million in 2004. Spending dropped to\n> $443 million for the 2006 midterm elections. Spending on midterm elections\n> typically runs lower than on presidential elections.\n>\n> The new groups are pulling in money that the major parties used to\n> receive. Before the 2002 crackdown, financier George Soros donated more than\n> $200,000 to the Democratic Party. Since then, he has given at least $20\n> million to the 527 organizations. American Financial Group Inc. Chairman\n> Carl Lindner previously donated more than $1.5 million in soft money to the\n> Republican Party. In 2006, he gave about $500,000 to a 501(c)4 group called\n> Common Sense Ohio, which sought to re-elect several Republican senators. In\n> the last four years, Mr. Lindner has donated $3.6 million to outside groups\n> backing Republican candidates, according to campaign-finance documents.\n>\n> Because the IRS doesn\'t require 501(c) organizations to detail election\n> spending or to list contributors, it\'s difficult to track their political\n> activity. The Journal analyzed data on 30 separate 501(c) groups active in\n> elections from 2000 to 2006, culled from a variety of sources.

"We now have a significant new ability to run\n> advertisements that directly call for the election or defeat of candidates."\n> Another advantage, Mr. Toomey noted, is that "unlike the past, your\n> donations to the Club will not be disclosed to the public."\n>\n> The League of Conservation Voters, an environmental-advocacy group that\n> was also fined by the FEC for its 527 spending, has made a similar move.\n>\n> Another environmental group, Defenders of Wildlife, started a 501(c)4\n> organization before the 2006 election, partly to help wage a campaign to\n> defeat California Republican Rep. Richard Pombo, then the chairman of the\n> environment committee in the U.S. House. The group spent $2 million. Mr.\n> Pombo lost the election. Rodger Schlickeisen, the group\'s president, says it\n> plans to spend $5 million this election on campaigns against four\n> candidates, including Rep. Don Young, the Alaska Republican who once was\n> chairman of the same environment panel.\n>\n> While independent groups have been building clout, the national political\n> parties have been losing election-spending power. In 2002, the national\n> parties raised $591 million in soft money, which funded about half of their\n> budgets for that year\'s election cycle. (Figures used in this story have\n> been adjusted for inflation.) Over the last four years, following the ban on\n> soft money, the national parties have had about $200 million less to spend\n> on campaigns, an 8% drop.\n>\n> During the 2000 presidential election, the Republican and Democratic\n> parties paid for 50% of advertising in the 70 largest cities, according to a\n> study by the Wisconsin Advertising Project at the University of Wisconsin.\n> In 2004, that figure fell to 17%. Outside groups accounted for 20% of the\n> advertisements in the 2004 presidential campaign, double the amount of 2000,\n> according to the project.\n>\n> Democrats have led the charge toward using independent political\n> organizations. Soon after the 2002 law took effect, several Democratic\n> strategists, including Harold Ickes, a former top official with the\n> Democratic Party, and Steve Rosenthal, who had run political operations for\n> the AFL-CIO, met for dinner at BeDuCi\'s restaurant in Washington. They\n> worried that the Republican Party would adjust better than the Democrats in\n> 2004 to the loss of soft money because it controlled the White House, and\n> because President Bush knew how to rake in campaign cash, Mr. Rosenthal\n> recalls.\n>\n> The Democrats decided to create and coordinate a set of 527 organizations,\n> such as America Coming Together and the Media Fund, which would essentially\n> act like a shadow Democratic Party. The Democratic strategists raised $200\n> million from wealthy liberals, trial lawyers, labor unions and other\n> traditional backers of the Democratic Party, and spent it on the campaign,\n> according to campaign finance records. The Democratic National Committee\n> spent $390 million on the election, according to campaign records.\n>\n> All told, since the campaign-finance law took effect, the 527\n> organizations that support Democratic candidates have spent nearly three\n> times as much money on elections than those backing Republicans, according\n> to the Campaign Finance Institute. One reason for the disparity is that\n> corporations, once the largest source of soft-money donations to the\n> Republican Party, haven\'t poured much money into 527s. Campaign-finance\n> lawyers who advise 527 organizations say that corporations are concerned\n> about getting involved with groups that run afoul of campaign-finance rules.\n>\n>\n> Democrats are expected to hold that lead during the 2008 cycle. Last\n> month, two Democrats launched Fund for America, a 527 group that plans to\n> raise at least $100 million to back the Democratic presidential nominee.\n> Republicans say they are recruiting donors to match that amount.\n>\n> Because they have their own agendas, outside organizations sometimes clash\n> with one another, the national parties, even the candidates they support.\n> Abortion-rights advocates say Democratic Party officials sometimes bristle\n> when they fund political advertisements in support of candidates, because\n> the ads focus attention on an issue that can alienate some voters.
