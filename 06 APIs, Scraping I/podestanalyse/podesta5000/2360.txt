Along with all those peanuts, Moricette said, have come visions of a brighter future for his wife and young son.\r\n\r\nFifty miles away on Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s Caribbean coast, Anelle Germinal exemplifies another reality of the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 work here: disappointment. The 33-year-old mother of four has been standing in the baking sun every day for months waiting for work in the struggling Caracol Industrial Park, which the Clintons have touted<https://www.clintonfoundation.org/our-work/clinton-foundation-haiti/programs/caracol-industrial-park> as a model that would change the economy of this impoverished country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey said we would have work,\xe2\x80\x9d Germinal said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMoricette and Germinal are two faces of the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 increasingly complicated relationship with Haiti, where their high-profile development efforts after a devastating earthquake in 2010 have produced both success and disillusionment.\r\n\r\nAs Hillary Clinton moves toward a second run for the White House, her family\xe2\x80\x99s global charitable work, mostly through the Clinton Foundation<https://www.clintonfoundation.org/>, has come under intense scrutiny. The foundation has accepted large donations from corporations and foreign countries, raising concerns that the Clintons are creating conflicts of interest by blurring the lines between their political, business and charitable interests.\r\n\r\n[https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/18/Others/Images/2015-03-18/AMC15WAPOCLINTON0051426705505.jpg?uuid=tLwsJs2hEeSHME9HNBbnWQ]Two farmers water plants in the Acceso farm, near Mirebalais. The Acceso Peanut Enterprise Corp. was started with a $1.25 million grant from the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership. (Andres Martinez Casares/for The Washington Post)\r\n\r\nThe Washington Post reported <http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/foreign-governments-gave-millions-to-foundation-while-clinton-was-at-state-dept/2015/02/25/31937c1e-bc3f-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html> last month that the foundation\xe2\x80\x99s donors include seven foreign governments that contributed millions during Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s tenure as secretary of state. Among those donations was a $500,000 contribution for Haiti earthquake relief from the Algerian government that the foundation has acknowledged violated the terms of an ethics agreement with the Obama administration.\r\n\r\nThe Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 defenders <http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/02/26/obama-officials-defend-clinton-foundation-donation/> have dismissed concerns about the donations as political sniping, saying the test of the foundation is not where it gets its money, but how it spends it. They said their work has created economic opportunity, improved lives for women and girls, raised health standards, and fought the effects of climate change across the developing world.\r\n\r\nThe work has been especially visible in Haiti, where the Clintons first traveled as young newlyweds in 1975 and where many people credit them with drawing the world\xe2\x80\x99s attention immediately after the earthquake, which killed more than 200,000 people.\r\n\r\nWith former president Clinton assigned by the United Nations to head up the emergency recovery effort and Hillary Clinton guiding official U.S. assistance as secretary of state, the couple helped a vast relief effort that has included some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest people, biggest celebrities and most successful businesses. The Clintons helped mobilize a vast relief effort in which international donors pledged $10.4 billion, including $3.9 billion from the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Milne, director of the Clinton Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s Haiti Program, said foundation projects include programs that have helped more than 2,000 small farmers, an artisan-goods company that employs more than 300 people, a fish-farming operation, a cholera treatment center and improvements to schools in some of Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s poorest slums.\r\n\r\nClinton supporters also point out that their successes have come amid Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s chaotic political situation \xe2\x80\x94 parliament is not functioning, and President Michel Martelly, dogged by scandal, is ruling with virtually no checks on his power \xe2\x80\x94 endemic corruption, weak institutions, poverty, poor public education, terrible roads and other factors that have historically made it extremely difficult <http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/clearing-earthquake-camps-in-haiti-is-not-pretty/2012/01/27/gIQAnxzNOR_story.html> for development efforts to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe country has long had a fraught relationship with foreigners who come to invest and provide aid. Haitians often regard them with gratitude for desperately needed resources, and at the same time with suspicion that their motives are more to make a profit in Haiti than to help it.\r\n\r\n[https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/18/Others/Images/2015-03-18/1545750541426704791.jpg?uuid=DFqdFs2gEeSHME9HNBbnWQ]Landry Colas hugs former president Bill Clinton in 2012 to express his gratitude for the Caracol Industrial Park, one of the largest regional investment projects in Haiti, which was expected to create more than 60,000 jobs. (Carl Juste/Miami Herald/MCT via Getty Images)\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Clintons are facing a growing backlash that too little has been accomplished in the past five years, and that some of the most high-profile projects they have backed \xe2\x80\x94 including the Marriott, another luxury hotel and the industrial park \xe2\x80\x94 have helped foreign investors and Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s wealthy elites more than its poor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBill Clinton is a good guy and well-intentioned, but the people here don\xe2\x80\x99t think so \xe2\x80\x94 they think he\xe2\x80\x99s here making money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Leslie Voltaire, a former government official who worked with Clinton on post-earthquake reconstruction. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a lot of resentment about Clinton here. People have not seen results. .\xe2\x80\x89.\xe2\x80\x89. They say that Clinton used Haiti.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn January, Haitian expatriates picketed <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9WYNZsKolQ> the Clinton Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s New York headquarters, demanding to know why more progress has not been made with the billions in international aid pledged after the quake.\r\n\r\nSaid Raymond Joseph, a former Haitian ambassador to the United States: \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are asking, \xe2\x80\x98What has Bill Clinton done for us?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Activist: Haiti redevelopment hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been about helping Haitians<http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/01/12/its-been-five-years-since-haitis-earthquake-and-the-redevelopment-hasnt-been-about-helping-haitians/>]\r\n\r\nThe Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 long influence in Haiti is hard to overstate. As president in 1994, Bill Clinton deployed about 20,000 U.S. troops to Haiti to restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who had been ousted in a coup in 1991. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s trade policies as president, which he later called a \xe2\x80\x9cmistake,\xe2\x80\x9d were devastating to Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s rice production and made it harder for the Haiti to feed itself.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Clinton was named U.N. special envoy for Haiti, and he has visited the country 37 times since then.\r\n\r\nAfter the earthquake, Clinton united with former president George W. Bush to create the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund, <http://www.clintonbushhaitifund.org/> which distributed $54.4 million in the two years after the earthquake. Separately, the Clinton Foundation has spent more than $30 million in Haiti and led efforts through the Clinton Global Initiative <https://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative> to persuade private companies to spend vastly more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I think most people don\xe2\x80\x99t know, even if they\xe2\x80\x99ve been on the ground there, is these people are immensely talented,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill Clinton said in a 2010 interview with NPR. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have suffered from 200 years of outside and inside abuses and neglect and misgovernment. And a lot of the people who\xe2\x80\x99ve gone there even to help them in the best of faith, have done so in a way that would never have allowed them to support themselves and to lift themselves up. And now there is a true consensus for and determination for a sustainable, comprehensive, long-term, modern society in Haiti. And they can do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut as the initial emergency response has evolved into efforts to ensure Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s long-term development, Haitians increasingly complain that the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 most ambitious plans are disconnected from the realities of most people in the poorest country in the western hemisphere.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund invested more than $2 million in the Royal Oasis hotel, where a sleek suite with hardwood floors costs more than $200 a night and the shops sell $150 designer purses and $120 men\xe2\x80\x99s dress shirts.\r\n\r\nOne recent afternoon, the hotel appeared largely empty, and with tourism hardly booming five years after the quake, locals fear it may be failing. A spokeswoman for Occidental Hotels, the chain that runs the hotel, said that occupancy is up this year and that the project will \xe2\x80\x9cmature in the long run.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBill Clinton also introduced Marriott officials to Denis O\xe2\x80\x99Brien, an Irish telecom billionaire who has contributed millions to the Clinton Foundation. The result is a $45 million Marriott Hotel that opened this month<http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/in-haiti-a-marriotts-opening-is-the-latest-milestone-in-quake-recovery/2015/02/26/bc3cadde-bd0e-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html> in central Port-au-Prince. O\xe2\x80\x99Brien said no Clinton money was invested in the project.\r\n\r\nThe ultra-modern hotel is adjacent to the headquarters of Digicel, a communications giant owned by O\xe2\x80\x99Brien. When The Post visited recently, many, if not most, of the guests seemed to be foreign businessmen connected to Digicel.\r\n\r\nClinton defenders argue that hotels that cater to well-heeled foreign guests can still buy local products and provide local jobs, and those guests are often involved in businesses investments or aid projects that benefit the neediest Haitians.\r\n\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Brien said his hotel employs 200 Haitians, is filled with locally purchased art and serves food from Haiti. O\xe2\x80\x99Brien leads the Haiti Action Network<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEFl6EUjrJs>, a collection of private businesses that have committed through the Clinton Global Initiative to spend $500 million on projects in Haiti. He and his company just built 150 schools and rebuilt Port-au-Prince\xe2\x80\x99s historic Iron Market.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know any modern leader that has spent more time helping a country and being so effective,\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Brien said of Bill Clinton. <http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/in-haiti-a-marriotts-opening-is-the-latest-milestone-in-quake-recovery/2015/02/26/bc3cadde-bd0e-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html> \xe2\x80\x9cHe works like a demon in the developing world. Nobody is doing that. Is Tony Blair doing that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOther Clinton-backed projects have not delivered on lofty promises: A 2011 housing expo that cost more than $2 million, including $500,000 from the Clinton Foundation, was supposed to be a model for thousands of new units but instead has resulted in little more than a few dozen abandoned model homes occupied by squatters.\r\n\r\nControversy surrounding the Clintons only deepened with the recent revelation, contained in an upcoming book by Peter Schweizer, that Tony Rodham \xe2\x80\x94 Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s younger brother \xe2\x80\x94 serves on the advisory board of a U.S.-based company that in 2012 won one of Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s first two gold-mining permits in 50 years. After objection from the Haitian senate, the permits have been placed on hold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither Bill Clinton nor the brother of Hillary Clinton are individuals who share the interests of the Haitian people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samuel Nesner, an anti-mining activist who thinks mining poses great environmental risks and will mainly benefit foreign investors. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are part of the elite class who are operating to exploit the Haitian people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClinton Foundation officials said Bill Clinton had been unaware of Rodham\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in the mine project. A spokesman for Hillary Clinton said she does not know the chief executive of the mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI strongly believe the Clintons came to Haiti in good faith and they wanted to have an impact,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jean-Max Bellerive, who was Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister at the time of the earthquake and served as co-chairman with Bill Clinton on the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission. (Bellerive is also on the mining company\xe2\x80\x99s advisory board.)\r\n\r\nBut, Bellerive said, the former president was hampered by a \xe2\x80\x9cweak\xe2\x80\x9d staff of American aides who were \xe2\x80\x9cmore interested in supporting Clinton than helping Haiti.\xe2\x80\x9d Echoing a common sentiment in Haiti, Bellerive also said Clinton should have listened more carefully to the opinions and needs of ordinary Haitians. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you want a guy coming from Davos or Dubai to get the real feeling for what\xe2\x80\x99s happening downstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMilne, of the Clinton Foundation, said the criticism is wrong and unsurprising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresident Clinton is one of the most dedicated and highest-profile advocates for Haiti, and he is still engaged while others have moved on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that for some he is an easy target for natural frustration that the change we all want isn\xe2\x80\x99t happening faster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilne said the country has experienced strong economic growth in recent years, with more Haitians employed and more children in school.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Haiti building back better?\xe2\x80\x9d Milne said, using a phrase that the Clintons frequently quote. \xe2\x80\x9cIn many ways yes, though challenges remain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul Farmer, a doctor whose Partners in Health <http://www.pih.org/> has helped provide medical care in rural Haiti since the 1980s and whose health network has received more than $1.8 million from the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund to establish a medical residency program, also praised the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 work. He said he forged partnerships at CGI meetings with private businesses and other charities for a variety of projects he said would not have taken place without the Clinton connection.\r\n\r\nHe said that by any objective measure, Haiti has been improving, in part because of the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 efforts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the whole country built back better? I doubt it,\xe2\x80\x9d Farmer said. \xe2\x80\x9cWater insecurity and food insecurity are very pressing problems. But if you look at the health statistics for Haiti .\xe2\x80\x89.\xe2\x80\x89. infant mortality, child mortality \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re all improving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill, even some who have benefited from Clinton-backed programs have grown disillusioned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI read that Bill Clinton is the most popular politician in America, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get elected mayor in Haiti today,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jacky Lumarque, rector of Quisqueya University, a private school that was largely damaged in the earthquake and received $914,000<http://www.clintonbushhaitifund.org/programs/entry/universite-quisqueya/> from  the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund to create an entrepreneurship center.\r\n\r\nLumarque said the program has helped hundreds of Haitians turn their informal street businesses into formal entities that keep records, pay taxes and have potential for growth.\r\n\r\nHe said it has been a huge success \xe2\x80\x94 but stands apart from the usual strategy of foreign groups, including the Clintons, who tend to favor projects imposed by well-meaning foreigners that are more \xe2\x80\x9cabout Haiti\xe2\x80\x9d than \xe2\x80\x9cfor Haiti.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe entrepreneurship center, Lumarque said, \xe2\x80\x9cis an example of what Clinton can do, in spite of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Foreign governments gave millions to Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 foundation<http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/foreign-governments-gave-millions-to-foundation-while-clinton-was-at-state-dept/2015/02/25/31937c1e-bc3f-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html>]\r\n\r\nWhen Bill Clinton came here late last month to help inaugurate the new Marriott, he made a side trip by helicopter to Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s central plateau to have a look at a Clinton-backed program that is revolutionizing the peanut-farming industry.\r\n\r\nThe Acceso Peanut Enterprise Corp.<https://www.clintonfoundation.org/our-work/clinton-giustra-enterprise-partnership/programs/acceso-peanut-enterprise-corporation> was started with a $1.25 million grant from the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, which is headed by Bill Clinton and Canadian mining executive and philanthropist Frank Giustra, as well as the charitable foundation of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim.\r\n\r\nAcceso buys feed, fertilizer and fungicide at bulk rates, then sells them to farmers for far less than normal prices. Acceso also hires tractors for farmers who otherwise would be using an ox and plow.\r\n\r\nRobert Johnson, an American who runs the program, said the improvements are vastly increasing yields, quality and farmers\xe2\x80\x99 profits.\r\n\r\nHe said Acceso worked with about 1,000 farmers last year and bought about 120 metric tons of peanuts. This year, it expects to triple the number of farmers and buy almost five times as many nuts.\r\n\r\nAt least half of Acceso\xe2\x80\x99s sales have gone to two large Haitian factories that produce a peanut-based paste that is given to malnourished children. Most of the rest goes to local peanut-butter producers, he said.\r\n\r\nThe program\xe2\x80\x99s success, Johnson said, comes from its market-driven approach: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a charity, it\xe2\x80\x99s a business with a charitable purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re building something that is going to be sustainable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe talk to the farmers. We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to just bring in something that someone thought up in Davos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe program is now branching out into lime production, and Clinton visited a site last month where thousands of lime seedlings are being cultivated by dozens of workers.\r\n\r\nBenel Auguste, 32, is one of the small landowners who rented his plot, about a third of an acre, to Acceso to plant limes. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea; it\xe2\x80\x99s going to work,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know limes and we need them. We can do this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Clintons also were enthusiastic backers of the Caracol Industrial Park, which was built on 600 acres of farmland just east of the Caribbean port city of Cap-Haitien.\r\n\r\nThey agreed with economists, particularly Oxford University development specialist Paul Collier, who concluded that Haiti is an ideal place to create mass jobs in garment factories because of its proximity to the United States, favorable trade agreements and cheap labor.\r\n\r\nThe Clintons helped Haitian officials identify Sae-A Trading Co., which operates factories across the developing world and sews garments for giants such as Target, Gap and Wal-Mart, as a potential major investor.\r\n\r\nAs secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, along with top aide Cheryl Mills, lobbied for the project with South Korean officials and hosted Sae-A executives in Washington to press the plan.\r\n\r\nBill Clinton attended the Sae-A contract-signing <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/11/AR2011011107157.html> ceremony in Port-au-Prince on Jan. 11, 2011 \xe2\x80\x94 a day before the first anniversary of the earthquake. He later laid the first stone of the park\xe2\x80\x99s construction. And then in October 2012, the Clintons, Martelly and other officials attended the ribbon-cutting.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to a group of investors at the ceremony, officials and celebrities that included actors Sean Penn and Ben Stiller and business moguls Donna Karan and Richard Branson, Hillary Clinton said it represented \xe2\x80\x9ca new day for Haiti and a new model for how the international community practices development.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaiti is truly open for business, and we want your help,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe see this partnership between governments like our own and the private sector as absolutely essential in promoting and supporting long-term prosperity in Haiti. We know very well that long-term prosperity cannot come from just the provision of aid; there must be trade and investment like we have seen here today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToday, Sae-A employs about 4,500 people. Company spokesman Lon Garwood said the operation has been steadily growing and will open a new facility next month. Henri-Claude M\xc3\xbcller-Poitevien, a Haitian government official who works the apparel industry, said the Caracol project is on schedule and continues to expand.\r\n\r\nA power plant was built, but plans for a new port at the industrial park to carry finished goods to the United States have been shelved. Residents of the plant\xe2\x80\x99s housing project say their land floods when it rains, and few said they think <http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/9/10/a-glittering-industrialparkfallsshortinhaiti.html> the plant will ever create the number of jobs originally promised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe that the momentum to attract people there in a massive way is past,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bellerive, the former prime minister. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can do interesting things with Caracol, but you have to reinvent the concept. Today, it has failed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEach morning, crowds line up outside the park\xe2\x80\x99s big front gate, which is guarded by four men in crisp, khaki uniforms carrying shotguns. They wait in a sliver of shade next to a cinder-block wall, many holding r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9s in envelopes. Most said they have been coming every day for months, waiting for jobs that pay about $5 a day.\r\n\r\nFrom his envelope, Jean Mito Palvetus, 27, pulled out a diploma attesting that he had completed 200 hours of USAID training on an industrial sewing machine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have three kids and a wife, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t support them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sweating in the hot morning sun. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a diploma, but I still can\xe2\x80\x99t get a job here. I still have nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom Hamburger in Washington contributed to this report.\r\n\r\nFrom: NSM <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com<mailto:nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>>\r\nDate: Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 7:59 PM\r\nTo: Jim Margolis <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com<mailto:Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com>>, Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com<mailto:gruncom@aol.com>>, Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com<mailto:jbenenson@bsgco.com>>, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>, Cheryl Mills <cheryl.mills@gmail.com<mailto:cheryl.mills@gmail.com>>, Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com<mailto:huma@hrcoffice.com>>, Robby Mook <robbymook2015@gmail.com<mailto:robbymook2015@gmail.com>>, Dennis Cheng <d.cheng@me.com<mailto:d.cheng@me.com>>, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com<mailto:dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>>, Jacob Sullivan <Jake.sullivan@gmail.com<mailto:Jake.sullivan@gmail.com>>, John Anzalone <john@algpolling.com<mailto:john@algpolling.com>>\r\nCc: Jennifer Palmieri <jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com<mailto:jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com>>, Kristina Schake <kristinakschake@gmail.com<mailto:kristinakschake@gmail.com>>\r\nSubject: Stories Update\r\n\r\nHi Everyone,\r\n\r\nNow that we\xe2\x80\x99re hopefully reaching a place of relative sanity again, I wanted to take a minute to send everyone a quick update on what\xe2\x80\x99s brewing in the press.  We\xe2\x80\x99ll institutionalize a system going forward, but for the moment let me just run through a few things.\r\n\r\nFirst, Amy Chozick at the NYT is writing a piece on Robby.  He didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to her for the piece but we sent some people her way.  Looks like it will trace his life a little, have some colorful factoids in it (apparently Robby loves polo shirts), and based on the intel we have, the more irritating parts will be a look at how the wide web of Clintonland will be kept at bay, including WJC\xe2\x80\x99s office.  To help on that last point Amy talked to Tina Flournoy last night who was fantastic.\r\n\r\nSecond, the Washington Post is working on a Haiti story about the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 work there, either via the Department of State or the Clinton Foundation.  It could run as early as Monday, and will be a look at the progress (or in their view the lack thereof) and what the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 role in it has been.  I\xe2\x80\x99m working closely with the Foundation on the response.\r\n\r\nRelated, there are some other Foundation-related stories in the offing, so I will keep people posted on that front.\r\n\r\nFinally, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been going back and forth with TIME about a particular component of their piece on Thursday that claimed no one read many of the emails, implication being that the search parameters outlined in the Q&A were applied and anything that didn\xe2\x80\x99t show up in them was discarded as \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal.\xe2\x80\x9d  We\xe2\x80\x99ve pushed back pretty hard and gone on the record telling them that they are wrong.  We are also hoping to put the counter-narrrative out there with the help of Laura Meckler at the WSJ, which I\xe2\x80\x99ll send when it posts.  Will keep everyone posted on this front as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a postscript, please enjoy this courtesy of John A:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/hillary-releases-twenty-thousand-spam-e-mails-from-old-navy\r\n\r\nHillary Releases Twenty Thousand Spam E-Mails from Old Navy\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report<http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report>)\xe2\x80\x94Hoping to quell the controversy over e-mails missing from her private account, the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday released twenty thousand spam e-mails she received from Old Navy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn an effort to be transparent, I have gone above and beyond what is required of me by law and released every last e-mail I received from this retailer,\xe2\x80\x9d she told reporters. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I think we can all consider this case closed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe e-mails reveal an extensive one-way correspondence between Clinton and Old Navy, as the retailer sometimes contacted her up to a dozen times in a single day to inform her of sales and other offers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is one of the main reasons I set up a private e-mail account,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not want spam from Old Navy clogging up the State Department servers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut if the former Secretary of State thought that she could end the controversy swirling around her e-mail account by releasing the Old Navy spam, she may have miscalculated.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Trey Gowdy, the Republican chairman of the House Benghazi select committee, questioned why Clinton would let twenty thousand spam e-mails from Old Navy accumulate rather than simply unsubscribe. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pass the smell test,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nResponding to that allegation, Clinton said, \xe2\x80\x9cI want the American people to know that, on multiple occasions, I tried to unsubscribe from Old Navy, and my requests were ignored. The most frustrating part of this whole affair is that I\xe2\x80\x99ve never even bought anything from Old Navy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGet news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.<https://www.newyorker.com/services/newsletters>\r\n\r\n'
