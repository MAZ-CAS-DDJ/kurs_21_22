Restaurants <http://www.latimes.com/food/jonathan-gold/la-fo-jonathan-golds-top-20-la-restaurants-20151102-htmlstory.html>\n\n\nCheck out a quick video recap:\n\n <https://www.facebook.com/garcetti/videos/vb.12476614805/10153730376514806/?type=2&theater>\n\n\nThe Details:\n\nGETTING READY FOR EL NI\xc3\x91O <http://www.lamayor.org/mayor_garcetti_signs_executive_directive_on_elnino_preparations_announces_2_agreements_to_help_angelenos_during_emergencies> <http://www.marketwatch.com/story/el-nino-is-drying-up-gains-for-this-major-currency-2015-11-04>This week, I signed an Executive Directive <https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/mayorofla/pages/17070/attachments/original/1446858272/Executive_Directive_14.pdf?1446858272> \xe2\x80\x94 creating an El Ni\xc3\xb1o Task Force  <http://www.lamayor.org/mayor_garcetti_signs_executive_directive_on_elnino_preparations_announces_2_agreements_to_help_angelenos_during_emergencies>and marshaling resources to keep our city safe in the event of heavy rainfall this winter. Preparing for a major storm means more than dusting off umbrellas and dragging raincoats from the back of the closet. L.A. must be prepared for emergencies and ready to capture as much rain as we can to fight the drought <http://savethedropla.com/get-all-the-tips>.\n\nMAKING BIG PROGRESS AGAINST THE DROUGHT <http://www.lamayor.org/1year_anniversary_water_saving_executive_directive_announces_support_for_tiered_water_rates_and_penalties_for_water_wasters>One year after I asked Angelenos to reduce water consumption by 20% by 2017, I am happy to report that we are well on our way to reaching that goal! We\xe2\x80\x99ve already cut potable water use by 16%, replaced 20 million square feet of turf with drought-tolerant landscaping, and are saving 3 billion gallons of water each year through devices like rain barrels <http://savethedropla.com/get-all-the-tips>, low-flush toilets <https://ladwp.com/ladwp/faces/ladwp/residential/r-savemoney/r-sm-rebatesandprograms?_afrLoop=679294256821074&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=null#%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26_afrLoop%3D679294256821074%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dz64m82rwb_17>, and weather-based irrigation controls <http://socalwatersmart.com/>.\n\nLEADING THE WAY IN SMART INFRASTRUCTURE, SUSTAINABLE TECH <http://www.lamayor.org/mayor_garcetti_unveils_nation_s_first_smartpole_street_lights_with_small_cell_technology>\nWe unveiled the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first installation of Philips SmartPole streetlights <http://www.lamayor.org/mayor_garcetti_unveils_nation_s_first_smartpole_street_lights_with_small_cell_technology> \xe2\x80\x94 which come with 4G LTE wireless technology and will deliver better wireless broadband coverage to our residents, businesses, and visitors. Westwood became our newest ExpressPark neighborhood <http://www.laexpresspark.org/>, using technology to make finding and paying for a parking spot much easier. And at the L.A. Zoo, we moved closer to our goal of 1,000 publicly available electric vehicle charging stations <http://www.sanfernandosun.com/news/article_9e5fa2c4-83da-11e5-a0ba-8321b8db10be.html>.\n\nSTANDING UP FOR VETERANS\xc2\xa0 <http://www.lamayor.org/hundreds_of_veterans_attend_stand_down_event_on_west_la_va_campus>AT THE \xe2\x80\x98STAND DOWN\xe2\x80\x99 <http://www.lamayor.org/hundreds_of_veterans_attend_stand_down_event_on_west_la_va_campus> <http://www.lamayor.org/hundreds_of_veterans_attend_stand_down_event_on_west_la_va_campus>We\xe2\x80\x99re working together to make sure that every veteran in our city has a safe and affordable place to call home.
