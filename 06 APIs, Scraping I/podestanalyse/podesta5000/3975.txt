john.podesta@gmail.comb'John --  \n\nRight now, Sarah Palin is on a highly publicized, nationwide book tour, attacking President Obama and his plan for health reform at every turn.\n\nIt\'s dangerous. Remember, this is the person who coined the term "Death Panels" -- and opened the flood gates for months of false attacks by special interests and partisan extremists.\n\nWhatever lie comes next will be widely covered by the media, then constantly echoed by right-wing attack groups and others who are trying to defeat reform.\n\nAs we approach the final sprint on health reform, we can\'t afford more deception and delay. We need to be ready for anything -- and have the resources to respond with ads, events, and calls to Congress when the attacks come.\n\nSo we\'re setting a big goal: $500,000 in the next week to help push back against Sarah Palin and her allies. Please chip in $5 to help reach our goal:\n\nhttps://donate.barackobama.com/SarahPalin4\n\nEarlier this month, Palin publicly said that she hopes health reform will be "dead on arrival." And since then, she\'s been working fiercely toward that goal.\n\nOn Tuesday, Palin went on Rush Limbaugh\'s radio show where she outrageously -- and falsely -- suggested that Americans could "face jail time as punishment" if they don\'t buy insurance.\n\nPalin has many more interviews scheduled on Hannity and other conservative shows in the next few weeks, with more platforms to go after the President. As soon as she does, the rest of our opponents will likely parrot those attacks.\n\nWe need to be prepared. And we\'re counting on you help. Can you chip in $5?\n\nhttps://donate.barackobama.com/SarahPalin4\n\nThanks,\n\nMitch\n\nMitch Stewart\nDirector\nOrganizing for America\n\n\nhttps://donate.barackobama.com/SarahPalin4\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for America, a project of the Democratic National Committee -- 430 South Capitol Street SE, Washington, D.C. 20003.
