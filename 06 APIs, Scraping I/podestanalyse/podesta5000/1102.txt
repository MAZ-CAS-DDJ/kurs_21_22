I'm looking forward to seeing you at Kristina's party tonight.\nI've heard from her and from Eryn that you're having the time of your life\nover there on Pennsylvania Ave. I'm looking forward to coming to visit you\nall sometime soon!\n\n\nI've also been having a really incredible time in my new position. I'm\ndoing all of Neera's speechwriting, helping manage the upcoming White House\nSummit on Women and Girls, and I have a huge amount of responsibility over\nthe daily routine in the executive office. My new position is much more\nlike Kristina's job on your team than mine. As I probably should have\nguessed I'm doing a lot more work for Neera than I am for Carmel. She's a\ntough boss, NT, but I think we've established a very solid relationship.\n\n\nI'm not sure if you've heard the news yet, but Jess O'Connell is headed\nover to EMILY's list, where she'll be replacing Amy Dacey as Executive\nDirector. Lindsay Hamilton is going to be taking over as Chief of Staff.  I\nbelieve they're making a public announcement in the next 24 hours, but the\nstory might still be under wraps when you come to CAP tonight. Two new\nbosses in three months! Between you and Jess leaving there is a lot of\nturmoil over here, but I'm learning an incredible amount in the process and\ntaking on responsibilities that far exceed my tenure. I've gotten to know\nLindsay over the past few months and I think she'll bring a lot of fresh\nenergy and focus to the executive team. I'm excited to see how I can grow\nunder her leadership.\n\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing you tonight! Also- if it's OK with you I'd\nlike to stop by for one of your Georgetown classes this semester. As I may\nhave mentioned, I'm planning on law school down the line. Let me know if\nyou have any recommendations on which class I should attend!\n\n\nSee you soon,\n\n\nMilia\n"
