john.podesta@gmail.comb'Thank you Steve.  We are working thru these issues now and I agree with\nyour assessment on a number of fronts.  We will be in touch soon.\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Jul 6, 2015, at 3:07 PM, Steve C. Bachar <Steve.Bachar@moyewhite.com>\nwrote:\n\n  Hi all,\n\n\n\nThought I should send you a quick note letting you know what I am hearing\nfrom various folks in CO; including some input some of you have gotten\ndirectly from Ken Salazar, Wellington Webb and others.  Also reflected\nherein are views from other statewide and local political leaders, elected\nand otherwise.\n\n\n\nSecretary Clinton will be in Aspen and Denver on August 4 for fundraising\nevents.  We are working to make those events as strong as possible and\nhaving the main Denver event at Merle Chambers\xe2\x80\x99 home is very good.  That\nsaid, especially since she also going to the Ergens\xe2\x80\x99, it is very important\nthat while she is here, she do something to convey a big tent; that it\xe2\x80\x99s\nnot just about the money.  This goal could be accomplished with a formal\nevent or even an OTR.  Whatever kind of stop is best for the campaign, the\nevent should likely be in north Denver, or other mixed race, not upscale,\nlikely primarily Latino neighborhood.  Could be a mini streetwalk \xe2\x80\x93 bounce\ninto a couple of stores; or a roundtable in appropriate neighborhood\nrestaurant; etc.  Sec Salazar, others and I happy to arrange with whomever\nappropriate from HRC staff side.  We need to send a signal that Sec Clinton\ncares about more in CO than the money and that there is recognition of the\ndiversity of the population and Main Street concerns.\n\n\n\nWith regard to more broad staffing issues:  We understand that the campaign\nhad a staffer in CO on contract for a few weeks conducting grass roots\nmeetings and that there is a replacement staffer now/soon to be on the\nground.  It is important this time around that staffer reach out to folks\nlike Lyons, Wellington, Salazar, Crisanta Duran, Angela Williams, Diana G\netc etc (I can give you a full list if you need it, though Jessica M should\nhave it) so that they feel touched; and much more imp so that they can make\nsure that appropriate grassroots organizers are involved early.  We had a\nmeeting last week among lots of money and organizing types (including\nFarber, Swanee Hunt, Sasha Millstone, and many former Obama folks);\nprimarily raising money with phone remarks from Dan Sorenson, Marlon\nMarshall. At that meeting, and in pre calls and follow up calls to me and\nothers, a common theme emerged which is same I am hearing from others: Fear\nthat the campaign in CO is starting to go down the same road as last time \xe2\x80\x93\nnot enough of a big tent, too many usual suspects and, related, not\naggressive outreach to those diverse communities \xe2\x80\x93 race, gender, and\ngeography \xe2\x80\x93 who should be engaged early.  I obviously don\xe2\x80\x99t know when you\nplan to have a senior staffer and full team here and recognize the early\nstate focus, but in the meantime, the staffer you do have on the ground\nneeds to be more fully engaged with those community and political leaders\nwho want to be helpful (esp given March 1 caucus date and Sen Sanders\nactivities here).  For example, there are community/political leaders who\nwould be happy to create some sort of HRC campaign presence at community\nevents and just need some materials and minimal staff engagement to do so.\nI should note that Sen Sanders is doing such things already.\n\n\n\nHappy to fully engage myself and others to implement any of the above.\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\n\nSteve\n\n\n303-292-7957    Moye White LLP Attorneys at Law\n16 Market Square 6th Floor 1400 16th Street Denver CO 80202-1486\n*tel* 303 292 2900 *fax* 303 292 4510 *www*.moyewhite.com\n<http://www.moyewhite.com>     > Profile\n<http://www.moyewhite.com/ourattorneys/>  > Download vCard\n<http://www.moyewhite.com/vcard.aspx?ID=>\n<http://www.moyewhite.com/alliance.aspx>\n'
