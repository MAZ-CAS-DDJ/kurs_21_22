(Photo by Patrick T. Fallon for The Washington Post)\nTHE BIG IDEA:\xc2\xa0Senate Majority PAC, the main outside group focused on trying to regain control of the upper chamber for Democrats, will begin running its first television ad of the 2016 cycle today. And it might look familiar: a narrator says GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte puts the Koch brothers ahead of New Hampshire families.\nThe spot, which a source tracking the air war says is backed up by $250,000, comes in response to a much larger buy that Americans for Prosperity, part of the Koch political network, placed against Ayotte\xe2\x80\x99s likely challenger last week.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cFifteen months before the election, yet the out-of-state oil billionaire Koch Brothers have already spent $1.2 million dollars here in New Hampshire to keep Kelly Ayotte in the U.S. Senate,\xe2\x80\x9d a narrator says. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, back in Washington, Ayotte voted to protect huge tax breaks for the oil industry\xe2\x80\x94costing taxpayers $40 billion.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDemocrats spent tens of millions of dollars last year on nearly 100 different commercials that similarly linked Republican candidates with Charles and David Koch. Majority Leader Harry Reid, who regularly railed against the brothers on the Senate floor, liked to say that the GOP was \xe2\x80\x9caddicted to Koch.\xe2\x80\x9d When Reid became the minority leader, some questioned the wisdom of this line of attack.\nBut leading Democratic strategist insist that correlation is not causation: just because they ran lots of ads tying Republicans to special interests and then lost does not mean it\xe2\x80\x99s an ineffective attack. In fact, they believe that tying Scott Brown to the Koch&#8217;s was integral to his narrow loss against Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in the Granite State. They point to several different surveys that show the charge is\xc2\xa0potent, especially when it comes to galvanizing the Democratic base.\nWith the Koch network aiming to spend $889 million in advance of the next election, Democrats promise they will only amplify their\xc2\xa0criticism of the\xc2\xa0brothers. Another outside group, American Bridge 21st Century, announced\xc2\xa0plans earlier this summer to spend heavily on efforts linking the presidential candidates with the Koch\xe2\x80\x99s. We&#8217;ll monitor\xc2\xa0polling to see\xc2\xa0whether the new ad moves numbers.\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n&#8212; Hillary Clinton turned her private email server over to the FBI, trying\xc2\xa0to end the drip-drip-drip of criticism for\xc2\xa0keeping it. Her campaign said last night that the former cabinet secretary\xc2\xa0released the server, along with a thumb drive that includes\xc2\xa0&#8220;thousands of emails&#8221; she already provided to\xc2\xa0the State Department, the Post&#8217;s Carol D. Leonnig, Tom Hamburger and Rosalind S. Helderman report. Clinton&#8217;s announcement followed the revelation that two Top-Secret emails traveled across the server, according to\xc2\xa0a top intelligence official. &#8220;The finding, contained in a letter sent to leaders of key oversight committees, marked the first indication from government officials that information regarded as top secret\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x94 the government\xe2\x80\x99s highest category of security designation \xe2\x80\x94 may have passed across Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s server while she led the State Department.&#8221;\xc2\xa0The disclosure ensures that congressional Republicans will keep this issue\xc2\xa0front-and-center beyond the fall.\n&#8212; A new Franklin Pierce University/Boston Herald survey shows Bernie Sanders now LEADING\xc2\xa0Hillary Clinton by 7 points in New Hampshire,\xc2\xa044 percent to 37 percent. The survey of 442 Democratic primary voters was taken from Aug. 7-10 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percent. The Herald notes\xc2\xa0that Sanders&#8217; rise has been &#8220;meteoric&#8221;: He trailed\xc2\xa0Hillary by 37 points in March (44-8).\n\n&#8212;\xc2\xa0Meanwhile, Donald Trump is still ahead\xc2\xa0among GOP voters in New Hampshire and Republican caucus-goers in Iowa, but there are signs his\xc2\xa0support may be slipping. According to the Herald poll of 447 Republican primary voters taken during the same time period as above, the race is very competitive. While Trump leads with 19 percent, Jeb Bush places second at 13 percent and John Kasich has moved up to third at 12 percent. Trump had a marked &#8220;very unfavorable&#8221; rating at 32 percent.\xc2\xa0In Iowa, Suffolk\xc2\xa0found\xc2\xa0Trump leading the field with 17 percent, followed by Scott Walker with 12 percent and Marco Rubio with 10 percent. But of those likely GOP caucus-goers who watched the debate, Trump and Walker were tied at 14 percent. Suffolk surveyed 500 likely caucus-goers from Aug. 7 to 10 with a 4.4 percent margin of error.\n&#8212; Trump focused his ire on China during an appearance in Michigan last night:\xc2\xa0&#8220;Devalue means: suck the blood out of the United States,&#8221; he told a crowd of 2,800. It came at the end of a day in which he tried to look more substantive, saying he wants to simplify the tax code before trying to create a flat tax. He also\xc2\xa0said that he would consider partly defunding Planned Parenthood, and that on abortion he supports exceptions for rape and incest.\n(realdonaldtrump)\n&#8212; Maryland Gov.

Because of a 2013 Supreme Court decision overturning part of the 50-year-old Voting Rights Act, next year\xe2\x80\x99s presidential election will be the first in which Southern states, including Virginia, will not be required to have election-law changes approved by federal authorities&#8230; In Virginia&#8230;Democrats are working closely with their national counterparts to expand the electorate \xe2\x80\x94 testing ways, for instance, to work around voter-identification laws, narrower voting windows and other restrictions generally backed by Republicans.&#8221;\n&#8212; &#8220;Super PACs\xc2\xa0throw lifelines to candidates scrambling for cash,&#8221; by Matea Gold and Philip Rucker: &#8220;If this were any other election cycle, Rick Perry would have reached the end of his presidential bid this week when his campaign nearly ran out of cash&#8230;Perry\xe2\x80\x99s White House hopes will now live on a little longer, as a result of a trio of cash-rich independent groups&#8230;&#8217;We saw this coming,&#8217; said Austin Barbour, senior adviser to the Opportunity and Freedom PACs, which have begun building their own field operation in Iowa \xe2\x80\x94 a task typically handled by campaigns. &#8216;We knew we would have to do more than just paid media and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in the playbook that says we can\xe2\x80\x99t do that.'&#8221;\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n&#8212; ZIGNAL VISUAL: With our report yesterday that Cruz is going after Rand supporters, here&#8217;s a state-by-state breakdown comparing total mentions of the two candidates across social media.

And on Monday, in a gesture heavy with symbolism, came a new law to erase the word &#8216;alien&#8217; from California&#8217;s labor code&#8230;these piecemeal measures have taken on a significance greater than their individual parts&#8230;The various benefits, rights and protections add up to something experts liken to a kind of California citizenship. &#8216;We&#8217;ve passed the Rubicon here,&#8217; said Mike Madrid, a Republican strategist. &#8216;This is not an academic debate on the U.S. Senate floor about legal and illegal and how high you want to build the wall&#8230;. [The state] doesn&#8217;t have the luxury of being ideological&#8230;. The undocumented are not going anywhere.'&#8221;\n&#8212; The Democratic parties in four states have now voted to change the name of their annual \xe2\x80\x9cJefferson-Jackson\xe2\x80\x9d dinner: Iowa, Georgia, Connecticut and Missouri. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least five other states are considering the same change,\xe2\x80\x9d Jonathan Martin reports in the New York Times. \xe2\x80\x9cFor all the attention this summer to the fight over the Confederate battle flag, the less noticed moves by Democratic parties to remove Jefferson and Jackson from their official identity underscore one of the most consequential trends of American politics: Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 shift from a union-powered party organized primarily around economic solidarity to one shaped by racial and sexual identity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSome pushback that has been largely absent from the conversation thus far: \xe2\x80\x9cThe move to erase Jefferson and Jackson is not being welcomed by all Democrats. Some of them fear the party loses what has long been its unifying philosophy by removing the names of founders, whose virtues and flaws illuminated the way forward. And they worry that as the labor movement declines, cultural liberalism is beginning to eclipse a fundamental message of economic equality that brought about some of the party\xe2\x80\x99s most important achievements, from the New Deal to Medicaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\nUseful historical context: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is partly because of the efforts of Democratic presidents that Jefferson and Jackson enjoy the standing they do. Franklin D. Roosevelt, the father of modern economic liberalism, was particularly devoted to elevating the two men, rushing to complete the Jefferson Memorial so his party could have a monument to compete with the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 Lincoln Memorial. And it was the house intellectual of the Kennedy clan, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., who did so much to restore Jackson with his seminal biography, \xe2\x80\x98The Age of Jackson.\xe2\x80\x99 In more recent times, Bill Clinton memorably began his presidency with a pre-inaugural trip to Monticello and Mr. Obama took the president of France there last year.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHOT ON THE LEFT\nLowe\xe2\x80\x99s shopper gets white driver after refusing black man.
