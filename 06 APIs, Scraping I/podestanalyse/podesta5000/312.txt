They both were architects\nof Governor Hickenlooper\'s recent win, and have huge experience in U.S.\nSenate and Governor\'s races, as well as supporting roles in Presidential\nones.\n\nAlso, you should meet Al Yates-African American, PhD in theoretical\nphysics, former President of Colorado State University, founder of the\nDemocracy Alliance, and ....the list goes on. He singlehandedly has in his\nhead the data analytics of the last ten years in Colorado (funded with huge\nresources) including the explanation of why Mark Udall lost and John\nHickenlooper won. I always won Colorado because of him. I would like to\narrange a time with him and you/ and your team as we get started.\n\nI know there are many good people in Colorado who would want to help, will\nhelp, and are seeking roles or have had roles with you or the President in\nthe past.  The three I mention above have no agenda, are smart, humble and\neffective. In my view, the team you put together in Colorado will be the\nkeystone of your victory here. So please be cautious and on target. I am\navailable to you or your team whenever you want.\n\nAll the best,\n\nKen Salazar\n\n\n\nSent from my iPad\n\nOn Feb 5, 2015, at 4:40 PM, H <hdr29@hrcoffice.com> wrote:\n\nDear Ken,\n\nI so enjoyed seeing you yesterday and appreciate greatly your support and\nfriendship over the years.

I am all in because I know you, believe in\nyou, and share your values.\n\n I will help you as much as I can. Specifically, I would offer to (1) host\nyour first fundraiser in Colorado at Hope\'s and my home (my Mom might even\nmake it if she can); (2) help identify the key elected leaders in Colorado\nlike Representative Crisanta Duran and Mayor Hancock of Denver and host a\nmeeting with you and them; (3) help identify the right political talent in\nColorado; and (4) help as needed across the nation.\n\n You are the best. Cesar Chavez prayed "give me the courage to serve others\nbecause in service there is true life." You have done so in your words and\ndeeds and I look forward to your next chapter of service.\n\n All the best,\n\n Ken Salazar\n\n\n\nSent from my iPad\n\nOn Feb 4, 2015, at 11:55 AM, H <hdr29@hrcoffice.com> wrote:\n\n *This message has no content.*\n'
