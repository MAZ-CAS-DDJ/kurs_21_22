john.podesta@gmail.comb'FYI - his story is already up.\n\nhttp://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/04/clinton-campaign-faults-media-for-shifting-line-on-205863.html\n\nClinton campaign faults media for shifting line on gay marriage\n\n   -\n\n   Hillary Clinton\'s views on marriage equality have evolved.\n\n   Last year, she believed\n   <http://www.npr.org/2014/06/12/321313477/hillary-clinton-the-fresh-air-interview>\nit\n   was a states issue: "For me, marriage had always been a matter left to the\n   states," she told NPR\'s Terry Gross. "I fully endorse the efforts by\n   activists who work state-by-state and in fact that is what is working."\n   Last month, her spokesperson did not respond\n   <http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clintons-unanswered-questions-marriage-equality>\nto\n   a request for comment about her position. Then, last week, a spokesperson\n   said Clinton believes\n   <http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/hillary-clinton-hasnt-said-how-she-thinks-the-supreme-court#.jyxJKV5nnr>\ngay\n   marriage is a constitutional right: "Hillary Clinton supports marriage\n   equality and hopes the Supreme Court will come down on the side of same-sex\n   couples being guaranteed that constitutional right."\n\n   And yet this week, whenever the Clinton campaign is asked about\n   Clinton\'s evolution on gay marriage, a spokesperson responds by claiming\n   that there has been no change. What\'s more, the spokesperson faults the\n   press for misreporting Clinton\'s views.\n\n   On Monday, senior Clinton spokeswoman Karen Finney told MSNBC that\n   Clinton has always been consistent on the issue, but had simply been asked\n   different questions by the media. As MSNBC\'s Craig Melvin was cutting to\n   commercial, he said, "When you come back, next time I do want to talk about\n   the timing of the same-sex marriage change of heart, next time."\n\n   "No change of heart," Finney replied. "[She] was asked a different\n   question than she was asked before, but I\'ll tell you."\n\n   Finney appeared on MSNBC again that afternoon and similarly said her\n   team had "been asked different questions" about marriage equality. "Last\n   week there was a question about where she was on marriage equality, which\n   she\'s had a consistent position on that -- despite the way it was\n   reported," Finney said. "So, you know, when we\'re asked the question, I\n   think part of it, though, is as a spokesperson, we\'re trying not to get\n   ahead of her because she\'s got her platform that she wants to roll out."\n\n   In fact, the questions put to Clinton last year, last month and last\n   week do not vary greatly enough to warrant different responses. NPR\'s Terry\n   Gross asked about Clinton\'s support of marriage equality, which is when\n   Clinton said, "For me, marriage had always been a matter left to the\n   states." Last month and last week, Clinton was asked about where she stands\n   on the constitutionality of marriage equality, and that is when Clinton\n   started referring to it as a "constitutional right" that should be\n   guaranteed by the Supreme Court.\n\n   Reached for comment, Finney provided the latest statement: "Hillary\n   Clinton supports marriage equality and hopes the Supreme Court will come\n   down on the side of same-sex couples being guaranteed that constitutional\n   right."\n\n\nOn Tue, Apr 21, 2015 at 1:22 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Past tense is important, and might be worth sending the bolded transcript\n> from Richard Socarides yesterday that makes that very clear.\n>\n>\n>\n> On Apr 21, 2015, at 1:02 PM, Adrienne Elrod <aelrod@hillaryclinton.com>\n> wrote:\n>\n> great\n>\n>\n> Adrienne K.
