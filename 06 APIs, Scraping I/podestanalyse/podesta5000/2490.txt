But she may reach out to you separately so wanted you to have a heads up as well.\n________________________________________\nFrom: Huma Abedin\nSent: Tuesday, January 20, 2015 10:30:26 AM\nTo: H\nSubject: Karen Dunn\n\nJust spoke with her.\nShe agrees CD won't practically work.\nBut she really wants a role and is willing to offer a lot of her time.  We discussed the same things she raised initially (debate prep and policy) and I suggested she talk to Robby to discuss details.\nShe will reach out to him today.\nYou will likely get a call from her in the next 24 hours officially declining the CD position and saying she's nailed down an alternative  with Robby.\n"
