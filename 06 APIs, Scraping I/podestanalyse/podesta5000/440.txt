One of my sons\nis a twenty-three year old independent, and I asked him about this last\nnight and to put it succinctly, he called back a weakness that having\nwatched my generation grow up, in the last twenty years, women have been\nfreed from feeling like they've had to stay married to those relationships\nthat they didn't have to stick around, so to speak. They didn't have to\nstay by their man. Your relationship with your husband and his\nextracurricular activities have been an issue. For me, they set an example\nfor my children who [inaudible] stay married legitimately for four years.\nYou stay married, people call it an open marriage. Good example, bad\nexample? Am I totally off base?\n\n\n\nHILLARY CLINTON: Well, putting aside the Republican political attacks that\nthey've been making about us on a range of issues for many years. They\nhaven't worked, and I think the American public is interested in what the\nnext President is going to do for them, for their families, and their\ncountry. And in an election you can [inaudible] for you or against you,\nbased on whatever factors they believe are relevant. So that's something\nthat I respect. I feel like this is something that was dealt with in the\nnineties, and I am more than willing to have people draw their own\nconclusions. But, I've been married now for a very long time and I'm very\nproud of that marriage. I'm very proud of the daughter we've raised, I'm\nvery proud of the grandchild we have and the one yet to come. And I think\nyou judge a person on the totality of his or her life. So I'm going to\ncontinue to live my life in accordance with my values and I'm very happy to\nhave a life partner that I've been with for many, many years.\n"
