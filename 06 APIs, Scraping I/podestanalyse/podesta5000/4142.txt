Missing, however, is a conversation about the role of the West as an enabler of such grand corruption. How is it that a significant amount of the stolen money winds up in Western bank accounts? Who else \xe2\x80\x93 besides the kleptocrats themselves \xe2\x80\x93 does it benefit? For a closer, unflinching look at these crucial questions, the Kleptocracy Initiative will host the creators and cast of the documentary From Russia With Cash.\n\nWatch Online - Stream begins at noon [http://hudson.org/events/1299-fighting-kleptocracy122015]              [http://hudson.org/events/1304-u-s-premiere-of-from-russia-with-cash-122015]   On Tuesday, Hudson Institute will host the U.S. premiere of the documentary From Russia With Cash at the Newseum.

In the wake of attacks in the West attributed to ISIS or inspired by the organization, and with a deluge of migrants fleeing its violence, Western and Arab nations are fumbling for answers. On December 18, Hudson Institute will hold a discussion on how to confront the problem consuming the Middle East and implement an effective policy course to destroy ISIS. Hudson Adjunct Fellow Michael Pregent, recently returned from a trip through the Middle East, will share his insights with Senior Fellow Lee Smith.\n\nRegister Here [https://www.eventbrite.com/event/19967233533]          The events above will take place at Hudson's Washington, DC headquarters unless otherwise noted.
