Carle; Page B07\nSen. John McCain has repeatedly characterized the threat of "radical Islamic\nextremism" as "the absolute gravest threat . . . that we\'re in against."\nBefore we simply accept this, we need to examine the nature of the terrorist\nthreat facing our country. If we do so, we will see how we have allowed the\nspecter of that threat to distort our lives and take our treasure.\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/11/AR2008071102710.html\n\n*McCain\'s bill now foreign to him (Palm Beach Post 7/13/08)*\nBy Dan Moffett\nIt\'s easy to forget that just last year, Barack Obama and John McCain were\npart of a bipartisan group that tried to push a comprehensive immigration\nreform bill through the Senate. Their effort failed, and now that they\'re\ncampaigning against each other, it gets very confusing trying to figure out\nwho actually did what with the bill, or who was even there to watch it die.\nhttp://www.palmbeachpost.com/opinion/content/opinion/epaper/2008/07/13/a2e_moffettcol_0713.html\n\n*How McCain Can Use a Struggling Economy to Beat Obama (Richmond\nTimes-Dispatch 7/13/08)*\nBy BOB RAYNER\nAmercians are smart, but we like to be able to conjure simple ideas about\nour prospective leaders.

Broder; B07\nJohn McCain is the candidate who actually had experience as a wartime flier,\nbut Barack Obama is the one who has most successfully adapted a favorite\ntactic of those intrepid aviators.

Given that effusive\nshow of respect for military experience in 2004, you would think no Democrat\nthis year could even contemplate disparaging John McCain\'s far more\nextensive military career. ... Yet in recent months, one Democrat after\nanother has gone out of his way to diminish or criticize McCain\'s war\nrecord.
