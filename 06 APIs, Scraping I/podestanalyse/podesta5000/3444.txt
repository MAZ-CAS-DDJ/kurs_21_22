john.podesta@gmail.comb'\n\nDear Mr Podesta\n\nI work on BBC News\' award-winning radio history programme, Witness, in which we talk to people who lived through, or witnessed, great events in history.\n\nWe want to do an edition on the historic handshake between Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin, in September 1993, to be broadcast next week.\n\nAnd we want to get a sense of what was going on behind the scenes that day - the last minute flurry of negotiations, the atmosphere, the worries about what might or might not go wrong; the scene which President Clinton recounts in his memoirs of how he and his aides practised  what might happen if Chairman Arafat moved to embrace Prime Minister Rabin, and how to ensure that they did shake hands. Witness is a programme of personal memories and we would be delighted if you would be willing to share with us your memories of that day.\n\nWith best wishes\n\nLouise\nLouise Hidalgo\nPresenter/Senior Producer\n"Witness", BBC World Service\nTel: 44 (0) 20 361 41143\nMob: 44 (0) 7800 835 325\n\nNamed "Best Speech Programme" at the Sony Radio Awards 2013 http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p004t1hd\n\n\n'
