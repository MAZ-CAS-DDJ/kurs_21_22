john.podesta@gmail.comb"Hi Mr.Podesta,\n\nI graduated from the University of West Georgia with a Bachelor of Science in Sociology in July 2013. I have been searching for a job in politics since graduating. I did a Fellowship Internship for the Michelle Nunn for US Senate & Jason Carter for Governor Campaign through GA Victory 2014 this past fall. Anyway, do you have any information on paid full time jobs with Hillary Clinton's Presidential campaign once she announces in April? I can send you my resume if you would like? I look forward to hearing back from you soon!\n\nThank You,\n\nRyan Decos \n\nSent from my iPhone"
