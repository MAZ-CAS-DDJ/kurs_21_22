Barack Obama set the record straight on where he stands\nversus John McCain in regard to education and the country\'s economic\nfuture. \n\nThe following can be attributed to NEA President Reg Weaver:\n \n"We finally have an opportunity for leadership that is more concerned\nabout fixing problems than just ignoring them. Sen. Barack Obama\'s\nproposed education and economic policies are exactly what we need to\nbegin fixing and improving our public schools. Sen. Obama clearly\nunderstands that it\'s time for policies that reflect the fundamental\ntruth that we rise or fall as one nation. He recognizes that if our\ncountry is going to recover from the economic and social challenges we\ncurrently face we have got to invest in the education of our students.\nMcCain chooses to deny our children early childhood programs, hinders\nthe hiring of quality teachers, and has voted to make the prospect of\ncollege affordability all but a memory. \n\n"McCain also continues to embrace the tired old rhetoric on vouchers.\nMcCain\'s education plan will only further damage our public schools by\nstarving them of much-needed funding. It won\'t provide public school\nstudents with what they really need-up-to-date textbooks and computers,\na qualified, caring teacher in the classroom, smaller class sizes, and\nparental and community involvement-and the money to make it happen. Sen.\nObama opposes using public money for private school vouchers. And as\nSen. Obama said so well, \'we need to focus on fixing and improving our\npublic schools; not throwing our hands up and walking away from them.\'\n\n"If you want to make public schools great, ask a teacher. Sen. Obama has\nlistened and responded to the nation\'s educators by putting forth a plan\nthat answers the needs of students and their teachers. Obama is\ncommitted to transforming public education so that all students can\nreach their full potential; and he is committed to fully funding\nnecessary programs that will help students succeed.  That\'s why NEA and\nits 3.2 million members-teachers, education support professionals,\nhigher education faculty, and students-have endorsed Barack Obama, a\ntrue friend of public education and the nation\'s students.  As\neducators, registered voters, and concerned members of society, we stand\nwith him in support of these ideals, and we will be ready to do all that\nwe can to make the future better for our children and America when he\ntakes office in 2009."\n\n # # #\n\nThe National Education Association is the nation\'s largest professional\nemployee organization, representing\n3.2 million elementary and secondary teachers, higher education faculty,\neducation support professionals, school administrators, retired\neducators and students preparing to become teachers.\n\n\nKim Anderson\nManager for Issue Advocacy\nNational Education Association\n1201 16th Street, NW--Suite 510\nWashington, DC 20036\n202-822-7341; fax: 202-822-7309\nC:  202-251-5578\nKanderson@nea.org\n*******************************************************************\nOnly the individual sender is responsible for the content of the\nmessage, and the message does not necessarily reflect the position\nor policy of the National Education Association or its affiliates.\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
