We've got a few bullets at the start about Paris and ISIS, and a\n> strong section on healthcare.   I've added more of the core economic\n> message from the stump near the start.  Also added a few bullets about gun\n> violence, since we are in Charleston.\n>\n> If you could please send me edits by 7pm, I'd appreciate it.\n>\n> Thanks.\n>\n"
