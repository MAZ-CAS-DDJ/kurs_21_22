Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nUntil now, Clinton has been the overwhelming frontrunner for the Democratic\nnomination in just about all national and early primary and caucus state\npolling. But the Suffolk survey, conducted June 11-15, indicates Sanders\ncould give the former secretary of state a real fight in the\nfirst-in-the-nation primary state. The independent senator who describes\nhimself as a democratic socialist is energizing many on the left, including\nsupporters of liberal hero Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who\xe2\x80\x99s\npassing on a White House run.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poll is not a home run for Bernie Sanders, but it could be\ncharacterized as a line shot to deep left field,\xe2\x80\x9d David Paleologos,director\nof the Suffolk University Political Research Center,\n<http://www.suffolk.edu/SUPRC> told NH1 News.\n\nThe survey suggests gender and philosophical divides between the two\ncandidates.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a clear gender gap among Democrats in New Hampshire. Among women\nClinton led Sanders 47-28%, but among men she trailed 35-32%,\xe2\x80\x9d Paleologos\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cPolitical philosophy divided the candidates. Among moderate\nDemocrats, Clinton led Sanders 46-26%, but among self-identified liberals,\nthe race is tied 39-39%.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Suffolk University poll is the second straight survey to indicate a\nreal race between Clinton and Sanders in New Hampshire. A survey released a\ncouple of days ago by Morning Consultant\n<http://morningconsult.com/2015/06/clinton-leads-in-early-states-but-sanders-popular-in-new-hampshire/>\nindicated\nClinton at 44% and Sanders at 32%.\n\nAccording to the Suffolk poll, Vice President Joe Biden\xe2\x80\x99s at 7% support.\nThe vice president has not ruled out running again for the Democratic\nnomination, but he has taken no visible steps towards setting up any kind\nof campaign structure. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, who recently\nannounced his bid for the nomination, stands at three percent in the\nsurvey. Former Rhode Island governor and senator Lincoln Chafee, who\xe2\x80\x99s also\nan announced candidate, is at one percent, as is former Sen. Jim Webb of\nVirginia, who\xe2\x80\x99s mulling a White House run.\n\nFifteen percent are undecided.\n\nThe poll indicates that two-thirds of likely Democratic voters are very or\nsomewhat satisfied about the field of presidential candidates, with 29%\nsomewhat or very dissatisfied.\n\nSeventy-two percent of those polled said they have a favorable opinion of\nClinton, with 19% saying they see her in an unfavorable light and 8%\nunsure. Sanders has a 62%-9% favorable/unfavorable rating, with a third\nundecided.\n\nOf those who are not backing Clinton, 12% said it\xe2\x80\x99s because they don\xe2\x80\x99t\ntrust her or think she lies or is corrupt, with 10% saying they prefer\nSanders.\n\nFive-hundred likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire were\nquestioned by telephone in the Suffolk University poll. The survey\xe2\x80\x99s\noverall sampling error is plus or minus 4.4% pts.\n\n\n\n-- \n\nJosh Schwerin\n\nSpokesperson\n\nHillary for America\n\n@JoshSchwerin\n'
