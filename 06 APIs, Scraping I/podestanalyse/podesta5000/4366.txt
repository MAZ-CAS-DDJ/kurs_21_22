john.podesta@gmail.comb'If you are both engaging with him, then I will leave to you. He\'s been a regular caller to remind us of all the things we aren\'t doing over last few months. But it sounds like you have both neutralized him for the time being.\nFwiw, I think he\'s working all of us so hard because he felt no reassurance from HRC that he\'s guaranteed anything this time around.\n________________________________\nFrom: Mike Vlacich <mvlacich@gmail.com>\nSent: Friday, February 13, 2015 10:18:50 PM\nTo: Robby Mook\nCc: Huma Abedin; John Podesta\nSubject: Re: Radio taped interview with President Clinton\n\nHeh, he left that part out in our breakfast yesterday.

I didn\'t get into too much detail about my role, but I assured him that I am very excited about the way things are shaping up and I envision a very inclusive campaign structure here in NH.\n\nIt may not be bad for periodic check-ins from "National HQ", I had discussed this a little with Robby.  If we\'re reaching out on our timetable, it might spare headquarters more frequent calls from Terry in the long run.\n\nI have been giving this some thought and will have a few more suggestions soon.  I want to keep him in fold while also being mindful that there are a lot of other people who want to be in leadership roles up here too.\n\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Feb 13, 2015, at 9:59 PM, Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com<mailto:huma@hrcoffice.com>> wrote:\n\nMinus others.\nAt some point, Mike, we need to address what to do with Terry. He still very much wants to play a central leadership role in NH. And I\'m not sure how you feel about that. As you know, he caused some issues for us in mid-terms.\n________________________________\nFrom: Tina Flournoy <Tina@presidentclinton.com<mailto:Tina@presidentclinton.com>>\nSent: Thursday, February 5, 2015 2:15:05 PM\nTo: Mike Vlacich; Robby Mook\nCc: Huma Abedin; John Podesta; Nick Merrill\nSubject: RE: Radio taped interview with President Clinton\n\nI talked to Terry Shumaker and told him we couldn\x92t do it.

We really enjoyed all of it and especially the chance to visit with him at the villa Friday evening.  As I may have mentioned, Dan had not seen him since \x9292 in Concord.\n\nBelow is the radio interview request from Jack Heath who has the top rated morning radio talk show in NH.  When the president was running and in office, Jack was the news director at WMUR-TV, our ABC affiliate.  Jack interviewed him numerous times up here and at least once in the oval office. He was always respectful and very fair and I am pretty sure WJC will remember him.  The Governor, Legislature and Secretary Gardner are making a big deal out of the 100th anniversary of our primary over the next year.  A special Commission on which I serve was set up to oversee the commemorative events etc.  In my opinion no one has done more to shine a light on the NH Primary and keep it first than WJC with his supportive comments nationally over the years so it is most fitting that he be interviewed about his campaign here and talk about what the NH Primary means for candidates, the races and selection of the ultimate nominees.\n\nIf you or anyone else has any questions, please do not hesitate to let me know.  My cell is 603-496-9919; office number is below.  As noted, Jack would like to do this before Feb. 9, but I am sure will do whatever he can to accommodate the president\x92s schedule.  Thanks for considering this.\n\nBest,  Terry\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerry Shumaker\nShareholder\ntshumaker@bernsteinshur.com<mailto:tshumaker@bernsteinshur.com>\n603 665-8826 direct\n603 623-8700 main\nMy Bio<http://www.bernsteinshur.com/attorney/edward-e-shumaker/> | LinkedIn<http://www.linkedin.com/pub/terry-shumaker/8/18/b07> | Twitter<http://twitter.com/bernsteinshur>\n\nBERNSTEIN SHUR | Click for Address: Manchester, NH<http://www.bernsteinshur.com/offices/manchester-nh/> | Portland, ME<http://www.bernsteinshur.com/offices/portland-me/> | Augusta, ME<http://www.bernsteinshur.com/offices/augusta-me/> | bernsteinshur.com<http://www.bernsteinshur.com>\nMember, Lex Mundi, the world\'s leading association of independent law firms.\n\nConfidentiality notice: This message is intended only for the person to whom addressed in the text above and may contain privileged or confidential information.

I am interviewing Bill Gardner, NH Secretary of State and one of his favorite reference points is when Bill Clinton finished 2nd in 1992 but essentially won.\nAs you know, I have interviewed President Clinton on several occasions, including in the Oval Office when I was News Director of WMUR TV. Mr. Clinton also invited me to interview him in White Plains NY when he was President.\nMy show airs daily on WGIR AM 610, 96.7FM in Portsmouth and on iHeartRadio live daily from 6 to 9am. I would request a pre tape call in interview with President Clinton some morning any day between next week and before February 9th.\nThe call in number is 6036416565.\nAgain, the sole topic is his reflection on the NH Primary, why it works and why it is special.\n\nThanks,\nJack Heath, 6037142607\nReference sites www.wgiram.com<http://www.wgiram.com> and NewsRadio 96.7FM.\n\n\nSent from my Verizon Wireless 4G LTE Smartphone\n'
