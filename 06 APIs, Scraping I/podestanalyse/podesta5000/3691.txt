The chair of the GOP was asked about it today and condemned but it was covered by all of the core Iowa political reporters who will be there tomorrow. On guns - this is an issue organizers have heard a lot about from activists in Iowa City. \n> \n>> On Mon, Jul 6, 2015 at 7:43 PM, Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com> wrote:\n>> \n>> I like a lot of this and love the grannies, but I am concerned about a number of things:\n>> \n>> --What happened to our core economic point that the deck is still stacked for those at the top?

They\'re meant as a guide, but she won\'t be reading it word-for-word.  We\'ve tried to take the riffs she\'s been doing recently, including in New Hampshire this weekend, and combine them with the future/past contrast we all believe she should be doing more of, plus some local flavor supplied by Matt and his team. \n>> \n>> Dan\n> \n> \n> \n> -- \n> Lily Adams\n> Iowa Communications Director\n> Hillary for America\n> c: 202-368-4013\n'
