Adding Milia to make sure he is good given that the admin\nhas not actually put out the plan that we are praising yet (at least\nformally - it\'s in the nyt!).\n\n\n\nOn Aug 2, 2015, at 9:05 AM, Jesse Ferguson <jferguson@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nJake/John, are we good/should we send now?

It sets a smart federal\nstandard that gives states the flexibility to choose how to reduce carbon\npollution most effectively.  And it drives investments in clean energy and\nenergy efficiency, reduces asthma attacks and premature deaths, and\npromotes a healthier environment and a stronger economy.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a good plan,\nand as President, I\xe2\x80\x99d defend it.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will need defending.  Because Republican doubters and defeatists \xe2\x80\x93\nincluding every Republican candidate for president \xe2\x80\x93 won\xe2\x80\x99t offer any\ncredible solution.  The truth is, they don\xe2\x80\x99t want one.  They just keep\nmaking the same tired arguments they\xe2\x80\x99ve been making for years.  They refuse\nto accept science.  They refuse to believe in American ingenuity and\nentrepreneurship, even though we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen time and time again that a clean\nenvironment and a strong economy go hand-in-hand.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, the Clean Power Plan standards set the floor, not the ceiling.  We\ncan and must go further. As President, I will launch a Clean Energy\nChallenge to give states, cities and rural communities that are ready to\nlead the tools and resources to succeed.  By combining the Clean Power Plan\nwith my Clean Energy Challenge, we\xe2\x80\x99ll achieve two big goals:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2         We will have half of a billion installed solar panels by the end\nof my first term in office,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2         We will generate enough renewable energy to power every home in\nAmerica within 10 years of my taking office.\n\n\n\n"As President, I will build on the work of this Administration and make\nAmerica a clean energy superpower and a global leader in the fight against\nclimate change.  That\xe2\x80\x99s a promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\nFor Immediate Release, August 2, 2015\n\nContact: press@hillaryclinton.com\n\n\n\nPAID FOR BY HILLARY FOR AMERICA\n\nContributions or gifts to Hillary for America are not tax deductible.\n\nHillary for America, PO Box 5256, New York\n'
