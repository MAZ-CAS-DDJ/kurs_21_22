john.podesta@gmail.comb'Team \xe2\x80\x93 attached are the toplines and memo (also pasted below) from our IA\nprimary survey.  We have a call scheduled for WED at 1030EST to review.\n\n\n\n*From:* John Anzalone [mailto:john@algpolling.com]\n*Sent:* Monday, June 29, 2015 5:28 PM\n*To:* Oren Shur\n*Subject:* June IA Trend Poll\n\n\n\nThe race in Iowa is relatively stable.  While Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s popularity\nand vote share are slightly lower than they were at the beginning of the\nyear, they\xe2\x80\x99re nearly identical to where they were in March.  And while\nBernie Sanders has added popularity and vote share, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a big\ndifference between what he\xe2\x80\x99s getting now, and Elizabeth Warren\xe2\x80\x99s vote share\nin our previous poll; while it looks like Sanders absorbed the Warren vote\nvery quickly, Clinton still leads by over 30 points.\n\n\n\nWhile there\xe2\x80\x99s been some erosion in measures of HRC\xe2\x80\x99s honesty, as many of\nthese caucus-goers are following news about her emails and the CGI, most of\nher traits are still strong and stable.  What\xe2\x80\x99s really remarkable about\nthis poll is the narrow range in which her vote moves when we offer more\npositive and negative information on the candidate field.  HRC\xe2\x80\x99s vote stays\nwithin a 55-58% range from the beginning of the poll to the end, though\nvoters hear positive about Sanders and O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, positive about Clinton,\nnegative about Clinton, and negative about Sanders. Sanders only ranges\nfrom 25-28% throughout the simulated communication, and O\xe2\x80\x99Malley only\nranges from 5-7%.  It\xe2\x80\x99s possible we\xe2\x80\x99ll see a relatively stable race for the\nforeseeable future.\n\n\n\n*The Current Vote*\n\n\n\nBallot Tracking\n\n*June*\n\n*March*\n\n*Late February*\n\n*Early February*\n\nHillary Clinton\n\n57%\n\n57%\n\n58%\n\n61%\n\nMartin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\n\n5%\n\n1%\n\n1%\n\n1%\n\nLincoln Chafee\n\n1%\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nBernie Sanders\n\n25%\n\n5%\n\n7%\n\n5%\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nNA\n\n21%\n\n20%\n\n17%\n\nUndecided\n\n13%\n\n6%\n\n7%\n\n6%\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by more than 30 points (57% Clinton /\n25% Sanders / 5% O\xe2\x80\x99Malley / 1% Chafee / 13% undecided).  Right now Sanders\nis dominating the non-Clinton vote, and his high name identification (72%)\nmay make it hard for the other challengers to find a lane.\n\n\n\nSanders seems to have picked up the Warren vote fairly quickly, but it\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear that there\xe2\x80\x99s been much growth in the non-Clinton vote since\nMarch. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 current vote share (25%) is very similar to the sum of\nSanders + Warren from March (26%), another sign of the relative stability\nin the race.\n\n\n\nJune 2015\n\n*Total*\n\n*Men*\n\n*Women*\n\nHillary Clinton\n\n57%\n\n46%\n\n65%\n\nMartin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\n\n5%\n\n7%\n\n3%\n\nLincoln Chafee\n\n1%\n\n1%\n\n1%\n\nBernie Sanders\n\n25%\n\n30%\n\n21%\n\nUndecided\n\n13%\n\n15%\n\n11%\n\n\n\nThe real story here is gender, with Clinton holding a 44-point lead over\nSanders among women, and a 16-point lead over Sanders among men.  Gender\nappears to be a bigger factor than ideology at this point, with Clinton\nover 60% among liberal and non-liberal women, and under 50% among liberal\nand non-liberal men.\n\n\n\nJune 2015\n\n*Total*\n\n*Core*\n\n*2008 / New*\n\nHillary Clinton\n\n57%\n\n55%\n\n59%\n\nMartin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\n\n5%\n\n5%\n\n4%\n\nLincoln Chafee\n\n1%\n\n1%\n\n1%\n\nBernie Sanders\n\n25%\n\n27%\n\n22%\n\nUndecided\n\n13%\n\n12%\n\n13%\n\n\n\nClinton leads by 28 points among \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d caucus-goers (those with multiple\ncaucuses in their voting history), and by 37 points among the expansion\nuniverse who voted in 2008 only, or are new to the process. We\xe2\x80\x99ve\nconsistently seen a bigger lead for Clinton among the expansion universe\nthan among the core caucus-goers. But in this poll, we\xe2\x80\x99re up a little with\nthe core caucus-goers, and down a little with the expansion universe, so\nthe difference between HRC\xe2\x80\x99s vote share among core (55%) and expansion\n(59%) caucus-goers is slightly smaller than it was last time (52% core /\n61% expansion).\n\n\n\n*Candidate Support Measures: HRC*\n\n\n\nFav / Unfav\n\n*June*\n\n*March*\n\n*Late February*\n\n*Early February*\n\nHillary Clinton\n\n85% / 12%\n\n87% / 11%\n\n91% / 7%\n\n92% / 5%\n\nMartin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\n\n33% / 8%\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n17% / 3%\n\nBernie Sanders\n\n64% / 8%\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n43% / 5%\n\n\n\nClinton currently receives an 85% favorable / 12% unfavorable rating, very\nsimilar to her 87% favorable / 11% unfavorable rating in March. Her very\nfavorable rating (50%) is almost unchanged since March (51%), as is her\nvery unfavorable rating (5% June / 6% March). The stability in her\npopularity is very good news, as is the stability in her job rating as\nSecretary of State (unchanged since March at 90% approve / 9% disapprove).\n\n\n\nJune 2015\n\n*Total*\n\n*Core*\n\n*2008 / New*\n\nHillary Clinton\n\n85% / 12%\n\n88% / 10%\n\n84% / 14%\n\nMartin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\n\n33% / 8%\n\n43% / 5%\n\n26% / 10%\n\nBernie Sanders\n\n64% / 8%\n\n74% / 5%\n\n56% / 11%\n\n\n\nClinton continues to show strong popularity with both core and expansion\nvoters.  She\xe2\x80\x99s at 88% favorable / 10% unfavorable with core caucus-goers,\nand 84% favorable / 14% unfavorable with the expansion universe.  Her vote\nhas consistently been higher with the expansion universe, while her\nfavorable rating has consistently been higher with the core universe.\n\n\n\nClinton Attributes\n\n(Net 5-7 minus 1-3)\n\n*June*\n\n*March*\n\n*Early Feb*\n\n*Net Change since last test*\n\nStrong Leader\n\n+77\n\n+77\n\n+85\n\n+0\n\nWill fight for people like you\n\n+66\n\n\n\n+74\n\n-8\n\nFresh ideas / new approach\n\n+60\n\n\n\n+56\n\n+4\n\nIn touch with the lives of ordinary Americans\n\n+55\n\n+54\n\n+61\n\n+1\n\nIs Honest\n\n+51\n\n+65\n\n\n\n-14\n\nWould hold WS accountable\n\n+43\n\n+51\n\n\n\n-8\n\nToo political / calculated\n\n+19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile our numbers are good on most traits tested, there has been erosion on\nhonesty (-14 since March) and holding Wall Street accountable (-8 since\nMarch).  And a majority (51%) think HRC is \xe2\x80\x9ctoo political and calculated.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn the context of the negative media barrage we\xe2\x80\x99ve faced, and the entrance\nof Sanders into the race, it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising to see erosion on honesty and\nfighting Wall Street.\n\n\n\nWhen we ask voters whether the news they\xe2\x80\x99re hearing about HRC is positive,\nnegative, or mixed, 60% say it\xe2\x80\x99s been mixed.  And when we ask what they\xe2\x80\x99ve\nbeen hearing about, 27% volunteer something related to the emails, 17%\nvolunteer something related to the CGI, and another 9% volunteer something\nBenghazi-related.  Only 12% volunteer something related to her campaigning\nin Iowa, and just 7% volunteer something related to our core message on\nfighting for everyday Americans / middle class / small business / women.\n\n\n\nBut while these news stories are registering with people, general\nimpressions of HRC are still strong. When we ask for the first words that\ncome to mind when they think of Clinton, caucus-goers\xe2\x80\x99 reactions are\noverwhelmingly positive. Most offer something related to intelligence,\nstrength, or experience, and only 16% volunteer something negative.\n\n\n\n*Candidate Support Measures: Bernie Sanders*\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 popularity (64% favorable) and name ID (72%) have grown\nconsiderably since June, when fewer than 50% could rate him (43% favorable\n/ 5% unfavorable). But his popularity and name identification aren\xe2\x80\x99t much\nbetter than Elizabeth Warren\xe2\x80\x99s were in March (63% favorable / 66% name ID)\nso we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a recent comparison with a very liberal candidate of similar\npopularity, and it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come as a surprise that Sanders and Warren\ndraw similar vote share in our two most recent polls.\n\n\n\nDespite his high name identification, Sanders is less defined than HRC.  In\nopen-ended questions, only 8% *can\xe2\x80\x99t *come up with a specific association\nwith Hillary Clinton, while 36% *can\xe2\x80\x99t *tell you what comes to mind when\nthey think of Sanders.\n\n\n\n*Candidate Support Measures: Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley*\n\n\n\nMartin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley has more than doubled his name identification (from 20% to\n42%) but it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t translated into vote for him. Most of his growth has\ncome with the core universe (he\xe2\x80\x99s up to 43% favorable with them) but\nSanders is still 31 points higher in total favorable with the core\nuniverse, and 31 points higher in very favorable, which is making it hard\nfor O\xe2\x80\x99Malley to get traction.\n\n\n\n*Vote Stability*\n\n\n\n*The biggest story in this poll is the stability of the vote in informed\nre-tests*.  After positives on Sanders and O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, positive on Clinton,\nnegative on Clinton, and negative on Sanders, the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 vote shares\nstay highly stable.  This is an important caution against over-reacting to\nincoming attacks, and against attacking Sanders.\n\n\n\nVote Dynamics\n\n*Current*\n\n*BS/MOM POS*\n\n*HRC POS*\n\n*HRC NEG*\n\n*BS NEG*\n\nHillary Clinton\n\n57%\n\n55%\n\n58%\n\n57%\n\n58%\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley\n\n5%\n\n6%\n\n6%\n\n6%\n\n6%\n\nLincoln Chafee\n\n1%\n\n1%\n\n1%\n\n1%\n\n1%\n\nBernie Sanders\n\n25%\n\n27%\n\n26%\n\n28%\n\n26%\n\nUndecided\n\n13%\n\n11%\n\n9%\n\n8%\n\n8%\n\n\n\nDespite positive graphs on Sanders and O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, there\xe2\x80\x99s very little change\nin the first informed vote. This is particularly rough for O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, who\nstarts with much lower name identification than Sanders, and who would\nexpect to get more movement out of a positive informed graph. But O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\nonly goes from 5% to 6% in the informed vote.\n\n\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s very little movement in HRC\xe2\x80\x99s vote after we read a positive graph\nabout her, which is to be expected given her high level of definition.  The\ngood news is that there\xe2\x80\x99s also very little movement after a battery of\nnegatives against her (each respondent heard 5 items), and her vote share\nremains at 57%. Even after the HRC negatives, Sanders is only at 28%,\nsuggesting a period of relative stability in the race.\n\n\n\n*Candidate Negatives*\n\n\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of intensity to the HRC negatives, which is part of the\nreason they don\xe2\x80\x99t move the vote against her.  They\xe2\x80\x99re bunched up in\nintensity, with the strongest (TPP) at just 15% much less likely, and most\nin the 10-12% range in intensity. This is a far cry from the 40% threshold\nwe expect to see in a strong negative that would get traction and affect\nvote. We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t over-react to attacks in Iowa.\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 negatives also test with low intensity, though the two\nstrongest test better than the Clinton negatives.  Guns (25% much less\nlikely) and ethanol (23% much less likely) both get moderate traction, but\nagain fall well short of the 40% threshold we usually use to judge a strong\nnegative.  Given that the Sanders negatives don\xe2\x80\x99t really move the vote\nagainst him, and that his vote doesn\xe2\x80\x99t move much when we test attacks\nagainst HRC, there seems to be little margin in going after him right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 John Anzalone\n\nAnzalone Liszt Grove Research\n\n334-387-3121\n\nwww.algpolling.com\n\ntwitter: @AnzaloneLiszt\n'
