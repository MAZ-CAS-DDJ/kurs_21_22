Russell, and two Democratic members of the commission,\nStuart J. Ishimaru and Christine M. Griffin, also said that the rule was\nunnecessary for the protection of employees and potentially confusing to\nemployers.\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 already prohibits employment\ndiscrimination based on religion, Mr. Russell said, and the courts have\ndefined "religion" broadly to include "moral or ethical beliefs as to what\nis right and wrong, which are sincerely held with the strength of\ntraditional religious views."\n\nMr. Ishimaru and senior members of the commission staff said that neither\nthe Department of Health and Human Services nor the White House had\nconsulted their agency before issuing the proposed rule. The White House Office\nof Management and\nBudget<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/o/office_of_management_and_budget/index.html?inline=nyt-org>received\nthe proposal on Aug. 21 and cleared it on the same day, according\nto a government Web site that keeps track of the rule-making process.\n\nThe protest from the commission comes on the heels of other objections to\nthe rule by doctors, pharmacists, hospitals, state attorneys general and\npolitical leaders, including President-elect Barack\nObama<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per>\n.\n\nMr. Obama has said the proposal will raise new hurdles to women seeking\nreproductive health services, like abortion and some contraceptives. Michael\nO. Leavitt<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/michael_o_leavitt/index.html?inline=nyt-per>,\nthe health and human services secretary, said that was not the purpose.\n\nOfficials at the Health and Human Services Department said they intended to\nissue a final version of the rule within days. Aides and advisers to Mr.\nObama said he would try to rescind it, a process that could take three to\nsix months.\n\nTo avoid the usual rush of last-minute rules, the White House said in May\nthat new regulations should be proposed by June 1 and issued by Nov. 1. The\n"provider conscience" rule missed both deadlines.\n\nUnder the White House directive, the deadlines can be waived "in\nextraordinary circumstances." Administration officials were unable to say\nimmediately why an exception might be justified in this case.\n\nThe proposal is supported by the United States Conference of Catholic\nBishops<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_states_conference_of_catholic_bishops/index.html?inline=nyt-org>and\nthe Catholic Health Association, which represents Catholic hospitals.\n\nSister Carol Keehan, president of the Catholic Health Association, said that\nin recent years, "we have seen a variety of efforts to force Catholic and\nother health care providers to perform or refer for abortions and\nsterilizations."\n\nBut the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, the American Hospital\nAssociation, the American Medical\nAssociation<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/american_medical_association/index.html?inline=nyt-org>,\n28 senators, more than 110 representatives and the attorneys general of 13\nstates have urged the Bush administration to withdraw the proposed rule.\n\nPharmacies said the rule would allow their employees to refuse to fill\nprescriptions<http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/getting-a-prescription-filled/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier>for\ncontraceptives and could "lead to\nMedicaid<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicaid/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier>patients\nbeing turned away." State officials said the rule could void state\nlaws that require insurance plans to cover contraceptives and require\nhospitals to offer emergency\ncontraception<http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/birth-control-and-family-planning/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier>to\nrape<http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/rape/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier>victims.\n\nThe Ohio Health Department said the rule "could force family planning\nproviders to hire employees who may refuse to do their jobs" \x97 a concern\nechoed by Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood\nFederation<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/p/planned_parenthood_federation_of_america/index.html?inline=nyt-org>of\nAmerica.\n\nUnder the Civil Rights Act, an employer must make reasonable accommodations\nfor an employee\'s religious practices, unless the employer can show that\ndoing so would cause "undue hardship on the conduct of its business."\n\nIn a letter commenting on the proposed rule, Mr. Ishimaru and Ms. Griffin,\nfrom the employment commission, said that 40 years of court decisions had\ncarefully balanced "employees\' rights to religious freedom and employers\'\nbusiness needs."\n\nThe proposed rule, they said, "would throw this entire body of law into\nquestion."\n\nMr. Leavitt, a leading proponent of the rule, said it would increase\ncompliance with laws adopted since 1973 to protect health care workers.\n\n"Federal law," he said, "is explicit and unwavering in protecting federally\nfunded medical practitioners from being coerced into providing treatments\nthey find morally objectionable."\n\nAs an example of the policies to which they object, Bush administration\nofficials cited a Connecticut law that generally requires hospitals to\nprovide rape victims with timely access to and information about emergency\ncontraception.\n\nGov. M. Jodi Rell<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/m_jodi_rell/index.html?inline=nyt-per>of\nConnecticut, a Republican, said the state law represented "an earnest\ncompromise" between the rights of rape victims and the interests of health\ncare practitioners who had moral or religious scruples against emergency\ncontraception.\n\nThe state attorney general, Richard\nBlumenthal<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/richard_blumenthal/index.html?inline=nyt-per>,\na Democrat, said the proposed regulation "would blow apart solutions and\ncompromises that have been reached by people of good will in Connecticut and\nelsewhere."\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail lori@progressiveaccountability.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
