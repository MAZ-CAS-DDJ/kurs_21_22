It has doubled in size over the last 14 years.  During the period 1973 to \n1985 the  financial sector never earned more than 16% of domestic profits.  \nThis decade, it has averaged 41% of all  the profits earned by businesses in \nthe U.S.  In 1947 the financial sector represented  only 2.5% of our gross \ndomestic product. In 2006 it had risen to 8%.  In other words, of every 12.5 \ndollars  earned in the United States, one goes to the financial sector, \nmuch of which,  let us recall, produces nothing. \nMost of that growth has not been among community or regional banks -- or  \ncredit unions.  I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about  Wall Street. \nWall Street\xe2\x80\x99s growth is one big reason that most of America\xe2\x80\x99s economic \ngrowth during the  last decade has flowed into the hands of investment bankers, \nstock traders and  partners in firms like Goldman Sachs. The Center on \nBudget and Policy Priorities  reports that fully two-thirds of all income gains \nduring the last economic  expansion (2002 to 2007) flowed to the top 1% of \nthe population.  And that, in turn, is one of the chief  reasons why the \nmedian income for ordinary Americans actually dropped by $2,197  per year since \n2000.   \nNo surprise then that  disproportionate numbers of the \xe2\x80\x9cbest and brightest\xe2\x80\x9d\n graduates of our finest  universities headed off to Wall Street.  After \nall, that\xe2\x80\x99s where if you are very clever you can make tens of  millions of \ndollars before you are thirty \xe2\x80\x93 mostly producing nothing.  \nBy 2007 the top 50  hedge and private equity fund managers averaged $588 \nmillion in annual  compensation each \xe2\x80\x93 more than 19,000 times as much as the \naverage  U.S. worker.  And by the way, the hedge fund managers  paid a tax \nrate on their incomes of only 15% -- far lower than the rates paid by  their \nsecretaries. \nThis huge wealth  transfer from the \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d economy to the world of finance \nhas also created a  vicious cycle of increased credit dependency.  If your \nfamily\xe2\x80\x99s real income isn\xe2\x80\x99t going  up, but costs are, you try to borrow to \nstay afloat.  That is one reason why private debt now  equals 350% of the \nGross Domestic Product \xe2\x80\x93 the highest ever.  The more debt that consumers owe to \nthe  shrinking number of big financial institutions, the greater the share \nof their  shrinking or stagnant incomes that is siphoned off to the finance \nsector \xe2\x80\x93 and  the cycle just gets worse.  And when  the disposable income of \nordinary Americans shrinks, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the money  to buy the new \nproducts and services that will fuel long term economic growth in  the real \neconomy. \nSomething is very  wrong in this picture. \nIn fact, as last year\xe2\x80\x99s financial collapse make ever so clear, the  \nincreasing dominance of the financial sector \xe2\x80\x93 and its deregulation -- has  become \na mortal danger to our economic security.  The financial sector \xe2\x80\x93 including \nthe big  insurance companies \xe2\x80\x93 has morphed into a cancer growing on our \neconomy \xe2\x80\x93 a  cancer that could easily strangle our prospects for our long-term \neconomic  security.  \nLater this week, Congress begins consideration of a package of measures  \nthat would serve as a first step in re-regulating and hopefully shrinking the  \nAmerican financial industry.  This  battle has not attracted as much \nattention as the critical fight over health  care, but it is just as important for \nthe well-being of everyday  Americans. \nThe \xe2\x80\x9cbest and brightest\xe2\x80\x9d from Wall Street would like to make the issues  \ninvolved in this debate look complex and technical \xe2\x80\x93 beyond the understanding \nof  ordinary mortals.  But there are a  couple of clear principles to \nremember as the debate unfolds: \n1). History has shown that  financial markets cannot accomplish their \nostensible goal of allocating risk and  directing capital to their highest and \nbest uses unless they function within the  context of very strict rules.  That \nis so because speculators have a natural tendency to create products  and \nsystems that allow them to engage in reckless excesses that cause the entire  \nsystem to lurch from bubble to bubble, collapse to collapse.  This is not a \ntheoretical argument.  History proves the case beyond a  reasonable doubt. \nIn 1792 the newly-minted United States suffered its first  credit crisis.  \nAnother credit  crisis followed about once every fifteen years until 1932.  \nThen, the mother of all credit crises  caused the Great Depression that in \nturn spawned the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) to regulate the \nstock market, the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC) to guarantee \ndeposits in banks, and the Glass-Steagall Act  that prevented banks from \nengaging in other forms of more risky financial  activity.  \nFor the next 50 years, those regulations--coupled with a wise use of  \nKeynesian economic policies -- prevented another financial crisis.  That is one \nof the reasons why  America\xe2\x80\x99s experienced an  unprecedented era of economic \ngrowth for every sector of the population \xe2\x80\x93 and a  massive reduction in the \ninequality of income distribution.  \nBut in the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s the Reagan \xe2\x80\x9crevolution\xe2\x80\x9d worked its de-regulatory magic  \non the Savings and Loan industry.  It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take long for many of these \nonce-stable institutions to  collapse and cause the first credit crisis in a \nhalf-century.  That should have given the country fair  warning, but a few \nyears later Wall Street convinced Congress to repeal the  Glass-Steagall Act, \nand it prevented the regulation of newly-exploding  \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial products\xe2\x80\x9d \nlike \xe2\x80\x9cderivatives\xe2\x80\x9d that were basically bets on the movement  of underlying \ninvestments like stock and bonds. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscourage  financial \ninnovation,\xe2\x80\x9d they said. The growing predominance of private equity  financing \nalso took more and more financial transactions from the light of  transparent \nregulated public markets into the de-regulated shadows.   \nThen there was the securitization of debt.  Banks and other lenders bundled \n mortgages and other loans into packages and then chopped the packages into \nunits  that could be sold on secondary financial markets.  These new \nmarkets made a lot more money  available for loans, but there was no provision \nmade for the inherent  dangers.  For years previous,  bankers made loans with \nthe realization that they were on the hook if they went  bad.  The new \nsecondary markets  allowed them to make the loans, and sell off the risk to a \ndiffuse \xe2\x80\x9cmarket\xe2\x80\x9d that  left them free of any risk.   \nAll the while, the size of the financial sector was fed by the growing  use \nof credit cards that could legally siphon off huge streams of revenue from  \nordinary Americans into the hands of bankers.  And the elimination of usury \nlaws  encouraged the development of the \xe2\x80\x9cpayday loan\xe2\x80\x9d industry that \nallowed someone to  borrow $500 and pay $2,000 of interest on the loan over the \nnext two years.   \nThe result of all of these trends has been massive consolidation of power  \nby a few major financial institutions that have ranged far afield from \nbanking  into highly speculative activities of all sorts.  Brokerage firms like \nGoldman Sachs and  banks like CitiBank have become indistinguishable.  \nMassive portions of the credit market  now exist outside of the oversight of any \nregulator. \nToday, 45% of  the banking market in the U.S. is dominated by Bank of \nAmerica  and CitiBank.   \nFinally, of course, huge remuneration packages were paid to clever Ivy  \nLeague graduates who could make billions in speculative profit, even if they \ndid  so by taking Godzilla-sized risks.  Remuneration systems paid them on the \nbasis of short-term gain and they  suffered no financial penalty for \nlong-term pain.  So they were \xe2\x80\x9coff to the races.\xe2\x80\x9d     \n2). Much of the financial sector does not  produce anything.  The principal \n missions of the financial sector are to take on risk and allocate capital  \neffectively. Some of the industry \xe2\x80\x93 especially community and regional banks \n\xe2\x80\x93 do  just that.  But in the last year the  financial sector as a whole didn\n\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9ctake on risk,\xe2\x80\x9d it shifted risk to ordinary  Americans through gigantic \ntaxpayer bailouts.  And often the Wall Streeters themselves  escaped the \nrecent economic debacle, having salted away hundreds of billions of  dollars. \nFundamentally the financial sector is made up of middlemen, who spend  \ntheir time creating schemes that allow them to funnel society\xe2\x80\x99s money through  \ntheir bank accounts so they can take a sliver of every dollar off of the top. \n \nRight now, the private health insurance industry is busy trying to defend  \nits turf against a public health insurance option.  It wants to maintain its \n\xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d to take  that tribute off the top of as many health care dollars \nas possible.  Remember, the private health insurance  industry doesn\xe2\x80\x99t \ndeliver any actual health care.   \nThe same is true of most of the financial sector.  It is the farmers, \nmanufacturing firms,  the health care providers, the transportation companies, \nthe guys who sweep up  buildings, the cops and firefighters, the people who \nteach our kids \xe2\x80\x93 those are  the people who produce the goods and services that \nwe consume in our  economy.   \nMost \xe2\x80\x9cinnovative financial products\xe2\x80\x9d like derivatives are nothing more  \nthan schemes that allow speculators to build up paper wealth that will fuel \nthe  next credit bubble.  Creating  mechanisms to allow speculators to bet on \nthe direction of stock prices or other  actual investments doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do any \nmore for the underlying economy than allowing  the same people to bet on horse \nraces.  \nMost Wall Street speculators don\xe2\x80\x99t contribute any more to our common well  \nbeing than professional gamblers \xe2\x80\x93 which is pretty much what they are. \nGaming in  Las Vegas has  fine entertainment value, but providing a gigantic \nworldwide casino for the rich  is not an economically vital core function for \nthe world\xe2\x80\x99s financial  markets. \nI\xe2\x80\x99m not arguing against using financial markets to allocate capital and  \nrisk.  Banks, stock markets and  other financial institutions can be \xe2\x80\x93 and \nhave historically been \xe2\x80\x93 important and  efficient means of accomplishing these \ngoals.  But not when the tail begins to wag the  dog.   Not when the \nfinancial  sector, which can be useful at serving the needs of the productive \nsectors of  the economy, comes to dominate the economy.   \nAfter all, if so much wealth flows from the productive sectors of the  \neconomy into the fundamentally unproductive financial sector, ordinary people  \ndon\xe2\x80\x99t have enough money to buy the products that drive economic growth in the \n real economy.   \n3). Left to their own devices,  financial speculators often kill off \nproductive enterprises through leveraged buyouts and private  equity plays. A case \nin point was highlighted last week by the New York Times.  Simmons Bedding \nhas been in business  producing high quality mattresses for almost 133 \nyears. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s about to file  for bankruptcy protection \xe2\x80\x93 but not because it isn\n\xe2\x80\x99t a viable successful  business.   \nSimmons has been milked dry by a succession of buyers and Wall Street  \ninvestment banks that have made millions through leveraged buyouts that made  \ngood financial sense for Wall Street, but left the manufacturing firm deeper \nand  deeper in debt. The Times reports  that \xe2\x80\x9cthe financiers borrowed more \nand more money to pay ever-higher prices for  the company, enabling each \nprevious owner to cash out profitably.\xe2\x80\x9d  \nSimmons now owes $1.3 billion compared with $164 million in 1991.  \nAccording to the Times, \xe2\x80\x9cIn many ways, what private  equity firms did at Simmons, \nand scores of other companies like it, mimicked the  sub-prime mortgage boom.  \nFueled by  easy money\xe2\x80\xa6 these private investors were able to buy companies \nlike Simmons with  borrowed money and put down relatively little of their own \ncash.  Then not long after, they often borrowed  even more money, using the \ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s assets as collateral.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe result: THL (the private equity firm) was guaranteed a profit  \nregardless of how Simmons performed.  It did not matter that the company was left \nowing far more than it was  worth.\xe2\x80\x9d Too bad for Noble Rodgers, an employee of \n22 years, who along with 1,000  others have been laid off.   Too bad for \nthe American manufacturing base. The investment bankers got  theirs.  \n4). The bigger the financial  sector gets, the more power it has to hold \nthe entire economy ransom for huge  bailouts when their speculative bubbles \ncollapse.  Firms that are allowed to grow as large  as AIG, CitiBank and Bank \nof America create \xe2\x80\x9csystemic\xe2\x80\x9d risk that threatens the  world financial \nsystem.   \nThe bottom line is that if a  financial institution is too big to fail, it\xe2\x80\x99\ns just too big, period.   \nThe new regulatory  proposals now pending before Congress are critical \nfirst steps in reining in the  power of the financial sector.  The  proposed \nConsumer Financial Protection Agency is especially important.  It would end the \nanything-goes  \xe2\x80\x9cDodge City\xe2\x80\x9d  mentality that allows consumers to have their \npockets picked by financial  \xe2\x80\x9cproducts\xe2\x80\x9d like teaser-rate mortgages with \nprepayment penalties that guarantee  the consumer pays more than meets the \neye. It will require tight regulation of  credit card interest rates and fees.  \nBut equally critical are tough new regulations of the entire financial  \nsector \xe2\x80\x93 including the \xe2\x80\x9cderivatives\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccredit-default-swap\xe2\x80\x9d markets \xe2\x80\x93 and \n private equity, as well as regulations to eliminate remuneration systems \nthat  incentivize recklessness, and requirements that mortgage originators \nmaintain a  stake in the loans they sell.  The  \xe2\x80\x9cresolution\xe2\x80\x9d authority \nproposed by the Obama Administration is also an important  step to assure that \nthere is an orderly way to close even the largest of  financial institutions.   \nSerious regulation will inevitably cut back on the flow of income from  \nnormal people to the financial sector as a whole.  But over time, our goal \nneeds to be to  restore dominance of the economy to the productive sectors of \neconomic endeavor,  and to break up the financial and insurance cartels that \nhave a stranglehold on  our future.  \nThat will not happen without a monumental struggle.  The Obama \nAdministration\xe2\x80\x99s proposals for  financial re-regulation are the first offensive on this \ncritical front in the  war for our long-term economic security.  \nRobert Creamer is a long  time political organizer and strategist, and \nauthor of the recent book:  Stand Up Straight: How Progressives Can  Win, \navailable on _Amazon.com._ \n(http://www.amazon.com/Listen-Your-Mother-Straight-Progressives/dp/0979585295/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1213241439&sr=8-1)\n  \n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
