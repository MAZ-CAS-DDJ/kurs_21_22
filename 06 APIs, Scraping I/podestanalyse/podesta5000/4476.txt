john.podesta@gmail.comb'Yesterday, the New York Times reported on the findings of the information security firm Hold Security.  This firm discovered that Russian hackers had come into possession of 1.2 billion username and password combinations as well as 500 million email addresses.  The security firm did not release information on what organizations this data belonged to.  We have no reason at this time to believe that any University credentials have been compromised.  However, since many people use the same password for multiple systems it is possible that stolen credentials from another site could be used to access University systems if they are the same.  Security experts recommend regularly changing your password and using a different password for each system.  If you observe  suspicious activity on any of your accounts, you should immediately change your password.  You can change your University password at any time by using the password change system found at http://password.georgetown.edu<http://password.georgetown.edu/>.
