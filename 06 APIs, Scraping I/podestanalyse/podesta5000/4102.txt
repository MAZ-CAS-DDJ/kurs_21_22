john.podesta@gmail.comb'UPDATE: Hill seems to confirm it via this tweet<http://twitter.com/marclamonthill/status/4922301342>: "You ever had anyone break up with you by text?"\n\nFox News Reportedly Fires Liberal Analyst Marc Lamont Hill<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/10/16/fox-news-marc-lamont-hill/>\n\nhttp://thinkprogress.org/2009/10/16/fox-news-marc-lamont-hill/\n\n marclamonthillweb<http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/marclamonthillweb.jpg>Yesterday, Accuracy in Media\'s Cliff Kincaid announced<http://www.aim.org/press-release/aims-kincaid-urges-fox-news-to-quit-shilling-for-terrorists-and-cop-killer-/>that at today\'s annual News Corp. meeting, he would urge Chairman Rupert Murdoch to fire Fox News analyst Marc Lamont Hill<http://www.marclamonthill.com/>, whom he called a "left-wing cop-killer apologist." Hill appears as an on-air contributor on shows such as The O\'Reilly Factor.\n\nThe Live Feed reports<http://www.thrfeed.com/2009/10/fox-news-fires-liberal-pundit.html> that when Murdoch was asked this question (presumably by Kincaid), he replied that Hill had already been fired:\n\nRupert Murdoch continued Fox News Channel\'s duel with the White House on Friday while also announcing the termination of the network\'s left-leaning analyst Marc Lamont Hill. [...]\n\nMurdoch also said that Hill has been fired. He revealed the move after a shareholder had raised the question of how Hill was hired, citing his "reputation of defending cop killers and racists."\n\nAccording to the report, Murdoch did not say why Hill had been fired. On his twitter feed, Hill seemed to acknowledge news of the report - saying, "Relax, y\'all<http://twitter.com/marclamonthill/status/4920841870>. Don\'t believe the internet rumors" - but he didn\'t directly deny that he had been fired. Neither Hill, nor Fox News have responded yet to inquiries from ThinkProgress.\n\nBut Hill appeared on the Fox Business Network just yesterday<http://twitter.com/marclamonthill/status/4893966458>. In fact, just after radical Fox host Glenn Beck led a crusade<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/09/06/van-jones-resigns/> to oust Van Jones from his position as White House clean jobs adviser, Hill defended<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IKQzqhIKbk> Jones on the network:\n\nHOST: We now know that he was involved in signing a petition that asked the question of whether or not the Bush administration had involvement in 9/11. He admits he signed it. He says...he didn\'t know what he was signing. Would that have come up if he had been required to fill out this form?\n\nHILL: Probably not, actually, because he - if we believe in good faith that he didn\'t do it on purpose - and I believe that he didn\'t do it on purpose - then he probably wouldn\'t have put that down. And I\'ll tell you why I believe he didn\'t do it on purpose because he\'s been very straightforward.\n\nHill also criticized the White House for not defending Jones. "[Obama] could have dispensed surrogates on the Sunday shows to defend Van Jones. Instead, they did nothing," Hill complained.\n\nAlso during today\'s News Corp. meeting, when asked about recent criticism from White House communications director Anita Dunn that Fox News is the "communications arm of the Republican Party<http://pr.thinkprogress.org/2009/10/pr20091016/index.html>," Murdoch didn\'t exactly deny it, saying her comments have "tremendously increased their ratings<http://www.thrfeed.com/2009/10/fox-news-fires-liberal-pundit.html>."\n\nWe\'ll update this post as we learn more.\n\nUPDATE: Hill seems to confirm it via this tweet<http://twitter.com/marclamonthill/status/4922301342>: "You ever had anyone break up with you by text?"\n\n\n-----\nAdam Jentleson\nCommunications Director, Progressive Media\nCenter for American Progress Action Fund\najentleson@americanprogressaction.org<mailto:ajentleson@americanprogress.org>\najentleson (AIM)\n202-247-8614 (cell)\n\n\n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
