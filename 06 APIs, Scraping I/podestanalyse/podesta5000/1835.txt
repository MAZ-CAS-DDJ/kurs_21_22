If you email the\nsummaries to me by COB tomorrow (Saturday), I can circulate them on\nSunday and also bring printed copies to Monday's meeting.\n\n \n\n2)      The Denver meeting room has conference call capability, so if\nanyone who can't attend plans to call in, let me know, and I'll get you\na call-in number. \n\n"
