john.podesta@gmail.comb"Thanks Steve. I am generally trying to get us aiming in the same direction.\nBernie has gone decidedly negative and personal and like most things maybe\nhe can get away with it. But we live with a double standard, so I think\nit's a mistake to follow him down that path.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 19, 2016, Steve Hildebrand <steve@josiahscoffee.com>\nwrote:\n\n> John,\n>\n> I sent this to Joel Benenson a few days ago. Thought I would send to you\n> as well. Hillary has got to get away from Washington speak and begin\n> immediately to find an emotional connection to regular Americans. She needs\n> to have a greater understanding of what people and families are going\n> through every day.  And, then she needs to find an emotional connection.\n> This has to turn around now. Her speechwriters, ad writers, communication\n> staff \xe2\x80\x93 she and President Clinton \xe2\x80\x93 all need to cut Washington rhetoric\n> from their vocabularies and all scripts. She also needs to be bold and not\n> be politically calculating. Americans and certainly primary voting\n> Democrats are sick of the Clintons being cautious and calculating.\n>\n> She can win this, but she\xe2\x80\x99s got to find a way to connect with voters and\n> stop worrying about Washington pols and press.

She should not just be connecting with women voters in a\n> better way, they should be energized in a big way. She\xe2\x80\x99s failing in this\n> regard. Dump the Washington political speak immediately \xe2\x80\x93 including\n> partisan language.

GET A PERSONAL CONNECTION.\n>\n> I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the words are exactly, but she should say something like:\n>\n> \xe2\x80\x9cWhile Mr. Trump makes these deeply personal attacks, he\xe2\x80\x99s far from\n> perfect himself. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been married to Bill Clinton for more than 40 years.\n> He is and always has been the love of my life. We\xe2\x80\x99ve raised an amazing\n> daughter and I love being a grandmother. Our marriage hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been perfect \xe2\x80\x93\n> the vast majority of marriages aren\xe2\x80\x99t. While being in public life the\n> majority of our 40 years together, the American people have heard more than\n> their share. I\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen my path \xe2\x80\x93 to make my marriage work. I don\xe2\x80\x99t walk\n> away from a commitment. There are millions of women across America just\n> like me and there are millions of loving couples who chose their path.  As\n> President, I will fight hard for American families \xe2\x80\x93 creating jobs,\n> fighting to raise wages, continuing to ensure millions more have the\n> protections of health insurance. I will do everything I can to help\n> families get ahead and be more financially secure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>\n> \xe2\x80\x9cThe last thing Washington needs, the last thing America needs is a\n> politician like Donald Trump to divide us, to create fear, to incite racism\n> and constantly run people down. His mouth spews hatred. And while he might\n> be speaking a good game for 30% of the Republican base, his shallow\n> policies would hurt, not help the majority of the people who are in his\n> camp.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>\n> \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica is strongest when we are united. A true American patriot will\n> vigorously defend our country from it\xe2\x80\x99s enemies. Donald Trump has a lot to\n> prove to the American people that his words, actions and policies are best\n> for America. I served as Secretary of State. I know what it means to stand\n> strong against enemies abroad. While he throws political grenades in an\n> attempt  to win the votes of the extreme side of the Republican base, he\n> has no clue how destructive his rhetoric is \xe2\x80\x93 how much it\xe2\x80\x99s dividing our\n> country which makes us weaker. Politicians in Washington have done enough\n> damage when they divide us \xe2\x80\x93 when they themselves refuse to work together\n> for the best of our nation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>\n>  \xe2\x80\x9cAs President, I will work my tail off to unite our nation to make us\n> stronger. And, I will challenge any politician \xe2\x80\x93 Democrat or Republican \xe2\x80\x93\n> to get off the politics of destruction and join together to make America\n> even stronger.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>\n> \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Trump should also understand that American families need a champion\n> who is f for their future. Donald Trump is so far removed from the daily\n> lives of American families that he  doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand that his policies\n> will kill jobs, will take health insurance away from millions of families,\n> and put more guns in the hands of dangerous people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>\n>\n> For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth \xe2\x80\x93 keep her grounded and always thinking about what\n> American families are going through \xe2\x80\x93 not what is happening with\n> politicians in Washington. Maybe none of this is helpful \xe2\x80\x93 but I hope it\n> is. If there is anything I can do, please ask.\n>\n> Best of luck to you and the entire campaign.\n>\n> Steve H.\n> 605-261-8988\n> ------ End of Forwarded Message\n>\n"
