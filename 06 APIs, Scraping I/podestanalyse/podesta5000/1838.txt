john.podesta@gmail.comb'\n \n\n\nHuffington Post, 10/20: "Congress "Getting Completely Crushed" With Over\n100,000 Calls For Obama\'s Healthcare Reform\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dawn-teo/ofa-healthcare-phonebank_b_32741\n8.html> " :  \n\n\nIt\'s not even noon on the West Coast and already Capitol Hill staffers\nsay they\'re getting nonstop calls from constituents in support of\nPresident Barack Obama\'s health insurance reform. At about 2:15 EST, \nOrganizing for America <http://www.barackobama.com/>  (OFA) surpassed\nit\'s goal of 100,000 phone calls to Congress, each one imploring\nrepresentatives to vote for reform. The nationwide "Time to Deliver on\nHealth Reform" event is the most massive outpouring of support from\nObama supporters since Election Day 2008. \n\nSenate Democratic aides told HuffPost that their phones have been\nringing off the hook. "We\'re getting completely crushed with calls,\njamming our phone lines from the moment we opened," said one aide.\n\nAnother said they\'d gotten "pretty much non-stop health care calls from\nOFA." A third also said their office was getting bombed and that four\nout of every five calls specifically mentioned the public option. \n\nNot surprising...\n\n \n\nWashington Post, 10/20: \'Public option gains support; CLEAR MAJORITY NOW\nBACKS PLAN\'\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/19/AR20091\n01902451.html?hpid=topnews>  : \n\n \n\nA new Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that support for a\ngovernment-run health-care plan to compete with private insurers has\nrebounded from its summertime lows and wins clear majority support from\nthe public.\n\n\n[...]\n\n \n\nOn the issue that has been perhaps the most pronounced flash point in\nthe national debate, 57 percent of all Americans now favor a public\ninsurance option, while 40 percent oppose it. Support has risen since\nmid-August, when a bare majority, 52 percent, said they favored it. (In\na June Post-ABC poll, support was 62 percent.)\n\n \n\n________________________________________\nJeremy J.
