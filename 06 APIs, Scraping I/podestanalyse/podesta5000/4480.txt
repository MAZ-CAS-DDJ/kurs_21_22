Will you join them by making your first donation right now?\n\nMake a donation of $5 or more today:\n\nhttps://donate.barackobama.com/lastnight1\n\nNow that the convention is over, time will fly between now and Election Day.\n\nAnd the next two days are especially important.\n\nThe August fundraising deadline is this Sunday at midnight, and we can prove that a campaign funded by grassroots supporters can compete with John McCain and the Republicans.\n\nThe past four days in Denver -- and the amazing event last night -- showed the country that Americans are ready for change.\n\nNow it's up to each of us to make it happen.\n\nThanks for everything you're doing,\n\nMichelle\n\nDonate: https://donate.barackobama.com/lastnight1\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Obama for America\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscribe\n\n"
