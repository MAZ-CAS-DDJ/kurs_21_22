john.podesta@gmail.comb"John,\n\n\n\nWe met the week before last at Kafe Leopold in Georgetown as I was en route\nback to Boston.  I was sitting with two colleagues next to your table when\nI noticed you were there having lunch with Donna Shalala. Thank you for\nyour willingness to connect and share your email address with me.\n\n\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve long held an interest in politics, spent a decade living and working\nin DC after graduate study at GW, as I had mentioned, in public policy and\npublic administration. I am a registered Independent voter, voted for Obama\nin the last two elections, and also have voted for Republicans in\nGubernatorial races here in Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nI am excited about the prospect of Hillary running for the presidency\nagain, yet as a middle-aged (47) professional, I\xe2\x80\x99m not yet convinced she is\nmy candidate.  For the first time in my voting history, I know that my vote\ncast will not be based on gender or social issues alone. Yet at the same\ntime, when my 8 year old daughter turned to me last year to say it would be\ngreat to see Hillary the first woman president, I had to agree if for no\nother reason than seeing in her young eyes the hope and possibility that a\nstatement like that could reveal.\n\n\n\nIn preparation for a campaign announcement and the months ahead, what I\nwanted to share with you are a few perspectives on things I believe the\nHillary campaign strategy should address:\n\n *Congruence:*\n\n\n\nHillary is a historical figure, a woman with phenomenal accomplishments,\nbut presents in public with a lot of incongruity. For example, in terms of\nincome inequality, how can Hillary project empathy and humility when the\nmajority of her life, at least the last 25+ years of it, was spent in the\n1%? Given campaign finance her relationships with Wall St is understood.\nYet what does it mean to have these relationships and campaign for closing\nthe income inequality gap? In what ways will Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s goals about\naddressing income inequality be innovative, realistic and actionable?  In\nwhat ways can they include Wall St. banks?\n\n\nHow can Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s campaign platform focus on advancing women and children's\nissues when the Clinton Foundation receives donations from countries with\nblatant disregard for women's rights? In what ways can she explain this\npublicly and authentically without political spin?\n\n\n*Purple:*\n\n\nThe ability to reach across party lines and strive for bipartisanship is a\nworthy ideal despite the polarizing environment that occupies Washington.\nEmphasizing how Hillary will work with the Republican congress going\nforward is as essential as showcasing ways she has done this in the past.\nWhat are her views on defense, immigration and healthcare that are not\nentirely in lock step with President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s, for example? How can that\nappeal to the Independent voter that does not vote party line?\n\n\n*Foreign Policy*\n\n\n Foreign policy is a top campaign issue for 2016. Many Americans have been\ndisturbed about Obama\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy missteps, and have not felt safer in\nan increasingly dangerous world rife with radical Islamic extremists. The\ngeneral sentiment about President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s earlier statements on ISIS (J.V\nteam, not having a strategy to combat it, not using the verbiage radical\nIslamists) left the American voting public uneasy about the ability of the\nDemocratic party to execute a muscular approach to military and diplomatic\naffairs.  While I thought the NYT article yesterday on the Obama Doctrine\nwas excellent, many Americans remain skeptical about a successful Iranian\ndeal that cuts off pathways to nuclear weapons with a country unlikely to\nloosen its grip on extreme religious ideology, the form that teaches hate\nand destruction to its youngest citizens and sponsors terrorism.\n\n\nHillary\xe2\x80\x99s depth of knowledge related to world affairs and foreign policy\nshould include a strategy for communicating a forward thinking geopolitical\nvision in ways that present her unique strengths.  This foreign policy\nstrategy needs to convince the voting public why Hillary, why now, (in\npart, by compare to Obama) and to her Republican challengers who will do\neverything to associate her with past missteps and perceived party\nweaknesses.\n\n\n*Engagement*\n\n\n Thriving companies in the private sector are focused on increasing\ntransparency, flattening hierarchies and encouraging employee engagement.\n\n\nHow can Hillary create a digital campaign to engage US citizens in a\nlarge-scale dialogue that\xe2\x80\x99s unique: social media, video, crowd-sourcing\nideas, online events? Engaging the hearts and minds of the American voters\nin 2015-2016 should be an exercise in transparency, collaboration and one\nthat goes beyond party platform, beyond label and beyond gender alone.\n\n\nJohn, thank you for taking the time to read this (long!) note.  If there\xe2\x80\x99s\na chance for us to meet, either here in the Boston/New England region or in\nWashington DC, I\xe2\x80\x99d be excited by the opportunity to discuss campaign\nstrategy with you further, especially around ways that will appeal to\nvoters beyond the base.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nEmily\n\n-- \nEmily Klein\nFlextime Global\nemily@flextimeglobal.com\nMobile: 617.599.9550\nLinkedIn <http://www.linkedin.com/in/emilyklein1> | @flextimeglobal\n<https://twitter.com/flextimeglobal>\n\n*Co-Author of Workshift: Future-Proof Your Organization for the 21st\nCentury\n<http://www.amazon.com/Workshift-Future-Proof-Your-Organization-Century/dp/113733746X>\n(Palgrave\nMacmillan, 2013)*\n*Transforming Organizations From The Inside Out\n<http://www.workflexibility.org/transforming-workplaces-from-the-inside-out/>*\n"
