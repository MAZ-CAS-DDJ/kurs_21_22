john.podesta@gmail.comb'John and Jon - since you two are the two I know best in Hillarys campaign ( and you are the two busiest people I know ) I pass this job request on to you . I do not know Hannah but I do know her Dad who is a brilliant guy , a life long democrat , and a very strong believer in and supporter of Secretary Clinton .\nWould you all mind asking someone to follow up as appropriate .  Thanks so much . I look forward to seeing the Secretary on the 19th .

I\'m asking a favor.  My daughter Hannah (CV attached) graduates from Carolina in May. She anticipates receiving a BA in media and journalism, with a public relations specialization and a minor in Hispanic studies.  She has submitted recently an online application for a position with the Clinton campaign.   Ideally, she would work tirelessly from the point of graduation through the election of the next President and take it from there.  And to be clear, she is not bound by geography at this stage of her life.  It is safe to say that Hannah shares the view that initiated this email exchange back in October (and appended below); she would express it more clearly (and in fewer characters) to voters in need of direction in 2016.\n\nAny advice you might have for her would be deeply appreciated.  Best and warmest regards, Lee\n\n\n\nFrom: Hogewood, Lee\nSent: Thursday, October 22, 2015 11:38 PM\nTo: Mr. Erskine B. Bowles\nSubject: Fw: Hillary\n\nSomeone suggested I ought to send this to you.

Unfortunately, their predictable attacks and baseless innuendo weakens our nation, increases the risks those who serve the cause of diplomacy face, and discourages even the most courageous ?from public service. They should be ashamed. And the next President of the United states explained once again why she is the one candidate, from both parties, who has the range of intellect and selfless love of country to move us to where we aspire to be.\n\n\nA.
