I'll shoot you a separate note, looping some of my colleagues.\n\nCheers,\nDaniella\n\nFrom: Margot Friedman [mailto:mfriedman@dupontcirclecommunications.com]\nSent: Monday, February 22, 2016 12:25 PM\nTo: Daniella Leger <dleger@americanprogress.org>\nCc: john.podesta@gmail.com; Neera Tanden <ntanden@americanprogress.org>\nSubject: Op Ed Writing Trainings\n\nHi, Daniella. I saw John and Neera at an event at Tony Podesta's home yesterday and they suggested that I follow up with you.\n\nI ghostwrite op eds for placement in top tier outlets and provide trainings for progressive organizations.\nIn October, I led an op ed writing workshop for the staff of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth at the CAP offices. I have presented at the American Federation of Teachers, Advancement Project, Vital Voices Global Partnership, MomsRising, Netroots Nation, and many other venues.\n\nI would like to be considered if you have needs for a trainer on op ed writing at the Center for American Progress. Would it be possible to meet at your convenience?\n\nBelow are links to three samples of my work, including with unlikely ally byliners.
