The family is  requesting that donations be sent to The Texas Trust or The Lance Armstrong Foundation.  Additionally, if you want to send a note to Lisa Blue, his wife it can be sent to 5950 Deloache Avenue, Dallas, TX 75225.\n\n\nhttp://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/103108dnmetbaronobit.4a2f0a1.html\n\nFred was a wonderful man and a tremendous friend and I know that we will all miss him.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nMary Pat\n\n'
