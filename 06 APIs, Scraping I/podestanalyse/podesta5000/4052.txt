john.podesta@gmail.comb'I understand what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do with \xe2\x80\x9ccommon ground, \xe2\x80\x9c elaboration but I really feel like breaking up a very tight line that summarizes her approach weakens it pretty completely.\r\n\r\nSo at the 3rd graph on p. 3, I would deliver the line first followed by the riff below and then bridge to immigration:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do as President.  I know how to find common ground and I know when to stand my ground.    I will go anywhere, talk with anyone and work my heart out to improve your lives, your families\xe2\x80\x99 lives, your children\xe2\x80\x99s lives.\r\n\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing for decades.  That\xe2\x80\x99s how I helped create the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Health insurance Program when I was First Lady and today the covers more than 8 million kids.  That\xe2\x80\x99s how as a Senator I won health benefits for heroic first responders who rushed into the trade center on that horrible day and faced lingering health issues.  That\xe2\x80\x99s how I helped secure a landmark treaty with Russia to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons when I was secretary of state.  So I know how to find common ground to get things done.\r\n\r\nBut I also know when to stand my ground especially when it comes to those powerful interests who are acting against the interest of hard working Americans and their families and holding you back from getting ahead.  I will stand my ground to stop drug companies from price gouging and charging you more for the drugs you need to stay healthy than they do in other countries.\r\n\r\nI will stand my ground against polluters, who want to keep dumping their carbon pollution into the air  you breathe and causing the climate change that threatens our planet and puts our children\xe2\x80\x99s and grandchildren\xe2\x80\x99s future at risk.\r\n\r\nI will stand my ground against the corporate gun lobby who fight every common sense gun law we need, including keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill or suspected terrorists on the no-fly list.\r\n\r\nI will continue to stand my ground and speak out loudly against those raising their voices in preaching some of the most hateful intolerance towards immigrants , towards Muslims, towards LGBT Americans.\r\n\r\nTHEN GO INTO THE IMMIGRATION SECITON WITH A SMOOTH TRANSITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com [mailto:speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com] On Behalf Of Huma Abedin\r\nSent: Monday, January 04, 2016 11:38 AM\r\nTo: Emily Aden\r\nCc: Michelle White; Emmy Ruiz; Dan Schwerin; Tim Hogan; Speech Drafts\r\nSubject: Re: DRAFT: Remarks at Nevada Democratic Party Dinner\r\n\r\nis there enough in here about harry reid?\r\n\r\nOn Mon, Jan 4, 2016 at 10:56 AM, Emily Aden <eaden@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:eaden@hillaryclinton.com>> wrote:\r\nResearch edits/flags attached in comments.

I agree with all of Emmy\'s suggestions.\r\n\r\nIt would also be great to thank NV State Democratic Party Chairwoman Roberta Lange. I think this can be done in a brief line at the very beginning.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if she could mention that she is grateful to have the support of many of the state legislators in the room tonight because they understand what\'s at stake. They saw firsthand during the 2015 Legislative Session what happens when Republicans get in control and what that means for Nevada families. "Their fights are my fights, and I\'m grateful they have my back." ...or something much more articulate and eloquent than that.\r\n\r\nI think that will score us bonus points with the political leaders and the base.

I\'m sure people would go nuts.\r\n\r\nSecond, when she references the Reno facility, think it would be great to note that she went there with former Senator Sheila Leslie. She is a well known (perhaps the most) progressive in the state and think it gives us progressive credibility with folks who may not know that she is supporting HRC.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nOn Sun, Jan 3, 2016 at 9:47 PM, Emmy Ruiz <eruiz@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:eruiz@hillaryclinton.com>> wrote:\r\nHi Dan,\r\n\r\nThanks for sending this along! This as close to perfect as I have every read anything - LOVE IT!\r\n\r\nJust have a few things for you to pls consider:\r\n\r\n  *   This will seem tiny and maybe even petty, but can Dina Titus please be acknowledged before Catherine Cortez Masto?\r\n  *   Also, all over Nevada people reference her trips to this state even before she ran for President, for example in the early 2000s to visit Fallon\'s Leukemia bubble. Would love to find a way to incorporate her Nevada roots and how much she loves this state, her history here.\r\nThanks so much for your work on this.\r\n\r\nEmmy\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sun, Jan 3, 2016 at 9:24 PM, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com>> wrote:\r\nOn Wednesday, HRC is speaking at the Democratic Party dinner in Nevada, along with the other candidates. She has about 15 minutes. Emmy asked that we emphasize the importance of state party building efforts and electing Dems up and down the ticket, immigration reform, and contrast with local Republicans (as we\'ve done to good effect in Iowa).  This is also an opportunity to lay out the closing argument more robustly than we\'ve doing in town hall toppers so far, raising the stakes in the election by painting a picture of how a Republican President would rip away our progress and explaining why we need to elect someone who has what it takes to get the job done on the economy, security, and problems that keep families up at night.  Plus, starting to draw sharper contrasts with Sanders, as HRC has indicated.  All in 15 minutes!\r\nAttached is a draft for discussion. (And please keep in mind that for anything we add, we also need to cut.)\r\nThanks\r\nDan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nEmmy Ruiz\r\nNevada State Director\r\nHillary for America\r\n(c) 956.454.4048<tel:956.454.4048>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nEmmy Ruiz\r\nNevada State Director\r\nHillary for America\r\n(c) 956.454.4048<tel:956.454.4048>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'
