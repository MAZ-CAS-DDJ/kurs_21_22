john.podesta@gmail.comb"\nDear Colleagues\n\nThis Wednesday the O\x92Neill Colloquium looks at something of high global importance, antibiotic resistance. The United Nations and World Health Organization have called the rise in resistance to standard antibiotics \x93a crisis.\x94 And the G-7 Summit in Japan next year will take it up as a priority. It also matters personally as we all rely on anti-microbials to cure infections. If we were to move to a post-antibiotic era, it would have major health consequences.\n\nPlease join us on Wednesday at 1:20 where we will be joined by:\n\n  *   Jesse Goodman, who directs Georgetown COMPASS, a new Center which focuses on informing science policy. Jesse came to the medical school from the FDA where he served as Chief Scientist.\n  *   Eili Klein, with the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy. Dr. Klein is a mathematical ecologist and epidemiologist whose research focuses on the role of behavior in the spread of infectious diseases.\n  *   Sarah Despres, director of Government Relations as The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nWith warm wishes, Larry\nJoin us for the O'Neill Institute Colloquium Wednesdays this semester from 1:20-3:20pm\n\nIs this email not displaying correctly?\nView it in your browser<http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=93cd2feb08&e=3596deea0c>.\n\n\n\n[O'Neill Institute]<http://georgetown.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=ccf8b631c7&e=3596deea0c>\n\nO\x92Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law Colloquium:\n\nLegal & Policy Approaches for Controlling the Antibiotic-Resistance Crisis\n\nWednesday, November 11th, 2015\n1:20 \x96 3:20 p.m.\n\nGeorgetown University Law Center\nFaculty Dining Room, Hotung Room 2001\n550 First Street, NW\nWashington, DC 20001\n\n\nThis session of the Colloquium will explore issues around the public health threat posed by antibiotic-resistance, the behaviors and practices which have led to the spread of resistance and the challenges to legislative and regulatory solutions, among other topics.\n\nPanelists will include:\n\nJesse L. Goodman, M.D., M.P.H., directs Georgetown COMPASS, a new Center which focuses on informing science based policy to address public health needs in product development and access, the supply chain, and antimicrobial resistance. Until February 2014 he was the Chief Scientist of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a position he assumed in 2009 along with Deputy Commissioner for Science and Public Health (2009-2012). As Chief Scientist he had broad responsibility for strategic leadership and coordination of FDA\x92s crosscutting scientific and public health efforts, including developing and implementing FDA's Strategic Plan for Regulatory Science, as well as leading FDA's public health preparedness and medical countermeasures efforts. In this role he led the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response and the medical countermeasure review for FDA, also serving as a member of the HHS Senior Leadership team. From 2003 to 2009,\n\nDr. Goodman was director of FDA\x92s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), which oversees activities critical to U.S. and global preparedness and the development, evaluation, safety, quality, and availability of blood, vaccines, gene and cell therapies and other biologics. As Senior Advisor to the Commissioner in 1998-2000, he initiated and co-chaired the United States Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance which produced the nation\x92s first Public Health Action Plan to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance. A graduate of Harvard, Dr. Goodman received his M.D. from the Albert Einstein and did residency and fellowship training in Medicine, Infectious Diseases and Oncology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and at the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA), where he was also Chief Medical Resident. Prior to his service at FDA, he was Professor of Medicine and Chief of Infectious Diseases at the University of Minnesota. He has served on numerous Boards and Committees for organizations including CDC, NIH, WHO and NIEHS and has been elected to the American Society for Clinical Investigation and to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nDr. Eili Klein, Ph.D. is a fellow with the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy. Dr. Klein is a mathematical ecologist and epidemiologist whose research focuses on the role of behavior in the spread of infectious diseases. Examining how individuals respond to incentives for both healthy and unhealthy behavior \x96 an area which economics has a lot to say \x96 and how this then impacts the spread disease can improve policy responses to epidemic diseases by giving policymakers and health-care providers clear tools for thinking about how certain actions can influence the spread of disease transmission.\n\nDr. Klein has authored numerous publications on the evolution and spread of antimicrobial drug-resistance, with particular reference to the emergence of antibiotic and antimalarial drug resistance. This has included descriptions of the burden and seasonality of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), as well as other pathogens including carbapenem-resistant enterococci. Dr. Klein has also looked at how patients view the prescribing of antibiotics and what relationship this holds to the primary messaging regarding the overuse of antibiotics. Dr. Klein is also an assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSarah Despres is the director of Government Relations as The Pew Charitable Trusts. Her specialties include healthcare policy development and advocacy including: the regulation of drugs and medical devices; policies to reduce abuse of prescription drugs; end of life care, conflict of interest in medicine, specialty drugs, and state healthcare spending. She also holds expertise in immunization policy.\n\n\n2015 O\x92Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law Colloquium\nThe purpose of the Colloquium is to engage leading experts, Georgetown Law students and faculty, and interested members of the public in an enriching dialogue surrounding current and pressing issues in global health law, policy and governance. The 2015 Colloquium will address two themes. First, at a time of increasing inequality, economic uncertainty, and evolving health and other threats, how can health law and public health be used to foster security\x97personal, community, national, and ultimately global security that leads to healthier populations the world over? And, second, what are the roles of different stakeholders in effecting policy change and how can lawyers and others advance change through different roles, whether as government policymakers, community advocates, researchers, or litigators?\n\nThe O\x92Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University is the premier center for health law, scholarship, and policy. Its mission is to contribute to a more powerful and deeper understanding of the multiple ways in which law can be used to improve the public\x92s health, using objective evidence as a measure. The O\x92Neill Institute seeks to advance scholarship, science, research, and teaching that will encourage key decision-makers in the public, private, and civil society to employ the law as a positive tool for enabling more people in the United States and throughout the world to lead healthier lives.\n\nThe O\x92Neill Institute Colloquium is open to all students, faculty, staff, and interested members of the public.\n\nThe hashtag for this event is #oneillcolloquium.\n\nFor more information on O\x92Neill Institute events, please visit http://www.law.georgetown.edu/ oneillinstitute/.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Blog]<http://georgetown.us5.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=0abc9ba263&e=3596deea0c>  [Facebook] <http://georgetown.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=a9b45aa193&e=3596deea0c>   [Twitter] <http://georgetown.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=e4da5008b8&e=3596deea0c>   [RSS] <http://georgetown.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=5fa65b3e62&e=3596deea0c>\n\n\n\n unsubscribe from this list<http://georgetown.us5.list-manage2.com/unsubscribe?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=8ac1b15f84&e=3596deea0c&c=93cd2feb08> | update subscription preferences<http://georgetown.us5.list-manage.com/profile?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=8ac1b15f84&e=3596deea0c> | view email in browser<http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=93cd2feb08&e=3596deea0c>\n\n\n\n\n"
