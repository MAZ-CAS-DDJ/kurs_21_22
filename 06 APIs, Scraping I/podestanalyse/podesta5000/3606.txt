Send me to the White House with that mandate, she is asking voters.\n\n\n\nDoing so, Clinton focused on the central domestic issue of an era that has\nproduced heavy concentrations of low-wage and part-time jobs, while adding\nfar too few positions overall. Still worse, wages have been stagnant or\nfalling for an extraordinarily long time.\n\n\n\nIt was clear during her meetings with small groups of Iowans that Clinton\nhas grappled with the scope of the national malaise.\n\n\n\nShe told community college students that U.S. workers have been left behind\ndespite producing more for employers.\n\n\n\nShe pointed out to local entrepreneurs that the World Bank has ranked\nAmerica 46th in the ease of starting a business.\n\n\n\nAnd, notably, she acknowledged that America\xe2\x80\x99s comeback from the Great\nRecession leaves a lot to be desired. She left President Obama unmentioned,\nbut her reference to bettering his achievements was unmistakable.\n\n\n\nJudging by the press coverage in Iowa, home of the first contest in the\nnominating process, the heartland folks bought in seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cIn Iowa,\nHillary Clinton lays out big vision for her campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d was the headline in\nthe Des Moines Register.\n\n\n\nShe got points for knowing that Iowa ranks high among states for student\nloan debt and for getting right the name of a town that is easily\nmispronounced.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, commentary tilted heavily toward style. Why did she drive to\nIowa in a van? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t she and an aide tip at a Chipotle? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t she\ngive a traditional kickoff address? And so on and so forth through\ndissections of her campaign logo and evaluations of whether she was being\n\xe2\x80\x9cauthentic.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhat counted in messaging was Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s fact-based populism. At a time when\nthe top 1% enjoy 23% of all income, more than doubling their share since\n1994, she accurately targeted income inequality.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong when CEOs make 300 times more than the typical\nworker,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared, while repeatedly asserting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe deck is still\nstacked in favor of those already at the top.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShrewdly, on Friday Clinton named as her campaign\xe2\x80\x99s chief financial officer\na former Wall Street regulator who has a well-earned reputation for\npolicing the financial industry.\n\n\n\nScorecard: Out of the starting gate, she\xe2\x80\x99s working for Democratic votes and\nearning them.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "HRCRapid" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n'
