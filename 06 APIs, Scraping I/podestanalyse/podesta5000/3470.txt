john.podesta@gmail.comb'Team,\n\nAttached is the agenda for our Thursday meeting.  Feedback is welcome.\n\nWe have one homework assignment:\n\nIn the "mid course review" section of the agenda, we have some questions in\nred (and listed below) that we\'d like everyone to think about in advance of\nthe meeting and come with ideas.  Our plan is to have everyone share their\nthoughts and then synthesize and discuss them as a group. Especially when\nthinking about what we did well in the last month, we wanted to focus on\nWHY we think something went well (the answer to "so what?") so we can\npinpoint key learning.\n\nThe result of this session will be a set of key takeaways that we will seek\nto implement over the next month and review at our meeting in September.\n\nLet us know if you have any questions.\n\nThanks--looking forward to it!\n\nRobby\n\n\n*Overall review *\n\nWhat have we done this summer that really mattered and advanced our\nimperatives?\n\nWhat do we want to do more of?\n\nWhat should we do differently or better?\n\n\n*Specific questions*\n\nHow do we pivot focus to our core economic home base?\n\nHow do we fully leverage assets other than HRC to communicate and organize?\n\nWhat should we be doing to motivate our supporters?\n\nHow do we add good work and good moments to the narrative of our\ncampaign--through the press filter and outside of the press filter?\n'
