And we\'ve got to stomp on them instead of kowtowing to them." \x97\nRep. Jerry Nadler1\n\nAfter the shooter Adam Lanza, no one is more to blame for the massacre of\n20 first graders and six women at the Sandy Hook Elementary School than the\nNational Rifle Association. To stop the senseless killing we must first\nmake the NRA stand down.\n\n*Join CREDO for an emergency march on the NRA office in Washington DC.*\n\nTime: Monday, Noon-1pm\nWhere: Meet at Spirit of Justice\nPark<http://act.credoaction.com/r/?r=6993860&id=52162-5278429-K7h4ESx&t=5>\n(corner\nof New Jersey Avenue & D Street SE near Capitol South Metro) and march to NRA\nFederal Affairs\nDivision<http://act.credoaction.com/r/?r=6993861&id=52162-5278429-K7h4ESx&t=6>\nat\n410 1st St SE in Washington DC\n\n*Click here for more details and to\nRSVP.<http://act.credoaction.com/r/?r=6993859&id=52162-5278429-K7h4ESx&t=7>\n*\n\nThe NRA will work to defeat any politician that doesn\'t support its extreme\nbloodstained agenda. To win support of the NRA, candidates must pledge\nallegiance to its insane pro-weapon stances. Like making sure your local\nWalmart can stock semi-automatic assault weapons such as the Bushmaster\n.223 that was used in the Sandy Hook massacre and that can fire more than\nsix bullets per second. The NRA forces politicians to oppose background\nchecks for weapons sold at gun shows. The NRA has even been able to compel\nits allies in Congress to oppose a ban on weapons sales to people on the\nU.S. terrorism watch list.2\n\nIn his address to the nation, President Obama vowed "to take meaningful\naction." We will hold him accountable for sending legislation to Capitol\nHill as soon as possible to address the crisis of gun violence in this\ncountry. But Congress, which for decades has cowered in the face of the\nNRA\'s lobbying prowess and vast campaign coffers, is not likely to pass any\nbill proposed by the White House if we don\'t stand up and force the NRA to\nstand down.\n\nThe National Rifle Association is a powerful lobby that purports to\nrepresent gun owners. But in reality, it represents the deadly interests of\narms dealers and gun manufacturers. And it has been astonishingly\nsuccessful at blocking regulations that should easily pass if Congress\nwould vote its conscience instead of kowtowing to the NRA.\n\n*Please join us tomorrow (Monday) at noon in Washington DC.
