Obama's transition team. This\nmorning's pieces in the Post reminded me of my earlier intent to ask you\nto pass along my willingness to help John out in any way he thinks I\nmight be useful.\n\nI trust that all is well. I'm planning on doing some phone banking and\nGOTV in Virginia as the election approaches. Fingers and toes crossed!\n\nThanks for passing this along  All the best, RPR\n\nPaul Richard\n1325 15th St NW Apt 911\nWashington DC USA\nP 202-620-4705\nC 202-701-3747\nrprichard@gmail.com\nPaul.Richard@alumni.brown.edu\n"
