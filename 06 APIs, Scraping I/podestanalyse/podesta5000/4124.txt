"There are 2,500 Colorado healthcare\nworkers in Local 105, making us the largest healthcare union in the\nstate. We know Senator Bennet won\'t stop fighting until we have\nmeaningful healthcare reform that lowers costs and ends the insurance\nindustry\'s stranglehold on our healthcare system."\n\n \n\n "Everyone knows that there\'s a lot left to do in Washington," said\nOrville Bryant, a cashier who works at Denver International Airport and\nis a member of the Local 105 Executive Board. "Senator Bennet has earned\nour support because he\'s focused on creating good jobs for ourselves and\nour children right here in Colorado. Working families just want a chance\nat the American Dream, which is why we need leaders like Michael Bennet.\nHe\'s working to rebuild our economy so it works for everyone through\npolicies like the DREAM Act and reining in the reckless behavior on Wall\nStreet."\n\n \n\n"The last decade was the first in the history of this country where the\neconomy grew and median family income actually declined; a decade in\nwhich wages fell, while the cost of health care and higher education\nwent up by double digits," said Bennet.  "Working families in Colorado\nand across the country can\'t afford another decade like the last - they\ndeserve better.  They deserve a politics that puts their interests above\nthe special interests; a politics that delivers on meaningful health\ninsurance reform, fixes our broken immigration system, and makes our\neconomy work for hardworking Coloradans.  These are efforts SEIU has\nfought for for years, and I\'m glad to join them in the fight for\nColorado\'s working families."\n\n \n\n###\n\n \n\nSEIU Local 105 brings together over 6,000 healthcare workers, janitors,\nsecurity guards and other property service workers who are building\ninnovative partnerships with their employers and winning better wages,\nhealthcare and more secure jobs for Colorado. With 2.2 million members\nin Canada, the United States and Puerto Rico, SEIU is the\nfastest-growing union in the Americas. Focused on uniting workers in\nhealthcare, public services and property services, SEIU members are\nwinning better wages, healthcare and more secure jobs for our\ncommunities, while uniting their strength with their counterparts around\nthe world to help ensure that workers-not just corporations and\nCEOs-benefit from today\'s global economy.\n\n \n\nwww.seiu105.org <http://www.seiu105.org/> \n\nwww.seiu.org <http://www.seiu.org/>  \n\n \n\n \n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
