The upshot? Colbert signed our campaign letter agreeing with General\nColin Powell that Guantanamo \x93should be closed this afternoon.\x94 Since this\nis Colbert we\x92re talking about, he claims he signed it to \x93make it harder\nfor Obama.\x94 But we\x92ll take it.\n\nJoin Rosanne Cash, the coalition of musicians who have joined the\ncampaign<http://newsecurityaction.org/pages/music-used-to-torture>,\nand now Stephen Colbert to add to the over 30,000 letters sent to Congress\nin just over a week of our campaign. Support President Obama\'s promise to\nClose Guantanamo.\n\n*Click here to watch the video and sign the\npetition.*<http://newsecurityaction.org/blog/entry/breaking-news-stephen-colbert-signs-petition-to-close-guantanamo-now/>\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
