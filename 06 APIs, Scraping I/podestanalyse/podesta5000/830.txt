john.podesta@gmail.comb"   This is a membership activation notice from the Democratic Majority Makers. Please respond before midnight tomorrow to activate your 2016 membership.\n\nMember: John Podesta | EMAIL: podesta@law.georgetown.edu| 2016 Membership Status: Not Active (https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/majority-maker?refcode=em112915_1&amount=3&recurring=12)\n\n2016 isn't going to be easy. But if Democrats have the resources to go toe-to-toe with the GOP in tight races, we could send the Tea Party packing once and for all.\n\nThat's why we're getting a jump-start on activating members for our 2016 Democratic Majority Makers. We've set a BIG goal of activating 5,000 memberships before midnight tomorrow. (https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/majority-maker?refcode=em112915_1&amount=3&recurring=12) If we're able to hit our goal, we can help ensure Nancy Pelosi becomes the next Speaker of the House.\n\nBut we can't do that without you, John. Can you click here to activate your membership with a donation of $3 or more now?
