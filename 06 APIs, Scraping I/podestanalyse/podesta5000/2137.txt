She's a straight up politician.\n\nI won't go into too much detail about Comstock's record, but let's just say she's a professional Clinton hater and she voted for that atrocious transvaginal ultrasounds bill.\n\nWhat else do you need to know?\n\nLook, John. We've got an amazing opportunity to elect a strong Democrat for Northern Virginia.\n\nBut we need to get behind John Foust before the right-wing attacks take hold. Will you pitch in today?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/foustq42014?refcode=em_FR_2014.10.12_b1_pb_ldnd&amp;amount=25&amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=DC&amp;zip=20016&amp;phone=2162818851&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=&amp;recur_weekly=true\n\nThanks,\n\nPaul Begala\n\n\nThis message was emailed to: podesta@law.georgetown.edu\n\nTo unsubscribe from this email list, please paste this URL into your browser: \nhttp://act.foustforvirginia.com/unsubscribe\n\nPaid for by John Foust for Congress\n\n"
