Not only\nis Gessler an infamous partisan political attorney with a long history\nof defending clients accused of election law violations, but he never\nreally\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=N9QAFO1ufjx759j5baYHCQ..\n\ntried to get elected, either: he never raised much money or even\ncampaigned much. It\'s almost as if he was elected by accident.\n\nNow that Scott Gessler is in office, though, he seems determined to do\nas much damage to Colorado\'s elections--and the right of Coloradans to\nvote--as he possibly can.\n\n>From now until Election Day 2012, one of ProgressNow Colorado\'s\nbiggest jobs is to stop Gessler from carrying out his intentions to\nsuppress the vote. Please join us--make a small monthly contribution\nto ProgressNow Colorado, and help us fight Scott Gessler every step of\nthe way\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=2jSp-xDtOwZRcQuB_zVbqw..\n\n.\n\nScott Gessler\'s latest attack on the right to vote is a piece of\nlegislation he cooked up with Tea Party support to conduct voter\npurges of people he "believes" could be illegal immigrants. Newspapers\naround the state have pointed out that Gessler could have freedom to\nuse almost any "information" he sees fit to exclude voters under this\nbill--a wide-open opportunity to manipulate Colorado elections. The\nevidence Gessler has presented in support of this legislation is\nseverely flawed, and easily accounted for by the normal rate of\nnaturalization of citizens. There has never been a documented case of\nan illegal immigrant voting in the state of Colorado. And if one ever\ndid, it\'s already against federal law!\n\nThere\'s only one possible outcome to Scott Gessler\'s hopes to purge\nthe voter rolls without oversight or accountability. And that\'s to\nsuppress the rights of legal Colorado citizens to vote.\n\nWe\'ve already enjoyed success at holding Scott Gessler accountable. In\nJanuary, after Gessler announced that he intended to keep working for\nhis old elections law firm, thousands of ProgressNow Colorado members\nstood up and demanded that he abandon that horrible idea. Gessler was\nstunned by the intense criticism, and announced after a few days of\noutcry that he was giving up.\n\nBut Gessler won\'t give up on suppressing the vote as easily. With your\nhelp, we\'ll fight him every step of the way--and we\'ll win. Please\ntake a moment to join ProgressNow Colorado with a small monthly\ndonation--$10, $20, or whatever you can throw in, and help us protect\nthe most important right we have\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=ppvixwZZ39yuQe8WcNPObQ..\n\n.\n\nThank you,\n\nKjersten Forseth?\n\n\n\n\xa9 2010 ProgressNow Colorado.
