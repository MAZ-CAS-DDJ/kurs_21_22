john.podesta@gmail.comb"Dear John, \n\n \n\nI hope you and your family had a wonderful Christmas and time in Lake\nTahoe  -- Mary mentioned you were going there -hope the XC skiing was\ngreat. \n\n \n\nJust before Christmas, Joshua Dubois the director of religious outreach,\nasked me to send him my position interests. I wanted to make sure you\nhad my email to him as well.  As I understand it, the religious outreach\nteam has sent in a first round of names through personnel.  My email to\nJoshua is copied below.  After talking with a few more people, I\nemphasized my interest in the White House Council for Faith and\nNeighborhood Partnerships itself.  I am also interested in one of the\nDepartment's Faith based offices or policy positions --- particularly\nHHS and Labor where I could help advance policy goals and engage the\nfaith community.    Elizabeth Bagley sent my resume over to  Tom\nDaschle, and will follow up with him.     I'm going to be out of the\nAlliance office next week but on my cell and this email. \n\n \n\nThanks so much John,  \n\n \n\nAlexia\n\nCell: 202/441-3812 \n\n \n\n \n\nFrom: Alexia Kelley \nSent: Tuesday, December 16, 2008 10:12 PM\nTo: joshua.dubois@ptt.gov; jdubois@pic2009.org\nSubject: Positions\n\n \n\nDear Joshua, \n\n \n\nThanks for the great meeting today, our conversation last week, and for\nyour continued leadership on religious outreach.  \n\n \n\nAs we discussed,  I'm very eager to serve in the new Administration to\nhelp realize President Elect Obama's goals, especially to engage faith\nand community partners and to help achieve health care reform, poverty\nreduction, and other key goals.  I have really enjoyed working with you,\nand with Mark and the rest of your team --- you all are doing\ngroundbreaking work for the common good and in public life.  I would\nvery much like to work as part of your new team going forward and I have\nattached my resume to this email.   \n\n \n\nAs I mentioned, I am most interested in serving within the White House\nCouncil for Faith and Neighborhood Partnerships, or in a White House\nposition where I can contribute my skills and experience to accomplish\nthe Council's mission.   I would be interested in a deputy director\nposition within the Council, and believe that I could serve you and the\nteam very well in this position.  My management of the Alliance over the\nlast 4 years and over a decade at the Catholic Campaign for Human\nDevelopment and other faith-based organizations would be an asset to the\nCouncil's work.   I would be thrilled to work under your direction, and\nto put my management, coalition-building, and coordination skills at the\nAdministration's and the Council's service. \n\n \n\nMy top interests are: \n\n \n\n*         A Deputy position within the White House Council for Faith\nBased and Neighborhood Partnerships \n\n*         A liaison to the faith community within the White House Office\nof Public Liaison \n\n*         An HHS or Labor Department position, either in the respective\nDepartment's Faith and Neighborhood Partnership Office, or in policy or\nlegislative appointment that would enable me to work towards key policy\ngoals and to engage and support the faith community.  \n\n \n\nThanks again Joshua, and I look forward to talking with you soon and to\ndiscussing how I would best work within the new Administration. Let me\nknow how I can be of service in the meantime. \n\n \n\nBest regards, \n\n \n\nAlexia\n\n \n\n \n\nAlexia Kelley\n\nExecutive Director\n\nCatholics in Alliance for the Common Good\n\n1730 Rhode Island Avenue NW \n\nWashington DC 20036\n\n202-429-9680 office\n\n202-441-3812 cell\n\nakelley@catholicsinalliance.org\n\nwww.catholicsinalliance.org\n\n \n\n"
