john.podesta@gmail.comb'To close the loop here, HRC will tweet this as soon as President Obama concludes his remarks this evening, followed by this statement, which I will circulate to our press list and anyone who asks.  HRC will get the question tomorrow evening when she sits on stage with Walter Isaacson at an event for the New York Historical Society.\n\nHuma/Dan/Ethan, anything to add?\n\nTweet\n"Thanks to President Obama for taking action on immigration in the face of inaction.  Now let\'s turn to permanent bipartisan reform."\n\n\nStatement\nI support the President\'s decision to begin fixing our broken immigration system and focus finite resources on deporting felons rather than families.  I was hopeful that the bipartisan bill passed by the Senate in 2013 would spur the House of Representatives to act, but they refused even to advance an alternative. Their abdication of responsibility paved the way for this executive action, which follows established precedent from Presidents of both parties going back 70 years.  But, only Congress can finish the job by passing permanent bipartisan reform that keeps families together, treats everyone with dignity and compassion, upholds the rule of law, protects our borders and national security, and brings millions of hard-working people out of the shadows and into the formal economy so they can pay taxes and contribute to our nation\'s prosperity.  Our disagreements on this important issue may grow heated at times, but I am confident that people of good will and good faith can yet find common ground. We should never forget that we\'re not discussing abstract statistics - we\'re talking about real families with real experiences.  We\'re talking about parents lying awake at night afraid of a knock on the door that could tear their families apart, people who love this country, work hard, and want nothing more than a chance to contribute to the community and build better lives for themselves and their children.\n\nFrom: Robby Mook <robbymook@gmail.com<mailto:robbymook@gmail.com>>\nDate: Thursday, November 20, 2014 at 4:54 PM\nTo: Jacob Sullivan <Jake.sullivan@gmail.com<mailto:Jake.sullivan@gmail.com>>\nCc: Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com<mailto:dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>>, NSM <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com<mailto:nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>>, Ethan Gelber <egelber@hrcoffice.com<mailto:egelber@hrcoffice.com>>, Cheryl Mills <cheryl.mills@gmail.com<mailto:cheryl.mills@gmail.com>>, Philippe Reines <pir@hrcoffice.com<mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com>>, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>, Huma Abedin <huma@clintonemail.com<mailto:huma@clintonemail.com>>\nSubject: Re: UPDATE: Draft statement on immigration executive\n\nFine w me\n\nOn Nov 20, 2014, at 4:18 PM, Jake Sullivan <jake.sullivan@gmail.com<mailto:jake.sullivan@gmail.com>> wrote:\n\nI\'m good with this.\n\nOn Thursday, November 20, 2014, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com<mailto:dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>> wrote:\n> Nick and I gave HRC two tweet options and two statement options (shorter or longer).
