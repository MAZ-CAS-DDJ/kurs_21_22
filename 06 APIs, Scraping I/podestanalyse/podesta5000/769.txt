Mercedes Schlapp\nsays Martha Raddaz did a very strong job asking tough questions and she has\nthe foreign policy knowledge to go toe to toe with HRC. Ball says when\nBernie Sanders backs off the attack like that, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it look like\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s serious.

Eliana Johnson joins the\nshow saying, you see a very clear strategy emerging from HRC in that she\xe2\x80\x99s\nacting like a general election candidate already. Says HRC is looking to\ntar the rest of the GOP field with Trump\xe2\x80\x99s comments and HRC is assuming\nthat ISIS is doing what it\xe2\x80\x99s doing because of remarks and provocations of\nAmericans. Says Trump\xe2\x80\x99s refute was ridiculous because HRC wasn\xe2\x80\x99t saying\nthat ISIS had shown video of Trump, but that they would do it. Host says\nHRC sees Trump as the general election opponent. Says she\xe2\x80\x99s puzzled as to\nwhat Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 strategy in handling the data breach was. Says it\xe2\x80\x99s\nsurprising that he continues to back down rather than attacking HRC.

Says HRC\ndid well and O\xe2\x80\x99Malley was irrelevant. Alan Colmes says HRC does well in\ndebates and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be protected. Says as a democrat, he wants the\ndebates to be on a night when people are going to watch. Says HRC\xe2\x80\x99s\ncampaign will sit very well with people who are going to vote, even if the\nbusiness doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love it. Ed Rollins says this debate was more of the same.

The legislation, which did\nnot pass the Senate, does not actually ban people form buying guns who are\non the no-fly list.

Panel joins the show to discuss HRC\xe2\x80\x99s ISIS\nstrategy. Charles Hurt says pretty much everything HRC said in the speech\ntouched on the State Department, and the question is why she didn\xe2\x80\x99t do\nthese things when she was SoS. Doug Schoen says we need a multi-pronged\napproach and HRC is right. Tucker Carlson says assault weapons have nothing\nto do with assault weapons. Doug Schoen says once HRC defeats Sanders, he\xe2\x80\x99s\ngoing to move to the right. Carlson says HRC is pandering to the left\nbecause she is getting spooked by Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 candidacy.

HRC was not about to let Sanders get\noff too easy with his apology. HRC claims that the American people are not\ninterested in the Democratic controversy; she believed that people wanted\nto hear more about Republicans and Donald Trump. HRC went on to say that\nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric is being used by ISIS recruiters through video, which has\nno support or backup evidence. GOP pounced on the remark about HRC claiming\nthat America is where it needs to be on ISIS.

HRC claimed that\nTrump is becoming ISIS\xe2\x80\x99 best recruiter. Experts say that there is no\nevidence that those videos exist. Trump weighed in by saying that HRC lied\nabout those remarks. David Gergen claims that CNN\xe2\x80\x99s search team did a\nthorough search about HRC\xe2\x80\x99s remarks. They concluded that Trump\xe2\x80\x99s comments\nare probably helping ISIS regarding going to people, etc. However, there is\nno evidence of such videos. The overall charge of these claims was false.\nGergen claims that he does not understand why HRC would go so far as to say\nthat there are videos of Trump that ISIS uses. She made the remark more\nconcrete, but left the remark open to controversy about stretching the\ntruth. Gergen claims that Trump\xe2\x80\x99s attack on HRC as a \xe2\x80\x9csnake\xe2\x80\x9d is\n\xe2\x80\x9crepulsive\xe2\x80\x9d, and these types of remarks should get him into trouble.

Tom Fuentes comments on how the candidates on both\nsides are ignorant about how to combat ISIS through encryption software.\nHRC. HRC has said that she wants to destroy ISIS, according to Larry\nSabato. The fact that HRC stuck to the frame of being on top of the ISIS\nsituation will become a huge controversy; it could potentially be shown in\nmany opposition videos. With toughness, voters will listen. Tom Fuentes\nclaims that self-radicalization occurs in someone\xe2\x80\x99s brain; unless they tell\nothers or use social media, it is very difficult to track ISIS recruits. If\nHRC wants to beat a GOP candidate, she must be able to counteract this\ntough stance.

MOM claims\nthat there must be more intelligence and that USAID must be separated from\nthe State Department. Anthony Shaffer claims that HRC and other Democrats\nare not moving this as fast as it should be moving. HRC helped create the\nconditions for ISIS by destabilizing Libya.

MOM had a very effective opening; however, it dwindled off\nafter that, solidifying the idea that HRC will be the nominee. Sanders\nkilled the drama of the data breach with an apology. Sanders was strong on\nthese moments. Sanders came out strong, issuing an apology. Sanders put an\nend to the data breach. What Sanders did was egregious, but what the DNC\ndid was an overreaction. HRC does not want to have a discussion bout data\nsecurity due to her own issues with this issue. It is benefitting everyone\nto move on.

Trump is becoming ISIS\xe2\x80\x99\nbest recruiter, according to HRC. The fact checkers claims that there is no\nproof of HRC\xe2\x80\x99s comment. The Data breach-gate was not turned into a scandal\ndue to the apology of Sanders. HRC won this controversy, according to\nJackie Kucinich. HRC decided that it was not in her best interest to go\nafter Sanders. The issue completely diffused. MOM seemed to even be thrown\noff by this scandal. The campaign did not align messages going into the\ndebate. Tad Devine escalated the controversy before the debate, but nothing\nhappened during the debate. This scandal is over. Sanders has had\nopportunities to go after HRC on tech issues, yet he declined this time\nagain. He has not put up a big fight against her. Sanders has a bigger\nproblem than the data breach gate, but his biggest problem is the issue of\nterrorism. HRC trumps Sanders in polling on the issue of national security\nand terrorism. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 passion lies with domestic issues and income\ninequality. Sanders campaign wants to be much more negative with HRC, but\nhis campaign wants to be much more negative with HRC. The campaign wants\nhim to fight with HRC on guns, national security, etc, but he just wants to\ntalk about his issues. HRC turned her focus from Sanders to Donald Trump.

HRC looked past her fellow Dems\nand attacked Trump various times; e.g. HRC saying Trump has become one of\nISIS\xe2\x80\x99 best recruiters. Some light moments: HRC coming back late after a\ncommercial break and when she wrapped up her closing remarks with \xe2\x80\x9cmay the\nforce be with.\xe2\x80\x9d Panel with April Ryan, Dana Milbank, and Adolfo Franco.\nRyan says Sanders seemed different, not as passionate but still forceful,\nwas someone who seemed presidential but also real (e.g. apologized and\nlater said we need to give her credit for being a transformative FLOTUS);\nhe still challenged HRC and MOM. Milbank says Sanders isn\xe2\x80\x99t a\nconfrontational person so it\xe2\x80\x99s expected he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t start a fight with HRC;\nsays he and everyone knows he won\xe2\x80\x99t be the nominee, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bridge\nburning but respectfully challenging.

Says she is a careful\ncandidate and rightly focused on the GOP field. Ryan says Trump has changed\nthe political landscape with his divisive tactics. Sharpton asks if HRC is\ndoing enough to drive out her base by being so careful.

HRC and Sanders called somewhat of a truce\nover the Sanders campaign data breach, only hours after the Sanders camp\nfired 2 more staffers over the scandal. Night was largely dominated by\nforeign policy and ISIS, though the data breach was big at the start.\nSanders quickly apologized over it, and HRC agreed it was time to move\non. Debate\npivoted to foreign policy, and HRC took the opportunity to slam Trump\xe2\x80\x99s\ndivisive rhetoric. HRC came under fire for saying we\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x9cwhere we need to\nbe\xe2\x80\x9d on ISIS: Bush tweeted that we\xe2\x80\x99re not. Sanders argued she\xe2\x80\x99s weak on\nnational security and too aggressive on regime change. They clashed on\nalmost every topic; HRC said \xe2\x80\x9ceverybody should\xe2\x80\x9d love her about Wall St, and\nSanders said they won\xe2\x80\x99t like him as president.

HRC\nhad a strong debate but she was on the defensive over the no-fly zone and\ngaffed in saying that we\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x9cwhere we need to be\xe2\x80\x9d on ISIS. Insana said the\ncomment was taken a bit out of context since she was talking about the UN\nresolution and that\xe2\x80\x99s true in that case but not in general. Hayworth says\nHRC was an integral part of the administration that got us to this point in\nSyria and was inattentive as Secretary of State, e.g. empowering Sunni\nallies like Jordan, Kurds, Saudis.Herbert says he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ve\nignored those groups but debates are always full of empty rhetoric and it\xe2\x80\x99s\n\xe2\x80\x9cnever clear\xe2\x80\x9d what HRC means. Says candidates make comments on foreign\npolicy that have nothing to do with real POTUS situations. Insana says the\nUS can\xe2\x80\x99t control things like Arab Spring revolutions. MOM hit HRC and\nSanders on guns. Host says MOM has done many things the Dem progressive\nbase likes but is still very low in the polls. Hayworth says his record as\nmayor of Baltimore is mixed since Baltimore is still not great for people\nthere that need it. Herbert says MOM was desperate to talk about any issue\nthat will get him attention; says HRC and Sanders should not be targets on\nthe issue of gun control, it should be the Republicans he should attack.

Last night was the last Dem debate of the year. It\nwas on the \xe2\x80\x9cTV graveyard\xe2\x80\x9d of Saturday night. Sanders really needed to make\nthe debate count to take up for the media\xe2\x80\x99s lower tendency to cover his\ncampaign. Recent analysis by the Tyndall Report that tracks nightly news\nelection coverage found that Sanders got just 10 mins out of 857 mins of\n2015 campaign coverage, compared to 234 for Trump and 113 for HRC. This\nweek those numbers rose with coverage of the Sanders data breach and being\ncut off by the DNC. Sanders got access again on Saturday morning and 2 more\nstaffers have been fired; Clinton campaign was \xe2\x80\x9cpleased\xe2\x80\x9d about those\ndevelopments. It was the first question at the debate and Sanders\napologized, HRC said we should move on. Debate was then a chance for\nSanders to try to have a moment; shows clip of Sanders saying he had\ncourage in votes for gun control, corporations and Wall St won\xe2\x80\x99t like him. HRC\ntoed the line between brushing off attacks and staying far ahead of the\npack. MOM came out swinging. Interview with Debbie Wasserman-Schultz; first\nquestion is if the DNC made the debate schedule to help HRC. DWS says no,\nshe can\xe2\x80\x99t impact the network TV schedules which made it on Saturday.

Dem candidates\ndebated in NH and got into a heated exchange over gun violence: HRC said\nguns in themselves will not help us be more secure, Sanders said criminals\nor mentally unstable people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have guns, MOM said Sanders and HRC\nrepresented interests that didn\xe2\x80\x99t close the gun show loophole.  Witt asks\nwho won and if it matters since HRC is so far ahead in the polls. Peters\nsays new CBS poll in NH shows Sanders widening his lead there, it shows the\nenthusiasm gap between Sanders and HRC campaigns and HRC needs to energize\nher supporters. Peters says she played it safe, focused more on Trump than\nSanders or MOM, is focused on the general election.Witt asks if she has no\nchoice but to embrace POTUS Syria strategy and if it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful. Peters says\nit\xe2\x80\x99s tricky, she has advocated a more interventionist approach that Obama\nin the past. On Trump, HRC said he\xe2\x80\x99s ISIS\xe2\x80\x99 best recruiter. Peters says it\xe2\x80\x99s\na claim to make in front of an audience, she wants to link Trump to the\nGOP.

Trump said it was another HRC lie and she lies about\neverything. Leigh Ann Caldwell reporting. Says it\xe2\x80\x99s easy for HRC to go\nafter Trump since Dems don\xe2\x80\x99t like him, it doesn\'t serve her to go after her\nopponents since she\xe2\x80\x99s the frontrunner. She did have oppo on Sanders and MOM\nand was able to defend herself. Witt asks who won and if it matters since\nHRC is so far ahead. Caldwell says she\xe2\x80\x99s ahead everywhere but NH where\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s tied or just behind Sanders. Says both had good nights; debate showed\nsubstantive policy differences between the 2. On Syria, HRC supports a\nno-fly zone and getting rid of Assad; Sanders supports single-payer\nhealthcare, free college tuition, and raising taxes for paid leave. HRC\nsaid no new taxes for the middle class. Commentary from Annie Linskey and\nPaul Singer. Linskey said each candidate had their best debate of the\nnight: Sanders people said he looked presidential, HRC people said she\nlooked happy and relaxed, MOM people said he got his points in on gun\ncontrol, etc. Witt says new poll shows Sanders with 48% vs HRC with 46% in\nNH, so his lead is down. Singer says the debate didn\xe2\x80\x99t really change\nanything in the race.
