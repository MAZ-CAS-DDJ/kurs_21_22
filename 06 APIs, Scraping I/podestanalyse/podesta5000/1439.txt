Not precisely what we ended up with in the book but very close conceptually.  Worth putting that answer in front of her again so she can recall the components and close the loop on some of these concepts when she talks.\n>\n> From: Ron Klain <rklain@aol.com<mailto:rklain@aol.com>>\n> Date: Saturday, December 5, 2015 at 9:17 PM\n> To: "Jake.Sullivan@gmail.com<mailto:Jake.Sullivan@gmail.com>" <Jake.Sullivan@gmail.com<mailto:Jake.Sullivan@gmail.com>>, Jake Sullivan <jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com>>, "karen.l.dunn@gmail.com<mailto:karen.l.dunn@gmail.com>" <karen.l.dunn@gmail.com<mailto:karen.l.dunn@gmail.com>>, Karen Dunn <kdunn@bsfllp.com<mailto:kdunn@bsfllp.com>>, Sara Margolis <sim457@georgetown.edu<mailto:sim457@georgetown.edu>>, Kristina Costa <kcosta@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:kcosta@hillaryclinton.com>>, Tony Carrk <tcarrk@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:tcarrk@hillaryclinton.com>>, \'John Podesta\' <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>\n> Cc: Ron Klain <rklain@aol.com<mailto:rklain@aol.com>>, "ron.klain@revolution.com<mailto:ron.klain@revolution.com>" <ron.klain@revolution.com<mailto:ron.klain@revolution.com>>\n> Subject: Debate Book Update\n>\n> This is what I think we should do based on tonight\xe2\x80\x99s sessions:\n>\n>\n> 1.
