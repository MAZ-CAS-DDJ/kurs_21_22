john.podesta@gmail.comb'::: ProgressNow - Building the online progressive movement state by state ::: \n\n\n\n\nApril, 2011\n\nFriends, supporters, and colleagues,\n\nProgressNow is not just throwing punches in the budget fights in our\nstates. We\'re landing them.\n\nRead below about just some of the ways we\'re affecting the\nbudget battles in Florida, Ohio, Colorado and Washington.\n\nAfter feedback from some of you about our updates we decided to limit\nthe number of states we highlight this time, and provide more detail.\n\nLet us know which format you best enjoy. And as always let us know how\nwe can continue to throw - and land - the punches.\n\nBest,\n\nDenise Cardinal\nExecutive Director\nProgressNow and ProgressNow Education\n612.269.9276\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nProgressFlorida http://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=ObPVjONf2NWs4c3ZVvN0Ow..\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n"Ray Seaman of Ocala, online director for Progress Florida, a\nprogressive group, is credited as the father of the Awake the State\nrallies that led thousands to come out against Scott\'s agenda on\nTuesday as the governor was delivering the State of the State\nAddress"\n\n- Ocala Star-Banner, March 9th\n\n\nFlorida Awakens!\n\nMust see video:\n\nATS Video - http://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=i8RYbMfgUYtGB7ILdL6v0w..\n\nWorking closely with our allies Florida Watch Action and America\nVotes, Progress Florida helped spearhead the "Awake The\nState" rallies held throughout Florida on March 8th to send a\nclear message to Gov. Rick Scott and the legislature: Stop the attacks\non Florida\'s middle class. Thanks to a growing backlash against\nthe devastating budget cuts being proposed by Gov. Scott and\nlegislative leaders, and the tireless work of activists and local\norganizers throughout the state, more than 15,000 Floridians turned\nout to more than 30 rallies from Pensacola to Key West.\xa0\n\nThe rallies garnered media coverage from virtually every news outlet\nin the state, helping draw attention to the war on the middle class\nbeing waged in Tallahassee by right-wing extremists and corporate\nspecial interests.\xa0\n\nPublic opinion has already shifted in our favor: a poll released last\nweek shows that Gov. Scott is "incredibly unpopular"\namongst Florida voters and would get trounced by Alex Sink in a\nhypothetical rematch of November\'s gubernatorial race.\n\n\xa0\n\n:: Defending Women\'s Health From Right-Wing Attacks ::\n\nGov. Rick Scott and Republican leaders in the legislature ran on a\nplatform of creating jobs, jobs and more jobs.\xa0 And yet, these\nsame leaders have filed 18 different bills that attack women\'s\nhealth and reproductive rights. As one Progress Florida member told us\n"last time I checked, there are no jobs in my uterus."\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=bdrZSxL74qq0X_MNUgSy4g..\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=lzFyRJjIvVzI84NaALbsHQ..\n\nWorking with our allies at the Florida Association of Planned\nParenthood Affiliates, we\'ve activated our network of more than\n100,000 e-activists to send a powerful message to key legislators:\nstop the attack on women\'s health!\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=t09S3MVOX4fBfPNDzorCew..\n\nSo far, Progress Florida members have submitted 28, 423 E-letters in\nopposition to these attacks on women\'s health to 26 state\nsenators that sit on key committees debating this critical issue.\n\n\n:: Tweeting a Better Florida ::\n\nProgress Florida has been named one of Florida\'s top political\nTweeters by The Washington Post.\xa0\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=N3m6WL2qcQucVL5eQwkriA..\n\nAdditionally, with more than 4,000 followers, including hundreds of\nmedia outlets and reporters, elected officials,\xa0 opinion leaders,\nand a \'Klout\' score of 62, we\'re currently ranked\nthe 7th most influential Tweeter in Florida politics.\xa0 This\nranking is based on our \'Klout" score and a prominent\nFlorida based political news blog that publishes a monthly list of the\ntop 100+ political Tweeters in Florida.\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=N7xbwovOfZob_O-4641qKA..\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=WPYFgIvHcL6lLYL8FSJYmA..\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=ST_bvUx6ecRbQFvED19lAA..\n\n:: FightForFlorida.com Launched ::\n\nWorking in close collaboration, the Florida AFL-CIO and Progress\nFlorida recently launched FightForFlorida.com, an online action hub\nfor working Floridians fighting back against the assault on\nFlorida\'s middle class by Gov. Scott and the leadership of the\nlegislature.\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=zPubK2KZ_dLDi7iA4gE81g..\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=O7-Z8cvE4fYa4HH3i6gbrg..\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=njuHGrFQ60WEsMR2L1mwnQ..\n\nAmong the ways citizens can already get involved via\nFightForFlorida.com:\n\n*  A letter-writing campaign urging legislators to oppose the\n"Worker Gag Bill" (SB 830).\n\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=p8-d3Ab2otlrohYx2ebJ6g..\n\n*  A campaign to stop the imposition of an unfair 3-5% tax on\nnurses, teachers, police, firefighters and other public\nemployees.\n\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=aeHQDn0H2L2O3N79qYpy6w..\n\n*  A petition to Gov. Rick Scott asking: Where Are The Jobs?\n\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=kqHqyOn4ThKm1HXg-fMKEw..\n\nYou can also stay informed about the ongoing Fight For Florida at the\ncampaign\'s Facebook page.\xa0 Onward and upward!\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=qtH4v7d_hKzjisgpqXdctg..\n\n\n:: Fair Districts Fight Rages On ::\n\nOn March 23rd, we issued an alert asking our network members to tell\nGov. Scott to quit playing politics and stop stalling the\nimplementation of Fair Districts - Amendments 5 and 6. Our\nnetwork responded in a big way and 48 hours later we delivered\nthousands of petitions directly to the Governor\'s office.\xa0\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=J6MykaQ1R_n9qF9zxQAbWw..\n\nA week later, thanks to public pressure and a lawsuit filed by the\nLeague of Women Voters, Democracia, the Florida NAACP and concerned\ncitizens, the legislature announced they finally submitted the\namendments to the Justice Department for certification.\n\nThis good news is tempered by the fact that the submission was done in\na way designed to allow Republicans to continue gerrymandering\ndistricts despite the unambiguous language of the amendments.\xa0\nWe\'ll continue working with our allies at Fair Districts Now to\ncounter efforts by the Republican majority to sidestep the will of\nvoters and rig future elections.\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=5j0sne5SYp3dSZwA7Keqzg..\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=x8xJ-C94sDmszjn4rC9MZA..\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nProgress Ohio - http://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=A18QWpjqNazurzuMFiKRPA..\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nProgressOhio was referenced by name in news articles 14 consecutive\ndays in March. During March, our work generated over 38 different news\nstories on a diverse array of topics:\n\n*  ProgressOhio lawsuit that removed unconstitutional state\ndirector\n*  ProgressOhio lawsuit to ensure citizen access to the Statehouse,\nafter being locked out by police our role fighting the\nanti-labor SB5, the largest protest at the Ohio Statehouse since\nVietnam\n*  Celebrating the first anniversary of Affordable Care Act\n*  First profit sharing checks for Ohio GM workers\n*  Policy criticism of Gov. Kasich\'s proposed budget\n*  3 separate musical protests we organized over corporate tax\nbreaks, budget and anti-union corporate donations\n*  An evaluation of our flash mob series\n*  Research on Koch brother donations and environmental policy\n*  ProgressOhio members riding a bus from rural areas to attend\nprotests\n\nBetween 2/28/11 and 4/1/11, ProgressOhio made the Associated Press\nwire five times. Per Google, these articles were republished over\n20,000 times.\n\n\xa0\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nProgressNow Colorado - http://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=JHhv-p3qsWQ1WpQ0Gw1mRg..\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\xa0\n\nAfter CO SB 200 was highjacked by the Tea Party, the House Judiciary\nCommittee voted on a party line vote to kill civil unions. Over the\nlast three months, ProgressNow Colorado provided much-appreciated support\nto One Colorado from helping to plan strategy, prepping legislators for testimony to working directly with the media. ProgressNow Colorado also worked closely with our partners at One Colorado, Gill Foundation Gill Action and others on the issue. The civil unions team put together one of the most well-organized, well-executed and impressive efforts (including packing three hearing rooms at the Capitol this week for an eight-hour hearing on the bill during which close to 100 people testified in favor of civil unions) ever seen. Mike Littwin does a\ngreat job of summing up what happened and where to go from here: Littwin\nEditorial - http://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=bCH9IQKRS6orEw9xUEtQ6A..\n\n\n:: Providing Communication Expertise to our Partners ::\n\nIn addition to sending out email blasts and providing strategic advice\nin a number of settings, ProgressNow is continually working with our\npartners to help them with their communications needs. Through our\nstaff and our consultants ProgressNow is recognized as a go-to\ncommunications organization for our expertise in conceiving and executing strategic communications with our project partners.\n\nGroups have come to depend on ProgressNow for help. Two weeks ago\nColorado Consumer Health Initiative found itself shorthanded when their\ncommunications director had to leave town suddenly due to a death in\nthe family. This happened just days before an intense week of activities marking the first anniversary of the signing of health care reform. CCHI\'s Executive Director, Dede de Percin, asked if they could "borrow" our human resources for the crucial week. As a representative of ProgressNow, Mark stepped in and helped make sure the week\'s activities went off without a hitch.\n\n:: Insurance Exchanges :: \n\nRep. Amy Stephens added a poison pill to CO SB 200, the bill to set up insurance exchanges in Colorado, after testimony from advocacy organizations, business groups and the Colorado Medical Society. Only the Tea Party president for Arapahoe County testified against it. Rep. Stephens co-sponsored this bill and worked closely with Sen. Boyd to ensure it would be pass with Republican support in the House. We intend to hold Rep. Stephens accountable for her attempts to kill insurance exchanges for small businesses and individuals struggling with insurance costs every day.\n\n\xa0\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nFuse Washington - http://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3aWnDgeEFuIgkm1m4Zc_XA..\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nIt\'s been an exciting few months. Fuse members have turned out in force for two major rallies in Olympia, sent thousands of emails and attended dozens of town halls asking legislators to close unfair tax loopholes. We challenged A.G. Rob McKenna\'s conservative, anti-health care agenda, and we helped efforts to stop predatory lending and transition away from dirty coal power plants in Washington.\n\nOrganizing\n\nRally2a.jpg\n\n"We don\'t believe that cutting nurses and teachers and firefighters is\ngoing to help rebuild our economy, and that\'s really what we need to\nbe focused on right now." - Collin Jergens, Fuse Communications\nManager, KING 5, 2/26/11\n\n*  Fuse members played a major role in the Rally to Protect Our\nFuture that drew 1,500 people in Olympia on March 17, just three weeks\nafter the February 26 event. We organized the rally through the Our\nEconomic Future coalition, urging legislators to take a balanced approach\nto the budget shortfall, including closing tax loopholes and raising\nnew revenue. The rally generated outstanding news coverage,\nincluding this story on KOMO 4: http://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=-Mbz-m6cehbnDm03iQQnzw..\n\n*  Seeking to support the progressive energy generated in Wisconsin, we coordinated a solidarity rally in Olympia on February 26 that drew 2,500 people. Hundreds of Fuse members and MoveOn activists joined a strong labor turnout at the rally, which attracted ten times as many people as the Tea Party gathering on the same day. The rally generated outstanding news coverage, including this story on KING 5: http://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=S0R9ahOPR-reRWKGNsTtMg..\n\n*  We continue to coordinate the progressive community\'s response to our state\'s fiscal crisis. We are organizing the Our Economic Future coalition, which includes a comprehensive media, lobbying, and field program.\n\nLegislation and Policy\n\n*  Working with our partners in the environmental community, we are close to achieving a major victory in an early shutdown of the dirty TransAlta coal plant. This landmark deal would accelerate the transition away from coal at TransAlta and dramatically reduce toxic pollution in our communities.\n\n*  Working with economic justice groups, we helped defeat conservatives\' attempts to repeal critical protections against loan sharks and predatory lending. These consumer protections prevent sleazy payday lenders from creating a debt\ntrap for desperate borrowers.\n\n*  Fuse is working with our partners in the Our Economic Future Coalition to research public support for a range of potential legislative and ballot strategies that would increase state revenues, and to promote bills that would eliminate tax\nloopholes.\n\nCommunications\n\n*  We launched LivingGreedy.com in February, a well-received parody of LivingSocial, Groupon, and other daily discount sites. Instead of coupons, we offer weekly "deals" to trade in unjust tax loopholes to fund education, health care, and other services. You can check out the site and trade in the tax giveaway for Wall Street Banks in order to fund Basic Health for 50,000 working families here: http://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=hYv65gQ3SDZ-fgwtzmMtBg..\n\n*  We have helped generate more than 165 news stories since the beginning of the year, including:\n\n*  Associated Press story on first day of legislative session: http://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=urjBQK7lXxI24Jdxgi_PgQ..\n\n*  Puget Sound Business Journal story about closing tax loopholes: http://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=PHaBZs8_IN7GA0sSPu410g..\n\n*  Rep.
