Several websites promptly dug up a comment from Mr. Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign in which he said the research on whether vaccines cause autism was \xe2\x80\x9cinconclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen it was reported Tuesday that Mrs. Clinton had responded to a questionnaire during the 2008 presidential primary race from a vaccine skeptics group in which she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am committed to make investments to find the causes of autism, including possible environmental causes like vaccines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe episode reveals that the emotionally charged vaccination issue has political pitfalls for both parties as candidates line up for the 2016 presidential contest, even though a Pew Research Center report released last week shows Democrats and Republicans alike strongly support childhood vaccinations.\r\n\r\nA left-right coalition\r\n\r\nFor Republicans, the trick lies with soothing the party\xe2\x80\x99s libertarian wing, which reflexively resists government intervention in the decision-making of parents. For Democrats, the challenge is figuring out how to put Republicans on the ropes without alienating the large pockets of \xe2\x80\x9canti-vaers\xe2\x80\x9d in heavily Democratic areas such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is one of those cases where the far left and the far right converge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Republican political strategist Dick Wadhams. \xe2\x80\x9cI just think it\xe2\x80\x99s poor judgment for anyone to suggest that children should not be vaccinated. It defies logic that someone could even suggest that in this day and age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemocrats jumped on the issue this week following comments by Mr. Christie and Mr. Paul, Kentucky Republican, who said Monday that vaccines \xe2\x80\x9cought to be voluntary\xe2\x80\x9d during a radio interview with host Laura Ingraham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not arguing vaccines are a bad idea. I think they are a good thing, but I think the parent should have some input,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Paul, an ophthalmologist who added that he did have his children vaccinated. \xe2\x80\x9cThe state doesn\xe2\x80\x99t own your children. Parents own the children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Christie and Mr. Paul are both oft-mentioned potential candidates for the 2016 GOP pnomination, making them juicy targets for the Democratic National Committee, which released a statement Monday blasting the Republicans as anti-science.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRepublican after Republican is bowing to the rhetoric of the anti-vaccination movement instead of standing up for the science supported by almost all doctors and scientists on protecting our kids and keeping our nation safe,\xe2\x80\x9d the Democratic National Committee said in a Monday statement.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clinton chimed in with a Tuesday post on Twitter saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThe science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork,\xe2\x80\x9d she tweeted. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s protect all our kids. #GrandmothersKnowBest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemocratic resistance\r\n\r\nBut Democrats have their own cultural vulnerabilities on the issue. Among the communities hit hardest by the recent measles outbreak are Los Angeles and the Bay Area, where Democrats vastly outnumber Republicans and where the anti-vaccination movement is on the rise.\r\n\r\nSuch Democratic environmentalist icons as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have directly blamed vaccines for a rise in autism despite a lack of support by the major scientific and medical organizations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemocrats love to masquerade as if they have no extremists in their party, and this is a classic case that exposes their own far left,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wadhams said.\r\n\r\nA Sept. 10 analysis in the Hollywood Reporter found that vaccination rates have plummeted at some of Los Angeles County\xe2\x80\x99s most exclusive schools, while incidents of whooping cough and measles among children in Southern California are on the rise.\r\n\r\nA study released Sunday in Pediatrics found that underimmunization rates in California have risen from 8.1 percent in 2002-2005 to 12.4 percent in 2010-2012.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the state with the lowest rates of nonimmunization statewide is Mississippi, a state that, despite its conservatism and religiosity, is one of only two in the nation with a state school vaccination requirement that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even have a religious exemption. (The other is West Virginia, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no secret that anti-vaccine sentiments run high on the West Side,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Hollywood Reporter article, referring to the wealthy Democratic Los Angeles County enclave, which includes Beverly Hills and Santa Monica.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the data reveals a community where ambiguous fears about the perceived threat of immunization have in fact caused a very real threat,\xe2\x80\x9d the article continues. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a hard topic to discuss, especially here in Hollywood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x98Whole Foods\xe2\x80\x99 standard\r\n\r\nIn a 2011 interview, author Seth Mnookin released a book called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Panic Virus: The True Story Behind the Vaccine-Austism Controversy\xe2\x80\x9d debunking anti-vaccine theories, and he noted in an interview with Science Magazine that they tend to follow a kind of green cultural liberalism that views with suspicion unnatural technologies such as pharmaceuticals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI talked to a public health official and asked him what\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to anticipate where there might be higher-than-normal rates of vaccine noncompliance, and he said take a map and put a pin wherever there\xe2\x80\x99s a Whole Foods. I sort of laughed, and he said, \xe2\x80\x98No, really, I\xe2\x80\x99m not joking.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s those communities with the Prius-driving, composting, organic food-eating people,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nAnother potential threat to public health stems from the influx of illegal immigrants, an issue that was broached Tuesday by Rep. Mo Brooks, Alabama Republican. Like many other Republicans, he has fought to tighten border security over the objections of Democrats.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is any health care professional who has examined the facts who can honestly say Americans have not died because the disease is brought into America by illegal aliens who are not properly health care screened as lawful immigrants are,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brooks told radio host Matt Murphy on WAPI-AM in Birmingham.\r\n\r\nHis comment was promptly ridiculed in a post on the left-wing website ThinkProgress, which called his theory a \xe2\x80\x9cred herring\xe2\x80\x9d and said the only evidence of foreigners carrying in diseases was \xe2\x80\x9ca few incidents of cases traced to European travelers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat wasn\xe2\x80\x99t how Dr. Marc Siegel described the situation in a July article in the liberal online publication Slate. His op-ed, \xe2\x80\x9cA Public Health Crisis at the Border,\xe2\x80\x9d argued that the flood of unaccompanied minors \xe2\x80\x9cin poor health or suffering from a communicable illness who enter this country illegally create[s] public health risks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere have been reports of measles and chicken pox at the [processing] centers, both of which are highly contagious and can spread to other children who aren\xe2\x80\x99t vaccinated,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Siegel, medical director of Doctor Radio at New York University\xe2\x80\x99s Langone Medical Center.\r\n\r\nPoliticians get involved\r\n\r\nAs the number of measles cases climbs over 100, politicians are increasingly under pressure to take a stand on what was not long ago a nonissue. Ben Carson, another potential Republican presidential contender, came out squarely in favor of vaccinations in a statement Monday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough I strongly believe in individual rights and the rights of parents to raise their children as they see fit, I also recognize that public health and public safety are extremely important in our society,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Carson, a former neurosurgeon in a statement to The Hill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertain communicable diseases have been largely eradicated by immunization policies in this country, and we should not allow those diseases to return by foregoing safe immunization programs for philosophical, religious or other reasons when we have the means to eradicate them,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Carson said.\r\n\r\nAs the issue and the politics mushroomed, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday that \xe2\x80\x9cthe president believes it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t require a law to exercise common sense and do the right thing. The science and the expert guidance is crystal-clear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe also downplayed his boss\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 and, by extension, Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 2008 comments about vaccines and autism, saying that the study that raised questions about a link has since been \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely undermined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe publisher of the major study suggesting a link \xe2\x80\x94 the prestigious British journal The Lancet, in a 1998 paper \xe2\x80\x94 indeed only repudiated the article in 2010, citing fraud by researcher Andrew Wakefield, who is now banned from practicing medicine.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as Democrats and environmentalists say is the case with climate change today, there was overwhelming consensus in 2008, if not absolute unanimity, on the lack of a link between vaccines and autism. The Lancet study had come under withering criticism for, among other things, a sample size of 12.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Absolutely preposterous\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt should have been clear to any science reporter that there was no way to draw the conclusion [Mr. Wakefield] did from that study. Even if his data were reliable, even if none of the issues of selection bias and fraud had ever come up, drawing huge, broad conclusions from a 12-person case study is absolutely preposterous,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mnookin said.\r\n\r\nAccording to a 2008 CNN report on an autism lawsuit, \xe2\x80\x9cThe CDC, American Academy of Pediatrics, Institute of Medicine and other prestigious medical organizations maintain there is no known link between vaccines and autism. Studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine and elsewhere also have found no link.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe government has made absolutely no statement indicating that vaccines are a cause of autism,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Julie Gerberding, former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at the time.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, both House Speaker John A. Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell found themselves making statements supporting vaccinations Tuesday, as did such Republican presidential contenders as Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Paul, he tweeted a photo of himself getting a booster shot and issued a statement rebutting claims he and/or his party is anti-science.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt just annoys me that I\xe2\x80\x99m being characterized as someone who\xe2\x80\x99s against vaccines,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Paul said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s 400 headlines now that say \xe2\x80\x98Paul says vaccines cause mental disorders,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9c he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not what I said. I said I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of people who\xe2\x80\x99ve had vaccines, and they see a temporal association, and they believe that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nVaccine debate presents a political minefield \xe2\x80\x94 as Hillary Clinton can attest (WAPO)\r\nBy Karen Tumulty\r\nFebruary 4, 2015\r\nThe Washington Post\r\n\r\nThe latest tweet from Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded straightforward enough: \xe2\x80\x9cThe science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the issue of vaccinations has long been politically and emotionally fraught \xe2\x80\x94 involving not just public health but also the proper role of government, the prerogatives of parents and medical riddles that have yet to be solved.\r\n\r\nProbably no one in public life today has felt those crosscurrents more strongly than the presumed front-runner for the 2016 Democratic nomination. On the issue of vaccination over the past two decades, Clinton has repeatedly found herself on the front lines of advocacy and criticism.\r\n\r\nOther politicians \xe2\x80\x94 including two potential GOP presidential hopefuls, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) \xe2\x80\x94 have been learning those political lessons the hard way in recent days. Both made statements questioning whether childhood vaccinations should be mandatory, bringing a torrent of criticism, including from medical professionals who are alarmed over a recent rise in measles cases.\r\n\r\nAs a new first lady in 1993, Clinton championed what became the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\xe2\x80\x99s Vaccines for Children program, designed to provide free inoculations against nine diseases to children who otherwise might not get them. It now covers 14 diseases.\r\n\r\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s role in that endeavor landed her in the crossfire. Conservatives blamed her when shortfalls of some vaccines developed in subsequent years, arguing that the private market was better at allocating resources. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of her pet projects is a bust,\xe2\x80\x9d the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote in a 2003 piece headlined \xe2\x80\x9cHillary\xe2\x80\x99s Vaccine Shortage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Clinton also found herself the target of a burgeoning movement that linked the rising rate of autism to thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative that has since been removed from childhood vaccines. Some advocates of this theory went so far as to dub her \xe2\x80\x9cThimerosal Hillary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor reasons that scientists cannot explain, the incidence of autism is up markedly. Last year, the CDC estimated that 1 in 68 children age 8 had been identified with the range of conditions known as autism spectrum disorder. That was about 30 percent higher than previous estimates, reported in 2012, of 1 in 88 children.\r\n\r\nClinton, as a presidential candidate in 2008, wrote in response to a candidate questionnaire: \xe2\x80\x9cI am committed to make investments to find the causes of autism, including possible environmental causes like vaccines. .\xe2\x80\x89.\xe2\x80\x89. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know what, if any, kind of link there is between vaccines and autism \xe2\x80\x94 but we should find out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer then-rival, Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.), also called for more research into whether there was some correlation. And 2008 GOP presidential contender John McCain (R-Ariz.) went so far as to say there was \xe2\x80\x9cstrong evidence\xe2\x80\x9d of a connection between vaccines and autism. But even in 2008, the weight of medical evidence was against such a link and the candidates who indulged such speculation were accused of pandering.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, the argument against vaccination received a devastating blow from the Lancet, a medical journal that 12 years before had published a study alleging that inoculations for measles, mumps and rubella were a cause of autism. The journal retracted the study, saying the supposed research had been falsified.\r\n\r\nAnother iteration of the vaccination issue flared in the 2012 Republican primary campaign, when then-Gov. Rick \xc2\xadPerry of Texas found himself under fire for a mandate requiring most girls in his state to get inoculated against the human papillomavirus, a sexual infection that can lead to cervical cancer. Some social conservatives argued that it would encourage girls to have sex.\r\n\r\nRepublican leaders have not welcomed the rekindling of the vaccine debate sparked by Christie\xe2\x80\x99s comment Monday that parents should have \xe2\x80\x9csome measure of choice\xe2\x80\x9d in deciding whether to vaccinate their children. Paul \xe2\x80\x94 a physician with a libertarian philosophy \xe2\x80\x94 joined the argument with an unfounded claim that there are \xe2\x80\x9cmany tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul took to Twitter on Tuesday to defend himself, saying he supports vaccinations and posing for photographs as he received a booster shot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not say vaccines caused disorders, just that they were temporally related \xe2\x80\x94 I did not allege causation,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in one tweet.\r\n\r\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) sought to tamp the furor down by saying Tuesday, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we need another law, but I do believe that all children ought to be vaccinated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, several other potential 2016 contenders distanced themselves from Christie and Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely, all children in America should be vaccinated,\xe2\x80\x9d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Tuesday. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless their immune [system is] suppressed, obviously, for medical exceptions, but I believe that all children, as is the law in most states in this country, before they can even attend school, have to be vaccinated for a certain panel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) also released a statement criticizing \xe2\x80\x9cfear mongering\xe2\x80\x9d and added: \xe2\x80\x9cPersonally, I would not send my kids to a school that did not require vaccinations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHillary Clinton, grandma-in-chief (Politico)\r\nBy Gabriel DeBenedetti\r\nFebruary 3, 2015\r\nPolitico\r\n\r\n\r\nHillary Clinton is embracing her inner grandma.\r\n\r\nAfter Republican 2016 hopefuls spent a day struggling to finesse the vaccination debate, the 67-year-old Clinton weighed in roughly an hour before midnight: \xe2\x80\x9cThe science is clear,\xe2\x80\x9d she tweeted late Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cThe earth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork. Let\xe2\x80\x99s protect all our kids. #GrandmothersKnowBest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was just 127 characters, but it struck a chord \xe2\x80\x94 especially her new hashtag. By Tuesday evening the tweet had garnered roughly 24,000 retweets \xe2\x80\x94 reaching millions of Twitter followers and making it her most-shared tweet since she jabbed Fox during February 2014\xe2\x80\x99s Super Bowl.\r\n\r\nThe Monday night tweet was just her sixth in 2015, but some of her backers felt it might shed new light on her candidacy.\r\n\r\nThe message offered a look at how Clinton might approach her likely 2016 campaign for the White House \xe2\x80\x94 and how she might combat Republican attacks on her age.\r\n\r\nWhile Clinton allies and detractors uniformly cautioned that too much of her strategy should not be inferred from a single late-night tweet, her backers also said the post demonstrated her intention to use her family \xe2\x80\x94 specifically, her 4-month-old granddaughter, Charlotte \xe2\x80\x94 as an important strand of her campaign message. It also hinted at how she intends to try to garner positive press \xe2\x80\x94 and present herself as the adult in the room \xe2\x80\x94 as the crowded Republican field dukes it out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does tap into something that is potentially really powerful for her in terms of how she connects, and how she communicates,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chris Lehane, a Democratic strategist and alum of President Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s White House. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen she offers a theory of government and connects it to her biography, in particular being a mom and a grandma, and talking about intergenerational equity issues and the possibility to do right by your kids \xe2\x80\x94 the combination there is a really, really powerful way to communicate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClinton first trotted out her granddaughter as a character in her 2014 stump speech while campaigning for Democrats across the country, using the infant Charlotte as a justification for her continued investment in the country\xe2\x80\x99s future. The 4-month-old Charlotte has been featured in more than a dozen of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s public appearances, making her a staple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have this little baby, you spend a lot of time just staring at her. You really resolve, as her parents and grandparents \xe2\x80\xa6 [to] do whatever we can to make sure she has the opportunities she deserves to have,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said in New Hampshire in November.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should not have to be the grandchild of a president to get a good education, to get good health care,\xe2\x80\x9d she said a month earlier in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nDemocrats see this rhetoric as a way to spin Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s age to her advantage, and as a chance to show off Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s family life to female voters and her personal warmth to young voters.\r\n\r\nClinton is also expected to rely more on her prospective status as the first female president during her campaign, and allies expect her to focus on her daughter and granddaughter when making her case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like grandmothers? What generation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like grandmothers? Young people like grandmothers, historically, more than mothers and fathers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jerry Crawford, the Des Moines attorney who served as the Midwest co-chairman of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cIt really, really is very authentic. Anybody that\xe2\x80\x99s been a grandparent knows that once you are, you have it on your mind at every moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTerry Shumaker, a former ambassador and New Hampshire-based co-chairman of Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaigns, added that Hillary Clinton had been working on children\xe2\x80\x99s issues since the 1980s, including during her tenure at the State Department, so it made sense for her to weigh in like this on a topic \xe2\x80\x9cnear and dear to her heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill, Clinton is older than each of the major likely Republican candidates, and conservative reactions to her Monday night message previewed the difficulties she might run into explicitly campaigning as a grandmother and as a candidate somehow separated from the bickering of the Republican hopefuls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I the only one who finds Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s #GrandmothersKnowBest hashtag not just cloying but creepy? Welcome to the grand-nanny state,\xe2\x80\x9d tweeted Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard.\r\n\r\nSuch objections also reflect Republican resistance to letting Clinton float above the mud of the nominating season in the event that she does not get a viable challenger. Democratic allies said occasional targeted tweets like Monday\xe2\x80\x99s could let Clinton seem like the adult in a room of fighting Republicans who will most likely get much more national attention with their squabbles. This tactic would let her stay engaged with the daily conversation without dragging herself into unproductively prolonged debates with Republicans, backers argue.\r\n\r\nBut Republican critics peg messages like Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s tweet as overthought and artificial, a vulnerability they see in many of her communications.\r\n\r\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s team has been tight-lipped while preparing for the likely campaign, releasing few public statements while the former secretary of state meets with advisers and largely stays out of the public eye. As a result, her occasional tweets are pored over by her backers and opponents as rare, if safe, insights into her thinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s demonstrating extreme caution both in how she is engaging on issues and in the way she frames them. An 11 p.m. tweet that reverses her previous position on the issue and reads like it was crafted by committee doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly scream \xe2\x80\x98authenticity,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Tim Miller of Republican opposition research firm America Rising, referring to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 statement that she was committed to finding the causes of autism, including looking at vaccines.\r\n\r\nAbsent a Democratic challenger specifically criticizing Clinton and going after her presumed voters, however, many of her supporters see little downside to her only occasionally wading into the issue of the moment with a strategically placed policy-based barb against Republicans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis mom for one would love to see #GrandmothersKnowBest make an appearance in future tweets,\xe2\x80\x9d said Democratic strategist Lynda Tran, an adviser to Ready For Hillary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPro-Elizabeth Warren Group Opens New Hampshire Office (WSJ)\r\nBy Peter Nicholas\r\nFebruary 4, 2015\r\nThe Wall Street Journal\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) has been sounding more definitive of late in saying she won\xe2\x80\x99t run for president.\r\n\r\nUndeterred, a group of her most ardent supporters have hired four campaign staffers in New Hampshire and opened an office in Manchester in hopes of luring her into the race as a liberal challenger to Hillary Clinton.\r\n\r\nDemocracy for America, a liberal political action committee, is stepping up its efforts to draft Ms. Warren, announcing Wednesday that it is creating a pro-Warren campaign apparatus in the state that holds the first primary of the presidential campaign season.\r\n\r\nThe group has hired Kurt Ehrenberg, a former political director for the New Hampshire AFL-CIO, as state director of what it calls the \xe2\x80\x9cRun Warren Run\xe2\x80\x9d campaign.\r\n\r\nJoining Mr. Ehrenberg are three field organizers: Jake Belanger, Diego Hernandez, and Jennica Simms -- all of whom have worked on Democratic congressional campaigns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m excited to join activists all across the Granite State to ensure we live up to our proud tradition of defying expectations, upsetting conventional wisdom, and picking presidents by working to bring Sen. Elizabeth Warren and her populist progressive vision for our country into 2016\xe2\x80\x99s first-in-the-nation primary,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Ehrenberg said in a prepared statement.\r\n\r\nDemocracy for America said it also plans to open an office in Portsmouth, N.H., and will hold events later this month.\r\n\r\nWhether any of this will make a difference is far from certain For months Ms. Warren used language that didn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely seem to rule out a presidential bid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not running for president,\xe2\x80\x9d she would say. And say and say again. But in a recent interview she dropped the present tense construction that seemed to leave her room to change her mind.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to Fortune magazine she employed the future tense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to run for president?\xe2\x80\x9d she was asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\nMr. Ehrenberg\xe2\x80\x99s task is to get Ms. Warren to reconsider. The idea is to demonstrate she enjoys an impassioned following in a state that has made or broken many a presidential candidate in modern American political history.\r\n\r\nIt won\xe2\x80\x99t be easy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clinton, who is expected to announce her candidacy some time in the next two-to-five months (sorry, that\xe2\x80\x99s as specific an answer as anyone will give right now), would be the overwhelming front-runner in New Hampshire. She won the state in 2008, injecting new life in her campaign after she finished third in the Iowa caucuses that year.\r\n\r\nCurrently, RealClearPolitics shows Mrs. Clinton leading all candidates in New Hampshire, running more than 40 points ahead of Ms. Warren.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are the senators who have already endorsed Hillary Clinton (CNN)\r\n\r\nBy Dan Merica\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2015\r\n\r\nCNN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHillary Clinton has yet to declare her intentions to run for president, but the likelihood of a 2016 campaign is such a foregone conclusion that 27 out of 46 senators in the Democratic caucus have already endorsed her all-but-certain plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Brian Schatz added his name to the growing list on Monday when he tweeted his support for Clinton and sent out a press release to reporters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReady for Hillary, the pro-Clinton super PAC that has urged Clinton to run since 2013, has been the force behind seventeen of these endorsements. Senators like Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia and Dick Durbin of Illinois and have all endorsed the former secretary of state through the super PAC. The group is also currently working to line up more endorsements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been fortunate to have prominent Democrats lend their credibility, their star power and their grassroots networks to help build a list of millions of Hillary supporters,\xe2\x80\x9d group spokesman Seth Bringman said about the list of high-profile endorsements they have wrangled for Clinton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s more, every female Democratic senator in the last Congress backed Clinton in a secret letter. \xe2\x80\x9cAll of the Senate Democratic women have written her a letter encouraging her to run,\xe2\x80\x9d Sen. Kay Hagan, who lost reelection in 2014, told an audience in 2013.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fact, before Clinton has even declared her candidacy, nearly 60% of Democratic senators have endorsed her run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the list:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin - Signed a letter with all other female senators backing a Clinton run\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut- Told CNN at a 2014 University of Connecticut event that he \xe2\x80\x9cwould support her when and if she\xe2\x80\x9d runs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Barbara Boxer of California - Signed a letter with all other female senators backing a Clinton run\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen.

Dianne Feinstein of California - Signed a letter with all other female senators backing a Clinton run\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Al Franken of Minnesota - The senator told MSNBC this in December 2014: \xe2\x80\x9cI think that I\xe2\x80\x99m ready for Hillary. I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve not had someone this experienced, this tough, and she\xe2\x80\x99s very, very impressive.\xe2\x80\x9d Franken has also expressed support through Ready for Hillary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York - Signed a letter with all other female senators backing a Clinton run\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico- Headlined a July 2014 fundraiser organized by Ready for Hillary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota - Signed a letter with all other female senators backing a Clinton run\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii - Signed a letter with all other female senators backing a Clinton run\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Bill Nelson of Florida - Nelson reportedly called Clinton in December 2014 to urge her to run. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time for a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he told The Tampa Bay Times. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m all for Hillary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Tim Kaine of Virginia - Headlined a May 2014 fundraiser organized by Ready for Hillary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota - Signed a letter with all other female senators backing a Clinton run\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont - Told Vermont Public Radio this in June 2014: \xe2\x80\x9cI told her if she decided to run I would support her and would be willing to do whatever she likes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made no secret of that ever since then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia - He told Politico in January 2014 that he wants Clinton to run. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s anyone more qualified. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri - Signed a letter with all other female senators backing a Clinton run\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland - Signed a letter with all other female senators backing a Clinton run\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Patty Murray of Washington - Signed a letter with all other female senators backing a Clinton run\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii - Tweeted Monday morning that he was backing Clinton in 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Charles Schumer of New York - The outspoken senator has gone as far to say that he would bet on Clinton running in 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire - Signed a letter with all other female senators backing a Clinton run\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan - Signed a letter with all other female senators backing a Clinton run\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts - Signed a letter with all other female senators backing a Clinton run\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island- Told The Hill in January 2014 that he was backing Clinton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot all senators, however, are ready to endorse Clinton this early. Delaware Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons have both side-stepped questions about Hillary Clinton 2016, largely because of uncertainty around whether Vice President Joe Biden -- a Delaware native -- will run. Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey told CNN last year that it was too early to endorse and Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent senator who caucuses with Democrats, is actively pursuing a 2016 run himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the list of not yet and nos to Clinton 2016:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio - In a June interview, Brown said he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9con board with anybody\xe2\x80\x9d after being asked about Clinton 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Thomas Carper of Delaware - The senator told The Hill in 2014 that \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s entirely, entirely too early to be talking about anybody running for president.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania - At a 2014 event in Philadelphia, Casey told CNN that it was too early to talk about Clinton 2016. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Chris Coons of Delaware - \xe2\x80\x9cI think 2016 is a long way off, we have to get through 2014,\xe2\x80\x9d Coons told Politico in January 2014. \xe2\x80\x9cI have always supported Sen. Biden, Vice President Biden, and I think all of Delaware looks forward to a future in which he has great opportunities to serve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont - The independent senator is actively pursuing a presidential run in 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome senators have been unclear about their support of Clinton in 2016. The best example is Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReid sent a fundraising email through Ready for Hillary in 2014 and regularly speaks highly of the Clintons. But he has not directly said that he is support her possible run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the list of senators whose support is unclear:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Michael Bennet of Colorado - The Colorado Democrat sent an email through Ready for Hillary in 2014, but to date, has not made it clear that he would back her run in 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Cory Booker of New Jersey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Angus King of Maine - The Maine senator has not said outright that he isn\xe2\x80\x99t backing Clinton, but in a post-election interview with MSNBC, the independent senator who caucuses with Democrats said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think that is going to be a difficulty for someone like Hillary Clinton, who has tremendous experience and background, but she\xe2\x80\x99s going to have a hard time saying, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m a new person.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9c\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Gary Peters of Michigan - Clinton endorsed Peters in 2014 and although Peters hinted at Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s future, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t outright endorse her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever she does, she is going to be really great at it in the future,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at the event with Clinton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Harry Reid of Nevada\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Jon Tester of Montana - After losing the chamber in 2014, the Montana Democrat was named chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee through 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Tom Udall of New Mexico\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSen. Ron Wyden of Oregon\r\n\r\nYoung people will hit the polls in 2016, and they want Hillary (Fusion)\r\n\r\nBy Brett LoGiurato\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2015\r\n\r\nFusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung people are planning to turn out the vote in 2016. And they have a clear choice at this point about who they want to be the nation\xe2\x80\x99s next president.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose are some of the highlights from Fusion\xe2\x80\x99s Massive Millennial Poll, which surveyed 1000 people aged 18-34 about everything from politics to dating to race issues. The poll provides a barometer of millennials\xe2\x80\x99 priorities and preferred candidates ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor one thing, they say they\xe2\x80\x99re increasingly engaged ahead of the all-important election \xe2\x80\x94 but it\xe2\x80\x99s also clear they\xe2\x80\x99re not very well-informed. And they think government can help them, particularly in an area where they\xe2\x80\x99ve struggled to get ahead \xe2\x80\x94 in their jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung people are \xe2\x80\x98ready for Hillary\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight now, young people want former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to become the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first female president in 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClinton is the top choice among young Democrats and handily beats the GOP challenger who currently gets the highest percentage of the youth vote, 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, according to the survey. Romney last Friday said he would not run for the third time, putting Republicans in a fresh scramble to find a candidate who can compete with Clinton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung Democrats across all demographics pick Clinton to be the party\xe2\x80\x99s next nominee, according to the survey. More than half \xe2\x80\x94 57 percent \xe2\x80\x94 of the Democrats surveyed prefer Clinton, compared with 10 percent who choose Vice President Joe Biden and another 10 percent who want Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. At 19 percent, a large chunk are still undecided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut young Republicans preferred a third presidential run from Romney before he made it official to supporters last week that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t run. More young people identified with the Democratic Party, so the Republican sample is decidedly smaller. (Note: Results showing Romney ahead were also based on a smaller sample size than the results with the rest of the Republican field.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Romney out of the mix, former Florida Jeb Bush benefitted the most: He could be the frontrunner with Romney out of the way. In a Romney-less field, Bush leads the pack at 16 percent, jumping 4 percentage points from a field that included Romney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBush is trailed by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (14 percent), former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (12 percent), New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (8 percent) and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (8 percent).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore young people still lean toward Democrats when they\xe2\x80\x99re pressed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the survey, 49 percent say they are politically unaffiliated \xe2\x80\x94 including a majority (58 percent) of young Latino voters, half of young male voters, and half of the 25-29-aged voters in the sample.\r\n\r\nBut when the self-identified independents were pressed further, half of those surveyed at least leaned toward identifying with the Democratic Party. Thirty-five percent, meanwhile, leaned more toward the GOP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd if the election were held today, 48 percent would choose a generic Democratic candidate, compared with 35 percent who would pick the Republican nominee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJeb Bush does exceptionally well with young Latino voters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCould Republicans solve their Latino vote problem in 2016? The survey suggests they have a candidate who excites young Latino Republicans far more than the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat candidate is Bush, whose wife is Latina and who is generally viewed as more pro-immigration reform than any of the other potential Republican candidates at this point. Bush, along with Romney, did not appear at an Iowa summit last weekend hosted by noted immigration hawk Rep. Steve King.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the survey, 19 percent of Latino Republicans surveyed said they\xe2\x80\x99d vote for Bush in the GOP primary. That was 8 percentage points higher than the next-closest candidates \xe2\x80\x94 Christie and Paul. Christie, however, blew out the rest of the field among young, African-American Republicans. He got 24 percent of the vote there, 17 points ahead of the next closest challengers \xe2\x80\x94 Bush and Paul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome other areas where Bush is relatively strong: in the 18- to 24-year-old crowd (12 percent), with self-identified \xe2\x80\x9cconservative\xe2\x80\x9d young Republicans (15 percent), and with young Republicans who have at least some college education (12 percent). He leads the crowded Republican field in each of those categories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne question revealed how alarmingly uninformed young people are about politics\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you between the ages of 18-34? Can you name one \xe2\x80\x94 just one \xe2\x80\x94 of your home state\xe2\x80\x99s senators?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCongrats! You did better than more than three-fourths of people your age. That\xe2\x80\x99s right \xe2\x80\x94 77 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds in the new survey could not name even one US senator in their home state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe finding provides fodder for the suggestion that millennials are relatively uninformed political citizens. But Fusion\xe2\x80\x99s survey also revealed that more than nine in 10 of the 18- to 34-year-olds plan to vote in the 2016 presidential election, so there\xe2\x80\x99s some inclination they want to learn more. [[More on this breakdown below.]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome interesting findings in the demographic breakdowns: more men (25 percent) than women (20 percent) were able to correctly name at least one of their senators. However, they were also more likely to guess and take a 50-50 shot at getting it right \xe2\x80\x94 women were more likely than men to say they \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x9d rather than give an incorrect response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, certain demographic groups within the survey earned a particularly low grade. Just 18 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds, 16 percent of Latinos, and 10 percent of African-Americans could correctly identify one of their senators. However, whites were significantly more likely to guess than to say they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s the one issue millennials most want the next president to tackle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA majority of millennials want their next president to take decisive action to improve their economic situations. A plurality \xe2\x80\x94 19 percent \xe2\x80\x94 of respondents in the survey said they want the next president to address the economy and jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComing in next on the list of important issues is health care (10 percent), education (7 percent), budgets and deficits (6 percent), and immigration and border control (4 percent).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe economy and jobs were the No. 1 issue across every demographic measured in the poll, from sex, age, race, ideology, and education level. All but one demographic \xe2\x80\x94 young men \xe2\x80\x94 ended up with health care as the No. 2 issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe economy, while picking up steam as a whole in recent months, continues to pose challenges, especially for millennials. The unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds remains around 20 percent, and a Pew Research Center paper published last year found that millennials are driving a record increase in multi-generational home living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChanging of the guard? Young people think government is helpful\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere millennials differ from the rest of the American population, however, is in their view that, overall, government is generally good. Fifty-seven percent of those surveyed said government is \xe2\x80\x9chelpful,\xe2\x80\x9d compared with just 18 percent who called it \xe2\x80\x9charmful.\xe2\x80\x9d That suggests millennials want the next president to be more active in tackling their prioritized issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA 2014 Washington Post poll found that a plurality of registered voters viewed the government as more harmful than helpful. The difference was especially distinct in those who felt strongly about their position \xe2\x80\x94 27 percent strongly felt the government was harmful, compared with 11 percent who strongly felt it was helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung people are actually excited to vote in 2016! Will it last?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than three-quarters millennials say they are at least \xe2\x80\x9cvery likely\xe2\x80\x9d to vote in the 2016 presidential election, a level of enthusiasm that has the potential to dwarf previous turnouts from young people in past elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all, 77 percent 18 to 34-year-olds are \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely certain\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cvery likely\xe2\x80\x9d to vote in 2016, according to the survey. Another 14 percent said they will \xe2\x80\x9cpossibly\xe2\x80\x9d vote, bringing the total up to 91 percent. Just 8 percent say they are not likely to vote, while 1 percent is undecided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch an increase could represent a boon for whichever presidential candidate takes advantage. Multiple studies have shown that young voters propelled Obama to his two electoral victories, especially in 2012.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat year, according to the Pew Research Center, voters between the ages of 18-34 made up about 19 percent of the electorate, an increase from 18 percent in 2008.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut only about half of those eligible to vote in the age group went to the polls, according to a 2012 analysis from Center for Research and Information on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. That same analysis found that Obama won at least 61 percent of the youth vote in four key swing states \xe2\x80\x94 Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. The analysis concluded that if Romney had split the youth vote in those states, he could have won each of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general enthusiasm spreads across demographics. Overall, 88 percent of men aged 18-34 are likely to vote. Even more women \xe2\x80\x94 95 percent \xe2\x80\x94 are planning on heading to the voting booth in 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNinety-three percent of young white people and African-Americans say they are likely to vote, while 88 percent of young Latinos plan to turn out. And 89 percent of high-school graduates, 90 percent of attendees of at least some college, and 94 percent of college graduates are likely to vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy are some young people planning on sitting out? What would make them change their minds?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey have a few reasons, but the most popular they gave is that they \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t care about voting\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 16 percent of the young people who said they are unlikely to vote chose that option. Twelve percent of that group said they are \xe2\x80\x9ctoo busy,\xe2\x80\x9d 9 percent said \xe2\x80\x9cnothing ever changes\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmy vote doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count,\xe2\x80\x9d and 8 percent said they \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t trust the system,\xe2\x80\x9d rounding out the top-five reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat could change that? Millennials say they\xe2\x80\x99d be more likely to vote if they could do so online (49 percent) or via a cell phone (38 percent). Another 26 percent said a more racially diverse palate of candidates would motivate them to vote, while 24 percent said more young candidates on the menu would be an encouraging factor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrican-Americans, in particular, said they\xe2\x80\x99d be much more likely to vote if there were racially diverse candidates (24 percent, vs. 13 percent across the board), and if they could vote online (44 percent, vs. 32 percent across the board).\r\n\r\n\r\nHillary Clinton trounces GOP foes in latest poll. Why that\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal (Christian Science Monitor)\r\n\r\nBy Husna Haq\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2015\r\n\r\nChristian Science Monitor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA new poll shows Hillary Clinton ahead of potential Republican rivals in three critical swing states: Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Why that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean much at this point in the 2016 presidential race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA new Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday shows Hillary Clinton trouncing nearly every potential Republican challenger in the 2016 presidential election in three critical swing states: Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince 1960, no candidate has won the presidency without winning at least two of those three states, and for some, this is further proof of Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s early dominance in the 2016 race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoll: Hillary Clinton wipes out GOP contenders - except Kasich,\xe2\x80\x9d reads one headline. \xe2\x80\x9cPoll: Clinton sweeps GOP foes save Bush tie in Florida,\xe2\x80\x9d reads another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA lead in three key swing states is noteworthy. But Clinton shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get too comfortable. More on that soon. For now, here\xe2\x80\x99s a closer look at the numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Florida, Clinton just barely leads former Gov. Jeb Bush 44 percent to 43 percent, falling within the 3.2 percent margin of error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut she bests other potential GOP contenders in the Sunshine state by at least 10 points. In a hypothetical matchup, Clinton leads New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie by 18 points, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul by 12 points, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee by 17 points and Florida Sen. and \xe2\x80\x9cnative son\xe2\x80\x9d Marco Rubio by 10 points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Ohio, also, Clinton appears to lead other candidates despite matching Ohio Gov. John Kasich, 44 to 43 \xe2\x80\x93 well within the margin of error. Still, Clinton shows comfortable leads over Bush 47 to 36, Christie 47 to 34, Paul 48 to 36 and Huckabee 49 to 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the three states surveyed, Clinton finds the greatest support in Pennsylvania, according to the poll. Once again, she leads Bush 50 to 35, Paul 53 to 34, Huckabee 54 to 34 and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum 54 to 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile would-be Republican presidential candidates, even Native Son Rick Santorum, absorb less than stellar favorability numbers, Clinton has the closest thing to rock star ratings a politician can get in America today,\xe2\x80\x9d Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polls, said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cPennsylvania, which just elected a Democratic governor, is shaping up early in the campaign season as the bluest of the Swing States.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe may be a Washington rock star, but right now, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s lead isn\xe2\x80\x99t especially noteworthy. Here\xe2\x80\x99s why:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor starters, it\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99d expect at this point in the 2016 race. The GOP vote is divided between as many as a dozen potential candidates, and the Democratic vote is essentially unified on one star candidate. It\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise, then, that the presumptive nominee (who has not yet, by the way, actually declared her intentions), sweeps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this early on, it\xe2\x80\x99s about name recognition and as far as name recognition goes, Clinton has the advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, her lead isn\xe2\x80\x99t definitive everywhere \xe2\x80\x93 even this early on. As the poll points out, Clinton does, in fact, statistically tie two contenders in two swing states: Kasich of Ohio, and Bush, likely her most serious competitor. And the margins are narrowing in certain key states, Politico points out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Miami Herald also notes, \xe2\x80\x9cif you \xe2\x80\x98unskew\xe2\x80\x99 the Quinnipiac poll (blending the average turnout by party ID from the last two presidential elections) Bush goes from trailing Clinton by 1 point to leading her by about 3, 46-43 percent in Florida.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd if we haven\xe2\x80\x99t already said it enough times \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s still early in the race and a lot can happen between now and Nov. 2016. As Hot Air\xe2\x80\x99s Ed Morrissey recently wrote, at this time eight years ago, \xe2\x80\x9cObama[\xe2\x80\x98s] candidacy...looked like a bid to be Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s VP choice or a credibility-establishing effort for a later, more serious campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other words, now is not the time for Hillary Clinton to read the polling numbers and gloat.\r\n\r\nThe GOP Elite Puts Its Foot Down (Politico Magazine)\r\n\r\nBy Bill Schier\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2015\r\n\r\nPolitico Magazine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShots have been fired. The GOP herd is beginning to be culled. In less than a week, the establishment hounded Mitt Romney out, and the conservative movement wrote Sarah Palin out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe message from Republican insiders is clear: We cannot let our primary become another clown show.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the nascent Hillary Clinton campaign has signaled it wants to push back its planned entry from the spring to the summer. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have the luxury of time, you take it,\xe2\x80\x9d one Democratic insider told POLITICO. But these Republican moves indicate that she may not have that luxury. Here\xe2\x80\x99s why.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe already knew the Republican National Committee, led by Chairman Reince Priebus, was trying to exert some adult supervision over the primary process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPriebus and every other leading Republican strategist knows that recent GOP nominees have been weakened by a primary debate stage dominated by fringe characters\xe2\x80\x94along with front-runners doing too little to distinguish themselves from the extremes. The resulting spectacle presents a horrible image of the party to general-election voters, weighing down the eventual winner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPriebus\xe2\x80\x99 recent declaration that candidates will have to perform above a certain threshold in polls to warrant inclusion in debates, a threshold that will get stiffer later in the campaign, suggests he is aware that he needs to get as many fringe characters off the stage as possible. But he can\xe2\x80\x99t be confident that the poll respondents will oblige and elevate only mature candidates above the bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, if Republican insiders have the wherewithal to contain the support and attention given to their circus acts, then that could greatly aid Priebus\xe2\x80\x99 project. The twin falls of Romney and Palin last week are solid evidence that the party wants to shape up and jettison any distractions. That\xe2\x80\x99s a warning for Democrats to stop laughing at the prospect of another GOP clown show a la 2012 and start preparing to grapple with a more serious opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rejection of Romney 3.0 wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just because he\xe2\x80\x99d worn out his welcome. Clear-eyed Republicans knew they were going to have a hard enough time fighting a campaign on the Democratic turf of economic inequality; the last thing they needed was to have the face of Republican callousness toward the \xe2\x80\x9c47 percent\xe2\x80\x9d inject his reputation for inauthenticity into the cause of reducing the income gap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the dispatching of one damaged establishment candidate is a simpler matter than the more corrosive problem of a field top-heavy with frightening Tea Party candidates. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the conservative buzz coming out of Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s Freedom Summit, a presidential cattle call organized by anti-immigrant zealot Rep. Steve King, was potentially more consequential than Romney\xe2\x80\x99s fold.\r\n\r\nNot only did conservative opinion leaders widely pan Palin\xe2\x80\x99s ramblings, extinguishing whatever fire she may have had for a run, but they also saved the bulk of their praise for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker\xe2\x80\x94a governor with a record, not a grenade-throwing pundit or a grandstanding senator. Even Rush Limbaugh was effusive: \xe2\x80\x9cScott Walker wowed them in Iowa. \xe2\x80\xa6 Scott Walker has shown the Republican Party how to beat the left. Scott Walker has the blueprint for winning and winning consistently and winning big in a blue state with conservative principles that are offered with absolutely no excuses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConservative die-hards may not agree with the establishment Republicans who believe the party needs some ideological recalibration on issues like immigration. But they do seem to be getting on board with the notion that Republicans need to elevate serious presidential timber over the silly self-promoters, no matter how good they are at stirring the pot and making liberal heads explode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, it\xe2\x80\x99s an open question whether conservative opinion leaders are able to lead conservative voters. Typically in Republican contests, \xe2\x80\x9cbase\xe2\x80\x9d voters remain enamored with ideological perfection and splinter among several implausible candidates, allowing an establishment favorite to win early primaries with mere pluralities. Attempts by conservative activists to \xe2\x80\x9cStop McCain\xe2\x80\x9d in 2008 and \xe2\x80\x9cStop Romney\xe2\x80\x9d in 2012 were busts, failing to coalesce around a single alternative. But if 2016 is different, if the conservative rank and file is fed up enough with losing, and can be persuaded by their leaders to rally around a qualified, substantive candidate, they could dictate the outcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTake the latest Fox News poll. Without Romney, Jeb Bush leads the pack, but with a middling 15 percent. Right behind him are Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee with 13 percent each, followed by Ben Carson with 10 percent. Few believe any of those last three\xe2\x80\x94with enough controversial comments to fill warehouses of opposition research\xe2\x80\x94would have a prayer against Hillary Clinton. Yet combined they hold 36 percent of the Republican vote. Meanwhile, Walker is knocking on the door of the top tier with 9 percent. If the conservative elite put their collective weight behind Walker, he could scoop up much of that Tea Party vote and zoom past Bush.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kissinger primary (Politico)\r\nBy Michael Crowley\r\nFebruary 4, 2015\r\nPolitico\r\n\r\n\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re a Republican thinking of running for president. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dangerous world, and your foreign policy credentials are a little thin.\r\n\r\nTime to see Henry Kissinger.\r\n\r\nScott Walker did it. So did Marco Rubio and Chris Christie. Rick Perry paid a visit in September \xe2\x80\x94 he even tweeted a photo to prove it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was an honor to speak with Dr. Kissinger today and hear his thoughts on America\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy challenges,\xe2\x80\x9d tweeted the then-Texas governor.\r\n\r\nRubio has \xe2\x80\x9cmet with Kissinger a couple of times in the past, and always appreciates his insights,\xe2\x80\x9d says a spokesman for the Florida senator, adding that Rubio has been reading Kissinger\xe2\x80\x99s latest book, \xe2\x80\x9cWorld Order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt 91 years old, the former secretary of state, national security adviser and intellectual-cum-celebrity has come to occupy a unique place in the foreign policy firmament. Though some historians blame him for countless deaths in places like Vietnam, Cambodia and Bangladesh, Kissinger is more revered than ever in Washington. He has become a Yoda-like figure, bestowing credibility and a statesman\xe2\x80\x99s aura to politicians of both parties, including ones who may not actually share his worldview.\r\n\r\nThey may want more than a message: A Kissinger endorsement could be a major boost in a crowded GOP field. Though he often sits out primary contests, Kissinger backed John McCain in December 2007 when the Arizona Republican was still fending off other challengers. (He even granted a much-needed private audience to McCain\xe2\x80\x99s running mate, Sarah Palin, the next year.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople treat him as an oracle,\xe2\x80\x9d says James Mann, a resident fellow at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and author of several books on foreign policy. \xe2\x80\x9cCandidates running for president like to be seen with or described as having talked to Kissinger, because they think it sends a message that they themselves are serious about foreign policy \xe2\x80\x94 when in fact they may not even know much about what Henry Kissinger believes or what he has done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKissinger\xe2\x80\x99s many admirers call him brilliant, with an unmatched grasp of history. They revere him for diplomatic feats like masterminding Richard Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s history-altering 1972 opening to China.\r\n\r\nBut the GOP\xe2\x80\x99s Kissinger crush is also surprising in some ways. The man who largely guided American foreign policy for a decade under Nixon and then Gerald Ford is a longtime proponent of the \xe2\x80\x9crealist\xe2\x80\x9d school of foreign policy. Realists prioritize order and stability above human rights, democracy and other internal affairs in foreign countries. Many of Kissinger\xe2\x80\x99s GOP admirers, including McCain, champion democracy promotion and military action to prevent atrocities.\r\n\r\nAnd Kissinger disciples like Walker, Rubio and Perry may not share their tutor\xe2\x80\x99s support for diplomacy with Iran and engagement with China, nor his caution against \xe2\x80\x9cposturing\xe2\x80\x9d against Russian President Vladimir Putin.\r\n\r\nEven more surprising, however, is Kissinger\xe2\x80\x99s embrace by Democrats, including providing private counsel to Barack Obama. A batch of White House visitor records released on Jan. 31 show that Kissinger visited the president in the Oval Office on Oct. 22. Unlike the Republicans who brag about their proximity to Kissinger, the White House did not publicize this meeting and would not characterize its substance. Kissinger\xe2\x80\x99s office did not comment for this story.\r\n\r\nBut other Democrats haven\xe2\x80\x99t been shy about their admiration for a man who was long reviled by the left, who regularly counseled George W. Bush and Dick Cheney during the 2000s, who endorsed John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012 \xe2\x80\x94 and whom credible historians say has not been held accountable for reprehensible actions during his Nixon administration tenure.\r\n\r\nDuring his confirmation hearing to be secretary of state, John Kerry cited Kissinger\xe2\x80\x99s book \xe2\x80\x9cDiplomacy\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9csuperb\xe2\x80\x9d guide to the modern world and met with him privately as the Obama administration built its later-aborted case for bombing Syria in September 2013. Last fall, Hillary Clinton wrote a glowing Washington Post review of Kissinger\xe2\x80\x99s late-2014 tome, \xe2\x80\x9cWorld Order,\xe2\x80\x9d which she called \xe2\x80\x9cvintage Kissinger, with his singular combination of breadth and acuity along with his knack for connecting headlines to trend lines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMost unlikely of all, perhaps, is the kinship between Obama\xe2\x80\x99s close adviser and United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power, with the Cold War-era diplomat five decades her elder. Last April ESPN tagged along with Power, a die-hard Red Sox fan, and Kissinger, a Yankees lover, for a trip to the ballpark in which the two likened their sports rivalry to their divergent worldviews. The two hold nearly polar opposite views of the role human rights should play in foreign policy, making Power what some call an idealist to Kissinger\xe2\x80\x99s realist. At Yankee Stadium, those differences were papered over with banter: \xe2\x80\x9cWait until Samantha says \xe2\x80\x98realpolitik,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Kissinger joked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt means: He\xe2\x80\x99s a German and watch out for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the partnership between Kissinger and Obama officials can be serious business. Still connected around the globe by dint of his reputation and business activities as the founder of Kissinger Associates, a lucrative Manhattan-based international consulting firm, Kissinger is a constant traveler and source of valuable information from abroad.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Kissinger has been an important \xe2\x80\x94 if informal \xe2\x80\x94 conduit of information about Putin. The former U.S. diplomat is among a small handful of Americans granted audiences with the Russian leader. Kissinger has reported back to Washington on his contacts, including at least once directly to Obama\xe2\x80\x99s national security adviser, according to Michael McFaul, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Moscow until last year.\r\n\r\nBefore his occasional meetings with Putin, Kissinger would first visit McFaul in Spaso house, the U.S. ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s residence in Moscow, where photos of Kissinger visiting the same building in the early 1970s adorn the walls. He would \xe2\x80\x9cfind out what the pulse of the [current U.S.] policy was\xe2\x80\x9d before seeing the Russian leader. Then, after seeing Putin, Kissinger would report on his contact back to officials in Washington.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was totally amazed at Henry\xe2\x80\x99s vigor, both intellectually and politically,\xe2\x80\x9d McFaul added.\r\n\r\nHe has sometimes undertaken more specific assignments, as when, in August 2011 Hillary Clinton turned to Kissinger amid an international crisis following a bloody Israeli assault on a Gaza-bound Turkish aid flotilla. Clinton enlisted Kissinger to urge Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to apologize to Turkey in the name of preserving an important regional relationship. (The account, described in Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s memoir \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices,\xe2\x80\x9d does not say how the message was received, but Netanyahu did not apologize until much later.)\r\n\r\nThe cross-partisan relationship between Clinton and Kissinger is particularly notable. Soon after Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s review of his book appeared, Kissinger told USA Today that Clinton \xe2\x80\x9cran the State Department in the most effective way that I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen.\xe2\x80\x9d He soon followed up by telling NPR that Clinton would be \xe2\x80\x9ca good president,\xe2\x80\x9d adding that he planned to vote Republican.\r\n\r\nForeign policy analysts say the friendliness illustrates the extent to which Obama, for all the idealism he once represented, has pursued a cold-eyed policy of realism in the classic Kissinger style \xe2\x80\x94 for instance, through his unwillingness to intervene more aggressively to prevent atrocities in Syria\xe2\x80\x99s civil war.\r\n\r\nModern foreign policy debates are less about partisanship and more \xe2\x80\x9cbetween people who focus primarily on states and people who focus on people,\xe2\x80\x9d says Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former top official in Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s State Department who now heads the New America Foundation. \xe2\x80\x9cHe sees the world as a chessboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome historians are harsher, questioning whether Kissinger should be accepted in polite company at all, citing actions and statements he made in the Nixon and Ford administrations that stretched the concept of realism to cruel callousness. In 1975, for instance, Kissinger said that the U.S. \xe2\x80\x9cwill be friends with\xe2\x80\x9d the Cambodian Khmer Rouge, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cThey are murderous thugs, but we won\xe2\x80\x99t let that stand in our way.\xe2\x80\x9d A Nixon Oval Office tape from 1973 recorded him expressing little sympathy for Jews trying to flee oppression in the former Soviet Union. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they put Jews into gas chambers in the Soviet Union, it is not an American concern. Maybe a humanitarian concern,\xe2\x80\x9d Kissinger said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople in Washington have a remarkable ability not to ask questions about what their guest of honor actually did in Cambodia or Bangladesh,\xe2\x80\x9d says Gary J. Bass, a Princeton professor of politics and international affairs and author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Blood Telegram,\xe2\x80\x9d which is harshly critical of Kissinger for allowing thousands of preventable deaths during the 1971 creation of Bangladesh.\r\n\r\nDuring his Jan. 28 testimony before McCain\xe2\x80\x99s committee, Kissinger was partly encircled by a group of protesters with the anti-war group Code Pink, who held a banner and chanted slogans calling for his arrest as a \xe2\x80\x9cwar criminal.\xe2\x80\x9d An outraged McCain threatened to have them arrested, calling one protester \xe2\x80\x9clow-life scum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRepublicans like McCain are totally unmoved by the charges against Kissinger, and recent GOP candidates have welcomed his support. Romney was grateful for Kissinger\xe2\x80\x99s backing in 2012, though \xe2\x80\x94 like so many others \xe2\x80\x94 couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist an impersonation of his German-born advocate\xe2\x80\x99s distinctive accent. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw Dr. Kissinger\xe2\x80\x9d in New York, Romney said at a surreptitiously recorded 2012 fundraiser. \xe2\x80\x9cI said to him, \xe2\x80\x98How are we perceived around the world?\xe2\x80\x99 And he said one word: \xe2\x80\x98Veak!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the 2016 campaign kicks off, a competition is already underway to gain Kissinger\xe2\x80\x99s favor. One early favorite could be Chris Christie. As the former New Jersey governor later told The Washington Post\xe2\x80\x99s Dan Balz for his book \xe2\x80\x9cCollision 2012,\xe2\x80\x9d Kissinger summoned him to his midtown Manhattan office in mid-2011 and urged him to run for president, saying he had a rare connection with voters. When Christie replied that he knew little about world affairs, his host told him not to worry. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can work with you on that. Foreign policy is instinct, it\xe2\x80\x99s character,\xe2\x80\x9d Christie recalled Kissinger saying.\r\n\r\nBut Kissinger \xe2\x80\x94 whom Bob Woodward once described as having \xe2\x80\x9ca powerful, largely invisible influence\xe2\x80\x9d over George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy \xe2\x80\x94 is also friendly with Bush\xe2\x80\x99s brother Jeb. Last spring Kissinger told the Post that he would be \xe2\x80\x9cdelighted\xe2\x80\x9d to see Jeb Bush run, calling the former Florida governor \xe2\x80\x9cexperienced, moderate and thoughtful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSince Bush began signaling his intention to run for president in 2016 this winter, the two have not yet had a publicized meeting. If recent history is any guide, that tweet should be coming soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nHillary Clinton more favorable to Florida voters than Jeb Bush (NY Daily News)\r\n\r\nBy Leslie Larson\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2015\r\n\r\nNY Daily News\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Florida, Florida, Florida voters are leaning toward Hillary, Hillary, Hillary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHillary Clinton was ranked more favorable (53%) to prospective Florida voters than the state\xe2\x80\x99s former Governor, Republican Jeb Bush (46%) and the state\xe2\x80\x99s current Republican Senator Marco Rubio (36%), according to a new Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s their home turf, Bush faces a name-recognition issue with 13% of Floridians saying they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard of Bush and 27% saying they don\xe2\x80\x99t know Rubio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf respondents in Florida, only 6% haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard of Clinton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClinton faces stiffer competition against Bush when it comes to the ballot box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen asked \xe2\x80\x9cif the election for President were being held today, and the candidates were Hillary Clinton the Democrat and Jeb Bush the Republican, for whom would you vote?\xe2\x80\x9d respondents put Clinton (44%) and Bush (43%) on a level playing field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a Clinton/Rubio matchup scenario, Clinton would win 49% of the vote and Rubio 39%, according to the poll.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBush hasn\xe2\x80\x99t fully declared his candidacy for President but is in the process of \xe2\x80\x9cexploring\xe2\x80\x9d a run. He is traveling the country headlining a series of fundraisers for his Leadership and Super PACs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClinton says she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made up her mind but will likely announce her decision in the Spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRubio has reportedly told his top aides to prepare for a presidential campaign but has not formally declared his candidacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBush, Clinton tied right now in Florida (Tallahassee Democrat)\r\nBy Jim Saunders\r\nFebruary 3, 2015\r\nTallahassee Democrat\r\n\r\nBush v. Clinton could be a barnburner in Florida.\r\n\r\nA Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday shows former Gov. Jeb Bush and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a virtual tie in a hypothetical 2016 presidential race in Florida. The poll gave 44 percent to Clinton and 43 percent to Bush.\r\n\r\nWhile presidential primaries and caucuses are still a year away --- and the fields of candidates are loaded with speculation --- the poll indicates Bush would be the toughest opponent for Clinton in the critical swing state of Florida.\r\n\r\nThat might not be surprising, as Bush was a popular two-term Republican governor. But the poll also shows the Democrat Clinton leading another native son, Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, by a margin of 49 percent to 39 percent in Florida.\r\n\r\nQuinnipiac polled voters in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, which are all pivotal states in presidential races. Clinton easily topped potential Republican candidates in each of the states, with the exception of Bush in Florida and Ohio Gov. John Kasich in Kasich\xe2\x80\x99s home state.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a reason why Hillary Clinton has followed a slower, less aggressive schedule when it comes to ramping up her expected presidential campaign than have virtually all of her potential White House opponents,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a prepared statement accompanying the results. \xe2\x80\x9cShe holds double-digit leads over all her potential GOP opponents in the three biggest swing states, except for two native sons, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. And she is under little pressure from within her own party to hit the campaign trail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA Bush-Clinton race in Florida would draw tens of millions of dollars, countless stories about political dynasties and memories of the 2000 Bush v. Gore presidential recount. That recount, of course, pitted George W. Bush, the brother of Jeb Bush, and Al Gore, the vice president under former President Bill Clinton.\r\n\r\nBut if Jeb Bush is derailed from getting the Republican nomination next year, the poll indicates other GOP candidates could have a difficult time beating Hillary Clinton in Florida. Along with the sizable margin in a hypothetical race against Rubio, Clinton also led by double digits in match-ups against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut-based Quinnipiac, which frequently conducts polls in Florida and other states, surveyed 936 Florida voters from Jan. 22 to Feb. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nRepublican presidential race is wide open, but Kasich is a big factor in Ohio, poll shows (Cleveland Plain Dealer)\r\nBy Stephen Koff\r\nFebruary 4, 2015\r\nCleveland Plain Dealer\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -Seventeen months before Republicans convene in Cleveland, the path to the GOP presidential nomination is equally cluttered and wide open, with no single candidate holding a clear advantage, according to a new poll this morning of three crucial swing states including Ohio.\r\n\r\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush holds an advantage in only one of the states, namely, Florida.\r\n\r\nOhio second-term Gov. John Kasich, on the other hand, could be considered the front-runner in the Buckeye state  right now, although while he has teased about a candidacy, he has not jumped in.  And his position in a fanciful primary race, carrying 14 percent of Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s Republicans, would only be three percentage points ahead of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, and four points ahead of both Bush and Kentucky U.S. Sen. Rand Paul. Statistically, that would make Ohio a tie.\r\n\r\nBeating them all: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeantime in Pennsylvania, Bush would lead with 12 percent but the neighboring governor from New Jersey, Chris Christie, would be only one point behind - a statistical tie - and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee would come close, with 10 percentage points.\r\n\r\nNo candidate has won the presidential race without taking at least two of these three states, note the pollsters, from Quinnipiac University in Connecticut.\r\n\r\nThis level of competitiveness does not exist on the Democratic side. Asked about potential party nominees, 51 percent of Ohio Democrats picked former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Sixty-one percent of Florida Democrats picked her, as did 54 percent of Pennsylvania Democrats.\r\n\r\nU.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren came in second in Ohio, at 14 percent - double the percentage of votes that Vice President Joe Biden would get on a Democratic ballot in the state.\r\n\r\nYet these second-position opinions may be squishy as Play-Doh at this point. When the Democratic question was asked differently -- \xe2\x80\x9cWho is your second choice?\xe2\x80\x9d -- Biden shot up to the top in all three swing states.\r\n\r\nQuinnipiac political polls are widely followed, but this particular survey comes with a caveat: The man who had led the GOP field in Ohio and Pennsylvania, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, announced near the end of the survey period that he would not run. The poll was conducted from Jan. 22 to Feb. 1, and Romney made his announcement Jan. 30.  Quinnipiac pollsters recalculated the matchup, factoring in the second-choice picks of survey respondents who had said Romney was their first choice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal from the presidential race, at first blush, has no statistical benefit in Florida, Ohio or Pennsylvania for any candidate for the Republican presidential nomination,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac Poll, said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the beginning of this survey, we asked Romney supporters who they would vote for if the 2012 standard-bearer bowed out, so we are able to measure the results of that decision. Looking at the final tally, his supporters moved evenly to a variety of the remaining candidates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInitially, Romney was picked by 15 percent of Ohio respondents identifying themselves as Republicans. Had Romney remained, Kasich would have been Ohio Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 second choice for president, at 11 percent. But indicative of the competitive nature of the primary at this point, when most candidates are still feeling out their viability, the \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x9d category still led in Ohio, at 18 percent.\r\n\r\nIn fact, of the three states, only Republican voters in Florida showed overwhelming support for a potential nominee - namely, Bush, their former governor. Bush got 30 percent of the vote in the initial poll, recalculated to 32 percent with Romney\xe2\x80\x99s exit.\r\n\r\nQuinnipiac surveyed 943 Ohioans, including 337 Republicans and 315 Democrats. The sample size factored into the margins of error: 5.3 percentage points for Republicans and 5.5 for Democrats.\r\n\r\nIn a survey of a potential general-election matchup, released Tuesday, Quinnipiac said that Clinton would have a double-digit lead among Ohio voters over most Republican challengers - but not over Kasich. If he were in the race, Ohio would show a dead Kasich-Clinton heat.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of primaries and caucuses starting early next year, Republicans will finalize their pick and formally nominate a candidate during their convention in Cleveland July 18-21. Democrats will quickly follow but have not yet selected a city for their convention.\r\n\r\n\r\nHillary\xe2\x80\x99s 140-Character Campaign Strategy (Time)\r\n\r\nBy Ryan Teague Beckwith\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2015\r\n\r\nTime Magazine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s pioneered a new way to use Twitter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHillary Clinton isn\xe2\x80\x99t officially running for president and she isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly campaigning yet either.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince last year\xe2\x80\x99s book tour, her public appearances have been limited to speeches, both paid and unpaid, and even campaign events where she isn\xe2\x80\x99t appearing are tightly controlled. That creates a supply-and-demand problem, though, when news breaks and the public wants to know where she stands on an issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter Twitter. Though Clinton didn\xe2\x80\x99t join the social media platform until mid-2013, she\xe2\x80\x99s pioneered a new way of using it to flesh out her campaign platform 140 characters at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great political strategy for her, though it leaves a bit to be desired among the public and the press. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s tweets come late in the news cycle, allowing her to score a quick point off Republican in-fighting after much of the debate has played out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re also tightly scripted, which means there\xe2\x80\x99s no problem of going off-message or losing control of the story, like she did during what should have been a softball interview with NPR that touched on her changing views on gay marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 140-character limit on Twitter also means that Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s pronouncements aren\xe2\x80\x99t as substantive as they often seem at first. Without reporters asking follow-up questions, Clinton can make a rather general statement about, say, being in favor of vaccination, without explaining her past doubts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr she can criticize an attempt to roll back the Dodd-Frank bank reforms without specifying exactly which changes to the law she would support or oppose.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York Suburb Seeks to Host Hillary Clinton 2016 Campaign (Time)\r\nBy Sam Frizell\r\nFebruary 3, 2015\r\nTime Magazine\r\n\r\nLocal luminaries in a suburb of New York City are calling on Hillary Clinton to place her campaign headquarters in White Plains\xe2\x80\x94a small city close to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s home in Westchester County\xe2\x80\x94despite the draw of the nearby metropolis.\r\n\r\nAt least one Congresswoman and a major real-estate developer are lobbying Clinton to place her headquarters in Westchester if she runs for president, aiming for the prestige and economic benefits of a large operation. \xe2\x80\x9cA Clinton campaign would be good for Westchester, and a Clinton Presidency would be great for America,\xe2\x80\x9d said Congresswoman Nita Lowey, the Democratic representative for much of the county. Lowey has encouraged Clinton directly to place her headquarters in the county if she runs.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour from Manhattan by train, prosaic White Plains is as functional a campaign headquarters as a pair of Crocs and about as chic. A suburb with plentiful office parks, PepsiCo\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters and 50,000 residents, the Democratic-leaning New York satellite is also squarely in Hillary heartland. The Clintons have had a home in Chappaqua, a hamlet 15 minutes away, since 1999, and White Plains is within striking distance of the presumptive candidate\xe2\x80\x99s power base in New York City. Clinton aides hinted last year White Plains is a strong option for a possible headquarters.\r\n\r\nBut recent lobbying efforts by businesses and local politicians may not be enough to keep Clinton close to home, as the presumptive 2016 candidate reportedly weighs a New York City campaign headquarters. New York is home to a large cadre of Clinton allies and devoted young Democrats that could make up her staff.\r\n\r\nWhere a candidate decides to locate their headquarters can have an outsized influence on the tenor of a campaign. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s decision in 2007 to base his campaign headquarters in Chicago made him a more credible Beltway outsider and may have kept his campaign grounded by keeping it far from the New York and D.C. media bubbles. Clinton and John McCain, on the other hand, both had headquarters in the D.C. suburbs during the 2008 campaign.\r\n\r\nRobert Weisz, the CEO of the largest privately-held property owner in Westchester, said he has reached out to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s staff, aiming to lease his properties to potential campaign. A Democrat and past Clinton donor, Weisz owns 2.5 million square feet of real estate in the county and plenty of contiguous office space large enough to host a presidential campaign.\r\n\r\nDuring Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 bid for president, Weisz hosted an 800-person Clinton event on his property on 1133 Westchester Avenue, a commercial space in White Plains. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s among the local real estate firms that are keen on bringing a Clinton campaign to the New York suburb. \xe2\x80\x9cWe reached out to her staff for several reasons: one to rent space, and one to be helpful to her possible campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d Weisz said.\r\n\r\nWestchester County Executive Rob Astorino, the Republican nominee in New York\xe2\x80\x99s gubernatorial election last year, said he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t reached out to Clinton directly to ask her to move her headquarters to the county, but that he likely will. \xe2\x80\x9cI would love for her to set up shop here,\xe2\x80\x9d Astorino said.\r\n\r\nWhite Plains has the advantage of relatively cheap office space, compared to New York City. The current average annual rent price per square foot of office space in White Plains is around $25, compared with around $60 in Manhattan and $30-$35 in Brooklyn, according to a 2013 report. That can add up. President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 headquarters occupied 50,000 square feet in Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Prudential building, where rents averaged $22-$25 per square foot annually.\r\n\r\nA White Plains headquarters could also attract a more dedicated staff that is willing to regularly commute or live at a distance from the city.\r\n\r\nIt remains unclear whether local excitement and cheap rent is enough to keep Clinton away from New York City, which has all the pomp, panache and power brokers that White Plains lacks.\r\n\r\nThe Big Apple\xe2\x80\x99s mayor, Bill de Blasio, ran her first senatorial campaign, and Clinton has connections in Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s financial industry. According to reports, potential bivouacs for a 2016 campaign include Brooklyn or Queens, where the former Secretary of State would be close to a large base of young Democrats who would form the spine of her campaign staff.\r\n\r\nA spokesperson for Clinton didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to a request for comment.\r\n\r\nIf the Clinton campaign decides to decamp from Westchester and heads to New York\xe2\x80\x99s outer boroughs, she would likely be courted by a wide array of friendly real estate developers interested in leasing her space.\r\n\r\nBruce Ratner, a prominent Democrat and real estate developer, has extensive Brooklyn properties including the Barclay\xe2\x80\x99s Center, a potential site for the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Stephen L. Green, who is one of New York\xe2\x80\x99s largest office landlords, was a member the so-called Hillraisers, an elite coterie of donors that bundled over $100,000 each for Clinton during her 2008 run.\r\n\r\nLast August, Clinton signed a two-year lease for a personal office in a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper owned by Green. Green\xe2\x80\x99s firm also owns office space in downtown Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nWhite Plains notables also argue that accessibility to Westchester County Airport\xe2\x80\x94mere minutes from the suburb\xe2\x80\x94 make the New York satellite a better option than the city.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhite Plains would be a terrific location for her campaign headquarters,\xe2\x80\x9d White Plains Mayor Tom Roach said. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, we would love to have her headquarters here if she decides to run.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nCan Brooklyn cool rub off on Hillary Clinton? (Hill)\r\nBy Amie Parnes\r\nFebruary 4, 2015\r\nThe Hill\r\n\r\nBrooklyn is casting a wary eye at the latest hipster who might be moving in: Hillary Clinton.\r\n\r\nThe news that Clinton is considering running her expected 2016 presidential campaign from New York City\xe2\x80\x99s most populous borough is being greeted in Gotham with surprise and snark.\r\n\r\nIt \xe2\x80\x9cjust goes to show you that Brooklyn is now whiter than ever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Livia Scott, a sketch comedian at the popular Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre who lives in New York and has seen the borough\xe2\x80\x99s gentrification over the years. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, welcome, Hillary!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWhile Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign machine might seem an odd match for the East Coast Portlandians who ride fixed-gear bicycles and pride themselves on their ironic facial hair, the idea has been gaining traction in recent weeks. Allies say Clinton had all but ruled out putting her headquarters in the Westchester County suburbs of White Plains near her Chappaqua, N.Y., home, as The Hill first reported on Monday.\r\n\r\nThe Daily News on Tuesday reported that Clinton aides have already scoped out office space in Brooklyn Heights, just across the river from Manhattan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she already has the hipster black-rimmed glasses,\xe2\x80\x9d one Clinton ally said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow she just needs some plaid and a carefree attitude and maybe an education of Mumford and Sons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother Democratic consultant said the idea of putting Clinton headquarters in the borough is \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely understandable,\xe2\x80\x9d but questioned whether it would send the right message.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe people who think it\xe2\x80\x99s a great idea are the same people who think \xe2\x80\x98Girls\xe2\x80\x99 is good,\xe2\x80\x9d the consultant said about the HBO series centered on an aspiring writer and her friends in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nThe Twitterverse reacted to the headquarters plan by labeling Clinton \xe2\x80\x9cHipster Hillary,\xe2\x80\x9d with some calling the plan \xe2\x80\x9cedgy.\xe2\x80\x9d The Daily News reported that \xe2\x80\x9cBrooklyn may be the new Westchester\xe2\x80\x9d for Clinton, while Brooklyn Magazine hailed the borough as \xe2\x80\x9cthe new Democratic Party mecca\xe2\x80\x9d because the party\xe2\x80\x99s nominating convention might be held there in the summer of 2016.\r\n\r\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat who was born in Brooklyn and represents parts of the borough, encouraged the move, saying there are plenty of reasons to set up shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a place of vibrancy and great ethnic diversity,\xe2\x80\x9d Nadler said in an interview. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s symbolic of the vibrancy of the country. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons the convention ought to be held there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe congressman \xe2\x80\x94 who said he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think of himself as a hipster \xe2\x80\x94 said he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lobbied Clinton to put her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn but would do so if asked.\r\n\r\nIf Clinton were to land across the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan, it would be a vastly different locale from 2008, when her campaign for the White House was based out of the former Immigration and Naturalization Services building in Arlington, Va., a suburb of Washington.\r\n\r\nNadler stopped short of contrasting the two spots but said, \xe2\x80\x9cI presume she\xe2\x80\x99s learned a lot about running a presidential campaign. ... Maybe part of that is to pick a better location.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nObservers say it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that Clinton and her allies want to replicate the cool factor generated by Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Windy City operation in 2008, which attracted an army of young volunteers who gave the campaign an edge.\r\n\r\nReid Cherlin, a former Obama spokesman turned writer who left the Beltway for the artisanal goods capital of New York, said the would-be campaign \xe2\x80\x9chas the right idea being away from D.C., but Brooklyn might not be the best spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless they were to be deep into what you might call \xe2\x80\x98real Brooklyn,\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99re just going to be a few subway stops from the center of the media universe,\xe2\x80\x9d Cherlin said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s still better than D.C, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that it gets you the fresh air, as it were, that you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI live in Brooklyn, and I love Brooklyn,\xe2\x80\x9d Cherlin added. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s no knock on the borough. But putting the headquarters here also would read as a message move, trying to be cool or whatever, in the way that many brands are now doing. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t see a real benefit to that for them. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually think they do, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCherlin suggested that the borough of Queens might be a better match for the campaign, saying it has \xe2\x80\x9cmore real people\xe2\x80\x9d and is \xe2\x80\x9cclose to the power centers but psychologically less so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nScott, on the other hand, called a Brooklyn-based campaign a \xe2\x80\x9cno-brainer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a wise move for the people who are advising her,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all about what\xe2\x80\x99s cool. If she\xe2\x80\x99s going to win, she\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to get the cool vote. It\xe2\x80\x99s not about capturing the young vote but capturing the cool-geist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill, she deadpanned: \xe2\x80\x9cThe people who are most cool have probably moved to Philadelphia by now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'
