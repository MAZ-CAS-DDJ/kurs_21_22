Also, had a really good meeting with Steve Daetz yesterday. He's smart.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nHeather Boushey\nhboushey@equitablegrowth.org<mailto:hboushey@equitablegrowth.org>\nTwitter: @hboushey\n\nOn Nov 18, 2014, at 5:40 AM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>> wrote:\n\nSorry for the delay.

One idea that we've had is to work towards some type of candidate forum where we get at policies where we frame the questions to get at how equitable growth could work in practice.\n\nI wanted to check in with you and hear your reaction and brainstorm a bit, if you have time. Good/bad idea in general? Do you think it would be possible to do in a c3 way - I.e., with both D and R candidates - where the candidates would actually want to engage?\n\nSteve Daetz is stopping by Monday for lunch at the office (in our new space on the first floor!) and I don't want to bring this up unless you and I have had a chance to talk beforehand.\n\nThanks!\nHeather\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nHeather Boushey\nExecutive Director and Chief Economist\nWashington Center for Equitable Growth\n1333 H Street, NW, 2nd Floor\nWashington, DC 20005\n\nhboushey@equitablegrowth.org<mailto:hboushey@equitablegrowth.org>\nwww.Equitablegrowth.org<http://www.Equitablegrowth.org>\nDesk: (202) 741-6247\nTwitter: @hboushey\n"
