We cannot back down ... the stakes are too high, for us, for Pennsylvania, for America.\n\nIf ever there was a time to make a contribution, I would ask you to make it be this time. Please contribute $25, $50, $100, $250, $500 -- or whatever you are able to afford -- before our $2 for $1 matching program expires midnight tomorrow, 31 December ... before it's too late. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=edec30link1 \n\nIt is going to be an amazing, exhilarating 20 weeks to the election.\xa0 We're primed, and ready to go.\xa0 \n\nPlease join our historic campaign by making one last contribution before the end of the year, in helping us reach our goal.\n\n\nWarmly, \nJoe Sestak\n\n\n\nContribute: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=edec30link2\n\nVolunteer: http://JoeSestak.com/volunteer\n\nUnsubscribe: http://JoeSestak.com/unsubscribe \n\nContributions are not tax deductible.\n\nSestak for Senate\nPO Box 1936 Media, PA 19063\n\n(610) 891-8956\n\nPaid for by Sestak For Senate"
