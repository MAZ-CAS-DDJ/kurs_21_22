So I'm still struggling with that as such a central idea. \n\nBut as Jen said, we should get to her and proceed with Jen's plan to have Dan have pen. \n\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Jun 4, 2015, at 9:15 PM, Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com> wrote:\n> \n> I like a lot of it.\n> \n> Agree about the need for more Dorothy.\n> \n> I wish there were other personal touches as well.\n> \n> Two things we might address quickly:\n> \n> Is the GOP bogus issue quote on equal pay one of the things she was criticized for taking out of context?

I called Lissa to tell her that Dan would manage the process going forward.  She thinks that is a mistake and does not believe it will work.  Just want to be upfront about that. I assume Joel and Mandy will hear from her, too. I still believe having Dan manage the process is best of not great options at this point.  If HRC has a different reaction after seeing the speech, we can adjust.  \n>> \n>> What's everyone's reaction to the new draft?  \n"
