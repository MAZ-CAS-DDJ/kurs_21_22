I worked in the transition office in 1992, as\r\nteam members began going into the executive branch agencies, and I would\r\nwelcome the opportunity to help the Obama team in its efforts this year.\r\n\r\nI worked at FEMA for almost six years during the Clinton Administration,\r\nso that would be my area of expertise and interest. Primarily, I served\r\nas the FEMA Region 10 Director in Seattle. As additional duties, I set\r\nup and directed the government\'s compensation program for victims of the\r\ngovernment-caused fires in Los Alamos in 2000, and served for a brief\r\nperiod as the agency\'s Acting General Counsel.  I have continued to be\r\ninvolved in issues relating to building safety and regulation, as well\r\nas disaster mitigation, in my five years as General Counsel with the\r\nInternational Code Council, which develops the model codes that govern\r\nconstruction in most of the U.S.\r\n\r\nI have attached a resume which outlines my background and experience in\r\nmore detail.\r\n\r\nThanks for your assistance.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid deCourcy\r\nGeneral Counsel and Senior Advisor to the CEO International Code Council\r\noffice: 206-527-4600\r\ncell: 206-484-2004\r\nfax: 206-729-1369\r\n\r\n\r\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.\r\nChecked by AVG. \r\nVersion: 7.5.524 / Virus Database: 270.7.6/1715 - Release Date:\r\n10/8/2008 7:19 PM\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n============================================================================\r\nBingham McCutchen LLP Circular 230 Notice:   To ensure compliance with IRS requirements, we inform you that any U.S. federal tax advice contained in this communication is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding any federal tax penalties.
