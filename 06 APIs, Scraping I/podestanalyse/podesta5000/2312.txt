Women Vote <http://www.wvwv.org/> offers you an opportunity\nto hear an analysis of potential voter drop-off in the 2010 elections.\n\nPlease join us Thursday, November 12, at 11:00am for a conference call and\nWebinar to explore the results of our research.\n\nPage Gardner, Founder & President of WVWV, will be joined by Anna Greenberg,\nSenior Vice President of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, to discuss what\nwe found.\n\nWomen\x92s Voices. Women Vote commissioned a post-election survey of 1000 *voters\nand non-voters* in New Jersey and Virginia.  Our survey takes an in-depth\nlook at the difference between the *Rising American\nElectorate*<http://www.wvwv.org/assets/2009/10/19/unmarried_america_and_the_rae_lake_research_slides_for_website.pdf>---unmarried\nwomen, youth (18-29), African Americans, Latinos, and other\nnon-white races--- and the rest of the voters and non-voters in both\nstates.\n\nWhat we found, while consistent with historical voter turn-out trends for\noff-year elections, raises important questions and confirms some of\nWVWV\x92s previous\ndiscoveries <http://www.wvwv.org/assets/2009/9/29/drop-off-voters-one-key-to-2010.pdf>about\nhow to engage the Rising American Electorate -- and what the opportunity\ncosts of not doing so are.\n\nThe Rising American Electorate now constitutes a majority -- 52% -- of the\nvoting-eligible population in America.  That\x92s 107 million eligible voters.\nIn 2008 elections, the RAE accounted for 47 percent of the electorate and\nmade their voice heard in support of progressive public policies on\neducation, energy, equality, health care, and the environment.\n\nOur poll in New Jersey and Virginia is one element of a\nlarger<http://www.wvwv.org/assets/2009/9/29/drop-off-voters-one-key-to-2010.pdf>\nresearch <http://www.wvwv.org/assets/2009/10/7/drop-off-voters.pdf>\nprogram<http://www.wvwv.org/assets/2009/10/7/drop-off-voting-in-the-2010-midterm-elections-a-state-by-state-analysis.pdf>designed\nto understand how the gains achieved in voter engagement and\nparticipation during the 2008 elections can be sustained, so that our public\ndebates and future elections reflect the greatest number of citizens and\nbroadest range of voices.\n\nIn addition to our post-election poll in New Jersey and Virginia, we will\nshare with you our analysis of RAE voter drop-off, both state-wide and at\nthe congressional district level.\n\nAs important, we will review the ways in which various candidates contacted\nvoters...what worked, what did not, and what really reached them.\n\nSo, please join us this Thursday, November 12 as we discuss what lessons our\nresearch offers for 2010.\n\n\n\nInformation for the call and webinar:\n\nPhone Number:  1-712-451-6000  code: 157606#\n\nWeb address:\n\n1.
