Deadline is ASAP if you want to contribute. Could do on background if not interested in providing a quote, given our policy of not speaking to the press about clients.\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Ho, Catherine <Catherine.Ho@washpost.com<javascript:_e(%7B%7D,'cvml','Catherine.Ho@washpost.com');>>\nSent: Wednesday, September 23, 2015 4:34 PM\nTo: Katie Beck\nSubject: can you comment?\n\n\nHi Katie,\n\nI'm working on a story about Hillary Clinton's remarks yesterday on lowering prescription drug prices and opposing Keystone pipeline. A number of the lobbyist bundlers who raise money for her campaign lobby on behalf of pharmaceutical manufacturers and oil companies, including Tony Podesta, who represents Amgen, Merck and BP. BP has been in favor of Keystone. I'm wondering if this is something Tony can comment on? What does he think about HRC's position on these two issues? Will he continue supporting/bundling for her campaign?\n\n\nOn deadline asap. We'd like to post the story first thing tomorrow morning.\n\n\nThanks,\n\nCatherine\n"
