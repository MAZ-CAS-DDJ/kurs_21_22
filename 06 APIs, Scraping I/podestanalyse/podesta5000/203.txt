From our\n>> perspective, this is pretty simple.  The people of New Hampshire wanted a\n>> debate.  We said Secretary Clinton would be there.

The\n>> Sanders campaign further asked that these debates not take place on\n>> weekends or holidays.  We agreed to that as well, and offered date windows\n>> accordingly.  The Sanders campaign proposal has been met in all respects.\n>> Now they refuse to take yes for an answer, apparently because they are\n>> intent on avoiding a debate in New Hampshire.  Enough of the games.  We are\n>> prepared to show up for a debate next Thursday and for three additional\n>> debates in the months ahead, which we can all work together to schedule.\n>> We hope Senator Sanders will be there too.  If the Sanders campaign decides\n>> to reject the debate next week, we'll let them answer to the voters of New\n>> Hampshire.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>> One additional note. We made the modest suggestion that one of the three\n>> additional debates take place in Flint, Michigan to shine a spotlight on\n>> what's happening there and in places like Flint around the country.  The\n>> Sanders campaign never responded.  We're not sure why, but if they'd rather\n>> not debate in Flint, we're certainly willing to mutually agree on three\n>> other locations.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>>\n\n\n-- \nMilia Fisher\nSpecial Assistant to the Chair\nHillary for America\nmfisher@hillaryclinton.com\nc: 858.395.1741\n"
