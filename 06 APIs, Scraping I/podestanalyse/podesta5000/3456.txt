So satisfying.\n\nI had a crazy, self-destructive idea.  As you are trying to figure out how\nto run the successor org to the Obama campaign, I have a suggestion for\nleadership:  Eli.\n\nYou know Eli, so I don\'t need to say much about this.\n\nBut he has done a truly remarkable job with MoveOn in general and especially\nthis year.  He\'s pivoted us into a positive, youth-oriented posture in just\na matter of months -- noting the shift from being on defense (the loyal\nopposition) and moving into offense (the new majority).  He\'s grown the base\nfrom 3M to 5M.  And he did the most remarkable thing -- deciding not to\ncompete with the Obama campaign in any way on field, and just jam energy\ninto it.  As you know, most organizations could not navigate that kind of\nopportunistic selflessness.  We fed more than 1M volunteers.  600,000 in the\nbattlegrounds.  Not to mention the $88M our members gave.  And to top it off\n-- more than 20M views of the GOTV "nonvoter" video.  A youth, pop culture\nhit.\n\nEli also could serve a really important role in signaling and realizing\nmovement connectivity with the permanent campaign.\n\nJust a thought.\n\nI mostly hope you don\'t pursue this, because it would create major problems\nfor me:  both in leading MoveOn and in differentiating MoveOn for our future\nwork.\n\nBut I had to raise it, because what you are doing is so, so important.  And\nI had to let you know that if you approach Eli, I won\'t be pissed.\n\n-Wes.\n'
