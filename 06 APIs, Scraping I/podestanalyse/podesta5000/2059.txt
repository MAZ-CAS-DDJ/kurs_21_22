john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hello All,\nJust got off the phone with our tracker, Evan, on the ground in Clearwater.\nBelow are the notes from our call.\nBig Highlights\n\n   - Says that in FL, \'all-of-the-above\' means wind and solar -- "god has so\n   richly blessed you here." also, enviromentally-friendly offshore\n   drilling. drill here and drill now.\n   - Delivers harsher attack against Obama on Ayers-- counters Dem.\n   rebuttals that Ayers just a guy in the neighborhood-- Palin said that\'s\n   untrue, that even Obama\'s own aides say Ayers was early supporter of obama\'s\n   - Repeats slam that Obama doesn\'t see america as you and i see america,\n   as a force for good in the world. im afraid this is someone who sees america\n   as imperfect enough to work with someone who\'s a domestic terrorist, would\n   target his own country. this isnt change we can believe in.\n      - Says we believe what Reagan believed, that USA is exceptional\n      country. we\'re not perfect but we learn from our mistakes. We represent a\n      perfect ideal.\n   - Says the phoniest claim in a campaign thats been full of them, is that\n   obama\'s gonna cut your taxes ("go with your gut, or do the math" and you\'ll\n   conclude the same)\n      - Says it\'s a left-wing agenda prettied up and packaged as mainstream\n   - Brings up "not-so-successful interview," apologizes for being\n   "annoyed," "impatient," "flippant"\n   - Lieberman: If anyone doubted that McCain is about change, is a\n   maverick, those doubts ended when he chose Gov. Palin to be his running\n   mate\n\n\nClearwater, FL: Palin Rally 10/06/08\n(Disclaimer: The following are notes, not direct quotes.

McCain fought for America,\n      That is the kind of man we need for america in these tough times.\n      - *If anyone doubted that McCain is about change, is a maverick, those\n      doubts ended when he chose Gov. Palin to be his running mate *this\n      year. [Crowd chants Sarah] Because as you know I am sure in AK\nthis lady is\n      the best in America. She represents the values of the American heartland.\n      She saw a govt in AK that wasnt delivering for folks like her, she ran\n      against incumbent GOP gov and she won ...\n      - and that is what she will help McCain do in DC. She is so strong, so\n      capable so full of values, a woman whose life has been built on faith in\n      god...\n      - there were a lot of people who were not so happy with McCain chosing\n      Sarah b/c she was so good, they tried to turn her into something\nshe is not,\n      didnt she show them in the debate...  i am proud to introduce to you the\n      next VPOTUS, SP\n\nSpeech Highlights*\n*\n\n\n\n   - thank you so much Sen Lieberman, with that kind introduction. He has\n   never seen so many people up so early. thankyou so much for that so warm\n   welcome, you take my breath away FL. The flags are beautiful, God Bless\n   America, you guys get it. It is great to be here in the home of the Tampa\n   bay Devil rays. Some of the experts were tough on the Rays, ive been there.\n   The rays in the playoffs for the first time ever.* FL knows something\n   about turning an underdog into a victor, how about that FL lets do that for\n   Sen. McCain. *So last time we came to FL it was up in the villages.\n   Thousand of people there to here our message of change, b/c they, like you,\n   are ready to shake things up in Fl. Rather you are a GOP, Dem, Ind. or\n   nothing at all we are asking for your support. We will win for you.\n   - So I wanted to come ehre a couple of days earlier but i had an\n   appointment in St. Louis that couldnt wait. I had a little debate with Sen.\n   Biden. [crowd boos] he is a fine and decent man. I enjoyed bringing McCain\'s\n   msg to Joe Biden. I told him he was the only man fighting for you, fighting\n   for america.\n   - it\'d sure be nice if just once he could say he wants america to\n   win- our opponent voted to cut off funding for troops even after saying he\'d\n   never do so - and he said our troops in afgh. are just "air-raiding\n   villages" and killing civilians - the US military is fighting terrorism and\n   protecting us and our values. theyre building schools so there\'s hope. they\n   deserve our gratitutde and our support\n   - mccain is a different kind of man - he believes in our troops and our\n   mission and as mom of 1 of those troops, thats exactly who i want as\n   commander in chief--\n   - man some of your signs just make me want to cry. thank you [we love\n   you!]\n   - mccain served country in uniform for 22yrs, *he was POW for 5 1/2 yrs* -\n   he was stationed here, learned to do what he does here in FL - today we\'re\n   proud of all the Floridians who\'ve worn country\'s uniform. FL home to many\n   of nation\'s vets, keeping nation safe and secure. let us applaud you, vets.\n   we thanks you and we love you guys. and gals.\n   - in 29 days, itll be time for choosing. in politics there are some\n   candidates who use change to just promote their careers and there are others\n   who use their careers to promote change. principles and pol. independence\n   matter more than party line, as lieberman told you. mccain and i dont just\n   talk about change - we\'re the only candidates in this election with track\n   record of making change happpen.\n   - as mayor and gov, i reminded ppl that govt not always the answer, too\n   often it\'s the problem. we put govt back on side of ppl. as mayor, i\n   eliminated burdens on sm. businesses, e.g. taxes on mill levy, property\n   taxes, etc. as gov, i came promising to control spending by request if\n   possible, by veto if necessary. today we have surplus.  [no more war! x2] we\n   suspended state fuel tax and i gave it back to ppl b/c they can spend it\n   better than govt can spend it for them. we\'ll take it to natl level. we\'re\n   not gonna have govt "solve all the problems" for them. we\'ll be acctable to\n   you, the ppl of USA.\n   - we\'ll set this nation firmly on a course of energy independence. [drill\n   baby drill! drill baby drill!] that\'s right. across FL and across USA, high\n   gas prices is making full tank feel like a luxury. costs going up, but\n   paycheck going down. we\'ll need all of the above approach, incl. alt\n   energy. *In FL, that means wind and solar -- god has so richly blessed\n   you here. sitting untapped. along with enviro-friendly offshore drilling.\n   *we need to drill here and drill now. now you can chant the \'drill baby\n   bill.\' its simple as this: in mccain-palin admin, we\'ll achieve energy\n   indep. its natl security issue and energy issue. that means Am energy\n   brought by Am sources and Am workers.\n   - we\'re gonna bring tax relief to every Americans and cut taxes for\n   business owners so you can hire new ppl -- that\'s how jobs are created. in\n   this election, mccain is the real reforrmer. and so am i.\n   - *i think the phoniest claim in a campaign thats been full of them, is\n   that obama\'s gonna cut your taxes.* he built his career first on doling\n   out tax money as state sen, then tax increases as Sen, then wasting $1M /day\n   on earmarks. now he\'s committed to $1T in new spending and *doggone it,\n   no one\'s asking him how he\'s gonna pay for all his new spending. so go with\n   your gut, or do the math, and either way, youll see he\'s gonna raise your\n   taxes.*\n   - it\'s leftwing agenda pkged and pretty\'d up to look mainstream. bigger\n   govt, activist judges, higher taxes, retreat in war - not what we want.\n   - a lot of interest in what ive been reading. incl. a not-so-successful\n   interview i had with couric recently. [boos] i was just trying to keep tina\n   fey in business. i have to apologize about being a bit impatient, annoyed\n   and my answer was a bit flippant-- but i wanted to talk about the issues\n   that matter to americans, not thru filter of MSM. well i was reading my copy\n   of NYT the other day [boos]--and i knew you guys would react like that-- and\n   i was really interested to read about his friend Bill Ayers. Acc. to NYT, he\n   was a domestic terrorist and he would have launched a campaign of bombings\n   incl. targeting pentagon. obama says he\'s just a guy in the neighborhood,\n   but that\'s not true. his own advisors say theyre friendly, reports that\n   ayers hosted fundraisers for obama, etc.\n   - *obama doesnt see america as you and i see america, which is as a force\n   for good in the world. im afraid this is someone who sees america as\n   imperfect enough to work with someone who\'s a domestic terrorist, would\n   target his own country. this isnt change we can believe in.* we believe\n   what Reagan believed in - that USA is exceptional country. [usa! usa! Palin\n   joins in] usa is a good and honorable nation, we\'re not perfect but we learn\n   from our mistakes. we represent a perf ideal, its frdm, tolerance its equal\n   rts. its what american soldiers have fought and died for - frdm is worth\n   fighting for.\n   - so look at that choice and contrast. the only man who can take on\n   washington is mccain. you\'ll have to hold onto your hats in FL b/c up to\n   election day, it may get kind of right. it\'s ok. opponents say they\'ll fight\n   for you. but since he wont say it on his own behalf, ive had to make it my\n   business to say it: mccain is the only man who\'ll really fight for you. he\n   has the courage to go on fighting for you. god bless you.\n\n\n\n\n-- \nSara DuBois\nTracking / Communications Manager\nProgressiveAccountability.org\nsara@progressiveaccountability.org\n202-609-7681 (office)\n410-967-7306 (cell)\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
