john.podesta@gmail.comb'Here is the post I mentioned.\nLandrigan\'s coverage of the TPC study:"Analysts say Obama offers three\ntimes the tax break for middle class"\nhttp://www.nashuatelegraph.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080611/NEWSB\nLOG/244217910\n\nAny help pushing this out would be appreciated.  \n\n-AJ\n\nhttp://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/2008/06/11/mccain-flip-on-taxes/\n\nDid Senator McCain Change His Mind On Taxes Again?\n<http://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/2008/06/11/mccain-flip-on-taxes/> \n\n\nOur guest bloggers are Center for American Progress Action Fund fellows\nRobert Gordon\n<http://www.americanprogress.org/experts/GordonRobert.html>  and James\nKvaal <http://www.americanprogress.org/aboutus/staff/KvaalJames.html> .\n\nThe highly respected Tax Policy Center (TPC) has posted a new\nside-by-side analysis\n<http://taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/election_issues_matrix.cfm>\ncomparing the McCain and Obama tax agendas. If accurate, this post\nindicates that the McCain team has described to TPC policies that differ\ndramatically from policies that remain on McCain\'s website and, in one\ninstance, were reiterated by McCain just yesterday.\n\n\tAlternative Minimum Tax. Yesterday, McCain said\n<http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/Speeches/641cbd73-6945-4103-ad\n70-306862fdecf3.htm>  he supports "a phase-out of the Alternative\nMinimum Tax." His website still says\n<http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/4dbd2cc7-890e-47f1-882f-b8fc\n4cfecc78.htm>  he will "permanently repeal the AMT." TPC says, however,\nthat McCain wants to "[e]xtend and index 2007 AMT patch, further\nincrease exemption by 5 percent in excess of inflation after 2013\n(temporarily)." That\'s relief from the AMT, but well short of "permanent\nrepeal" or "phase out."\n\n\tCorporate Expensing. McCain\'s website still features his\nproposal "to permit corporations to immediately deduct the cost of\nequipment investment, providing a valuable pro-growth investment\nincentive." That is enormously costly. In a fact sheet also still\navailable on the website, the McCain campaign compares\n<http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/1a8640f0-b2e3-4edb-b2a9-236d\nf79d2579.htm>  this proposal to a "modest" partial expensing measure\nscored\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/20/AR20080\n42001810.html>  by the Treasury Department as costing $1.2 trillion over\n10 years. But TPC says that McCain is now proposing only to "allow\nfirst-year deduction of 3 and 5-year equipment," and that McCain also\nwants a complementary repeal of the interest tax deduction. The TPC also\nsays that McCain\'s proposal "expires." With these modifications, the\nproposal\'s cost will be less than 2% of the proposal that McCain once\ndeemed "modest."\n\nSubstantively, these changes are mostly (modest) moves in the right\ndirection - although they also show McCain manipulating phase-ins and\nphase-outs just as President Bush has done for the last eight years. But\nour first question is: What is the McCain policy-what\'s on their\nwebsite, or what they seem to have told TPC?\n\n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
