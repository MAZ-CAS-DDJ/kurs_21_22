john.podesta@gmail.comb'6 radio interviews and 2 coffee shops this morning.  Interviews were all\nlive or taped Detroit stations with the exception of one we did into\nFlint.  Quick hits, mostly centered around getting out to vote.  Flint came\nup in every one, and then education, and ACA.  No flags.  Every single\ninterviewer was for her.  Highlight of the morning was one of the hosts,\nwhose stage name is "Foolish" asked a question, to which HRC replied "Well,\nFoolish, that is far from a foolish question."  Awkward chuckles all around.\n\nWe did 2 OTRs, both at very hip coffee shops a couple of miles outside of\ndowntown Detroit.\n\nThe first was Avalon, not too far from the Shinola Store.  HRC walked in\nand chatted with the baristas a little, then went to one of two small\nsitting areas and shook a lot of hands.  She had several interesting\nconversations, one with a woman who has cystic fibrosis, and her friend who\nalso has it had met and chatted with HRC in NH.  We\'ll get the audio and\nhave the exchanges transcribed.\n\nSecond OTR was at Astro coffee, near the old Detroit train station, which\nwas pretty striking.  HRC shook a lot of hands and ordered yet more\ncoffee.  Lots of people seemed to have voted, and lots said they\'d voted\nfor her.\n\nBack at the hotel now, likely until we leave for Cleveland this evening.\n\n\n\nOn Mar 6, 2016, at 2:27 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nICYMI, HRC did a 7 minute pre-taped hit on Face the Nation this morning.\nDickerson began by asking if Senator Sanders should stay in the race until\nthe end.  She said that\'s for him to decide, she\'s proud to have more\ndelegates and to have built a broad coalition that can win in November.  He\nasked about enthusiasm on the Republican side.  She said that she was proud\nto have gotten more votes than anyone in this race, and mentioned that she\nhas more white support than anyone if you exclude Vermont.  She got asked\nabout Trump bring people into his coalition, she said she wanted everyone\nin hers.  Asked about emails and played a little offense on the WaPo report\nthis morning that made clear how many state officials, including career,\nwe\'re sending what\'s now considered classified.  Name-checked Powell and\nmentioned that he called this all absurd. Final question was about Libya,\nstemming from the NYT 2-parter last week.  Handled it well.\n\nThen we went to church.  3 to be exact.\n\nWe began at the Holy Ghost Cathedral, with about 400 congregants I\'d\nguess.  The Bishop gave a rousing introduction about how much she loves\nHillary Clinton, because HRC is a woman who\'s been through difficult times\nand come out on the other side with the Glory of God.\n\nHRC\'s remarks were powerful, she talked about the need for us to unite.\nThat we need citizenship and stewardship in addition to leadership.  Real\ntogetherness message.  She told the story of the prodigal son, and used it\nto talk to the congregation about the discipline of gratitude.  She then\ndid Flint, schools in Detroit, and then a litany on breaking down\nbarriers.  Ended by talking about the need to never grow weary doing good.\n\nNext up was Russell Street Missionary Baptist Church\n\nPastor gave a nice intro, started by praising President Clinton, said\n"today she comes before us standing in her own shoes, with her own record,\nand her own vision."  Mentioned Debra and other strong women from the bible.\n\nHRC opened with love and kindness.  Talked about Flint, ended by saying\nthat we need to stand up for each other and our future.\n\nFinal church was Triumph Church.  The sanctuary was a beautiful wooden dome\nwith stained glass windows.  She opened with barriers here, then praised\nObama and the ACA.  Talked about togetherness, and did Flint at the end.\n\nVery good morning.\n\nOn a personal note, I just had two Coney Island hot dogs at the famous\nLafayette Coney Island next to the hotel.  I highly recommend.  Bring your\ndefibrillator, or ask to borrow one from USSS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Mar 5, 2016, at 1:20 AM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nJobs speech was great.  She stuck to the script mostly, cut out a few\nthings (didn\'t mention the /ideas webpage and cut out the story at the\nend).  Only real add was a line at the end about "bad mouthing America"\nthat some tried to seize on as a shot at Bernie, but it was (mostly) about\nthe GOP.\n\nThe Harwood interview was a little less substantive than promised, but she\ndid fine.  Got clawbacks in there, and a lot of questions about her\napproach to the economy, but all in the context of Bernie, Trump, what\'s\npolitically viable.  She got emails as well, handled well.\n\nDid an OTR at Kuzzo\'s Chicken and Waffles with the Mayor and Congresswoman\nBrenda Lawrence.  Lots of enthusiasm, lots of selfies.\n\nWe did 4 radio interviews, into Jackson, MS, New Orleans x2, and Detroit.\nAll very positive interviews, disproportionately about college\naffordability and education writ large.\n\nMore tomorrow.\n\n\nOn Mar 1, 2016, at 2:50 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nTwo OTRs with Governor Mark Dayton complete.\n\nWalked into Mapps Cafe in a trendy neighborhood near U of M, greeted by\nabout 50 patrons and 25 press.\n\nWe are now officially no longer 88 days from a press avail, but 0.  Merica,\nKarni, Abby Philipps, and some locals asked her questions.  Merica asked\nher about expectations today, she said were working hard, hope people turn\nout.  Asked about Sanders\' path, she declined to comment, said she\'s going\nto keep going.\n\nLocal asked about message for Minnesota voters today.  Talked about\nbreaking down barriers.\n\nAbby Philipps asked her about Trump being the eventual nominee.  She\ndodged.  Said they all have deeply troubling views.\n\nof the WaPo asked about Trump, she said things like this need to be\nrepudiated.  She would continue speak out against bigotry.\n\nAnnie Karni asked her another expectations question (I think), she again\nhave a pretty stock answer.  She tried to ask about asking for Bernie to\nget out of the race, she said that everyone has to make their own decisions.\n\nLocal asked her about Trump, she talked about speaking out against insults.\n\nShe met a Somali woman who wanted to tel her she was going caucus for her\nthrough her daughter who was translation.  HRC told her she would be the\npresident for everyone.\n\nShe met another Somali American on the city council who she was impressed\nby.\n\nHRC, Dayton, and the Lieutenant Governor made it to the counter ordered\ncoffee (HRC got something called the Big Bang).\n\nA guy came over to her at the counter and told her that he had just\nreceived a letter back from her yesterday.  He had written HRC about a\nhealth problem (I think with his dad).  They had a really nice exchange\nabout how useful it was for her to hear stories like his so she can figure\nout how to help.\n\nHer final real interaction before leaving was with a Somali-American girl,\nprobably 26 or 27, who said that Somali-American youth are being\nmarginalized and experiencing prejudice, and given her comments about the\nAfrican American community, how do we know she\'d be any different now?  She\nmentioned super predator specifically.  HRC said she\'d used the word one\ntime, and to look at her record.  The young woman said she knew what her\nrecord was and that it was supportive of the African American community,\nwhich is why so many have supported her campaign.  She mentioned the\nSomali-American councilman that she\'d just seen, and that she\'d met with\nmembers of the community last time she was in Minneapolis.  The girl\nresponded by saying something to the effect of the councilman doesn\'t\ncount.  HRC told her that if she believes that than maybe she should run\nfor office.  At this point the Governor intervened and the conversation\nended.\n\nLeft the coffee shop for Global Market, and indoor market with food and\nother stands that sell various things.  We got mobbed in the lobby so\nbarely made it to the proper market everywhere.  Took some selfies and then\nout.\n\nTaxiing now to head to Miami.\n\n\n\n\nOn Mar 1, 2016, at 11:19 AM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n8 interviews in the can here in Minneapolis this morning.  We did early\nmorning radio into Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and did the Tom Joyner show\nwith special guests.  All very positive, with a few questions about trust.\n\n*Ryan Cameron, Host, The Ryan Cameron Morning Show, V 103, Atlanta, GA *\nAsked her how she was feeling, why they should vote for her, being a woman,\n90s, crime bill, Superpredator (did her points), how will you continue a\ndialogue with the community.\n\n*Tom Joyner, Tom Joyner Morning Show*\nRoland Martin started off with a question about job growth for small\nbusinesses.  Sharpton asked her about who she\'d appoint as AG to protect\nvoting rights, same with SCOTUS justices. Don Lemon, said she stopped\ntalking about Sanders on the trail. She basically refuted that citing her\nrallies yesterday and proceeded to draw contrasts. Jacque Reid asked her\nabout what can be done in communities.  She talked a lot about breaking\ndown barriers. Finally, Sybil Wilkes asked her about how her presidency\nwould be different than her husbands.\n\n*DeDe, Host, Dede in the Morning (KKDA), Dallas, TX*\nWhy is it important to get out and vote, Trump, asked about WJC in the WH.\nLast question was about Morgan Freeman voice HRC\'s ads.\n\n*Madd Hatta, Host, The Madd Hatta Morning Show (97.9), Houston, TX*\n"Mista Madd" opened by calling her Madam President, pretending it was a\nslip of the tongue.  Questions were college loans, talked about making\nAmerica whole again.  Final Q was about wages.  And then the final final Q\nwas about what she\'d do about health care.\n\nWe just wrapped up some satellite TV hits into Atlanta, Oklahoma City,\nDenver, and Little Rock.  She got or emails in all but Denver.  She didn\'t\ngo full-bore on her most recent trust answer, but talked about not being a\nnatural politician, had a warm tone, all in all did well.  Not really a\nflag unless Healy and Chozick are trolling for nonsense this morning, but\nshould mention that she told the OK City anchor that WJC was her chief\nadvisor.  It was playful, but nonetheless.\n\n*Lori Geary WSB  (Atlanta)*\nTrump/David Duke\nTrust/FBI\nLied on BG?\nCollege affordability\nEver thought we\'d be where we are today with the name calling on the\nRepublican side?\n\n*Christie Lewis KWTV (Oklahoma City)*\nWhat do you want to say to voters?\nTrust\nEnergy sector\nWJC (called him her chief advisor)\nEmails\n\n*Marshall Zelinger- KMGH (Denver)*\nWhy not Colorado today?\nCaucuses\nFederal banking system for marijuana/Hickenlooper\nMental health and guns\n\n*Mallory Brooks- KARK (Little Rock)*\nArkansas Travelers\nWhat was so special about AR, what are you most proud of?\n- Wants to win in the fall\nVP candidates?\nEmails\nBernie\'s message\n\n\n\n\nOn Feb 29, 2016, at 12:37 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n600 at the Museum of Springfield history this morning, where I\'ve learned\nthat Springfield used to be a place where they manufactured Rolls Royces.\nThey have some here from the 20s on display that are just beautiful, if you\nlike that millionaires/billionaires stuff.\n\nRemarks were met with enthusiasm, but she was largely back to her\nlonger/policy-laden stump, with trickle down again and a return to some\nother old hits on Republicans.  In other words, November, with some of the\nnew message stuff as bookends.\n\nGot to Boston and were met by hundreds of people in the streets that\ncouldn\'t fit into the Old South Meeting House (one of the places where the\nTea Party was established--the 18th century Tea Party).\n\nShe\'s doing much the same thing here in Boston.  She did do a nice riff\n(thanks to Dan being quick on his feet right before she hit the stage) on\nwhat our founders would think about Johnson Controls and Valleant\nPharmaceuticals using American resources and not paying their fair share.\n "Now we may not go dumping prescription drugs into Boston Harbor, but I\npromise you they are going to pay a real price...\n\nWorking a ropeline now, then off to GMU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Feb 28, 2016, at 10:28 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n\nBelow its the readout that Adrienne sent around to many of you.  This was a\ngood rally.  She loves her some Arkansas and Arkansas loves her.  She\nopened with a little togetherness but quickly reverted to her stump,\nbeginning with rising incomes.  She ended by doing breaking barriers.\nThere were a few hundred people in the room and then a few hundred more in\na gymnasium next door where she spoke very briefly and worked another long\nrope line.\n\nIn the air headed to Springfield, MA now.\n\n###\n\nExecutive summary:  This was one of Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s best recent rallies.  She\nlooked incredibly comfortable on stage as she spoke about the differences\nbetween her and the Republican nominees, our country\xe2\x80\x99s economic success\nunder her husband, voting rights, Supreme Court and more.\n\n\n\nReporters noticed Hillary speaking more freely about her husband, referring\nto him by his first name and to his time as president.  Mentions of her\ntime in Arkansas, investment in jobs and infrastructure and debt-free\ncollege got the most applause.  She got a lot of nods when she said, \xe2\x80\x9cits\nnot enough to create opportunities for my granddaughter, I want to create\nopportunities for everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Epstein @jeneps\n\nSmall but enthusiastic crowd (partial crowd in photo) for Clinton in Pine\nBluff, 45 miles south of Little Rock pic.twitter.com/hPsGXofVdC\n\n\n\nRuby Cramer \xe2\x80\x8f@rubycramer\n\n.@HillaryClinton revives the word awesome, describes commander-in-chief job\nas "an awesome responsibility."\n\n\n\nMonica Alba @AlbaMonica\n\nHRC in Pine Bluff: "Arkansas runs deep in me.

I was (and still am) feeling\nblessed and caffeinated this Sunday afternoon.\n\nChurches were Greater Imani Church and Mississippi Boulevard Christian\nChurch.  Imani had about 2000 congregants there, 800 or so at Mississippi\nBlvd.\n\nShe gave a similar speech at each, sort of an abbreviated new stump,  did\ntogetherness, mothers of the movement, health care, love and kindness.\nFirst one was probably a little better organized, but crowd at each was\nfired up.  Lots of applause and lots of individual cheers.\n\nLeft there and flew to Nashville, where we joined Tony Goldwyn and the\nMayor Megan Barry for a coffee stop at Fido, near Vanderbilt. The place was\npacked, she ordered some coffee and took lots of photos, spoke to the owner\nand his son for awhile.  *On small thing to note*: on the way in Tony asked\nher what she thought of Trump\'s David Duke comments this morning.  She\nreplied that it was "pathetic" under her breath, which has made a little\nnews (in a good way).\n\nThe rally at Meharry Medical college was high-energy.  Tony Goldwyn did\nLONG but solid intro.  HRC visited an overflow room with about 400.  800 in\nthe main room.  She told the story again about the young, affluent white\nguy that emailed her after her Harlem speech and said he\'d been arrested\nbut through connections his parents made the charges go away. All people\nmust be equal under the law.\n\nLong ropeline and out.\n\nOn the plane headed to Arkansas (!!)\n\n\n\nOn Feb 26, 2016, at 3:07 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nGood trip to Georgia.\n\nCity hall was packed, with several hundred more in overflow than in the\nevent itself.  HRC spoke at both, with Mayor Reed getting everyone fired\nup.  Speech was shorter but pretty standard stump otherwise.\n\nWe left and went to the Statehouse which was electric.  Who knew there were\nthat many Democrats in Georgia.  She addressed the Democratic Caucus and\ndid a short version of her stump that was pretty crisp.  She used a line\nabout spending 10 months crafting policies, and while the press may have\nthought that was boring, she\'s very proud of it.  People loved it.  There\nwere no press in the room.\n\nWe took many a selfie while wading through throngs of people, with more\npouring over the balconies, and headed to Octane coffee shop for an OTR.\nUsher was going to join us but got stuck in traffic...\n\nDan Merica asked her if she was jealous that she didn\'t get Christie\'s\nendorsement, to which she responded with a prolonged smile (you could see\nthe gears turning), and then said "Dan, I really like you.  I really really\nlike you."  They are basically courting each other at this point.\n\nShe got one question from local CBS, general about why she\'s in Georgia.\nShe gave a stock answer about being a good partner if she\'s lucky enough to\nwin.\n\nIn the air headed to Orangeburg now.\n\n\nOn Feb 25, 2016, at 4:16 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nTwo events and two NBC interviews down, seem to be surviving the day.  I\neven venture to say it\'s going well.\n\nThe town hall in Kingstree was very engaging.\nStuck largely to remarks:\n\nSenator Sanders wants to take us back on HC.\n\nHit the GOP, saying they have health care through their jobs so what do\nthey have to worry about.\n\nSchools/Education\n\nDid the SCOTUS piece, including Sandoval:\n\n"Now there\'s been some talk that the President might nominate the R Gov of\nNV.  I love NV.  But I sure hope the President chooses a true progressive\nthat stands up to the values and interests of the people of this country,\nname-checked voting rights."\n\n*Q&A was strong, covered v*ets, someone asked about Haley, accusing her of\nbeing so focused on being GOP VP that she doesn\'t care about South\nCarolinians.  Got asked about HIPPY.  Forgiveness of debt for enterprise in\nAfAm communities.  Guns, Ukraine, child asked what she would do to stop\nterrorist attacks in the US, she gave a great answer that ended with he\ntelling the little girl to worry about school and her friends, and HRC\nwould worry about making sure she\'s safe.   Puerto Rico question from a\nyoung autistic man- she advocated for them voting and if they choose to\nbecome a state allowing them to do so.\n\nMorning Joe:\nAre we seeing a new HRC?\nTrust? In it for HRC or people?\nRelatability/Jeb/WJC\nTranscripts\n*Can you guarantee that you didn\'t say anything problematic?*\n*"Absolutely"*\n\nBig banks\n*Orderly unwinding under Dodd Frank, there\'s a roadmap if one starts to\nfail.*\n\nYou won\'t bail out?\n*If they pose a systemic risk, we\'ll bail them out.*\n\nElizabeth Warren for VP?\n*I don\'t want to get ahead of myself.*\n\nSuper predator, in the expected formulation where Joe basically baited her\non the notion that it was silly\n*Did some smiley head knodding in agreement with Joe\'s SP assessment.  Was\nprobably fine but let\'s keep an eye on.*\n\nElectability\n*I\'ve been vetted*\n*Hasn\'t even begun on the others*\n*Talked about voter turnout, NV caucus being better for Dem turnout than\nGOP*\n\nEmails, you say it\'s partisan, but is it?\nConflation of court fight which are partisan and what DOJ is doing.\n\nYouth/Young women\n*She stayed closer than usual to the Teddy formulation:*\n*It\'s Messed up*\n*Feel like the system failed them*\n*Excited by someone who says well change it all*\n*I remember being that age*\n*Want to meet people where they are*\n*Want to have a real dialogue*\n\nGridlock\n\n*Chuck Todd/MTP Daily*\n\n1) Nomination\nNot someone who gets ahead of myself.\nGot to keep proving it over and over again.\n\n2) Clyburn says you\'ve been more conversational.\n\n   - So proud\n   - Fair observation\n   - We laid out a lot of policy in the beginning\n   - I wanted people to know my plans, etc\n   - Now we have some opportunities to talk about values at stake, breaking\n   down barriers.\n   - Sense of convergence\n   - We\'ve laid out the work we want to do.\n   - Now we can build on that about how we unite the country and have\n   conversations about the future again.\n\n\n3) Ohio/Bernie NAFTA hit\n\n   - Americans are asking who can stop other countries from hurting their\n   workers and do a Manufacturing Renaissance...rest of answer we provided-\n   got in both Ex-Im investments in Ohio and name checked the tire factory\n   that benefitted from the New Markets Tax credit in Sumter.\n\n\n4) Protestor last night\n\n   - Poor choice of words\n   - Wouldnt\' use them today\'s\n   - Life\'s work\n   - Lifting up children and young people\n   - Never got the chance they deserved\n   - School to prison pipeline\n   - Going to keep being a champion\n   - Break down the barriers, economic and racism\n\n5) Trump/Supporters are former Trump supporters.\n\n   - Too soon to make judgements about this.\n   - NV Caucuses stat on turnout\n\n6) People say their second choice is Bernie, seems to be an appetite for\nradical change.\n\n   - People are disappointed and feel like they\'ve been let down.\n\n\nHere at the church in Florence right now and people are FIRED UP.  She\'s\nusing "imagine" to frame the whole speech.  Working well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Feb 24, 2016, at 6:15 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nStarted the day with an interview with Joe Madison, she called him on our\nway to SC Strong in North Charleston.\n\nOpened with a PBS story on the wealth gap growing.  She talked about her\nplans and inequality in general.  Follow up was about Obama\'s hesitancy to\nhave targeted efforts, instead focusing on the all boats rise with the tide\nnotion, so she skipped the Obama piece and talked about Clyburn\'s 10-20-30,\nher own plans.\n\nThen he played Gwen Carr\'s comments lasts night, quoted some of her lines\nincluding the one about HRC seeking them out, and compared it to Kennedy\ngoing to see MLK when he was arrested in Alabama.  HRC gave a strong answer\nabout being humbled, being a mother and a grandmother.\n\nGitmo Q at the end, answer tracked with her statement yesterday.\n\nSC Strong went well.  She did some very brief opening remarks, had a couple\nof the round table participants share their stories, and then we shuffled\nthe press out.\n\nDropped by the Longshoremen\'s, she thanked everyone and asked for their\nvote.  Great reception, they were very grateful that she came to the hall.\n\nOn the way to the airport we called Rhonda Rawlings for her show.\n\nRhonda started with minimum wage.  HRC stuck to her standard lines,\nmentioned equal pay, got a follow up on why $12 and defended it well.\n\nCollege affordability. She said she think debt free public education is\nachieveable.  Covered student debt as well.\n\nBreaking Down Barriers forum with the mothers in Greenville...talked about\nhow amazing it was, then asked about policing.  HRC talked about their\nability to turn grief into action.\n\nEnded with Obama\'s legacy.\n\nAlpha Kappa Alpha event went well.  She did some of her remarks, some ad\nlibbing. She reprised her town hall Q from last night where she was asked\nabout trust and forgiveness, repeated what she said about the importance of\nforgiveness and cited Mandela as our greatest example.  Worked a rope line\nat the end for a fair amount of time.\n\nDid two local affiliates before headed off to Sumter.  CBS and NBC locals.\nTalked about the state of the race, why she\'s in SC, Gitmo, and a quick Q\nabout emails and Benghazi in CBS.  NBC asked her about SC, Trust, Trump,\nBernie supporters and how to bring them around if she wins, and one\ninteresting question about her unique ability to energize rooms with\nminorities in them.\n\nWe\'re in Sumter now at Moore College.  She\'s been talking for 45 minutes.\nCovered it all!  Possible impending Q&A...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Feb 23, 2016, at 9:40 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n*Mothers of the Movement Event*\n\nHere\'s a summary, but for those of you that didn\'t watch...it was quite\nsomething.\n\nShe opened by acknowledging Herb Buhl, who she worked with when she was\ndown here working for CDF in the 1960s.  Told a funny story about not\nknowing how to drive a stick shift and him lending her a manual car.\n\nShe briefly told the stories of the mothers and the children they lost.\n\nGuns are the leading cause of death among black men, more than the other\nleading 9 causes of death combined.  There was an audible sigh in the\naudience.\n\nTalked about Gabby Giffords, and the 9 year old girl shot along with the\nothers that day.\n\nNo fly list.\n\nPolitics are hard, I know that.  But sometimes the hard things are\nsometimes the things that are most important to do.  President Obama wants\nto make guns a voting issue and I agree completely.\n\nPlease welcome these remarkable people who are taking this journey on\nbehalf of all of us.\n\nHRC turned it over to the guests.\n\n*Sabrina Fulton*: "She walked in as a Presiodental candidate, walked out as\na compassionate mother."\n\nNo one took notes fort her, she took notes for herself.\n\n*Maria Hamilton*, mother of Dontre Hamilton, told her story.\n\n*Lucia McBath*, mother of Jordan Davis.- told her story.  I have watched\nher bring people and countries back into the fold back into the fray, and\nshe has done a good thing.\n\n*Gwen Carr*- Talked about all the outreach, how HRC came to them.\nWondering what the catch was. "There was no catch, she was just genuinely\nconcerned."  I endorse her, because she endorsed us first.\n\n*Geneva Reed-Veal*, Sandra Bland\'s mom. Did a wonderful rant on the media\nand how tired she was of them.  Go out and vote.  We have 9 months to put\nher in, she\'s the new baby."There are no secret emails."\n\n*Mark Kelly*: X percent of children that die from gun violence in the\ndeveloping world die in the US.\n\n*Gabby*- Here to talk about Hillary Clinton, who is tough, she is\ncourageous, she will fight to make our families safer.  In the WH she will\nstand up to the gun lobby. Thanks why IU\'m voting for Hillary.  Speaking is\ndifficult for me but come January I want to say these two words...Madame\nPresident.\n\nStanding ovation from the room, someone stood up and yelled "Madame\nPresident!" Everyone went nuts.\n\n*HRC* said thanks to everyone, talked about their courage.  I hope this is\na movement that lasts, and ended to work a rope line.\n\n***At the very end, she briefly spoke to Alex Wagner on the rope line who\nwas there with The Circus.  I\'m not sure it checked the box for us, but\nthey talked briefly about how amazing the mothers were, what a moving event\nit was***\n\n\n\nOn Feb 22, 2016, at 2:34 AM, Lorella Praeli <lpraeli@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nHRC met with the United Farm Workers (UFW) and earned their endorsement by\nthe end of the meeting. Julie captured this unexpected moment on video--it\nwas special! We\'ll be working with UFW to discuss the roll out plan.\nThey\'ve asked their members to hold the news.\n\n   - She reiterated her commitment to fight for CIR with a pathway to\n   citizenship; protect and implement DACA and DAPA; and explore other ways to\n   protect undocumented people via executive action ("create new categories").\n   - She stated support for UFW\'s legislative proposal to expand overtime\n   pay for farm workers in CA, so overtime is av. after 40 hours/week or 8\n   hours/day.\n   - She was asked to help in the dispute between the UFW and CA-based\n   Gerawan Farming. She said she\'s do everything possible. After the meeting,\n   she had a private conversation with Arturo and expressed caution b/c of\n   campaign.\n   - She was asked about healthcare for the undocumented community. Stated\n   her support for all undocumented people to be able to buy in the exchange,\n   but acknowledged that most people don\'t have the resources to afford it.\n   She also said she would work to make the exchanges available to all,\n   including subsidies, but immediately linked it to CIR. Also wants to work\n   with states like CA and the UFW to explore other ways to provide HC\n   - Re Central American kids, she said government funded legal counsel for\n   UCs and working with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to take down drug\n   cartels and build the region.\n   - She was asked if she would appoint Obama to the SCOTUS. She said he\n   would be a very good candidate, but she wouldn\'t have that power...and he\n   probably wants a normal life. It was a fun exchange bet. her and the farm\n   workers.\n\n\nOn Sun, Feb 21, 2016 at 7:08 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Just met with the farm workers for an hour here in Palo Alto.
