A few things:\n\n \n\n*                     it sounds like getting a picture of taking the\ngirls to school would involve a waiver. What is a 2nd option for a photo\nthat day?\n\n*                     Do we have a podium sign with the seal being\nprinted somewhere?\n\n*                     We have locked a ballroom at the Hyatt for avails.\nWe are trying to lock an additional ballroom for the meeting followed by\navail for Friday. \n\n*                     We are close to having office space locked for\nWed-Friday. Adam Hitchcock will update later today. Hopefully Ariel Cap\nwhich is one block from our HQ and one block from Hyatt.\n\n \n\nWe should get this to BO if no one has issues. \n\n \n\n \n\n____________________________\nAlyssa Mastromonaco \n\nDirector of Scheduling and Advance\n\nObama for America \n\n312-819-2008\nwww.voteforchange.com <http://www.voteforchange.com/>  \n\n \n\n'
