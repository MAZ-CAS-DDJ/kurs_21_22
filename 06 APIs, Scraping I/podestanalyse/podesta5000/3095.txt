john.podesta@gmail.comb'===============================\nLeague of Conservation Voters\nhttp://action.lcv.org/ct/bpzLkNK1EmJe/\n===============================\n\nDear John,\n\nWe did it!\n\nThe election is finally over, and dozens of new environmental\nchampions will be heading to Washington in January, including\nPresident-Elect Barack Obama. This election was a victory for\nour nation and for a new energy future. I am especially proud of\nwhat we have accomplished together. \n\nWith your help, LCV helped elect several new pro-environment\nleaders to Congress, including Senators-Elect Mark Udall (CO),\nTom Udall (NM), Kay Hagan (NC) and Jeanne Shaheen (NH). We also\nkicked out some of the worst environmental foes, like Senator\nElizabeth Dole (NC) and Representative Joe Knollenberg . \n\nSome races are so close that they have not yet been called. Be\nsure to check our elections results page\nhttp://action.lcv.org/ct/gpzLkNK1EmJw/ and our Dirty Dozen\nhttp://action.lcv.org/ct/b1zLkNK1EmJs/ page for updates as\nthey come in. \n\nTo thank you for your help in these outstanding victories for\nthe environment, I would like to invite you to a post-election\nbriefing tomorrow, Thursday, November 6 at 4:00 p.m. Eastern\nTime. \n\nJoining us on the call will be Gary Peters, who defeated Dirty\nDozen member Joe Knollenberg in Michigan\'s 9th Congressional\nDistrict. I will also be joined by other LCV staffers who will\ndiscuss the election results and our plans to set the policy\nagenda in the new Congress and Administration:\n\n**Tony Massaro, Senior Vice President of Political Affairs and\nPublic Education;\n**Tiernan Sittenfeld, Legislative Director; and\n**Navin Nayak, Global Warming Project Director.\n\nI hope you will join us. Click here to register for the call.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/ct/b7zLkNK1EmJ3/\n\nEven as we celebrate, we are gearing up to translate these\nelectoral victories into lasting action to end our dependence on\noil, reverse global warming, and chart America\'s course to a\nclean, renewable energy economy.\n\nAs President-Elect Obama said last night, "This victory alone is\nnot the change we seek - it is only the chance for us to make\nthat change." \n\nThank you again for your generous support of LCV. We could not\nhave done it without you. We look forward to changing our\ncountry\'s energy future together! \n\nSincerely,\n\nGene Karpinski\nLeague of Conservation Voters \n\n*******************************\nTell A Friend!\nTell your friends to sign up for LCV updates today.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/lcv/join-forward.html?domain=lcvorg&r=z1zLkNKqBkm-&\n\nSign up for LCV Updates\nIf you received this message from a friend, you can sign up for\nLeague of Conservation Voters updates.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/lcv/join.html?r=z1zLkNKqBkm-E&\n\nQuestions?\nIf you have any questions about this message or any other League\nof Conservation Voters issue, please click here or call\n202-785-8683.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/ct/bdzLkNK1EmJx/\n\nPolicy\nYou, or someone on your behalf, has subscribed to receive this\ninformation from the League of Conservation Voters.
