For forty years we\'ve taken action for clean water \xe2\x80\x93 with the support [ https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=11212 ] of members like you. We\'ve made sure our waterways are protected, our drinking water is safe, our lakes are swimmable, and our streams are fishable. \n\nBut, as you know, we\'ve never seen a Congress as hostile to commonsense environmental protections as this one. Polluters and their allies in Congress have been relentlessly undermining the vital laws like the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts since day one. They are putting our health at risk and jeopardizing hundreds of thousands of jobs that depend on clean water.\n\nWe need Clean Water members like you to join us in this fight [ https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=11212 ]. Will you make a contribution of  [ https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=11212 ] today? Before you head to your favorite swimming hole or fishing spot to close out the summer - or, even better, before you have a beer (brewers need clean water) at that holiday weekend barbeque - think about why clean water matters you and take a moment to support Clean Water Action.\n\nThanks for your support!\n\nBob Wendelgass, President & CEO<!-- TemplateEndEditable -->\n\n\n----------------------\nCelebrating 40 years of action for clean water!\n\nTell a Friend\nDo you know someone who might be interested in learning about our work? <http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/t/201/tellafriend.jsp?tell_a_friend_KEY=3263>Tell them!\n\nDonate\nSupport Clean Water Action by <https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/t/9935/content.jsp?content_KEY=6304&tag=email.passiveask>making a donation today.\n\nConnect\n<http://www.facebook.com/pages/Clean-Water-Action/22907478728?ref=nf> Join us on Facebook\n<http://twitter.com/cleanh2oaction/> Follow us on Twitter\n<http://www.youtube.com/cleanwateraction> Check out our YouTube channel\n<http://cleanwateraction.we-care.com/>Shop with a purpose!
