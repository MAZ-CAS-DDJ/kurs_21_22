(Not that they weren't before).\n \nAs I see it, it's this simple: Women have the right to make their own health care decisions. If government gets in the way of that, we're doing something very wrong. If you agree, click here to join my colleagues and I and take a stand for women's health.\n\nhttp://signforgood.com/womenshealth/?code=SPMaloney&firstName=John&lastName=Podesta&email=john.podesta@gmail.com&zip=20016\n \nWe should be making women's health care as easy and as safe as possible by providing access to affordable care and contraception through programs like Planned Parenthood. But Republicans in the House are doing exactly NONE of those things. And we're all losing.\n \nThat's why I need your help.\n\nPlease click here to add your name and tell Congress to back off of women's rights.\n\nhttp://signforgood.com/womenshealth/?code=SPMaloney&firstName=John&lastName=Podesta&email=john.podesta@gmail.com&zip=20016\n \nAt the rate they're going the House Republicans won't stop until women's rights are back where they were in the 1950's. We can't let that happen.\n\nThanks for standing with me on this one,\n \nSean\n\n\nContribute -- https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/womenshealth-ty?refcode=SPMaloney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.\nTo unsubscribe from the Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress email list, please click here: http://action.seanmaloney.com/unsubscribe\n\n\nPAID FOR BY SEAN PATRICK MALONEY FOR CONGRESS\n\n\n"
