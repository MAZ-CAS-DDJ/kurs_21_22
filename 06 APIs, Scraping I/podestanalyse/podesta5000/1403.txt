I appreciate your persistence.\n\nAttached is a draft memo on some staffing issues I thought might be useful for updating Barack on the status/process of our work and teeing up issues for him to think about/provide feedback.  Let's discuss when you have a chance.\n\nIn addition, we're compiling names and the list is coming together.  We have several areas of weakness, but I look forward to discussing that with you as well.\n\nLook forward to speaking with you.  (I'm in disposed for the next couple of hours, but wanted to get this to you before the weekend.). Talk to you soon.\n\n-- Mike\n \n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Michael Froman <mfroman@hotmail.com>\nTo: Froman, Michael B [CAI]\nSent: Fri Aug 22 12:27:29 2008\nSubject: \n\n\n"
