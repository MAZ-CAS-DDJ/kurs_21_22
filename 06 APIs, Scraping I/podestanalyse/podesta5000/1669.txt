The paper, "The Law of Interpretation," co-authored with Will Baude (Chicago), is likely to be of wide interest, it deals with the law of interpretation across doctrinal areas, including both public law and private law interpretation of legally salient texts.\n\nHis paper is attached to this email.  A light snack will be served.\n\nLarry\n'
