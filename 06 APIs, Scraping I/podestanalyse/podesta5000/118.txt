What about Trump\'s denigration of immigrants? Women? The disabled?\n\nSomething crazy is definitely happening in the GOP, and Senator Portman is part of the problem. He voted to defund Planned Parenthood four times. He has consistently stood with the special interests and tried to take away health care from millions.\n\nThe good news is that we have an amazing Democratic candidate in Ohio, Ted Strickland. He\'s a former minister, psychologist, congressman, and governor with the experience and heart to deliver on the issues that matter to us all.\n\nThis is one of the closest races in the country, and the Koch brothers and their big money allies have already spent up to $10.7 million to defeat Ted. Now is our time to step in.\n\nWe need to show Ted that he has the full support of our PAC for a Change community.\n\nWill you step up today with a contribution of $10 or more right now?\n\n http://links.e.tedstrickland.com/ctt?kn=5&ms=ODM4OTI2OQS2&r=MTAyNDUyNjI4OTcwS0&b=2&j=ODIzMTg5ODczS0&mt=1&rt=0 \n\nI want to elect progressive champions like Ted to carry on the fight in the U.S. Senate.\n\nI want to elect progressive champions like Ted who will stand with Planned Parenthood -- not those who want to defund it.\n\nThat\'s why we need to come together today and support Ted\'s campaign.\n\nWill you contribute $10 or more to Ted Strickland\'s campaign today?\n\nThank you for standing up for Ted today.\n\nIn Friendship,\n\nBarbara Boxer\nU.S. Senator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.
