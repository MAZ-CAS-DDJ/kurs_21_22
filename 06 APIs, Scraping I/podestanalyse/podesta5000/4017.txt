john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hello Big Campaign,\n\nUnfortunately, we were not able to get a tracker into today\'s Environmental\nRound Table in North Bend, WA today.  The event was closed to the public and\nstaffers were checking a pre-made list.\n\nThe good news is we were able to capture video of the event from online\nstreaming video and we have that available upon request.  Below are the\nnotes we took from that video.\n\n*NORTH BEND, WA: McCain Environmental Round Table*\n*\nHighlights:* McCain was asked whether his age is a legitimate political\nissue and responded "anything is fair." McCain also staked out his\ndifferences from Bush on the environment, and he said that Hagee\'s\napology--and his coming-together with Bill Donohue to help reconcile with\nthe Catholic community--are "laudable."\n\nBACKGROUND DETAILS:\n-       Roundtable held at the Cedar River Watershed Educational Center\n-       Panelists include\n\no   Lands Commissioner Doug Sutherland\no   Bruce Williams, chairman and CEO of HomeStreet Bank and vice chairman of\nCascade Land Conservancy,;\no   Jim DiPeso, policy director of Republicans for Environmental Protection;\no   REI CEO Sally Jewell;\no   West Mathison, a fifth-generation farmer with Stemilt Growers, Inc.;\no   Chris Bayley, the former Republican King County prosecutor and chairman\nof Stewardship Partners;\no   Eagle Scout and high school senior Will Mentor;\no   Mercer Island City Councilman Steve Litzglow.\no   Former Gov. Dan Evans is the moderator.\n\n\n*INTRO:* from moderator, former Gov. Dan Evan\n\nMCCAIN SPEAKS\n\n\xb7      thanks Governor \x96 Native American issues \x96 they\'re stewards of large\namounts of land, so we need to have their "active partnership" in\nenvironmental initiatives\n\xb7      thanks Slade Gorton, \x85, Rob McKenna\n\xb7      not new to this issue, but I\'m always learning on this issue\n\xb7      "I traveled, I traveled around the globe  - usually at your expense"\nto learn about climate change: the Artic, Greenland\'s erosion of the ice\npack, Brazilian rain forest, Great Coral Reef \x96 "these are the miners\'\ncanaries of what\'s going to happen to our planet"\n\xb7      cap-and-trade. Other option is carbon tax \x96 just going to be passed\nonto consumer. Europeans have a cap and trade system, so we\'re not inventing\nthe wheel here \x96 we\'re trying to put free-enterprise, market-based\nincentives for how to deal with this great threat to Americans.\n\xb7      Citing Blair, suppose all we think we know about climate change is\nwrong and we accept green technologies, then all we\'ve done is handed off a\ncleaner world to young Americans. But if we are right, this will stoke\ninnovation and we must stewardship. Wind energy. Firmly and fastly rejects\nthe notion that this will be somehow harmful to the economy. We can use\nalternative-energy technologies to reduce greenhouse gases. "Do I have some\npassion about this? Yes" younger Americans are largely on my side; "we\'ve\ngot a few old geezers we\'ve got to convince."\n\n\nROUNDTABLE\n\n\xb7      MCCAIN: Tees off roundtable with Will, congratulates Eagle Scouts.\n\no   WILL MENTOR: Has seen the effects of climate change on his hikes as a\nBoy Scout and if we don\'t combat this issue, it has the potential to destroy\na lot of things Northwesterners hold important: streams, salmon. If there\nwere more of an opportunity for people his age to get involved in all this,\nit would make a big difference.\no   MCCAIN: If I were to make an obvious suggestion, best thing to do is\nplant another tree.  Best way to lower CO2.\n\n\xb7      MCCAIN asks SALLY JEWELL: How does REI contribute to this fight?\n\no   SALLY JEWELL: We have to lead. Business and private enterprise have to\ntake a significant role. REI launched a goal to be climate neutral. It\'s\ndifficult but it\'s important. Part of the problem is that children have a\nlack of connection to the outside world (too much time inside) \x96 a concern.\nWorking with Retailers like WalMart, Target, BestBuy and Loews. Working on\nsustainable packaging coalition. Working with paper companies to make sure\nthey\'re coming from responsible sources. Using recycled materials in REI\'s\nproducts.\no   MCCAIN: give you a comparative disadvantage?\no   SALLY JEWELL: it\'s expected to be green but people don\'t want to pay\nmore.\n\n\xb7      MCCAIN: What do you want me to do?\n\no   SALLY JEWELL: there\'s no federal incentives to be green. Find ways to\nincentivize businesses and individuals to reduce\no   MCCAIN: If you can sequester carbon and cut down on methane\x97we\'ve got to\nprovide those incentives.  Research and innovation. Once you\'ve developed\nit, you hand it off to private enterprise.\no   MCCAIN: Education. We\'ve had some on recyclable (struggles with word)\nmaterials.  Recycling is a very important aspect. Public education problem\non how important these small steps are.\no   "I\'m a little wary \x96 I have to give you some straight talk\x97about\ngovernment subsidies\x85 I opposed the [ethanol] subsidies because I thought\nthey\'d distort the market" b/c of unintended consequences. In the 70s- the\nlast time there was a gas crisis- we over-subsidized some of the solar\nindustry and we turned out to have some pretty shoddy material, incl. in AZ.\nAmericans will respond, as they have to\no   SALLY JEWELL: if not subsidies, then find ways to do the right thing and\npenalize those doing the wrong thing. Then these cleaner energy sources will\ntake off.\n\n\xb7      DOUG SOUTHERLAND\x97 as federal govt starts national cap-and-trade\nprogram, make sure local/regional systems aren\'t penalized.\n\no   MCCAIN: in other words, you want us to establish a system where you get\nsome credit for systems you\'ve established in the past, rather than have\neveryone start at same point?\no   DOUG SOUTHERLAND: I think each of the states should be able to make some\ndecisions on how it\'s going to be run.\no   Forest health is also a problem (i.e. strategic burning to minimize risk\nof fire). MCCAIN agrees \x96 forest fires have been devastating.\n\n\xb7      STEVE LITZGLOW: issue of money. We\'re trying to move to hybrids, but\nhow do you kickstart to get over that level to get to the hybrids? Battling\npriorities \x96 wants to be green, but... Says he has sinking fund, which\nhelps, but hard to get to long-term goal.\n\no   MCCAIN: Got an idea, Chris?\n\n\xb7      CHRIS BAYLEY: Government should give money to landowners who know how\nto take care of their land. From regulatory paradigm. landowner-based and\ncooperative paradigm.\n\xb7      MCCAIN: What about PILT (payment in lieu of taxes)? That\'s a good\none?\n\no   DAN EVANS: As former county exec, PILT, especially in those communities\nthat have been affected by the loss of harvesting on federal lands \x96 those\ncommunities that are dependent on forest industry don\'t have funds to meet\ntheir needs \x96 education, etc. either we have to get out of our analysis\nparalysis or find a way to help them survive. PILT has been one of those\nissues.\n\n\xb7      BRUCE WILLIAMS:\n\no   (1) land use \x96 may sound like a local issue removed from fed govt, but\nhas an impact in terms of climate change. When we did a carbon footprint of\nour bank, a lot of it came off of employees commuting \x96 need to be aware of\nit in developing great cities.\no   (2) waste management \x96 we don\'t have a good national plan and we\'d like\nto see that taken care of before we create more of it. Hantford.\no   (3) worry that cap-and-trade system will penalize hydropower.\n\n\xa7  MCCAIN \x96 would need to be accounted for in credit system.\n\xa7  MCCAIN \x96 maybe make mass transportation green.\n\xa7  MCCAIN \x96 on nuclear power, BRUCE WILLIAMS, why have European countries\ncome up with solutions that people approve of? E.g. France \x96 they\nre-process. We  have to do both. I understand the dangers. We have a whole\nlot more to do than we thought we had to do at the beginning of the\nexercise. We don\'t have the capability or certainly anything that\'s\naffordable. If other countries are able to make use of nuclear power and\naddress the issues of spent nuclear fuel, I don\'t understand why USA can\'t\ndo it. We\'ve never had a nuclear accident when we\'ve sailed ships around. We\nought ot be able to address the issues of transportation, storage,\nreprocessing and new technologies which reduce the amount of spent nuclear\nfuel. I\'m all for clean coal technology \x96 right now it\'s too expensive, but\nI\'m confident it will become less expensive. In the meantime, we can\'t\nafford an increase in greenhouse gases.\n\n\xb7      SALLY JEWELL (REI): on transportation. Worst is airplane travel \x96 we\ncan buy offsets, but not ideal. Electricity consumption \x96 we\'ve been able to\nbuy from more responsible compnaies. On employee commuting \x96 one of the\nthings the fed govt has done and I would encourage it -  the provision and\ntransportation funding for alternative forms of transportation, e.g.\nconnected bike path. One of the positive consequences of gas hike has been\nthrew-the-roof sales of bicycles. If you find ways to support bike routes,\ne.g., people will use it and it\'ll have positive consequences. But if you\ndon\'t have support from state, local and federal, not going to happen.\n\xb7      MCCAIN \x96 anecdote \x96 Meg Whitman asked employees how to reduce impact.\nSuggested that have cleaners come in and clean during the day and shut down\ncompletely at night \x96 saved on energy costs.  So we should ask Americans how\nthey think we should help.\n\xb7      WEST MATHISON \x96 I\'ve had retail execs say they hear "sustainability"\nand reach for their wallet.  But global marketplace is full of low-cost\nproducers. In American agriculture, we\'ve applied technology (organic,\nmicroirrigation) that any way we can help support agriculture in the USA \x96\nkeep food in US, not outsource. MCCAIN quips, "which means you\'re in favor\nof free trade?"\n\xb7      MCCAIN to WEST MATHISON:  how have gas prices affected your business?\n\no   WEST MATHISON: the only way we\'ll be sustainable is market-based\nsolutions. Maybe tax incentives with pre-determined sunsets will help. We\'re\nstarting to see trend of businesses asking question how can we be profitable\nand how can we do right? We\'re just scratching the surface \x96 so anything we\ncan do to incentivize that is going to be great.  Keep economic stimulus in\nthis country with the production of food, agriculture is a great way to\nsequester carbon\x85\n\n\xb7      MCCAIN to SALLY JEWELL: is there a concern that people worry they\'re\nnot getting the best quality product with recycled materials?\n\no   SALLY JEWELL \x96 our competitors aren\'t other sustainable orgs but TV,\nvideo games and overscheduled people. Sustainability is a team sport, it is\nnot competitive advantage. We\'re trying to create a market \x96 we\'re trying to\ncreate the demand.\n\n\xb7      MCCAIN to CHRIS BAYLEY: how can we help at fed level?\n\no   Landowner incentive programs fuel voluntary work and the agricultural\nproduction. Fed govts role in enviro should be incentive-based,  using the\nengine of volunteers and the power of landowners who want to save their land\nand create new habitat.\n\n\xb7      Steve \x96 you want to keep the fed govt from inhibiting people from\nfinding solutions. We don\'t need govt to tell us what we need to do \x96 but to\nencourage people to find systems that work. Like internet 10 years ago \x96 a\nlot of options look good right now, but you need to let the marketplace\nfigure out what\'s going to work. E.g. biodiesels and plug-ins \x96 don\'t know\nwhich is going to work, and so natural selection is critical in finding best\nwhat\'s going to work.\n\xb7      MCCAIN \x96 enviro not just green thing \x96 it\'s a national security and\nan economic concern (fillin up gas tank of fixed income people). Natl\nsecurity since we are dependent on more than $400b / year in imported oil to\ncountries that don\'t like us very much and some of that money ends up in\nhands of terrorists. Trade deficit  - we\'re borrowing from  China. Needs to\nbe bipartisan issue \x96 sit-down with bankers and consuemrs and all of us as\nAmericans and address this issue.  Honored to be in presence of Slade Gordon\nand to be at this facility that does so much to provide arguably cleanest\ndrinking water in the world and I promise not to do anything that would\naffect this state and local govt working together to provide this service.\nYou renew my enthusiasm in the lord\'s work in the city of Satan.\n\n\nMEDIA AVAILABILITY\n\n-       MCCAIN: Cedar River Watershed is beautiful. The environment here and\nin AZ important. I will be a Pres for the environment, I have a long record\nof advocacy for environment. I have a plan of action that will restore our\nenvironment, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and relieve our dependence on\nforeign oil. We can have good environmental record and a good economy,\nnamely through innovation and green technology. This can be a bipartisan\neffort. It is a nexus of compelling issues.\n-       Q: \x96 Obama and Clinton have nearly identical cap and trade plan but\nmore modest goals. Why should voters listen to your plan versus theirs?\n\no   MCCAIN: I have a long history in this \x96 they don\'t. People will trust my\nstewardship not only because of my background and knowledge but also my\nvision for the future. My plan is doable. You can dictate a lot of things,\nbut you have to unleash the entrepreneurial power of Americans in order to\naccomplish these things. This is one element of my environmental record and\nplan of action.\n\n-       Q: did you influence or support Hagee\'s decision to issue letter of\napology to Catholics? How will this change? Will it be enough to silence his\ncritics?\n\no   MCCAIN: Hagee and Donohue are joining together and reconcile with the\nCatholic community. I have long sought to reconcile \x96 with antiwar movement,\nwith David Ifshin, with the Vietnamese in interest of healing the wounds of\nwar. Donohue\'s and Hagee\'s coming together is a "laudable thing and a\ntestament to their Judeo-Christian values."\n\n-       What do you say to people who say global warming isn\'t real?\n\no   MCCAIN: I\'ll be glad to continue the debate. We continue to amass\nscientific evidence, e.g. from NASA. I pose the question again: the\nconsequences if we\'re wrong vs. consequences if we\'re right about climate\nchange happening.\no   I\'ve made some Republicans mad \x96 but my duty is to do what I think is\nright.\n\n-       Do you feel more comfortable accepting Hagee\'s endorsement now?\n\no   I again say that I accept his endorsement but not everything he says.\nThe fact that he apologized was helpful. I think it\'s always laudable for\nsomeone to apologize for something they did that was wrong.\n\n-       Q: Given mounting evidence of harmful effects of military sonar\ntesting on marine animals, are you going to take away the military\'s\npractice of that?\n\no   MCCAIN: there\'s a balance that can be achieved of conducting these tests\nso they\'re not harmful. I\'d be glad to continue to work on that.\n\n-       Q: GOP base would like to know \x96 do you believe that climate change\nis manmade or natural occurrence?\n\no   MCCAIN: I think evidence has indicated that human activity has had major\nimpact on buildup of greenhouse gases. I trust the assessment of National\nAssoc of Science\n\n-       Q from European journalist: Are you going to present different\napproach then what we\'ve had?\n\no   MCCAIN: Yes the President and I have had a "long-standing, significant,\ndeep" difference between Pres and I in our policies on this. Going back to\n2002. We can learn from the Europeans, from their mistakes (e.g. with cap\nand trade).\n\n-       Q: Fair for your age to be an issue?\n\no   MCCAIN: "Oh, anything is fair. This isn\'t beanbag." [How old *is* John\nMcCain?? Beanbag??] This is a question that was raised in the primaries. I\nlook forward to that. I look forward to bringing my 96-year-old mother\neverywhere I go. Maybe hiking too.\n\n-       Q: why weren\'t you in DC for vote about cutting off deliveries for\npetroleum reserve? Obama and Clinton were there.\n\no   MCCAIN: Because I\'m out campaigning. With a 97-to-1 vote it doesn\'t\nmatter. The people of AZ understand.\n\n-       Q: Points out examples of problems with nuclear, e.g. Hantford. Why\nshould we trust anyone who advocates nuclear?\n\no   MCCAIN: I understand the enormous challenges we\'ve faced in trying to\nclean up, I understand the skepticism. I\'d like to point out the European\nexample. They\'ve dealt with problems, they\'ve made progress. I will have to\nmake sure Americans convinced that nuclear power will be safe and secure and\nwe will avoid these problems.\n\n-       Aide says we\'re out of time. MCCAIN asks if he can take a few more\nquestions.\n-       Q: Were you or your campaign involved in brokering Donohue-Hagee\npeace?\n\no   MCCAIN: I certainly wasn\'t.\n\n-       Q: How do you respond to protests about hurting Boeing?\n\no   I have the greatest respect for Boeing workers. I was part of\ninvestigation that ended up with Boeing workers in prison and costing\nAmericans money. I did everything possible to make sure everything after\nthat was a fair and open process. I\'m open to Air Force review. But my first\nobligation to the American people is the careful stewardship of their\ndollars. And I\'m proud of my record there.\n\n-       Q: Would you make cap and trade bill a priority in your first 100\ndays?  Is it important to make progress on this bill even if it doesn\'t\npass?\n\no   MCCAIN: Lieberman-Warner is a good bill but doesn\'t go far enough with\nnuclear. It will be a top priority.\n\n-       Q: If elected, would you commit to attending the next round of UN\nclimate talks?\n\no   MCCAIN: I\'d have to assess where other countries are. But I will lead\nthis country and the world to address this issue. America can lead and not\nobstruct.\n\n\n-- \nCammie L.
