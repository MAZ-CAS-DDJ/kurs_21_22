Our working group meets tomorrow and they are asking how to\nhandle a variety of issues relating to the teams that you have yet to\napprove.  They are being asked by possible team members if they can talk to\ntheir employers (some are in high level positions and/or have significant\nmanagement responsiblities and need to give their employers a heads up and\narrange for time off); there are likely to be a slew of legal issues for the\ntransition lawyers to work through before some can sign the pledge and\nserve; and a considerable number have not yet been approached at all pending\nyour approval, some of whom will say no to joining a team, requiring us\nto regroup.  All to say -- is there anything I can do to help facilitate\nyour review?\nEven if you can't look at the lists today, if you could tell me when you\nwill get back to us, it will help us stave off the masses. . . .\n\nTHANKS!!\nLisa\n-- \nLisa Brown\ncell) 301-537-3332\n"
