As some of you may know, Tyrone has been out of the office for some time due to medical reasons, and we had deeply hoped for a better outcome. Tyrone\xe2\x80\x99s family is in the process of preparing to take Tyrone back to St. Louis; however, we hope to hold a memorial service for Tyrone on campus at some point in the future.\r\n\r\nPlease keep Tyrone and his family in your thoughts and prayers. \r\n\r\nSincerely, Bill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n"
