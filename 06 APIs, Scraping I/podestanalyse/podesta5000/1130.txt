You live in Illusions believing that this election could be won by beggary! Billionaire' fortune cannot be matched by small money collection from the Poor! A much better way exists but you stubbornly ignore it! The efficacious way of emerging victorious from this Campaign would have been only by Mobilization of Entire USA Media for Coast to Coast Transmissions intending US Consistency persuasion to refrain from   voting for the Republican Avaricious Party! Since most of US Population is not Wealthy such Tramsmissions  would have been an effective deterrence against mas voting for the Republican Party logically!               Gideon Rodeh"
