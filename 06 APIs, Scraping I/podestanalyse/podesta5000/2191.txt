john.podesta@gmail.comb'Thank you John!\n\nAs promised, this is the short piece on "Shared Prosperity in the\nInformation Age". It is not a revolt against Google or Facebook. It is a\nstrategic adjustment they need to make to keep the "free content writer"\nand preserve value!\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/lt-gen-clarence-e-mcknight-jr-/information-age-inequality_b_6531770.html\n\nMy second piece is just about to go out. My thought partner on this one is\nJoe Kelly, former Cyber chief at the DoD office of Undersecretary for\nIntelligence and recently the CIO at the civil liberties and privacy\ncommission.\n\nI will send the new one to you shortly. I am partnering with Georgetown to\nassess the premise deeper.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you soon. You have a standing invitation for a\nmodest lunch at the Army and Navy Club downtown when your schedule permits.\n\nAll the best\n\nBijan\n\n\n*Hon. Bijan R.
