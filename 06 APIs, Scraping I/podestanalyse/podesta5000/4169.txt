We will\nbe outlining our plan to achieve that as part of a broader energy and\nclimate strategy in the weeks ahead."\n\n\nMilia Fisher\n(858) 395-1741\n\nOn Jun 13, 2015, at 5:00 PM, Milia Fisher <mfisher@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n\n\nMilia Fisher\n(858) 395-1741\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n\n*From:* Mike Schmidt <mschmidt@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Date:* June 13, 2015 at 4:55:01 PM EDT\n*To:* Christina Reynolds <creynolds@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Cc:* Trevor Houser <tghouser.hrc@gmail.com>, Ben Kobren <\nbenkobren@gmail.com>,  Pete Ogden <progden@gmail.com>, Maya Harris <\nmharris@hillaryclinton.com>,  Corey Ciorciari <cciorciari@hillaryclinton.com>,\nMilia Fisher <mfisher@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Subject:* *Fees and royalties*\n\nHi Christina:\n\nJust spoke with our energy folks about the line in the speech on "using\nadditional fees and royalties from fossil fuel extraction to protect the\nenvironment" -- a reference to reforming the royalties paid for energy\nextraction on public land. Their only potential concern was that folks in\nthe environmental community will view this as a step towards a carbon tax\n(thus raising expectations) -- whereas it\'s really going to be a more\ntargeted proposal (in line with some Obama Administration reforms) aimed at\nmaking sure that taxpayers get their fair share in federal royalties.\n\nWe think it\'s unlikely that this will be much of an issue, as the language\nin the speech was pretty specific. But, to be safe, the team is developing\nsome talking points that (1) withhold details until the summer but (2)\nemphasize that we\'re talking about royalties on federal land (rather than a\nbroader carbon tax). We just wanted you to have this background, in case\nyou got any questions on this -- and let us know if there seems to be\ninterest in the issue.\n\nCopying Milia to make sure that this is consistent with where John is on\nthis.\n\nThanks a bunch,\n\nMike\n'
