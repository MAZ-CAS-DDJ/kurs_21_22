In this line: Not California, not China, not Germany \x96 Michigan.   I would take out "Not California". Let\'s not bash any post March state, but also CA is doing a ton of auto innovation on this front too.\n\n2. Suniva solar plant Not sure here, but doublechecking... I thought they had issues post government investment and needed to have a bailout before getting back to profitability.  ??\n\n3. "casino culture" might not be great re: Nevada, Reid.  Also there\'s a MGM Casino right in downtown Detroit (if memory services me right).  Perhaps reckless gambling with our economy.  reckless risk taking. greedy risk taking. ?\n\n4. This country has given you so much.  If you desert America, you\x92ll pay a price. can we add the American worker somewhere here.  This country, American workers, have given you so much.\n\n5. Agree with adding one more line on Detroit schools.  I\'ve talked to teachers in Detroit??  I\'ve seen the pictures of mold.?  Something along those lines.\n\n6. I worry about talking about immigration in this way here or even at all.  If we do want to talk about it... we should address the underlying concerns of working class guys in unions who are VERY worried about wages going down and people taking their jobs.  Instead my key suggestion is to make the case that fixing immigration HELPS working class guys too.  Bottomline: if we get rid of exploitation (of immigrants), ALL American workers benefit.\n\nOriginal: We also need to finally fix our broken immigration system.  That will bring millions of undocumented workers out of the shadows; increase wages for Americans and immigrant workers; generate billions of dollars in new revenue; strengthen key industries \x96 and by the way, it\x92s the right thing to do for families.\n\nSuggestions: We also need to finally fix our broken immigration system.  In this election cycle, Republicans have been whipping up hate and hysteria by telling stories of untold waves of foreigners flowing across our border. But, here\'s the reality, net movement of immigrants coming into this country is going in the other direction. So, the most important thing we have to do is to bring the 11-12 million undocumented people who are already here out of the shadows. It is not just the right thing to do because it keeps families together, but all American workers benefit when our neighbors can\'t be exploited and are paying their fair share of taxes.\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Mar 3, 2016 at 7:49 PM, Ann O\'Leary <aoleary@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:aoleary@hillaryclinton.com>> wrote:\nYes, he was!

What would you do about it?  Do you support local control of the school district?\n\n  *   Lets recognize for a moment that there\'s a pattern here. Another low-income, largely African-American city with a problem that is devastating a generation of children. Another state appointed Emergency Manager. Another round of excuses and finger pointing as the problem gets worse and your Governor sits on his hands.\n\n  *   Detroit\'s children are sitting in classrooms with rodents and mold. Ceilings are caving in. The heat is barely functioning. 6 percent of fourth graders are proficient in reading. 5 percent are proficient in math.\n\n  *   That\'s unacceptable in America. Detroit has fought too hard. Its families have sacrificed too much. Its time for action.\n\n  *   Its time for Governor Snyder to give Detroit\'s schools back to Detroit. Its time to rebuild our crumbling schools and invest in our students and teachers. Its time to give every child clean water, a safe classroom, and a world class education.\n\n\nOn Thu, Mar 3, 2016 at 4:08 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com>> wrote:\nSchools is in there no?

There are serious complaints about potential health issues related to mold, but DPS has apparently blocked health inspectors from the teacher\'s union. Seems a bit tone deaf not to say something but to suggest that good things are happening in Eastern Detroit.\n\n\nTeachers union says DPS blocked its health inspectors\n\n\nOfficials from Detroit\'s teachers union blasted Detroit Public Schools on Wednesday after the district blocked the union\'s environmental experts from investigating possible mold growth, water damage and other problems inside nine schools.\n\n"Our members are demanding that we give them specific answers as to what\'s going on in their schools," Ivy Bailey, interim president of the Detroit Federation of Teachers, said at a news conference outside Spain-Elementary Middle School.\n\nhttp://www.freep.com/story/news/education/2016/02/03/dft-school-inspections/79766166/\n\n\nAFT sues Detroit schools over decrepit conditions\n\nMold, rodents and water-damaged ceilings were among the unsafe classroom conditions cited in a recently filed lawsuit against the Detroit Public Schools by the American Federation of Teachers-Michigan, the Detroit Federation of Teachers and parent groups. David Hecker, the president of the AFT-Michigan, said the action was taken to force the district to respond after years of neglect. The January lawsuit \x97 and rolling teacher sick-outs \x97 drew national attention to the long-neglected schools.\n\n\nDetroit Public Schools will be completely broke by April.
