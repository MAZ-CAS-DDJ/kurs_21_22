School Board.\n\nAnd Delegates Barbara Frush, Joseline Pe\xc3\xb1a-Melnyk, and Ben Barnes and I are running for re-election.\n\nI need your help in all these efforts.\n\nSample ballots, yard signs, mailings - they all cost money. To help advance the interests I work for in the Senate - education, local business growth, environmental protection, health care, technology - I\'m working to elect allies from the court house and Annapolis to Upper Marlboro and Congress.\n\nI hope you can join Rushern Baker and me on October 3rd at my fundraiser in Laurel.\n\nA contribution of $4000, $2500, $1000, $500, or $250 would be a great help.\n\nBelow is the invitation.
