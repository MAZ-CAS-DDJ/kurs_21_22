john.podesta@gmail.comb"Dear John,\n\nThis is just a brief note to wish you the very best on your last day at the\nWhite House -- at least for now! It's inspiring to reflect on the many ways\nin which your work on behalf of the President and the nation has made an\nimpact in just over a year. Your excellent Politico piece today highlighted\nyour extraordinary leadership on climate, but I know there's much more on\nthat list. I'm so lucky that you arrived last year just in time for me to\nhave the chance to work with you for a few months!\n\nAll is well so far here at L.A. City Hall -- Mayor Garcetti is a great\nleader, and I already have a very full plate helping manage a variety of\npolicy initiatives and formulating a plan to improve his decision-making\nand briefing process. I'm confident this is a great next step for me, and\never appreciative of the role you played in making it happen.\n\nI know another exciting venture lies ahead for you -- no doubt you'll lead\nit to great heights as well! Please do let me know when that mission next\nbrings you to Los Angeles, as it would be great to see you.\n\nWarmly,\n\nAnuj\n\n-- \n<http://www.lamayor.org/>\n\n\n\n*Anuj K.
