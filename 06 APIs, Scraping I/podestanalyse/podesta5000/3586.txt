Victory Fund Follow Up-I think that NEA is open to doing the full\n> $180K to the Victory Fund.  They can do this amount in 2015 and the same\n> amount in 2016.  For 2015, our window is closing and they had a question\n> about holding any of that money back for in kind work rather then direct\n> contributions.  Since we\'re in December, I\'m doubtful the flexibility for\n> in kind work is needed since we reset in 2016.  I spoke with Mike Smith\n> this morning and its definitely finance\'s preference to have the full money\n> amount for 2015.  John deferred to Robby on this decision but said we would\n> circle back with a answer this week.  Can you help me nail that down?\n> Happy to start a email, etc.  Just let me know how I can help.\n>\n> 3.  Teacher shortage-John Stocks raised a issue about teacher shortage\n> that he thought would be a good message for their members and the\n> profession at large if the Secretary would want to weigh in.  The NEA is\n> going to send materials and I\'ll mention this issue to Ann O\'Leary as well\n> for background.\n>\n> 4.  MA-The NEA State President of MA is very pro-Sanders.  John Stocks\n> suggested outreach to the former President Paul Toner.  I spoke with\n> Charlie Baker this morning and we\'re going to reach out to him together.\n> Charlie knows him.  We will try to engage.\n>\n> *Building Trades Meeting*\n>\n> 1.  John mentioned to them that as we role out gun control we would\n> appreciate their help as buffers around the issue.  I\'ll be sure to loop\n> them in as we roll out any gun control policy initiatives.\n>\n> 2.  "Leaky pipes"-Terry O\'Sullivan was in attendance and mentioned his\n> sensitivity to using the term "leaky pipes" in HRC remarks and statements.\n> I\'ve already flagged this for our policy team.  Bottom line:  Our intention\n> was not what they thought it was and moving forward we\'ll be sensitive to\n> it.\n>\n> 3.  I\'m going to do follow up calls on the Victory Fund information that\n> was circulated on Friday with attendees\n>\n> 4.  I\'m going to follow up with Monroe on next steps to plan for Hardhats\n> events.\n>\n> *WJC Surrogate NEA request:*\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> *MEMO*\n>\n>\n>\n> *TO*:              State Affiliate Presidents\n>\n>\n>\n> *FROM*:        Lily Eskelsen Garc\xc3\xada\n>\n>\n>\n> *DATE:*         November 13, 2015\n>\n>\n>\n> *RE:            *2016 NEA ESP National Conference: Registration and\n> Nomination Process\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> *2016 NEA ESP National Conference Theme*\n>\n> *Education Support Professionals: Uniting, Inspiring and Leading for the\n> Whole Student*\n>\n>\n>\n> The 2016 NEA ESP National Conference will take place March 11-13, 2016,\n> in Orlando, Florida.
