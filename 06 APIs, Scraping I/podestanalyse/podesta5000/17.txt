I like to think of myself as an archive rat who knows a thing or two about Felix Frankfurter and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., but Brad makes me look like a piker.  The paper begins with a one-page cover memo that says what\'s new about this chapter and the book it\'s taken from and suggests why both matter.\n\nDan\n\nFrom: John Mikhail\nSent: Wednesday, February 04, 2015 3:51 PM\nTo: Law Faculty and Visitors\nCc: Jennifer E.
