john.podesta@gmail.comb'To the Board,\nFrank and I have had early conversations about the Fund and decision making\nfor message and voter mobilization allocations.  If you could review the\nfollowing document, we would like to have your thoughts on the memo and how\nwe wish to proceed.\n\nOur next Board meeting is not until February 22nd.  We would also like to\nconsider a brief phone call if possible to go over the points in the memo if\nnecessary prior to the Boad meeting.\n\nThank you all,\nAmy\n'
