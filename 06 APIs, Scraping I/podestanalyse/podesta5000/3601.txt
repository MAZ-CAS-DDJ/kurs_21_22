Catholics United\nbelieves the campaign and an affiliated protest - scheduled for Friday, June\n13 at the USCCB\'s meeting in Orlando - constitute both a shameful attempt to\nuse the Catholic sacrament of Communion as a political weapon, and a means\nof perpetuating decades of the acrimony and division that have prevented\nreal progress toward ending abortions in the U.S.\n\n \n\nCatholics United further called on the Society for Truth and Justice and\nOperation Rescue to work with leaders from across the ideological and\npolitical spectrum to craft real solutions to the abortion issue.  A growing\nbody of evidence - including a Catholics United study using data from Kansas\nand an upcoming 50-state study by Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good\n- suggests that providing economic and social supports for pregnant women\nand families are the most effective ways to prevent abortions.\n\n \n\n"Many of these organizations\' supporters are undoubtedly motivated by a\nprofound and commendable desire to preserve and protect human life at all\nstages," said Chris Korzen, executive director of Catholics United and\nco-author of A Nation for All:  How the Catholic Vision of the Common Good\nCan Save America from the Politics of Division. "Unfortunately, the leaders\nof these organizations are pursing strategies that are counterproductive to\ntheir stated objectives.  This type of political rhetoric and campaign\nintervention is directly responsible for many of the failed policies of the\nlast decade that have proved to be a disaster - by all reasonable measures -\nfor human life and dignity."\n\n \n\nThe ad campaign and USCCB protest are eerily reminiscent of a 2004 concerted\neffort by the Republican Party and far right Catholic political\norganizations to convince Catholics that Senator John Kerry\'s position on\nabortion rendered him unfit for their vote.  Although theologically\ninaccurate, this well-funded and well-organized campaign may have been the\ndecisive factor in securing President Bush\'s win in Ohio.\n\n \n\n"It\'s time to move beyond the failed policies of the past and address the\nreal threats to the common good:  war, poverty, and lack of health care and\neducation, the environment, and our dire economic situation," said Korzen.\n"It\'s also time to stop using the abortion issue to divide voters and to\nstart bringing Americans together around common ground solutions.  The\nSociety for Truth and Justice and Operation Rescue\'s action are bad for\nCatholics, bad for the unborn, and bad for America."\n\n \n\nFor more information:\n\n \n\nSociety for Truth and Justice Release:\nhttp://christiannewswire.com/news/50216885.html\n\nSociety for Truth and Justice Ad:  http://www.ahumbleplea.com/OrlandoAd.htm\n\nCatholics United Abortion study:\nhttp://www.catholics-united.org/abortion-study\n\nA Nation For All:  http://www.anationforall.com\n<http://www.anationforall.com/> \n\n \n\n###\n\n \n\nCatholics United is a non-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to\npromoting the message of justice and the common good found at the heart of\nthe Catholic Social Tradition.
