And I am so proud of all the dedicated public servants\nwho were part of that work - including the team that came in with me, and\nleft with me. I was proud of them then, and I am proud of them now. They\nworked tirelessly, gave everything of themselves in support of our\ncountry\'s goals. We are all accountable to the American people for our work\n- but they simply don\'t deserve to be attacked this way.\xe2\x80\x8e Despite that\nthough, they have committed - as I have - to being as helpful as possible\nto those asking the questions.

Was her statement\ninaccurate?*\n\n\n\nNo information in Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s emails was marked classified at the time she\nsent or received them.  Clinton only used her account for unclassified\nemail.\n\n\n\nWhen information is reviewed for public release, it is common for\ninformation previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified\n<http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/05/22/408774111/state-department-to-release-more-clinton-emails-today>\nif the State Department or another agency believes its public release could\ncause potential harm to national security, law enforcement or diplomatic\nrelations.\n\n\n\nAfter reviewing a sampling of the 55,000 pages of emails, the Inspectors\nGeneral have proffered that four emails, which did not contain any\nclassified markings and/or dissemination controls, should have been\nclassified at the time they were sent.  The State Department has said it\ndisagrees with this assessment.\n\n\n\nClinton hopes the State Department and other relevant agencies will sort\nout as quickly as possible which of the 55,000 pages of emails are\nappropriate to release to the public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Is Department of Justice conducting a criminal inquiry into Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nemail use? *\n\n\n\nNo. As the Department of Justice and Inspectors General made clear, the\nIG\xe2\x80\x99s made a security referral.  This was not criminal in nature as\nmisreported by some in the press.  The Department of Justice is now seeking\nassurances about the storage of materials related to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s email\naccount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Is it true that her email server and a thumb drive were recently turned\nover the government.   Why?*\n\n\n\nAgain, when information is reviewed for public release, it is common for\ninformation previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified\n<http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/05/22/408774111/state-department-to-release-more-clinton-emails-today>\nif the State Department or another agency believes its public release could\ncause potential harm to national security, law enforcement or diplomatic\nrelations.\n\n\n\nIt is her hope that State and the other agencies involved in the review\nprocess will sort out as quickly as possible which emails are appropriate\nto release to the public, and that the release will be as timely and as\ntransparent as possible.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, her team has worked with the State Department to\nensure her emails are stored in a safe and secure manner.\n\n\n\nAs a result, she directed her team to give her email server to the\nDepartment of Justice, as well as a thumb drive containing copies\nof her emails already provided to the State Department.  We have pledged to\ncooperate with the government\'s security inquiry\xe2\x80\x94if it decides it needs to\nsee more, we will arrange for that to happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Would this issue not have arisen if she used a state.gov\n<http://state.gov> email address?*\n\n\n\nEven if Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s emails had been on a government email address and\ngovernment device, these questions would be raised prior to public release.\n\n\n\nWhile State Department\xe2\x80\x99s review of her 55,000 emails brought the issue to\nthe Inspectors Generals\' attentions, the emails that were classified prior\nto public release were on the unclassified .gov email system. They were not\non the separate, closed system used by State Department for handling\nclassified communications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n\nThis message and any attachments are intended only for the addressee and\nmay contain information that is privileged and confidential.
