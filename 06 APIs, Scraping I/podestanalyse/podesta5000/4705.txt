I am proud to say that, together,\nwe have attracted more new Fellows (695) than in previous years and have exceeded\nour fundraising goal ($1,530,000).  State Chairs are to be congratulated for their\nleadership in all areas and especially for planning and conducting more state-based\nevents than ever before.\n\nThe Fellows now provides approximately 20% of the annual funding needed to continue\nthe important academic work of the ABF.  That financial support is critical to the\nfuture of our faculty's work in researching important topics in the rule of law \nand the administration of justice; which, together, comprise the foundation of our\ndemocracy and the future of global society.\n\nOver and above its financial contribution, our fellowship provides important assistance\nin the dissemination of the Foundation's accumulated knowledge throughout the legal\ncommunity, to educational institutions, to civic organizations and to public policy\nmakers.  We have found much serious interest in the ABF's research findings stretching\nfrom the highest levels of government (the White House) --- to sole practitioners\nin rural jurisdictions --- to civic activists in developing nations.\n\nLet me offer a very special thanks to our great staff (Kathy Pace, Tim Watson, Erin\nChristmas and Candy Khin) who are tireless in their efforts to insure the success\nof our organization and to the Foundation leadership (Judge Bernice Donald, David\nCollins, Bob Nelson and Lucinda Underwood) whose encouragement and guidance made\n this year possible.\n\nI look forward to being with you at Fellows events this year, and pledge my support\nto your exceptionally talented new officers:  Chair Kathleen Hopkins, Chair-Elect\nCara Lee Neville, and Secretary Mike Byowitz.\n\nThank you for your time, treasure, and talent.\n\nWith warmest regards,\n\nDon Slesnick\nImmediate Past Chair, Fellows\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nForward email\nhttp://ui.constantcontact.com/sa/fwtf.jsp?llr=ov98u5bab&m=1101613886126&ea=$podesta@law.georgetown.edu$&a=1118542272998\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu by fellows@abfn.org.\n\nUpdate Profile/Email Address\nhttp://visitor.constantcontact.com/do?p=oo&m=001bjL6eFYGfG1y50bUhnoXug%3D%3D&ch=d3d2f1a0-4899-11e3-ad56-d4ae5292c973&ca=05280341-758f-46fe-a287-f3fb82308509\n\n\nInstant removal with SafeUnsubscribe(TM)\nhttp://visitor.constantcontact.com/do?p=un&m=001bjL6eFYGfG1y50bUhnoXug%3D%3D&ch=d3d2f1a0-4899-11e3-ad56-d4ae5292c973&ca=05280341-758f-46fe-a287-f3fb82308509\n\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttp://ui.constantcontact.com/roving/CCPrivacyPolicy.jsp\n\nOnline Marketing by\nConstant Contact(R)\nwww.constantcontact.com\n\n\n\nThe Fellows of the American Bar Foundation | 750 North Lake Shore Drive | 4th Floor | Chicago | IL | 60611"
