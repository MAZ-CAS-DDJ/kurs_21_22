We do high risk, cutting edge work and our grantees have\nalready discovered eleven new pathways, four of which are in clinical\ntrials. We probably know more about these issues than virtually anyone.\nMore later.\n\nWe trust you're holding out OK. We're around if you want to talk.\n\n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: Daetz, Steve \nSent: Friday, November 14, 2008 10:33 AM\nTo: Marion Sandler (mos@sandlerfoundation.org); Sandler, Herbert\nSubject: Asthma -- Obama\n\n \n\nThe Obama's youngest daughter, Malia, has asthma, and Michelle Obama has\nwritten about asthma education and prevention and was previously in the\nhealth care field.  Is there something worth pursuing here?  Might\nMichelle want to take up asthma as a cause as first-lady?  Might there\nbe more receptivity to federal support for asthma research?  \n\n \n\nhttp://www.achooallergy.com/blog/obama-child-asthma/\n<http://www.achooallergy.com/blog/obama-child-asthma/> \n\n \n\nhttp://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/obama-cites-case-of-bronx-n\nursing-aide/\n<http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/obama-cites-case-of-bronx-\nnursing-aide/> \n\n \n\nSteve\n\n \n\n"
