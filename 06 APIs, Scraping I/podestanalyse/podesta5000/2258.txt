john.podesta@gmail.comb'Over the last six years, I have been on the receiving end of hundreds of White House farewell emails (none tops Alyssa\'s email with the video from Thelma and Louise going over the cliff). It always seems like an impossible task to say appropriate thank you\'s and farewells in this format. However, I will try.\n\nRight before the election in 2008 Dan Balz told a couple of us that if we won, we would all be known as "Obama people" for the rest of our lives no matter what we did. (At the age of 32, that seemed a bit extreme.) So I leave the building today, but like so many of you on this email I will be always be an "Obama person." And I couldn\'t be prouder of that fact or more gratified by the people I have gotten to work with.\n\nAfter today I can be reached at danpfeiffer2008@gmail.com<mailto:danpfeiffer2008@gmail.com>, and if you need help with White House specific business, please contact Clay Dumas (Clay_A_Dumas@who.eop.gov<mailto:Clay_A_Dumas@who.eop.gov>).\n\n'
