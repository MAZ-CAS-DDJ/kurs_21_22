Roosevelt outlined in his 1941 State of the\nUnion address \xe2\x80\x94 freedom of speech, religion, freedom from want and freedom\nfrom fear. The symbolic backdrop won out over other potential sites for\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvision\xe2\x80\x9d speech that were floated to the campaign by supporters,\nsuch as Seneca Falls, N.Y., the site of the first women\xe2\x80\x99s rights convention\nin 1848.\n\n\n\nIn announcing the venue for the much-anticipated speech, the campaign\nemphasized Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s long admiration of both Franklin and Eleanor\nRoosevelt. Clinton is expected to be joined at the kick-off speech by her\nfamily, Chelsea and Bill Clinton. It won\xe2\x80\x99t mark their first time there:\nBill Clinton was one of the speakers at the 2012 dedication ceremony of the\npark.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s New York speech will be open to the public and tickets will be\nfree, according to the campaign website. But that message came with a big\ndisclaimer: tickets do not guarantee admission and the rally will fill up\non a first-come, first-served basis. A spokesman said it was not clear yet\nhow many supporters the venue would accommodate.\n\n\n\nThe big rally will mark a break from the intimate roundtables Clinton has\nparticipated in during the first two months of her campaign. The speech\ncomes almost two months to the day after Clinton formally announced her\npresidential bid, and will be followed up by her busiest week on the trail\nyet: Clinton will fly directly to Iowa Saturday night, marking her third\nvisit there since announcing, followed by stops in New Hampshire, South\nCarolina and Nevada \xe2\x80\x94 all early states she has already visited at least\nonce during the ramp up phase of her campaign.\n\n\n\nThe Iowa organizing meeting that Clinton will participate in on Saturday\nevening will be simulcast at organizing meetings planned for nearly all of\nthe country\xe2\x80\x99s 435 congressional districts, campaign officials said.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign is already lowering expectations as they explain how the\nformer secretary of state will fight for every vote and not take the\nprimary for granted \xe2\x80\x94 even while her challengers so far remain side players\nin the 2016 drama. In Iowa, the campaign pointed out, no Democratic\npresidential candidate has ever received more than 50 percent of the caucus\nvote, unless they were a sitting president, vice-president, or Iowa Sen.\nTom Harkin, who ran in 1992. In New Hampshire, the campaign underscored, no\nDemocrat in a contested primary in the last 25 years has won by more than\n27,000 votes, or received more than 50 percent of the vote.\n\n\n\nBut the campaign is building up the rally as a dramatic beginning of a new\nphase of the campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cThousands of Americans coming together to hear\nHillary lay out her vision for the future of our country,\xe2\x80\x9d is how campaign\nchairman John Podesta described it in an email. \xe2\x80\x9cAll at one of the most\nspectacular locations you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*EXCLUSIVE: Clinton looks to the future in Pride statement\n<http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/06/01/exclusive-clinton-looks-to-the-future-in-pride-statement/#sthash.n6QIln0h.qxCmVE3D.dpuf>\n// Washington Blade // Chris Johnson \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said Monday past advances\nmade by the LGBT community should be recognized during Pride celebrations\nthis month, but noted that more work remains.\n\n\n\nIn an exclusive statement to the Washington Blade, the former secretary of\nstate recognized June as Pride month, calling for a rededication to\ncomplete the work of improving the lives of people everywhere.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEach June, we honor the contributions of the LGBTQ community and proudly\nreaffirm our commitment to ensuring that every member of the American\nfamily can live, work, and marry the person they love without enduring\ndiscrimination or prejudice,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs we celebrate the\nhard-fought progress that has been made toward advancing the rights of\nLGBTQ Americans, we must also recognize that this work is far from\nfinished. I hope that each and every one of us will dedicate ourselves to\nbuilding a future in which every person can live in dignity, free from\nviolence or fear, free to be themselves, free to live up to their God-given\npotential no matter where they live or who they are \xe2\x80\x94 this month and every\nmonth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton made the statement on the same day she issued a message via Twitter\nhinting that, like many LGBT Americans, she\xe2\x80\x99s awaiting good news from the\nSupreme Court on same-sex marriage. This month, justices are expected to\nissue a decision on whether same-sex couples have a right to marry\nnationwide.\n\n\n\nAs of the time of this posting, neither former Maryland Gov. Martin\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley nor U.S. Sen. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.) \xe2\x80\x94 other Democratic\ncandidates in the race \xe2\x80\x94 had issued statements this year recognizing June\nas Pride month, nor had any of the Republican presidential candidates.\n\n\n\nClinton, who enjoys considerable support in the LGBT community, issued the\nstatement shortly after calling on the Supreme Court to issue a nationwide\nruling in favor of same-sex marriage. She\xe2\x80\x99s also spoken out against\nreligious freedom measures in Indiana and Arkansas seen to enable\ndiscrimination against LGBT people.\n\n\n\nAmong her achievements on behalf of the LGBT community as a U.S. senator\nare advocating for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and twice voting\nagainst a U.S. constitutional amendment that would have barred same-sex\nmarriage throughout the country.\n\n\n\nDuring her tenure as secretary of state, Clinton coined the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cgay\nrights are human rights\xe2\x80\x9d during a Pride celebration at the State Department\nand delivered a high-profile speech in Geneva in favor of LGBT human rights\nacross the globe.\n\n\n\nBut Clinton didn\xe2\x80\x99t articulate support for same-sex marriage until 2013 and\nbefore that time said her position was that she opposed gay nuptials. In a\nlater interview with National Public Radio, she advocated a state-by-state\napproach to advancing marriage rights for same-sex couples. Two weeks\nbefore oral arguments at the Supreme Court, Clinton made clear she believes\nsame-sex couples should have a constitutional right to marry.\n\n\n\nAccording to a Clinton aide, staff and volunteers are set to participate in\na number of Pride events and parades throughout the country during the\nmonth of June.\n\n\n\n*Poll: New speed bumps for Clinton\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/02/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-poll-gop-field-close/>\n// CNN // Jennifer Agiesta \xe2\x80\x93 June 2, 2015*\n\n\n\nMore people have an unfavorable view of Democratic front-runner Hillary\nClinton now than at any time since 2001, according to a new CNN/ORC poll on\nthe 2016 race.\n\n\n\nWhile Clinton remains strikingly dominant in the Democratic field, the poll\nshows that her numbers have dropped significantly across several key\nindicators since she launched her campaign in April.\n\n\n\nA growing number of people say she is not honest and trustworthy (57%, up\nfrom 49% in March), less than half feel she cares about people like them\n(47%, down from 53% last July) and more now feel she does not inspire\nconfidence (50%, up from 42% last March).\n\n\n\nIn head-to-head match-ups against top Republicans, her margin is tighter\nthan it has been at any point in CNN/ORC\'s polling on the contest.\n\n\n\nOn the Republican side, though, no candidate has successfully broken out of\nthe pack.\n\n\n\nThe group of seven that have come to dominate most polling on the race hold\nthe top of the charts in this poll, Sen. Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush leading\nthe pack with Mike Huckabee, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Sen. Ted Cruz,\nBen Carson and Sen. Rand Paul all in the hunt.\n\n\n\nMuch of Clinton\'s fade is attributable to shifts among independents, but\nshe\'s also losing some ground among her own partisans. Her support in the\nDemocratic nomination contest has dropped 9 points since April, and though\nmore than 8-in-10 Democrats said they thought she was honest and\ntrustworthy earlier this year; now, just 73% say so.\n\n\n\nThe new CNN/ORC poll looking at the shape of the race for the presidency in\n2016 finds these warning signs for Clinton, alongside some concerns for the\nRepublican Party\'s best-known contender, Jeb Bush.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush\'s family ties\n\nBush\'s efforts to separate himself from his brother have worked to some\nextent. Only about half of Americans say Bush is "a lot like his brother."\n\n\n\nBut most -- 56% -- say his connection to two former presidents would make\nthem less likely to back him for the presidency. Just 27% say that\nconnection would make them more likely to back the former Florida governor.\n\n\n\nThat\'s virtually the opposite situation of what his brother faced when\nGeorge W. Bush made his initial run for the presidency in 1999. Back then,\n42% said Bush\'s connection to his father made them more likely to back him,\nwhile only 24% said it was a deterrent.\n\n\n\nBush\'s family ties are slightly more of a draw for Republicans, but not by\nmuch. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 42% say\nthey\'re more likely to back Jeb Bush because of his connections, while 38%\nsay they are less likely to vote for him because of that.\n\n\n\nNo leader emerges in the GOP pack\n\nFor the bulk of the GOP field, however, the race for the Republican\nnomination remains an effort to distinguish themselves from the pack and no\none has yet succeeded at that.\n\n\n\nThough there has been some shuffling at the top of the GOP order since the\nlast CNN/ORC poll in April, no individual candidate\'s movement lies outside\nof the margin of sampling error.\n\n\n\nRubio tops the field with 14%, with Bush near even at 13%. Huckabee and\nWalker follow at 10% each, with Cruz (8%), Paul (8%) and Carson (7%) all\nwithin striking distance of double-digit support.\n\n\n\nPaul prompts the largest gender gap on the GOP side, drawing 13% and tying\nfor first among men while garnering just 2% support among women.\n\n\n\nThe top of the field is similar among conservative Republicans to the\noverall horse race numbers, but among those who consider themselves tea\nparty supporters, there\'s a clear leader: Scott Walker with 19% support.\nHis closest competitor is Ted Cruz with 12%.\n\n\n\nOverall, about half of Republicans (49%) would like to see the field\nresolve early, saying it would be best for the party if one strong\ncandidate emerged early as a clear frontrunner. But 46% say they would\nprefer a longer campaign, with a number of strong contenders competing over\nthe next year.\n\n\n\nOne possible differentiator emerges: The poll finds a distinct difference\nin which candidates Republicans view as representing the future rather than\nthe past.\n\n\n\nThree-quarters of Republicans describe Marco Rubio (77%) or Scott Walker\n(75%) as representing the future, nearly 7-in-10 say so about Rand Paul\n(68%), but Bush (51%) and Christie (51%) are far less likely to be seen as\nrepresentative of the future.\n\n\n\nThe growing Democratic field\n\nDemocrats are more likely than Republicans to say they would like a\ncompetitive primary (53% say that would be best for the party), but their\npreferences so far don\'t portend a close contest.\n\n\n\nClinton continues to hold a massive lead in that race, with 60% of\nDemocrats saying she would be their top choice for the nomination. Behind\nher, 14% would favor Vice President Joe Biden, and 10% prefer Vermont Sen.\nBernie Sanders.\n\n\n\nMartin O\'Malley, the former Maryland governor who announced his candidacy\non Saturday, barely registers with 1% support.\n\n\n\nSanders does fare better among liberals than overall, carrying 18% support\namong that group, but Clinton still notches 61% among the liberals in her\nparty.\n\n\n\nGetting closer to the general\n\nIn general election match-ups, Clinton now runs about even with Rand Paul,\nScott Walker and Marco Rubio, while she continues to top Bush and Ted Cruz\nby a significant margin.\n\n\n\nAs noted above, those shifts stem largely from a change among independents,\nthough Republicans appear to be solidifying their support for GOP\ncandidates while Democrats are slightly less certain about Clinton.\n\n\n\nOne feature of the race that has held even as the numbers shifted: These\nmatch-ups prompt enormous gender gaps. According to the poll, the gender\ngaps remain over 20 points in each of the five match-ups tested, including\na whopping 34-point gender gap in Clinton\'s match-up with Scott Walker.\n\n\n\nHer declining support in those general election match-ups, alongside\nfalling favorability ratings and worsening impressions of her, suggests\nrecent news about her actions as secretary of state may have taken a toll.\n\n\n\nThough most -- 61% -- think the release of Clinton\'s emails over the next\nmonths from her time as secretary of state will not reveal any previously\nhidden wrongdoing, the poll also finds 58% are dissatisfied with the way\nshe handled the attack in Benghazi in 2012.\n\n\n\nA narrow majority feel the Republican-led congressional hearings on the\nattack have been handled appropriately, just 41% say the GOP has gone too\nfar with them.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s family ties to a president are more of a wash than Bush\'s. While\n39% say her marriage to Bill Clinton makes them more likely to vote for\nher, the same share say it\'s a turn-off. And most Americans say Clinton is\nnot like her husband at all (54%).\n\n\n\nThe CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone May 29-31, among a random\nnational sample of 1,025 adults. The margin of sampling error for results\namong the full sample is plus or minus 3 percentage points. It is 4.5\npoints for results among the 433 Democrats and Democratic-leaning\nindependents and the 483 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.\n\n\n\n*Republican Lindsey Graham Announces 2016 Presidential Campaign\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-01/republican-lindsey-graham-announces-2016-presidential-campaign>\n// Bloomberg // David Weigel \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham announced his campaign for president on Monday,\nemphasizing his centrist challenge to the Republican Party\'s base.\n\n\n\n"I intend to be president not of a single party, but of a nation," Graham\nsaid in a speech in his hometown of Central, S.C. "I want to do more than\nmake big government smaller. I want to help make a great nation greater."\n\n\n\nGraham\'s speech finishes a months-long exploratory process, one that found\nthe Republican bantering with town hall audiences and baiting rivals into\nfights on foreign policy and immigration. Polling in single digits, joking\nabout his chances, Graham combines the candor of a dark-horse candidate\nwith the media profile of a front-runner.\n\n\n\nHe left little doubt as to his intentions during a May interview on CBS\nThis Morning: "I\'m running because I think the world is falling apart. I\'ve\nbeen more right than wrong on foreign policy," he said.\n\n\n\nGraham, 59, joins three younger Senate colleagues\xe2\x80\x94Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand\nPaul of Kentucky, and Marco Rubio of Florida\xe2\x80\x94in the Republican nomination\nfight. (Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is seeking the Democratic\nnomination.) Elected in 2002 to replace the retiring Strom Thurmond, and\npreviously elected to four terms in the House of Representatives, he is\nlikely to have the longest Washington resume of anyone on the Republican\nstage.\n\n\n\nHe\'s also the only declared candidate with a military record, having been a\njudge advocate in the United States Air Force since 1982. Last week he\nannounced he would leave the reserves as he reaches the mandatory\nretirement age of 60 this summer.\n\n\n\nSince the January launch of his exploratory committee, Security Through\nStrength, the possibility of a Graham bid has been a puzzle. His is a\nresume not calculated to appeal to Republican primary voters. Graham\'s\nearly Washington career was defined by the impeachment of President Bill\nClinton, a case on which he served as a prosecutor, which quickly came to\nlook like a debacle for Republicans. In the Senate, he\'s advocated for an\naggressive foreign policy and strong security state even as his party\'s\nlibertarian tendency has grown. And every time legislation to change\nimmigration policy moved in the Senate, Graham was a co-sponsor.\n\n\n\n"We are going to solve this problem," he told the National Council of La\nRaza in a 2007 speech. We\'re not going to run people down. We\'re not going\nto scapegoat people. We\'re going to tell the bigots to shut up."\n\n\n\nTalk like that infuriated conservatives. In 2008 and 2014, Graham\'s enemies\nsearched for credible primary challengers. Both times, they came up far\nshort, and convinced Graham that the fringe could bark but not bite. In\n2010, he predicted that the Tea Party would "die out." After securing his\n2014 victory, he seemed to be proven right.\n\n\n\n"There\'s a growing element in our party that would like me to speak up,"\nGraham said earlier this year in an interview. "Where is the Republican\nParty on problem solving? Is there a rational way forward on immigration?\nDo you deport 11 million people? I don\'t think so."\n\n\n\nWry and affable, Graham\'s approach to presidential politicking owes much to\nhis friend and mentor John McCain. In 2000 and 2008, Graham campaigned hard\nfor the Arizona senator, who was running for president. In the Capitol,\nboth men share an open-door approach to the media and a hunger for deals\nwith Democrats. Graham shares McCain\'s readiness with a joke and talent for\nTV debate.\n\n\n\n"In debates, he\'ll shred \'em," McCain said when Graham announced his\nexploratory committee. "He has my all-out complete support."\n\n\n\nGraham may be kept out of the first Fox News debate, in August, which the\nnetwork intends to limit to the top 10 candidates according to national\npublic polling. Despite his steady presence in green rooms, Graham\'s\nfocusing more on the New Hampshire primary than any "national" race. Like\nMcCain, Graham is looking to prove that he can reason with the Republican\nprimary electorate one room at a time. Alone among the candidates, he\nfavors laws that would limit campaign spending\xe2\x80\x93an issue that boosted McCain\nin 2000.\n\n\n\nWhen challenged on immigration, he enters into a Socratic dialogue with\naudiences, to convince them that reform and pathways to citizenship are\nsensible but not amnesty.\n\n\n\nAnd like McCain, Graham is a hawk whose confidence is not dimmed by events.\n"I think the world is falling apart," he often says, "and I\'ve been right\nmore than wrong." Graham supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2007\nmilitary surge, and has insisted that the conflict was won, a victory\nsquandered by Barack Obama. He favored a more muscular intervention in\nLibya than the no-fly zone favored by the Obama administration, and favored\nan early military intervention on the side of Syria\'s rebels.\n\n\n\nGraham\'s foreign policy contrasts completely with that of Rand Paul, and\nthe two men have sparred across the primary states. Paul tends to avoid\nusing Graham\'s name when he refers to "a senator" who favors NSA\nsurveillance and treating captured terrorists as enemy combatants. Graham\nhas no such filter, and has said that Paul "would have the worst chance of\nanybody to make a case against Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy."\n\n\n\nThat confidence grows out of a personal story that Graham has become more\ncomfortable telling on the trail. Born in Central, near Greenville, he\nworked at a pool hall and was compelled at an early age to take care of his\nyounger sister. "My mom\'s disease, Hodgkin\'s disease, wiped us out\nfinancially," Graham told Fox News in April. "We eventually lost our\nbusinesses. I understand we\'re all one car wreck from needing help. But\nwhat it told Lindsey Graham, above all else, is that family, friends and\nfaith really do matter."\n\n\n\nIn politics, since winning a state legislative seat in 1992, Graham has\ndefended the existence of the welfare state while arguing for reform.\nRaising the Social Security retirement age, like an immigration overhaul\nand foreign policy, has been a focus of Graham\'s early pitch. He starts\nwith less support than McCain\xe2\x80\x93but unlike the Arizonan, he hails from one of\nthe GOP\'s vital early primary states.\n\n\n\n"Get ready," Graham told a dinner audience in his native South Carolina\nlast month. "Get ready for a debate that\'s been long overdue within the\nparty. Get ready for a voice that understands you can\'t save America\nwithout someone willing to sacrifice and die for America."\n\n\n\nGraham holds undergraduate and law degrees from the University of South\nCarolina. On Sunday, while the Senate debated the Patriot Act, he\nofficially retired from the Air Force reserves, which he joined while\nattending school and caring for his sister in the absence of his late\nparents.\n\n\n\n"There are a lot of so-called \'self-made\' people in this world," Graham\nplanned to say in Central. "I\'m not one of them. My family, friends,\nneighbors, and my faith picked me up when I was down, believed in me when I\nhad doubts. You made me the man I am today."\n\n\n\n*SOCIAL MEDIA*\n\n\n\n*David Axelrod (5/31/15, 8:23 AM)*\n<https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/605031777267290113>* - O\'Malley is\na dynamic, accomplished guy.

It was reported in\nthe blog of Rick Hasen, an election law expert who works at the University\nof California, Irvine.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis lawsuit concerns the most fundamental of rights guaranteed citizens\nin our representative democracy \xe2\x80\x94 the right to vote,\xe2\x80\x9d the complaint states,\nthen refers to a curtailing of early voting in the state, among other\nchanges that affect minority voters and other groups. \xe2\x80\x9cThat right has been\nunder attack in Wisconsin since Republicans gained control of the\ngovernor\xe2\x80\x99s office and both houses of the State Legislature in the 2010\nelection.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s aides said the suit was not filed on behalf of the campaign,\nbut they offered their support for it.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are aware of it and strongly support its goal of ensuring the right to\nvote is not unduly burdened,\xe2\x80\x9d Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton,\nsaid in a statement.\n\n\n\nMr. Elias filed a similar lawsuit in Ohio recently, accusing the state of\ntrying to suppress the votes of traditional Democratic constituencies like\nblacks, Hispanics and young people.\n\n\n\nMr. Walker, as he travels around the country, often talks about his efforts\nto push through changes in the voting rights laws to require people to\nbring identification to the polls.\n\n\n\n*Journalists Meet To Discuss Frustration With Clinton Campaign\'s Control\nOver Access And Information\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/01/journalists-clinton-campaign_n_7487076.html?1433194660>\n// HuffPo // Michael Calderone \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nNEW YORK -- Journalists covering Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign\nmet for nearly two hours in Washington on Monday to discuss concerns about\nwhat they believe is inadequate access to cover the Democratic\nfront-runner, according to people who attended.\n\n\n\nThe grievances discussed at the private gathering, which was held at the\nLos Angeles Times/Tribune Washington offices, go beyond Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nunwillingness so far to substantively engage with the press, a topic that\nhas already been discussed publicly on cable news and social media.\nAttendees of the meeting, who were not authorized by their news\norganizations to speak on the record, charge the Clinton campaign with\nkeeping an excessively tight grip on information, even when it comes to\nlogistical details that don\'t seem particularly sensitive or revelatory.\n\n\n\nAmong the problems discussed were the campaign\'s failure to provide\nadequate notice prior to events, the lack of a clear standard for whether\nfundraisers are open or closed press and the reflexive tendency to opt to\nspeak anonymously. The complaints mirror concerns that a number of\npolitical journalists have also raised in recent conversations with The\nHuffington Post.\n\n\n\nWhile the White House Correspondents\' Association has worked for greater\nmedia access for over a century and elects representatives to present the\ngroup\'s concerns to the administration, there isn\'t any comparable,\nestablished body working on behalf of the campaign press. Monday\'s meeting,\nwhich included about 17 journalists from outlets such as The New York\nTimes, The Washington Post, Politico, Time and McClatchy, was an attempt\nnot only to discuss such concerns, but eventually to present them to the\ncampaign in a unified way.\n\n\n\nAttendees discussed the feeling that the campaign hasn\'t provided enough\nnotice for events, resulting in logistical difficulties for those trying to\ncover them. It\xe2\x80\x99s still too early in the election cycle for the campaign to\nbe chartering the flights and buses that news organizations, at the cost of\nthousands of dollars, can sign up for to follow the candidate from stop to\nstop. For now, reporters are booking commercial flights to reach Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nevents, and networks need to make sure satellite trucks and camera\nequipment make it there on time. The group discussed urging the Clinton\ncampaign to provide information outlining the upcoming week so they can\nplan accordingly.\n\n\n\nAnother concern raised, according to attendees, was that the campaign had\ninitially said that fundraisers of more than 100 people would be open to\nthe press through a pool system. Under this arrangement, certain reporters\nare designated to cover events that cannot accommodate large numbers of\njournalists, and those reporters then provide information to the larger\npress corps. But recent Clinton fundraisers have been closed press.\n\n\n\nMeeting attendees also expressed dissatisfaction with the ground rules\nestablished for a Thursday briefing at the campaign\'s Brooklyn headquarters\nthat was attended by dozens of news outlets, including The Huffington Post.\n\n\n\nCNBC\xe2\x80\x99s John Harwood wrote Friday that reporters who attended the briefing\nwere not allowed to quote top campaign officials directly, even when it\ncame to information that appeared to be basic talking points. Harwood noted\nthat he could not show readers what campaign staffers\xe2\x80\x99 desks looked like\nbecause \xe2\x80\x9cthe post-briefing tour was deemed off-the-record.\xe2\x80\x9d (A week\nearlier, the Nashua Telegraph, a New Hampshire newspaper, similarly mocked\nthe Clinton campaign for holding a conference call in which mundane\ninformation was provided under ground rules that those speaking should not\nbe quoted.)\n\n\n\nCoincidentally, Monday\'s meeting wrapped up just before the campaign sent a\nmass email to journalists with details of an upcoming event. The campaign\nsaid the details could only be attributed to a \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign official,\xe2\x80\x9d which\nprompted New York Times reporter Adam Nagourney to out the sender on\nTwitter. Such rules for anonymity, Nagourney noted, are not done\nunilaterally but established between two parties. He also pointed out that\nthe information itself didn\'t "rise to [the] level" of requiring anonymity.\n\n\n\nThere was a general consensus at Monday\'s meeting that the ground rules for\nthe Thursday headquarters briefing were unacceptable. Attendees say they\nexpected that the group will urge the campaign to agree that similar\nbriefings need to be on the record in the future.\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the reporters\' complaints and how the campaign is\nreacting, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill responded in an email to HuffPost.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d say two things,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst, we want a happy press corps as much\nas the press corps does. Not in an effort to obtain favorable coverage, but\nbecause we\'re decent humans who want people to be able to plan their lives.\nIt\'s a long campaign, and we are going to do our best to find equilibrium.\nGriping on background is not a constructive solution though, and I can\'t\nhelp but point out the irony here."\n\n\n\nThe group also discussed its system for disseminating pool reports, which\nThe Washington Post criticized Friday for turning some reporters "into\nsecond-class journalists in the hunt for Clinton info.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe pool system, established at the urging of the Clinton campaign but run\nby campaign reporters, places journalists on a rotation and disseminates\nreports in real-time to fourteen news organizations. Those organizations,\nwhich do not bear the costs of being in the pool, receive the reports at\nthe end of the day.\n\n\n\nThough the Post put forth the idea of the system creating two classes of\nreporters, attendees at Monday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting stressed that the system allows\nfor wider dissemination of traveling pool reports than was possible during\nMitt Romney\'s campaign four years ago. At that time, only reporters\nphysically present for Romney campaign trips received pool reports, and\nthere was no wider dissemination to news organizations not in the rotation.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton Focuses on Drug Addiction After Learning Scale of Problem\n<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/01/hillary-clinton-focuses-on-drug-addiction-after-learning-scale-of-problem/>\n// NYT // Amy Chozick \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s carefully choreographed round-table discussions\nwith voters don\xe2\x80\x99t lead to many moments of surprise. But Mrs. Clinton has\nseemed to have had some legitimate jolts when conversations in Iowa and New\nHampshire repeatedly drifted back to drug abuse.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton called heroin and methamphetamine addiction in rural America a\n\xe2\x80\x9cquiet epidemic\xe2\x80\x9d and told her policy advisers in Brooklyn to put it on the\nlist of priorities as her campaign inched closer toward presenting a\nspecific policy platform.\n\n\n\nAs part of that effort, last week senior campaign policy advisers held\nGoogle Hangout discussions with local officials and substance abuse\nactivists in Iowa and New Hampshire to see how the campaign could best\naddress the problem, the first of such discussions that will take place in\nthe early nominating states, according to the campaign.\n\n\n\nIn the six years Mrs. Clinton has been mostly out of the discussion on\ndomestic policies, heroin use has swept rural communities, and although\naides say she was aware of problem in an abstract way, from reading policy\nbriefings and talking to academics and advisers, her discussions with\nvoters on the issue were particularly eye opening.\n\n\n\nShe instructed her policy team \xe2\x80\x9cto go beyond standard policies and really\ntake a hard look at some of the more creative or forward-looking policy\npositions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jake Sullivan, the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s senior policy director.\n\n\n\nThe Google Hangouts, led by the senior policy advisers Ann O\xe2\x80\x99Leary and Maya\nHarris, are part of that effort. Moving forward, drug addiction, according\nto aides, will be a central part of the \xe2\x80\x9cfour fights\xe2\x80\x9d that Mrs. Clinton\nroutinely references in her prepared remarks.\n\n\n\nParticipants in the hangouts included Candace Accord, of the Community\nBased Correctional Facility in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Abigail Shockley,\nexecutive director of the New Hampshire Alcohol and Other Drug Service\nProvider Association, among other local community leaders and elected\nofficials.\n\n\n\nBased on their suggestions, Mrs. Clinton is likely to propose\nbetter-financed prevention and treatment options before criminalization and\nbetter access to mental health services (an area that aides and voters have\nsaid is lacking under the Affordable Care Act). She has already called for\nreform to the criminal justice system and a prison system overflowing with\nlow-level drug offenders.\n\n\n\nDrug abuse has not been a central campaign issue since the 1980s and early\n1990s, when crime was on the rise and the crack cocaine epidemic threatened\nAmerican cities. Candidates, particularly Republicans, and the more\ncentrist-minded Bill Clinton were elected by vowing to be tough on drugs.\nUnder President Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s administration, drug offenders received\nstiffer penalties under federal law.\n\n\n\nIn the 2016 election, Mrs. Clinton enters a very different situation, in\nwhich rural areas, like the ones she has visited in Iowa and New Hampshire,\nare seeing an increase in addiction. She is expected to present more\nspecific policy proposals after her campaign\xe2\x80\x99s official kickoff event on\nJune 13.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have an increasing problem that is only beginning to break through the\nsurface so that people \xe2\x80\x93 I think a lot of people are thinking, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s\nsomebody else\xe2\x80\x99s problem, that\xe2\x80\x99s not my problem,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Clinton has said.\n\n\n\n*It\'s time for the media to admit that Hillary Clinton is popular\n<http://www.vox.com/2015/6/1/8676727/hillary-clinton-popularity> // Vox //\nMatthew Yglesias \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nQuinnipiac is out with a new poll that confirms something the national\nmedia is loathe to admit and essentially never surfaces in their coverage\nof one of the most-covered people in the world today: Hillary Clinton is\nthe most popular politician in America.\n\n\n\nIt would be genuinely silly to think that her early leads in general\nelection polling tell us anything interesting about what will happen in\nNovember 2016. But they tell us a lot about how people feel in May 2015,\nand the way they feel is pretty good about Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nAccording to Gallup, for example, she is the most admired woman in the\nworld. What\'s more, she has been the most admired woman in the world for 17\nout of the past 18 years.\n\n\n\nJournalists don\'t like Hillary Clinton\n\n\n\nBut the press hates to admit this. For Clinton, good news is never just\ngood news. Instead it\'s an opportunity to remind the public about the\nmedia\'s negative narratives about Clinton and then to muse on the fact that\nher ratings somehow manage to hold up despite these narratives.\n\n\n\nHere\'s how the Wall Street Journal wrote up an earlier poll showing Clinton\nbeating all opponents:\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\'s stature has been battered after more than a month of\ncontroversy over her fundraising and email practices, but support for her\namong Democrats remains strong and unshaken, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC\nNews poll finds.\n\n\n\nAnd here\'s how the New York Times wrote up yet another poll showing Clinton\nbeating all opponents:\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton appears to have initially weathered a barrage of\nnews about her use of a private email account when she was secretary of\nstate and the practices of her family\'s foundation, an indication that she\nis starting her second presidential bid with an unusual durability among\nDemocratic voters.\n\n\n\nThis framing is not surprising, since, among journalists, Clinton is one of\nthe least popular politicians. She is not forthcoming or entertaining with\nthe press. She doesn\'t offer good quotes. She doesn\'t like journalists,\nrespect what we do, or care to hide her disdain for the media. She feels\nthat the right-wing press has tried to destroy her for decades, that the\nmainstream press got played like a cheap fiddle by the conservative press,\nand that even the liberal press was overwhelmingly hostile to her during\nher 2008 campaign.\n\n\n\nThe public also hates journalists\n\n\n\nJournalists are obviously free to dislike politicians who are uncooperative\nwith the press, and to celebrate those who embrace a more freewheeling\nmedia-friendly style. But reporters all-too-often confused the conventional\nwisdom of the journo-pack with the opinions of actual voters.\n\n\n\nThe reality is that Clinton\'s disdain for the press is largely shared by\nthe public, which does not think journalists are credible or contribute to\nsociety\'s well-being.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, most of the "bad" narratives about both Clintons that\nexist in the media are essentially self-centered. From an impeachment\ngrounded in Bill\'s effort to keep an extra-marital affair out of the\nnewspapers to a scandal about an email server designed to keep the contents\nof Hillary\'s messages out of the newspapers, the Clintons have continually\nrun afoul of the press\' fervent desire to know everything.\n\n\n\nBut few regular people evaluate public figures on the basis of their level\nof cooperation with media inquiries. Clinton\'s brand of cautious\ncenter-left politics and her genuine passion for trying to bring people\ntogether and make deals more-or-less reflects what the public wants from a\npolitician.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton Still Strong in Iowa Poll, Though Negative News Is a\nConcern\n<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/01/hillary-clinton-still-strong-in-iowa-poll-though-negative-news-is-a-concern/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog%20Main&contentCollection=Politics&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body>\n// NYT // Trip Gabriel \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton continues to command a sizable lead in a poll\nreleased on Monday of Iowa Democrats, who will cast the first votes of the\npresidential nominating race early next year. At the same time, Democrats\nare worried that revelations about Mrs. Clinton could hurt her in the\ngeneral election.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton is the choice of 57 percent of likely Democratic Iowa\ncaucusgoers, followed by 16 percent for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont\nand 2 percent for former Gov. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley of Maryland. Vice President\nJoseph R. Biden Jr., who has shown little interest in running, received 8\npercent.\n\n\n\nThe poll was conducted for The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics\nfrom May 25 to 29. Mr. Sanders, who drew large crowds in the state during\nthe end of that period, was up from 5 percent in a January survey by the\nsame pollsters. He has inherited the support of his party\xe2\x80\x99s most liberal\nwing that once favored Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who was\nnot included in the poll after repeatedly saying she was not a candidate.\n\n\n\nMr. Sanders or Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, who officially entered the race on Saturday\nand is also carving out a lane to the left of Mrs. Clinton, seem to have\nroom to grow: 37 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers said their\npolitical beliefs were closer to Ms. Warren\xe2\x80\x99s than Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\n\n\nSupport for Mrs. Clinton stayed steady since the earlier Iowa poll in\nJanuary. It showed no softening despite the continuing spate of negative\nnews accounts of foreign donations to her family foundation while she was\nsecretary of state, her use of a private email account in office, and a\nRepublican-led investigation of her handling of the attacks in Benghazi,\nLibya.\n\n\n\nBut 66 percent of Democrats said that at least one of those issues will\nhurt Mrs. Clinton in the general election if she is the nominee.\n\n\n\n*Here\xe2\x80\x99s the best news for Hillary Clinton in that new Iowa poll\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/06/01/heres-the-best-news-in-that-new-iowa-poll-for-hillary-clinton/>\n// WaPo// Chris Cillizza \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nIt\'s not been a very good last month for Hillary Clinton\'s presidential\ncampaign. She\'s been dogged by questions regarding donations made to the\nClinton Foundation, bad publicity surrounding the release of her State\nDepartment e-mails and a continued unwillingness to engage the media.\n\n\n\nDoesn\'t matter! That\'s according to a new Des Moines Register/Bloomberg\npoll of Iowa Democratic caucus-goers, who in large majorities believe the\nClintons are getting a raw deal in all of this. Seven in ten respondents\n(71 percent) said that regarding the "controversies surrounding Bill and\nHillary Clinton," the couple is getting a "bad rap." Just 14 percent said\nthe controversies were indicative of a "pattern of unethical behavior" by\nthe former first couple.\n\n\n\nYes, these are Democrats. And Iowa Democrats, as we\'ve learned over the\npast decade or so, are on the liberal side of the ledger.  So if anyone was\ngoing to rally to Clinton\'s side against the perceived attacks of\nRepublicans and the mainstream media, it\'s true believers like the ones\ntested in the DMR poll.\n\n\n\nStill, the fact that there is a widespread belief that things like the\nprivate e-mail server or the donors to the Clinton Foundation are trumped\nup is extremely good news for Clinton.\n\n\n\nThe key for Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 in both the primary and, to a certain extent, the\ngeneral election \xe2\x80\x94 is to rally Democrats, especially liberal Democrats, to\nher cause. In the early days of her presidential campaign, she has staked\nout decidedly liberal positions on hot-button issues like immigration and\nincome inequality. But oftentimes, the best way to convince people you are\none of them is to come under attack from enemies of those people. (Enemy of\nmy enemy and all that.) And Republicans and, increasingly, the media, are\nvery much enemies in the eyes of dyed-in-the-wool liberals.\n\n\n\nIf liberals \xe2\x80\x94 like those in Iowa \xe2\x80\x94 continue to see stories about the e-mail\nserver and the Clinton Foundation as part of a broader witch hunt against\nClinton being organized by her political enemies and reporters with an ax\nto grind, that\'s a best-case scenario for the former secretary of state.\nWhy? Because with every report on her e-mails or her donors, it affirms the\nsense within her liberal base that she\'s being unfairly maligned.  The more\nthe merrier, from Clinton\'s point of view.\n\n\n\nThe alternate reality is that these scads of stories raise doubts about\nClinton\'s ability to win next November and, as a result, people begin to\nshop for a different candidate. While there is some evidence that\nDemocratic voters are slightly worried about that possibility (four in ten\nDemocrats in the DMR poll say that keeping a private e-mail server will\nhurt Clinton in the general election), they remain largely united behind\nher.\n\n\n\nThe more Clinton can turn the negative storylines around her into an "us\nversus them" (no matter who the "them" really entails) conversation, the\nbetter for her chances.\n\n\n\n*Meet the woman behind Hillary Clinton\'s Twitter account\n<http://fortune.com/2015/06/01/meet-the-woman-behind-hillary-clintons-twitter-account/>\n// Fortune // Nina Easton \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nKatie Dowd is the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s digital director, in charge of putting the\nswagger in Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter\xe2\x80\x93not to mention Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr and\nall the rest.\n\n\n\nWith many of the power players from Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 presidential run\nare sitting this one out, the big question is: Who\xe2\x80\x99s in?\n\n\n\nWhat follows is the latest installment of a Fortune series looking at the\nthe most influential women on Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 team. When this series wraps,\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll turn our attention to the most powerful women on the GOP side of the\nrace.\n\n\n\nKatie Dowd may be in charge of the Clinton campaign\xe2\x80\x99s digital strategy, but\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s not all about pixels. Indeed, Dowd is a self-described \xe2\x80\x9cpeople\ngeek\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a sociology major drawn to politics because she\xe2\x80\x99s interested in\nunderstanding what makes people tick. After graduating from Illinois\xe2\x80\x99\nWittenberg University, she headed to D.C. and wound up working for a direct\nmail firm, learning old-style political persuasion that would later become\nuseful in the exploding universe of social media. She worked at the two\norganizations charged with electing Democratic members of Congress\xe2\x80\x94the\nDemocratic Senate Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional\nCampaign Committee.\n\n\n\nMost recently, Dowd worked on a State Department project called TechCamp,\nwhich helped civil society groups around the globe harness web tools for\nsocial action. A prime example: The Lithuanian activist who wanted to make\nthe buildings in his town wheelchair accessible. Through TechCamp, he was\nable to use Google Maps to \xe2\x80\x9ctag\xe2\x80\x9d buildings and prove to authorities that\nphysically disabled residents were being excluded. Before this project,\nDowd worked on STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) issues as\nsenior adviser to the chief technology officer at the White House.\n\n\n\nWhen Dowd started out in political campaigns a decade ago, early engagement\nwith voters was mostly an exercise in fund-raising; operatives viewed the\nInternet as an ATM machine. That has changed dramatically. Now, engaging\nvoters online means a lot more than asking them to write checks. On the\nDemocratic side, the presidential campaigns of Howard Dean and John Kerry\nset the bar for using the web to create a grassroots network of passionate\nvoters\xe2\x80\x93a trend that Obama all but perfected in 2008. When Dowd was part of\nthe 2008 Clinton campaign, the team experimented with new digital\ntechniques, like enabling volunteers to make internet calls to fellow\nvoters from their own homes.\n\n\n\nThis time around it\xe2\x80\x99s a far bigger, more complicated ball game. Dowd and\nher staff (likely to grow to 150) will have to manage a range platforms,\nfrom Twitter and FaceBook to Instagram, Tumblr, Pintrest\xe2\x80\x94and likely other\nemerging networks we haven\xe2\x80\x99t even heard of yet. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to think about\nwhere the audiences are,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dowd. Real-time video platforms like Meerkat\nand Periscope will change how campaigns operate. In the 2016 race, says\nDowd, the focus will be on \xe2\x80\x9cletting people feel like they are part of the\nreal-time movement of a campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd of course, there is the low-tech, but essential challenge: How to give\nvoters a lasting personal connection to Hillary connection. Already, Dowd\nhas helped craft the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s famous Twitter bio: Wife, mom, grandma,\nwomen+kids advocate, FLOTUS, Senator, SecState, hair icon, pantsuit\naficionado, 2016 presidential candidate.\n\n\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s her next move?

The rally\nwill be followed in the subsequent week by a blitz of the four first\nprimary states, according to spokesman Jesse Ferguson.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer speech will lay out her view of the challenges facing this country and\nher vision and ideas for moving the country forward,\xe2\x80\x9d Ferguson said.\n\n\n\nThe rally on Roosevelt Island marks a shift away from a deliberately\nlow-key rollout intended to take the edge off what both Democrats and\nRepublicans had regarded as a steamroller to the 2016 nomination. The event\nwill also include the first campaign appearances by her husband, former\npresident Bill Clinton, and their daughter, Chelsea Clinton.\n\n\n\nThe choice of Roosevelt Island is a nod both to Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s adopted\nhome state of New York and her longtime admiration of Franklin Delano\nRoosevelt-style government and ideals. She has often invoked the\nDepression-era president in speeches, and she cites Eleanor Roosevelt as a\nrole model for her own public service.\n\n\n\nIn a memo Monday, Ferguson noted that no Democratic candidates have\nsurpassed 50 percent in the Iowa caucuses unless they were a sitting\npresident, vice president or Iowa senator; similarly, he wrote, no Democrat\nhas received more than half the vote in a contested primary in New\nHampshire.\n\n\n\nClinton will travel to Iowa immediately after the New York rally for a\nmeeting with organizers that night. Her address to that meeting will be\nsimulcast to similar meetings across the country, the campaign said.\n\n\n\nClinton will campaign in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada\nthat week.\n\n\n\nShe is expected to do her first media interviews about the same time.\nClinton has briefly responded to some questions from reporters traveling\nwith her since the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s launch but has held no formal news conference.\n\n\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement\nthat Clinton should answer questions about foreign donations to her\nfamily\xe2\x80\x99s foundation and her use of a private e-mail server while she was\nsecretary of state.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter dodging questions for months, she should take this opportunity to\nfinally come clean and discuss the issues important to everyday Americans,\xe2\x80\x9d\nPriebus said.\n\n\n\n*Clinton campaign emails Ready for Hillary list\n<http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2015/05/8569107/clinton-campaign-emails-ready-hillary-list>\n// Capital NY \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nThe Clinton campaign has sent its first email to the Ready for Hillary\nsupporter list after obtaining access to it last week.\n\n\n\nPolitico reported Saturday that the campaign obtained the list of almost\nfour million contacts through a swap with another independent group a\nDemocratic source would not identify.\n\nCapital reported in April that Emily\'s List, which took over Ready for\nHillary\'s social media accounts, had begun emailing the Ready for Hillary\nlist in March. It has continued to do so through May.\n\nPolitico reported Saturday that the campaign has not had access to the\nReady for Hillary list in the first six weeks of its campaign as lawyers\nwere working out what the best option would be for the campaign to receive\naccess to the independent super PAC\'s list. Until now, Politico reported,\nin addition to signing up its own supporters, campaign staffers were\nworking with a list of old 2008-era supporters that was often unproductive.\n\n\n\nAs Politico noted, Ready for Hillary had also sent out several e-mails\nafter the Clinton campaign\'s official launch urging supporters to sign up.\n\n\n\nIn the email Sunday, with the subject line"Ready for your free sticker?,"\nRobby Mook, campaign manager for the Clinton campaign, writes that "You and\nI have something in common: We\xe2\x80\x99ve both been ready for Hillary for a long\ntime."

"The concern is that the Clinton campaign is getting a list of\ntremendous value and paying little or nothing for it."\n\n\n\nWhitaker said his group had long suspected Ready for Hillary was preparing\nto transfer the email list to Clinton\'s campaign.\n\n\n\n"If the campaign swapped lists with the super PAC, what value would a list\nhave to a closing super PAC?" Whitaker said. "Right now, we do not know who\nthe Clinton campaign swapped lists with or how, if not the super PAC, that\ngroup got the lists."\n\n\n\nReady for Hillary reportedly began to shutter its operations in April.\n\n\n\nThe super PAC survived an FEC review earlier this year after an\nanti-Clinton group complained about Ready for Hillary\'s decision to rent an\nemail list from the candidate-in-waiting\'s prior Senate race.\n\n\n\nThe commission had an "insufficient number of votes" to find the super PAC\nin violation of a number of campaign laws and dismissed outright several\nother allegations, including that Ready for Hillary had sent an email to\nsupporters in January 2014 that was authorized by Clinton herself.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton to Rally in New York, Then Tour Early Voting States\n<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/01/hillary-clinton-to-rally-in-new-york-then-tour-early-voting-states/>\n// NYT // Amy Chozick \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton will hold the first major rally of her presidential\ncampaign on June 13 on Roosevelt Island in New York City, before embarking\non a five-day swing through the four states with the earliest Democratic\nnominating contests, her campaign said on Monday.\n\n\n\nIn a midday speech at Four Freedoms Park \xe2\x80\x94 a memorial to Franklin D.\nRoosevelt, for whom the East River island is named \xe2\x80\x94 Mrs. Clinton will\nsketch out her view of the problems facing the nation and her \xe2\x80\x9cvision and\nideas\xe2\x80\x9d for how to move the country forward, a top spokesman, Jesse\nFerguson, said in an email to reporters that also noted Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nadmiration for both F.D.R. and Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\n\n\n>From New York, she will travel to Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and\nNevada.\n\n\n\nIn the email, Mr. Ferguson also sought to lower expectations for Mrs.\nClinton in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park, which belatedly opened in\n2012, four decades after architect Louis Kahn first began designing the\nmemorial to the former president.\n\n\n\nClinton can count on an impressive backdrop of the skyscrapers of Midtown\nManhattan as she gives what her campaign says will be her fullest\nexplanation yet of why she should be elected president next year.  How a\ncrowd of thousands might reach the island is less clear at this point \xe2\x80\x93 it\nhas a single subway station that rarely deals with large crowds, and a tram\ncar system, memorably featured in the climactic battle scene in the 2002\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpider-Man\xe2\x80\x9d film, that can deliver about 100 people to the island at a\ntime. There is also a small bridge connecting the mostly car-free island to\nthe borough of Queens.\n\n\n\nClinton, who moved to New York in 1999 ahead of a successful run to become\na Democratic U.S. senator for the state, picked the park in part because\nshe said she was inspired by Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s presidency and considered his\nwife, Eleanor Roosevelt, a role model, according to the announcement email.\nWhen she last ran for president in 2007, she held her first rally at school\ngym in Des Moines, Iowa, a few days after her initial announcement. This\ntime around, Clinton has been an announced candidate for about seven weeks,\nbut has only held small events with little or no access for the general\npublic.\n\n\n\nThe hospitals and prisons that once made the island infamous have long been\nreplaced by small clusters of middle-class housing, popular with people who\nwork at the United Nations headquarters just across the water. Although\nClinton is yet to discuss much in the way of specific policies, she has\nsaid she is concerned both about reducing the number of people the U.S.\nsends to prison and making it easier for people with mental health problems\nto get treatment. Given the setting of her rally, Clinton may be tempted to\ninvoke the work of Nellie Bly, the celebrated journalist whose 1887 book\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen Days in a Mad-House\xe2\x80\x9d, written after she feigned insanity and got\nherself committed, caused outrage for exposing the abusive treatment of\nmentally ill inmates on the island.\n\nHillary Clinton: First stop is New York City\xe2\x80\x99s Welfare Island\n<http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/1/hillary-clinton-sets-first-big-rally-new-york-city/>\n// Washington Times // S.

It also put Mrs. Clinton\nconspicuously close to the Wall Street banks with which liberal activist\nalready say she is too cozy.\n\n\n\nStill, the June 13 rally will mark the official kickoff of Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\ncampaign and will be followed by a six-day whirlwind tour through the first\nfour early voting states: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.\n\n\n\nThe former first lady, senator and secretary of state announced her White\nHouse bid in April, but she limited her campaign stops to small events and\nroundtable discussions, a sort of listening tour to ease her into the\ncampaign and help her get to know the voters that she referred to as\n\xe2\x80\x9ceveryday Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe campaign announced the date of the big rally Friday but kept the\nlocation secret until Monday.\n\n\n\nIn her speech, Mrs. Clinton will lay out her view of the challenges facing\nthis country and her vision and ideas for moving the country forward, the\nofficial said.\n\n\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99ll also describe how her lifelong commitment to working on behalf of\nchildren and families took her from Illinois, where she grew up, through\nArkansas and Washington, D.C., to New York were she was elected as the\nstate\xe2\x80\x99s first female senator.\n\n\n\nWith a nod to the city, the park and the island named after her hero, Mrs.\nClinton will tell the crowd how her work championing the needy followed in\nthe tradition of Mr. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, the campaign official\nsaid.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton to launch campaign from one of New York\xe2\x80\x99s least-accessible\npublic places\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/06/01/hillary-clinton-to-launch-campaign-from-one-of-new-yorks-least-accessible-public-places/>\n// Washington Post //Philip Bump \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nThere is only one island in New York City harder to get to than Roosevelt\nIsland, where Hillary Clinton will hold her campaign kickoff later this\nmonth. That island is Riker\'s Island.\n\n\n\nI\'m not the type to go looking for metaphors in things! I am not that type!\nI am merely here to offer insights as a New Yorker-American into the ins\nand outs of New York life. Including the details of Roosevelt Island.\n\n\n\nFirst of all: Roosevelt Island is a cool place to visit. It use to house a\nsmallpox quarantine center at its southern end, which is still in the\nprocess of being restored (after partially collapsing a few years back).\nIt\'s got a bunch of new housing and a spectacularly painted public pool.\nBut it is about as inconvenient a place to get to in New York as is\nconceivable.\n\n\n\nThere are three ways onto the island.\n\n\n\nBy car: The red line shows the one route onto the island by car. You have\nto get to Queens and make your way through back streets in an industrial\narea to do so. The Queensboro Bridge (or whatever it is called now that New\nYorkers ignore) passes over the island, but has no outlets onto it. (It\nwould be hard to do so, given how high the bridge is.)\n\n\n\nWhat\'s left, then, is that little scroungy two-lane bridge from Queens,\nlimiting how many people can get across it. But most people don\'t.\n\n\n\nBy train: Instead, they usually use the subway (the black line). Now, here\nis a secret about taking the subway to Roosevelt Island: It is terrible.\n\n\n\nIn order to get under the East River, the train tunnel is very deep\nunderground, meaning you have to take about six escalators up to get to the\nsurface. Maybe more, I haven\'t counted. I tried to take the stairs once,\ninstead, and actually almost passed out. I\'m not an athlete. But still.\n\n\n\nBy tram: The cool way to get to the island, the way that\'s mentioned\ninHollywood Movies, is to take the newly refurbished tram, seen here in\nblue.\n\n\n\nIt holds maybe 20 people at a time and takes probably 10 minutes. It\'s\nbeautiful! I recommend it to visitors. However, it is not mass transit in\nthe sense of accommodating masses of people for rapid transit.\n\n\n\nI am not the type to find metaphors in things, as I said. I am just\nreporting that the Hillary Clinton campaign is launching from one of the\nleast accessible parts of New York City. That is all I am doing here in\nthis article. Nothing\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGrassroots Campaign\xe2\x80\x9d Sets $1,000 Minimum for a\nConversation\n<https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/06/01/costs-2700-participate-hillary-clintons-grassroots-campaign/>\n// Firstlook // Lee Fang \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nAn Intercept reader forwarded me the following invitation from Hillary\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign, asking him to join the candidate for a\nseries of events in Massachusetts.

Something is wrong when CEOs earn more\nthan 300 times than what the typical American worker earns and when hedge\nfund managers pay a lower tax rate than truck drivers or nurses,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nrepeated a month later when she returned to the state.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\'t need anybody crapping all over what I do for a living.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nLeon Cooperman\n\n\n\nNow, one such manager is firing back.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t need anybody crapping all over what I do for a living," Leon\nCooperman, the billionaire founder of the Omega Advisors hedge fund told\nCNN on Monday, adding that she \'hangs out with all these people in Martha\'s\nVineyard and in the Hamptons and then the very first thing she has to say\nis to criticize hedge funds."\n\n\n\nCooperman says he and other maligned hedge fund managers have given\nmillions of dollars back to society in the form of donations to\nuniversities, charitable organizations, and cultural institutions.\n\n\n\n"I have nothing to apologize for. I\'ve made a lot of money. I\'m giving it\nall back to society," he said.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s populist critique of hedge fund manager tax rates has also come\nunder scrutiny for its accuracy.\n\n\n\n"Her broad-brush assertion does not hold up to scrutiny, even when the\ntalking point is uttered correctly," the Washington Post\'s Glenn Kessler\nwrote in May. "Overall, even hedge fund managers pay higher taxes\xe2\x80\x94and tax\nrates\xe2\x80\x94than middle-class Americans."\n\n\n\nThe Tampa Bay Times\' Politifact concurred.\n\n\n\n"She is certainly wrong for dollar amounts, which is what her statement was\nabout. If she meant to say tax rates, that\'s more complicated, and the data\ndoesn\'t clearly back up the point. Here, we\'re looking at just taxes paid,\nso we rate her claim False," Louis Jacobson wrote.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s own son-in-law, Marc Mezvinsky is a founding hedge fund manager\nfor Eaglevale Partners, LP, and her ties to Wall Street have provided\nammunition to rivals like Bernie Sanders and Martin O\'Malley. On Sunday,\nO\'Malley renewed that criticism by noting that Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd\nBlankfein allegedly said that he would be happy if either Clinton or Jeb\nBush was elected president in 2016.\n\n\n\nBlankfein is an investor with Eaglevale Partners, which Mezvinsky started\nwith his former Goldman Sachs colleagues Bennett Grau and Mark Mallon.\n\n\n\n*Journalists Meet To Discuss Frustration With Clinton Campaign\'s Control\nOver Access And Information\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/01/journalists-clinton-campaign_n_7487076.html?1433194660>\n// HuffPo // Michael Calderone \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nNEW YORK -- Journalists covering Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign\nmet for nearly two hours in Washington on Monday to discuss concerns about\nwhat they believe is inadequate access to cover the Democratic\nfront-runner, according to people who attended.\n\n\n\nThe grievances discussed at the private gathering, which was held at the\nLos Angeles Times/Tribune Washington offices, go beyond Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nunwillingness so far to substantively engage with the press, a topic that\nhas already been discussed publicly on cable news and social media.\nAttendees of the meeting, who were not authorized by their news\norganizations to speak on the record, charge the Clinton campaign with\nkeeping an excessively tight grip on information, even when it comes to\nlogistical details that don\'t seem particularly sensitive or revelatory.\n\n\n\nAmong the problems discussed were the campaign\'s failure to provide\nadequate notice prior to events, the lack of a clear standard for whether\nfundraisers are open or closed press and the reflexive tendency to opt to\nspeak anonymously. The complaints mirror concerns that a number of\npolitical journalists have also raised in recent conversations with The\nHuffington Post.\n\n\n\nWhile the White House Correspondents\' Association has worked for greater\nmedia access for over a century and elects representatives to present the\ngroup\'s concerns to the administration, there isn\'t any comparable,\nestablished body working on behalf of the campaign press. Monday\'s meeting,\nwhich included about 17 journalists from outlets such as The New York\nTimes, The Washington Post, Politico, Time and McClatchy, was an attempt\nnot only to discuss such concerns, but eventually to present them to the\ncampaign in a unified way.\n\n\n\nAttendees discussed the feeling that the campaign hasn\'t provided enough\nnotice for events, resulting in logistical difficulties for those trying to\ncover them. It\xe2\x80\x99s still too early in the election cycle for the campaign to\nbe chartering the flights and buses that news organizations, at the cost of\nthousands of dollars, can sign up for to follow the candidate from stop to\nstop. For now, reporters are booking commercial flights to reach Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nevents, and networks need to make sure satellite trucks and camera\nequipment make it there on time. The group discussed urging the Clinton\ncampaign to provide information outlining the upcoming week so they can\nplan accordingly.\n\n\n\nAnother concern raised, according to attendees, was that the campaign had\ninitially said that fundraisers of more than 100 people would be open to\nthe press through a pool system. Under this arrangement, certain reporters\nare designated to cover events that cannot accommodate large numbers of\njournalists, and those reporters then provide information to the larger\npress corps. But recent Clinton fundraisers have been closed press.\n\n\n\nMeeting attendees also expressed dissatisfaction with the ground rules\nestablished for a Thursday briefing at the campaign\'s Brooklyn headquarters\nthat was attended by dozens of news outlets, including The Huffington Post.\n\n\n\nCNBC\xe2\x80\x99s John Harwood wrote Friday that reporters who attended the briefing\nwere not allowed to quote top campaign officials directly, even when it\ncame to information that appeared to be basic talking points. Harwood noted\nthat he could not show readers what campaign staffers\xe2\x80\x99 desks looked like\nbecause \xe2\x80\x9cthe post-briefing tour was deemed off-the-record.\xe2\x80\x9d (A week\nearlier, the Nashua Telegraph, a New Hampshire newspaper, similarly mocked\nthe Clinton campaign for holding a conference call in which mundane\ninformation was provided under ground rules that those speaking should not\nbe quoted.)\n\n\n\nCoincidentally, Monday\'s meeting wrapped up just before the campaign sent a\nmass email to journalists with details of an upcoming event. The campaign\nsaid the details could only be attributed to a \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign official,\xe2\x80\x9d which\nprompted New York Times reporter Adam Nagourney to out the sender on\nTwitter. Such rules for anonymity, Nagourney noted, are not done\nunilaterally but established between two parties. He also pointed out that\nthe information itself didn\'t "rise to [the] level" of requiring anonymity.\n\n\n\nThere was a general consensus at Monday\'s meeting that the ground rules for\nthe Thursday headquarters briefing were unacceptable. Attendees say they\nexpected that the group will urge the campaign to agree that similar\nbriefings need to be on the record in the future.\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the reporters\' complaints and how the campaign is\nreacting, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill responded in an email to HuffPost.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d say two things,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst, we want a happy press corps as much\nas the press corps does. Not in an effort to obtain favorable coverage, but\nbecause we\'re decent humans who want people to be able to plan their lives.\nIt\'s a long campaign, and we are going to do our best to find equilibrium.\nGriping on background is not a constructive solution though, and I can\'t\nhelp but point out the irony here."\n\n\n\nThe group also discussed its system for disseminating pool reports, which\nThe Washington Post criticized Friday for turning some reporters "into\nsecond-class journalists in the hunt for Clinton info.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe pool system, established at the urging of the Clinton campaign but run\nby campaign reporters, places journalists on a rotation and disseminates\nreports in real-time to fourteen news organizations. Those organizations,\nwhich do not bear the costs of being in the pool, receive the reports at\nthe end of the day.\n\n\n\nThough the Post put forth the idea of the system creating two classes of\nreporters, attendees at Monday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting stressed that the system allows\nfor wider dissemination of traveling pool reports than was possible during\nMitt Romney\'s campaign four years ago. At that time, only reporters\nphysically present for Romney campaign trips received pool reports, and\nthere was no wider dissemination to news organizations not in the rotation.\n\n\n\n*New York Times reporter blows up Clinton campaign\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98background\xe2\x80\x99 e-mail\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/06/01/new-york-times-reporter-blows-up-clinton-campaigns-background-e-mail/>\n// WaPo // Erik Wemple \xe2\x80\x93June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nAdam Nagourney is the Los Angeles bureau chief for the New York Times.\nThough he\xe2\x80\x99s the paper\xe2\x80\x99s former chief political reporter, he\xe2\x80\x99s not currently\nassigned to cover the campaign of Democratic 2016 hopeful Hillary Rodham\nClinton. But he receives the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s e-mails.\n\n\n\nAnd tweets about them:\n\n\n\nThat tweet was an apparent reference to a June 1 e-mail from the Clinton\ncampaign that included this data point: \xe2\x80\x9cIn Iowa, no Democratic candidate\nfor president has ever received more than 50% of the caucus vote unless\nthey were a sitting President or Vice-President, or incumbent Iowa\nSenator.\xe2\x80\x9d More Nagourney:\n\n\n\nAs Nagourney noted, the e-mail addressed Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s June 13 campaign kickoff\nspeech at Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park in New York City. The\ne-mail instructed recipients to attribute its contents to a \xe2\x80\x9cClinton\ncampaign official.\xe2\x80\x9d Those contents were pedestrian and, in some cases,\nWikipedia-style pedestrian. For example:\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton grew up in Illinois, and her career spent working on behalf\nof children and families has taken her from Massachusetts to Washington,\nD.C., Arkansas to New York. But it was the voters of New York who elected\nher to serve as their first female senator.\n\n\n\nNow let\xe2\x80\x99s attribute that snippet in accordance with the rules of the e-mail:\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton grew up in Illinois, said a Clinton campaign official in an\ne-mail sent to reporters, and her career spent working on behalf of\nchildren and families has taken her from Massachusetts to Washington, D.C.,\nArkansas to New York. But it was the voters of New York who elected her to\nserve as their first female senator, noted the campaign official.\n\n\n\nIn a chat with the Erik Wemple Blog, Nagourney said, \xe2\x80\x9cReporters negotiate\nthe terms of information with sources\xe2\x80\xa6.you can\xe2\x80\x99t go preemptively.\xe2\x80\x9d He\ncalled the information in the e-mail \xe2\x80\x9canodyne stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like give me a\nbreak,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. Nagourney isn\xe2\x80\x99t writing a piece on Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign\nlaunch, nor has he heard any complaint from the Clinton people about his\ntweets. The Twitter commentary from Nagourney, furthermore, lands on a heap\nof other backlash pieces against the Clinton campaign team for generally\nworthless press briefings.\n\n\n\nAnd Nagourney has some experience torpedoing background e-mails. Way back\nin December 2003, Nagourney did a story on how the capture of Iraqi\nstrongman Saddam Hussein would affect the then-incipient race for the\nDemocratic presidential nomination. Around that time, Howard Dean was\nviewed as a threat to vanquish his rivals, who included eventual nominee\nSen. John Kerry. Nagourney wrote:\n\n\n\nThe strains this created were evident on Sunday. Mr. Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s press\nsecretary, Stephanie Cutter, sent an e-mail message to news organizations\nlisting remarks Dr. Dean had made over the past six months that she said\ndemonstrated that his opposition to the war was \xe2\x80\x9dpolitically driven.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut Ms. Cutter, reflecting the concern among the campaigns that they not be\nviewed as turning a foreign policy victory to political advantage, put a\nnote on the top of the statement demanding that it be reported as\n\xe2\x80\x9dbackground\xe2\x80\x9d and attributed only to a Democratic campaign.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was upset,\xe2\x80\x9d Nagourney recalls, when asked how Cutter reacted to the\nouting. Cutter told the Erik Wemple Blog via e-mail, \xe2\x80\x9c[B]ackground has to\nbe agreed to, not assumed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOf course, there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem when reporters gripe about the \xe2\x80\x9cbackground\xe2\x80\x9d\ntendencies of campaigns and Cabinet officials and White House officials and\nso on. That problem is that media execs also run away from on-the-record\naccountability whenever possible.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton coming back to S.C.\n<http://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/the-buzz/article22801125.html>\n// The State \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton will return to South Carolina on June 17 in what will be\nthe 2016 Democratic presidential frontrunner\xe2\x80\x99s second trip to the Palmetto\nState in three weeks.\n\n\n\nDetails were not announced.\n\n\n\nHer latest trip will come after Clinton formally launches her campaign in\nNew York on June 13.

VOGEL \xe2\x80\x93 June 2, 2015*\n\n\n\nWinning over such donors is seen as critical to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s White House\n\nprospects.\n\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s allies are working to win over unenthusiastic rich\nliberals by pitting her against the Koch brothers and prospective GOP\nrivals rather than more progressive Democrats, according to a draft of a\nsecret memo obtained by POLITICO.\n\n\n\nThe memo was prepared for Clinton enforcer David Brock ahead of an April\nmajor donor meeting in San Francisco. But the concerns it reveals about\nliberal donors\xe2\x80\x99 coolness toward her presidential candidacy \xe2\x80\x93 with some even\nholding out hope for a robust primary challenge from the left \xe2\x80\x93 are just as\nacute today, Clinton allies say.\n\n\n\nWinning over such donors is seen as critical to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s White House\nprospects.\n\n\n\nThe Clinton forces are counting on a constellation of allied outside groups\nto raise as much as $500 million to take on a Republican big-money machine\nthat has been raking in cash from dozens of super-rich and highly engaged\npartisans. By contrast, the main super PAC supporting Clinton, Priorities\nUSA Action, has struggled to collect million-dollar checks.\n\n\n\nPart of the reticence stems from liberal queasiness about the expanding\nrole of big money in politics since the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2010 Citizens\nUnited decision. But there\xe2\x80\x99s also some discomfort with Hillary Clinton, the\nformer New York Senator and Secretary of State, who is seen as too hawkish\non foreign policy and insufficiently progressive on key issues like\nfighting climate change, income inequality and the role of big money in\npolitics. Additionally, Democratic finance operatives say, efforts to\nrustle up seven-figure checks are suffering from a lack of a single,\nunifying enemy on the right.\n\n\n\nAll those concerns are addressed in the Brock memo, which appears to have\nbeen drafted in preparation for his appearance at the annual spring meeting\nof the Democracy Alliance major liberal donor club in April in San\nFrancisco. The memo is written as a question-and-answer exchange between\nBrock and Democracy Alliance donors .\n\n\n\nThe memo suggests that Brock, who has built a fleet of deep-pocketed groups\naligned with Clinton, is taking a conciliatory approach to assuage donors\xe2\x80\x99\nconcerns \xe2\x80\x93 conceding she\xe2\x80\x99s not as liberal as some donors wish, but\nemphasizing her progessiveness in public service and minimizing the\nprospects of a vigorous Democratic primary.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say the Kochs represent all that is bad in this broken system, yet our\npresumptive nominee is in the pocket of big Wall Street banks,\xe2\x80\x9d begins one\nof the memo\xe2\x80\x99s hypothetical donor questions. \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t we going to have a hard\ntime going after the Kochs\xe2\x80\x99 big money when some could argue that Sec.\nClinton is bank rolled by Wall Street and therefore there is a pox on both\nour houses?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe answer Brock should give, according to the memo: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is no secret that\nSec. Clinton is fair-left and not far-left. I think it is safe to say that\nthere will be a dramatic difference between Sec. Clinton and whoever is the\nRepublican opponent. She has spent a lifetime advocating for women and\nchildren and fighting for the middle class and there is not one GOP\ncandidate who has that record.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBrock did not dispute the authenticity of the memo, which leaves a pair of\nquestions about the internal politics of the Clinton big-money effort\nunanswered. But he declined to comment on the memo, or whether it reflected\nhis fundraising approach or his presentation at the Democracy Alliance,\nwhich was closed to the press.\n\n\n\nThe three-day meeting of the Democracy Alliance \xe2\x80\x94 a group that includes\nmore than 100 individual and institutional donors and various unions \xe2\x80\x94 took\nplace at San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s Four Seasons Hotel just as Clinton officially\nlaunched her campaign.\n\n\n\nWhile some of the group\xe2\x80\x99s major donors \xe2\x80\x94 including billionaires George\nSoros and Tom Steyer \xe2\x80\x94 have displayed varying levels of support for\nClinton, others have grumbled mostly privately that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect\ntheir worldviews. Many Democracy Alliance members supported then-Illinois\nSen. Barack Obama over Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary\nand urged Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to run in 2016.\n\n\n\nThe group\xe2\x80\x99s importance to Democratic big-money efforts was underscored by\nthe attendance of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, who held a\nbriefing on the sidelines of the San Francisco meeting. Podesta founded the\nCenter for American Progress think tank, which has benefited from Democracy\nAlliance support, and he has close relationships with many club members. At\nleast one \xe2\x80\x93 CREDO Mobile co-founder Michael Kieschnick \xe2\x80\x93 told Podesta\nduring the side session that his campaign role made Kieschnick more\nsupportive of Clinton.\n\n\n\nAnother donor who attended, Utah-based investor Art Lipson, told POLITICO\nthat Podesta didn\xe2\x80\x99t overtly seek support for Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst of\nall, that would have gone over badly. And he is much too smart to say it\nand doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to say it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lipson, who has donated about $2.5\nmillion over the years to Democratic candidates and committees.\n\n\n\nLipson said he recently donated to a super PAC trying to draft Warren into\nthe Democratic presidential primary. In an assessment that could apply to\nmany Democracy Alliance members, he said \xe2\x80\x9cher message is exactly my\nmessage, so I am 100 percent behind her. But there is no chance she is\ngoing to run.\xe2\x80\x9d Lipson plans to attend a fundraiser this month in Salt Lake\nCity for Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic presidential campaign and said the\nformer Maryland governor \xe2\x80\x9ccomes across as being highly intelligent.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nLipson said he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfine with Hillary\xe2\x80\x9d given \xe2\x80\x9cthat it would take some sort of\na national disaster to have some other Democratic candidate\xe2\x80\x9d win the\nnomination. But he said that, while he\xe2\x80\x99ll vote for her over prospective\nRepublican rivals, he does not plan to donate to her campaign, let alone\nany supportive super PAC..\n\n\n\nBrock has sought to rally donors who might not otherwise give to Clinton by\nhighlighting expected attacks against her from the most reviled of liberal\nbogeymen \xe2\x80\x93 the billionaire industrialist mega-donors Charles and David Koch\nand their conservative political and policy network.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have their sights on Sec. Clinton,\xe2\x80\x9d reads the memo prepared for Brock\nahead of the meeting.\n\n\n\nHe spoke on a panel called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Electoral Arms Race,\xe2\x80\x9d focused on the\nunprecedented $889-million spending spree planned by the Koch network in\nthe 2016 run-up, according to an agenda obtained by POLITICO.\n\n\n\nAt the meeting, sources say, Brock detailed a new initiative of his\nAmerican Bridge political outfit to highlight key 2016 states in which Koch\nIndustries, the brothers\xe2\x80\x99 multinational manufacturing conglomerate, could\nbe used against GOP candidates. The model for this project, the sources\nsaid, were the attacks that Democrat Gary Peters and his allies leveled\nagainst the Kochs and Republican Terri Lynn Land in his successful 2014\nMichigan Senate race.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a brand new project and we project it will cost around $3\nmillion,\xe2\x80\x9d reads Brock\xe2\x80\x99s memo. \xe2\x80\x9cWe think it is critical to start the project\nearly and we are looking for support to get staffed up very soon. We are\nhoping to get immediate support coming in at the $250,000 level.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe memo also includes responses to questions about how liberals could\njustify their criticism of the Koch groups for not disclosing their donors\nwhen some of Brock\xe2\x80\x99s groups \xe2\x80\x93 including Media Matters and American Bridge\n21st Century Foundation \xe2\x80\x93 also do not disclose the identities of their\ndonors.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can we stand up here and expect to be taken seriously talking about\nwhat they are doing when we are doing the same thing?\xe2\x80\x9d reads one question.\nIn the suggested answer, Brock expresses disapproval for the proliferation\nof so-called \xe2\x80\x9cdark money,\xe2\x80\x9d which Clinton herself has criticized, but adds,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will play by the existing rules in this election because we cannot\nunilaterally disarm \xe2\x80\x93 too much of what we care about is at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\nasserts: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a major difference here \xe2\x80\x93 the Kochs are flooding the\npolitical system with money for pure self interest and self gain,\xe2\x80\x9d alleging\nKoch-backed groups back policies and candidates committed to \xe2\x80\x9cslash(ing)\ngovernment regulations so they can pollute with abandon and increase their\nbottom line. People in this room are not motivated by personal gain, and\noften work against their own self-interest.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Kochs\xe2\x80\x99 allies reject this argument on its face, contending that their\nactivism is motivated by a belief that society as a whole stands to benefit\nfrom small-government policies that allow the free market to thrive.\n\n\n\nTold of the characterization in the memo, James Davis, a spokesman for the\nKoch network umbrella group Freedom Partners, said its members are focused\non \xe2\x80\x9cadvancing a future with more economic opportunities for every American.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDavis accused the Kochs\xe2\x80\x99 liberal critics of \xe2\x80\x9claunching personal attacks and\ntaking away those freedoms.\xe2\x80\x9d And, alluding to support by Democrats\nincluding Clinton for reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, which Freedom\nPartners opposes, Davis said \xe2\x80\x9cmany of them are rigging the system to fatten\ntheir wallets with taxpayer-funded corporate welfare. This is the culture\nof corruption in Washington that we\xe2\x80\x99re fighting against.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton Returning to L.A. for June 19 Fundraising Swing\n<http://variety.com/2015/biz/news/hillary-clinton-visiting-l-a-june-19-fundraiser-1201509648/>\n// Variety // Ted Johnson \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton is returning to Los Angeles on June 19 for a fundraising\nswing that includes an event at the home of HBO\xe2\x80\x99s Michael Lombardo and\nhusband Sonny Ward, sources said.\n\n\n\nThe event will be a day after President Obama treks to L.A. for a\nfundraiser at the home of Tyler Perry.

Underscore her\nexperience. Appeal to Vermonters\' pragmatic side. Stock house parties with\nVermont beer.\n\n\n\nAnd, perhaps above all, stay on friendly but noncommittal terms with a\nrival, Vermont\'s "almost native son," Bernie Sanders, the independent\nsenator seeking the Democratic nomination.\n\n\n\nNearly everyone at the organizing event mentioned Sanders as a point of\ncomparison.\n\n\n\n"The slogan should be, \'Cheer for Bernie. Vote for Hillary,\' " said Beach\nConger of Burlington.\n\n\n\nTo the extent the strategy works in Vermont, Democrats suggested they\'d\ndrive across the river to stump for Clinton in the more influential New\nHampshire primary.\n\n\n\n"We all know that Vermont\'s primary somehow seems never to make or break\npresidential politics," said Gov. Peter Shumlin, who spoke at the\norganizing meeting at Main Street Landing on a rainy Monday evening. "Let\'s\nbe honest about this. But let\'s also remember that to our east is a state\nwith great people where they seem to have a great impact on the outcome of\npresidential primaries."\n\n\n\nVermont is among the 12 states holding a primary on Super Tuesday, March 1.\n\n\n\nThe state\'s Democratic establishment has lined up largely behind Clinton.\nIn addition to Shumlin, former Gov. Madeleine Kunin spoke in Clinton\'s\nfavor Monday.\n\n\n\n"I\'ve known Hillary through the years both personally as a very bright,\ncompetent and compassionate woman," said Kunin, who was Vermont\'s first\nfemale governor, "and in her public presence, the issues she\'s fought for\nall of her life."\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton back in Bay Area on June 20\n<http://www.ibabuzz.com/politics/2015/06/01/hillary-clinton-back-in-bay-area-on-june-20/>\n// San Jose Mercury News // Josh Richman \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will be back in the Bay\nArea to raise campaign money in a few weeks, just a little more than a\nmonth since her last sweep through the region.\n\n\n\nClinton will attend a brunch reception on Saturday, June 20 in San\nFrancisco\xe2\x80\x99s Mission District, hosted by real estate broker, former planning\ncommissioner, and attorney Rick Hills. Tickets start at $2,700 per person;\nco-hosts who raise $27,000 or more and hosts who raise $50,000 or more will\nbe invited to a pre-reception and photo line with Clinton.\n\n\n\nAn email sent Monday to announce the event noted that Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign\nrecently unveiled a finance committee structure in which someone who raises\n$27,000 in 30 days will be a \xe2\x80\x9cHillstarter\xe2\x80\x9d with a seat on the Northern\nCalifornia finance committee; someone who raises $50,000 by Dec. 31 will be\na \xe2\x80\x9cHillraiser\xe2\x80\x9d with a seat on the Northwest regional finance committee; and\nsomeone who raises $100,000 by Dec. 31 will be a \xe2\x80\x9cHillblazer\xe2\x80\x9d with a seat\non the national finance committee.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe hope you will use this opportunity to help reach your goals and take\npart in the wonderful benefits (soon to be revealed) associated with each\ncommittee,\xe2\x80\x9d the email said.\n\n\n\nThe former U.S. Secretary of State, U.S. Senator and First Lady held two\nfundraisers in San Francisco on Wednesday, May 6, one hosted by hedge fund\nbillionaire turned environmentalist Tom Steyer and the other by longtime\nfriend and support Susie Tompkins Buell, cofounder of Esprit and the North\nFace.

She has yet to hold any public campaign events\nin California.\n\n\n\n*Marco Rubio And Rand Paul Pose Greatest Threat To Hillary Clinton\n<http://thefederalist.com/2015/06/01/marco-rubio-and-rand-paul-pose-greatest-threat-to-hillary-clinton/>\n// The Federalist // Emily Ekins \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nA recent CNN/ORC poll finds 75 percent of Republican partisans prefer that\ntheir party nominate a \xe2\x80\x9cpresidential candidate who can beat the Democratic\ncandidate,\xe2\x80\x9d while only 25 percent prefer a nominee who agrees with them on\nissues that matter most to them. This clashes with partisans\xe2\x80\x99 reported\npreferred candidates for the Republican nomination. Numerous polls find\ndisproportionate support among partisans for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\nand Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker; however, U.S. senators Rand Paul and Marco\nRubio perform better in general election matchups against likely Democratic\ncandidate Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nDespite this, 2016 election coverage has tended to pay more attention to\nBush and Walker over Rubio and Paul. In fact, a May Fox News poll even\nexcluded Paul from its general-election matchups with Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nOne reason less attention is being paid to these candidates is that only a\nquarter of Republican voters believe either Rubio or Paul have the \xe2\x80\x9cbest\nchance of beating the Democratic nominee in the general election,\xe2\x80\x9d\naccording to another recent CNN/ORC poll. But the matchup data say\ndifferently.\n\n\n\nTo be sure, Clinton enjoys a sizable lead against all Republican\ncontenders. That being said, Quinnipiac\xe2\x80\x99s latest poll shows that in a\nhypothetical general-election matchup, Paul and Rubio come the closest to\nbeating Clinton. Paul would garner 42 percent of the vote to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 46\npercent and Rubio would capture 41 percent to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 45 percent.\n\n\n\nHigher Heights, Lower Lows for Paul and Rubio\n\n\n\nThis poll is not an anomaly. In fact, an analysis of major polls conducted\nin 2015 shows that Paul has fared best against Clinton from January-March\nof this year, with Rubio pulling ahead in April. Quinnipiac found that Paul\nand Rubio are the only widely known candidates whose favorables are not\n\xe2\x80\x9cunder water.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIf Republicans care about nominating a candidate who can beat the\nDemocratic nominee in 2016, they might want to pay more attention to Rubio\nand Paul.\n\n\n\nWhy might Paul and Rubio lead other Republicans in match-ups with Hillary\nClinton? There are a number of possible explanations. One likely\nexplanation is that Paul and Rubio beat Clinton on empathy.\n\n\n\nPerception of candidate empathy matters. Readers may recall going into the\n2012 presidential election that Mitt Romney and Barack Obama were tied on\nseveral candidate qualities, including being honest and trustworthy and\nbeing strong leaders. But Obama trounced Romney on \xe2\x80\x9ccares about the needs\nand problems of people like you\xe2\x80\x9d 60 to 48 percent. In fact, a slim majority\n(51 percent) of Americans thought Romney did not care about the needs of\npeople like themselves.\n\n\n\nHow could anyone honestly expect to win if a majority of the people doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nthink he or she cares about them?\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton is not Barack Obama. The Quinnipiac Poll finds that only 48\npercent of Americans think Hillary cares about the needs and problems of\npeople like themselves and 47 percent think she does not care about them.\n\n\n\nRepublicans Who Care\n\n\n\nBut Paul and Rubio are the only GOP contenders who Americans are more\nlikely to believe \xe2\x80\x9ccares about the needs and problems of people like\n[them]\xe2\x80\x9d than don\xe2\x80\x99t. In this, Paul has a +6 point advantage and Rubio has a\n+3 point advantage. In fact, Paul and Rubio are the only Republican\ncandidates in the poll who Americans believe care about their needs. For\ninstance, Jeb Bush has a -7 point deficit, Walker has a -5 point deficit,\nand Donald Trump has a -53 point deficit on empathy.\n\n\n\nWhy might Americans think Paul and Rubio care about people like them?\nPerhaps because they have taken stands on issues most Republicans avoid.\nFor instance, Paul has actively sought reform of the criminal-justice\nsystem and is an outspoken critic of police misconduct and the justice\nsystem\xe2\x80\x99s disparate impact on African-American and Hispanic communities.\nFurther, Paul has twice filibustered (or quasi-filibustered) over drone\nassassinations of citizens in the United States and renewal of the Patriot\nAct.\n\n\n\nRepublicans have lost the popular vote in five of the six presidential\nelections since 1992. However, candidates like Rubio and Paul who expand\ntheir scope of issue ownership beyond conventional Republican issues may be\nexpanding their base of support. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that what Rubio and\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s unique stances share in common is expanding freedom and choice, and\nthis may be attractive to new GOP voters.\n\n\n\nPickups Among Independent Voters\n\n\n\nIndependent voters seem to largely drive these results. Paul (+5) and Rubio\n(+1) are the only Republicans who lead Clinton among independent voters.\nInstead, Walker trails Clinton by 2 points, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\nby 3 points, Bush by 5 points, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee by 7\npoints, Sen. Ted Cruz by 8 points, and Trump by 15 points.\n\n\n\nWho are these voters that would not vote for any other Republican candidate\nbesides Paul or Rubio in a matchup with Clinton? Unfortunately, little raw\ndata are publicly available, besides a December 2014 CNN/ORC poll available\nvia the Roper Center that included Paul, but not Rubio. Furthermore, sample\nsizes are small so data should be interpreted with caution.\n\n\n\nHowever, data from this survey suggest that national-security issues, such\nas the U.S. government\xe2\x80\x99s use of torture, may attract new voters into the\nPaul camp. Indeed, civil liberties are precisely the issues on which Paul\nhas distinguished himself from the Republican pack. More publicly available\ndata are needed to investigate Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s voters.\n\n\n\nExamining respondents from a Gallup March 2015 survey who are not favorable\nof Republican presidential candidates besides Paul or Rubio provides\nfurther insight into these non-traditionally Republican voters. Paul seems\nto attract younger, white, male liberals who are non-religious, and Rubio\nseems to attract middle-age, Hispanic moderates, and particularly women.\n(Once again, sample sizes are small, so data should be interpreted with\ncaution.)\n\n\n\nRight-Wing, or Leftist?\n\n\n\nSome might find it ironic that Rubio and Paul, who were catapulted to high\nelected office via what many call the \xe2\x80\x9cfar right-wing\xe2\x80\x9d Tea Party movement,\nare also the very candidates posing the most formidable challenge to the\npotential Democratic nominee. In fact, Dana Milbank from the Washington\nPost even argued that Paul had taken a \xe2\x80\x9cleft turn,\xe2\x80\x9d and that his positions\nwould work well if he were challenging Hillary for the Democratic\nnomination. How can one come from the \xe2\x80\x9cfar right\xe2\x80\x9d and compete for the\nDemocratic nomination at the same time?\n\n\n\nWhile many Republican lawmakers are known by their stances on gay marriage,\ntaxes, and spending, these issues are simply not a high priority for many\noutside of the GOP base. Instead, many Americans are more worried about\nbeing unnecessarily (and unjustly) hassled by the police than by the\nInternal Revenue Service. Many fear being profiled by law enforcement,\nworry their grandmother may be deported, and wonder if they will eventually\nbe accepted by their communities.\n\n\n\nAmericans gravitate to politics of inclusivity, of empathy. This is not the\nsame as handing out \xe2\x80\x9cgifts,\xe2\x80\x9d as Romney suggested. Americans do not need to\nbe bought\xe2\x80\x94they want to be asked for their vote (well in advance of Election\nDay).\n\n\n\n*Dan Pfeiffer: Hillary Is \xe2\x80\x98Going To Have To Engage The Press\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://dailycaller.com/2015/06/01/dan-pfeiffer-hillary-is-going-to-have-to-engage-the-press-video/>\n// Daily Caller // Al Weaver \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nOn his first day as a CNN contributor, former Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer\nargued that Hillary Clinton is \xe2\x80\x9cgoing to have to engage the press\xe2\x80\x9d if she\nwants to have a success in her presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nAppearing on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lead\xe2\x80\x9d with host Jake Tapper, Pfeiffer said that her\ndealings with the press will be \xe2\x80\x9ccritical to her success\xe2\x80\x9d as the campaign\ndrags on.\n\n\n\nJAKE TAPPER: Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about Hillary Clinton who is obviously way favored\non the Democratic side of the aisle. You said that the political world had\nlost its mind about the Hillary Clinton e-mails. You don\xe2\x80\x99t think that this\nis something the American people should care about? She wiped her server\ncleaned, she used a private server for official business?\n\n\n\nDAN PFEIFFER: No. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that should be\nlooked at. I think it is. My point was when this all happened, every, you\nknow, political prognosticator and pundit was saying that this is going to\nbe an existential threat to her campaign, some said. We have a poll for out\nin Iowa last night, or the other night that said she\xe2\x80\x99s still doing quite\nwell there. So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a legitimate issue that people should look at,\nbut not the threat to her long-term political viability and some say it is.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: One could argue that reason that she\xe2\x80\x99s been able to avoid any harm\nfrom this is that she has avoided any questions about it. She has really\nkept the press at arms length during all of her various trips. She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\ngiven any significant interviews. Is this a smart strategy or do you think\nit will ultimately backfire?\n\n\n\nPFEIFFER: Over the course of time..she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even done the official\nannouncement of her campaign yet. Over the course of time, she\xe2\x80\x99s going to\nhave to engage the press. I think it will be critical to her success. I\nthink that whenever you\xe2\x80\x99re in a situation like this\xe2\x80\xa6you want to make sure\nyou run your campaign strategy, and don\xe2\x80\x99t do it on the schedule the press\nsets. But what you can\xe2\x80\x99t do is go so long without talking to the press that\nit bubbles over into a world where every single little interaction you have\nbecomes carried on live television. So you have to find the balance. As the\ncampaign goes on I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to do that.\n\n\n\n*20 things for Hillary Clinton to worry about\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/01/20-things-for-hillary-clinton-to-worry-about/>\n// WaPo // Jennifer Rubin \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nFor a presidential candidate who is so \xe2\x80\x9cinevitable,\xe2\x80\x9d Hillary Clinton is in\nan odd position. She\xe2\x80\x99s far ahead of any challenger but seems more\nvulnerable than ever. Here are 20 reasons for her to worry:\n\n\n\n1. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is being taken seriously in the media and is\ndrawing big crowds in Iowa.\n\n\n\n2. Once Sanders breaks 25 to 30 percent, other, stronger candidates may\nconsider getting into the race.\n\n\n\n3. The war against the Islamic State is going poorly, making her decision\nto tie herself to President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s mast on foreign policy more problematic\nby the day.\n\n\n\n4. Ditto for the Iran negotiations.\n\n\n\n5. She has to re-launch her campaign, suggesting that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t get off the\nground the first time.\n\n\n\n6. The appearance of so many quality candidates on the GOP side who have\ninteresting things to say highlights how little she offers in the way of\nnew or interesting ideas.\n\n\n\n7.  The media buy that the Clinton Foundation scandals \xe2\x80\x94 with her greed and\nlack of candor front and center \xe2\x80\x94 are real scandals. Media discussion of\nher antics remains vicious. Not even her allies seem inclined to defend\nher. And to top it off, the monthly release of e-mails will give the media\nnew fodder for months to come.\n\n\n\n8.  The premise of her campaign \xe2\x80\x94 working for everyday Americans \xe2\x80\x94 has been\nswamped by scandal and her own fear of freely interacting with everyday\nAmericans.\n\n\n\n9. Neither Sanders nor former Maryland governor Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley has\nanything to lose, so they might as well go after her biggest liabilities \xe2\x80\x94\nher character and staleness. They\xe2\x80\x99ve begun already.\n\n\n\n10. She still can\xe2\x80\x99t manage a one-on-one news anchor interview. Will she\never?\n\n\n\n11.  Other candidates are improving, but she shows no sign of doing so.\n\n\n\n12. Bill Clinton continues to sound off and sound out of touch.\n\n\n\n13. A listless economy does not offer impetus for a \xe2\x80\x9cthird term.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n14. The GOP not only has a lot of quality candidates, but also a lot of\nyoung ones. Whether it is age, longevity or simply cultural cluelessness,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see how Clinton generates excitement, particularly among young\nvoters.\n\n\n\n15. Republican operatives can still focus their fire almost exclusively on\nher, while Democrats can\xe2\x80\x99t yet single out one or even a couple of GOP\ntargets. The general election campaign against Clinton is well underway.\n\n\n\n16.  There does not appear to be anyone in her inner circle willing to tell\nher hard truths about her campaign skills, strategy and unethical behavior.\n\n\n\n17. She has reminded us that with the Clintons come a retinue of unsavory\ncharacters.\n\n\n\n18. With 100 percent name identification, it is hard to imagine there are\nmany persuadable voters out there. By contrast, many GOP contenders are\nlargely unknown to the electorate and can gain followers. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nplunging favorable ratings suggest she may have peaked already.\n\n\n\n19.  She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to lose the Iowa caucuses to get rotten headlines.\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s flunking the expectations game.\n\n\n\n20. She is charmless.\n\n\n\n*The Presidential Candidates\xe2\x80\x99 404 Pages, Ranked\n<https://www.yahoo.com/tech/the-presidential-candidates-404-pages-ranked-120445718829.html>\n// Yahoo // Daniel Bean \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nCareer politicians are acutely sensitive to taking wrong turns. So it\xe2\x80\x99s no\nsurprise that many of the 2016 U.S. presidential candidates are paying\nattention to where their campaign website visitors land when they veer\noff-course.\n\n\n\nInstead of a simple error message, the 404 pages for the online\nheadquarters of Marco Rubio, Hillary Clinton, Mike Huckabee, and others\noffer family photos, personal videos, and, of course, plenty of puns.\n\n\n\nBelow, we\xe2\x80\x99ve ranked all of these novelty 404 pages with respect to\ncreativity, technical prowess, and also arbitrariness. You probably should\nnot base your vote in the upcoming election on this.\n\n\n\nLAST PLACE: Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, Lindsey Graham, and Carly\nFiorina\n\n\n\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t put any effort into making your 404 page fun at all, you make\nlast place on our list. The candidates listed above feature standard \xe2\x80\x9cpage\nnot found\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cerror\xe2\x80\x9d messages when visitors get lost on their campaign\nsites. In the case of Ted Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s website, trying to access a page that\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist will simply spit you back out to the home page.\n\n\n\nThanks for not playing along, guys and gals!\n\n\n\n6. Rick Santorum\n\n\n\nWe like 404s that are fun and lighthearted. So since former Pennsylvania\nsenator Rick Santorum decided to use his as a nasty poke at the Hillary\nClinton email scandal, we\xe2\x80\x99ve pushed him down on our list. More demerits\nwere calculated in for the Republican since his site ostensibly lifted the\n\xe2\x80\x9cmean Hillary Clinton joke 404\xe2\x80\xb3 idea from his party\xe2\x80\x99s official website.\n(Also, the GOP\xe2\x80\x99s Hillary 404 is way funnier.)\n\n\n\n5. Marco Rubio\n\n\n\nNothing is more American than throwing a little pigskin, right Marco? The\nFlorida Senator\xe2\x80\x99s 404 page wants you to know that he\xe2\x80\x99s a big fan of family\nand football. It\xe2\x80\x99s a nice-looking and technically savvy landing page with\nan embedded video, but the charm of it all might be lost on its alignment\nwith a sport that\xe2\x80\x99s under fire for safety concerns.\n\n\n\nFUMBLE!\n\n\n\n4. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\n\n\n\nMartin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s horse-mounted general 404 gives us too much of a\nDukakis-on-a-tank feel to rank highly on our list. We get the joke, and\nit\xe2\x80\x99s good to see that the Maryland governor knows how to poke a little fun\nat himself. But if the Democrat wants to upend favorite Hillary Clinton for\nthe 2016 party nomination, he\xe2\x80\x99ll want to bring something a little more\nrelatable than looking regal on a horse.\n\n\n\n3. Bernie Sanders\n\n\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 404 redirection video message is no-frills\npersonified. (Go watch it.) And it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful, even! We can appreciate those\ntraits in and of themselves, but imagining the conversation Bernie had with\nsome web designer intern just before filming the vid, that\xe2\x80\x99s the part that\nmakes us smile the most.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?! You want me to point at the bottom of the screen?!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n2. Mike Huckabee\n\n\n\nThe fishing Mike shown in Governor Huckabee\xe2\x80\x99s 404 page cleverly reinforces\nthe Republican\xe2\x80\x99s good ol\xe2\x80\x99 boy persona. The bonus points added for\nincorporating a dog bring him to second on our list. Simple and appealing.\nAnd a dog!\n\n\n\n1.       Hillary Clinton\n\n\n\nRight now, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s cute and punny 404\ngets our vote for number one. Hers, featuring a family picture at Disney\nwith Bill and Chelsea, was the first we came across this election cycle and\nnone of the other candidates have been able to dethrone the queen yet.\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nOf course, the party primaries leading up to the 2016 election are still a\nlong way away, and plenty of candidates have yet to officially launch their\ncampaign websites. (We hold high hopes for Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s 404, for\nexample.) So between now and then, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be updating our ranking as other\nhopefuls launch their respective Internet campaign home pages.\n\n\n\n*OTHER DEMOCRATS NATIONAL COVERAGE*\n\n\n\n*The race is on to become Hillary Clinton alternative\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/02/politics/hillary-clinton-democratic-primary/>//\nCNN // Eric Bradner - June 2, 2015*\n\n\n\nWashington \xe2\x80\x93 The race to become the liberal alternative to Hillary Clinton\nis on.\n\n\n\nThanks to a new poll, which shows Clinton has some serious vulnerabilities\nwhen it comes to trustworthiness and likeability, contenders like Vermont\'s\nBernie Sanders and Maryland\'s Martin O\'Malley may have more room to make\ntheir case than previously thought.\n\n\n\nA more alarming sign for Clinton: Prospective Republican opponents have\nclosed on her in head-to-head matchups, with Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul,\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker all now polling\nwithin the margin of error.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s favorability rating is now 46% -- down from 53% in March. And\njust 42% said they view Clinton as honest and trustworthy, compared to 50%\nin March, according to a new CNN/ORC poll.\n\n\n\nThe greatest threat to her chances of securing the Democratic nomination --\nthe potential for a Sen. Elizabeth Warren candidacy -- is apparently over.\nBut the polling shows she\'ll still have to come to play against the likes\nof liberal folk hero Sanders and the willing-to-throw-a-punch O\'Malley.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s share of Democrats\' support has slipped from 69% in April to 60%\nsix weeks later. Second, though, is Vice President Joe Biden, at 14%.\nSanders is at 10%, double his support from March, while O\'Malley still\nbarely registers at 1%.\n\n\n\nThe former Maryland governor officially launched his campaign over the\nweekend, and Sanders made news by attracting crowds of hundreds to events\non his first swing through Iowa.\n\n\n\n"That was an indication of the fact that Iowa voters definitely want to get\nengaged," said Tom Henderson, the Democratic chairman in Polk County,\nIowa\'s most populous county.\n\n\n\nThough there are apparent cracks in the armor, top Democratic hands say\nClinton is still on safe territory.\n\n\n\n"If either one of them were to win, it would be the greatest upset in the\nhistory of politics," said Dan Pfeiffer, a CNN political commentator and\nformer senior White House aide to President Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nAnd Clinton\'s campaign is making as clear as it can that the former\nsecretary of state is preparing for a real primary battle -- particularly\nin early-voting states like Iowa.\n\n\n\nOn June 13 -- the same day Clinton holds her first major speech and rally\nof the campaign in New York City -- she\'ll meet with key supporters and\nvolunteers in the Hawkeye State, and simulcast that meeting to similar ones\nin nearly all 435 congressional districts across the country.\n\n\n\nIn the 2008 campaign, Clinton was stunned by a third-place finish behind\nBarack Obama and Sen. John Edwards. It\'s a lesson that seems to have been\ntaken to heart for her 2012 campaign.\n\n\n\nTeam Clinton already employs 21 field organizers and six regional\norganizing directors in Iowa, and those organizers are working down to the\nprecinct level. The staff includes state director Matt Paul and deputy\nstate director Molly Schermann, who both worked for former Iowa governor\nand Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, as well as political director Troy\nPrice, the former executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party.\n\n\n\nThat said, her advisers know Iowa has always been a game of expectations,\nand they are doing their best to temper them.\n\n\n\nClinton campaign spokesman Jesse Ferguson on Monday highlighted a number\nmany Clinton allies have cited: No Democrat who wasn\'t a sitting president,\nvice president or Iowa senator has ever topped 50% of the state\'s caucus\nvote.\n\n\n\nStill, Clinton is far from a typical candidate.\n\n\n\nHenderson, the Polk County Democratic chair, said it\'s unfair to compare\nlow-profile candidates like Sanders and O\'Malley with Clinton.\n\n\n\n"We keep comparing these candidates to Hillary Clinton, who may be the most\nfamous women in the world, and a lot of them are still emerging -- people\nare getting to know them," he said. "It\'s still early in the campaign."\n\n\n\nThe biggest danger to Clinton\'s candidacy is the emergence of a damaging\nnarrative -- that she acts like she\'s above reproach when it comes to\nquestions over her use of private email while heading the State Department\nor the controversial donations accepted by the Clinton Foundation. Or that\nshe\'s completely untrustworthy.\n\n\n\n*Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s first challenge: Bernie Sanders\n<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/martin-omalley-first-challenge-bernie-sanders>\n// MSNBC // Alex Seitz-Wald \xe2\x80\x93 6/1/15*\n\n\n\nMartin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley was supposed to be the main liberal alternative to Hillary\nClinton. But when he announced his candidacy Saturday in Baltimore, he\nfound that spot already taken by someone else.\n\n\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is now Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s top rival in early polls,\nbeat the former Maryland governor to a presidential announcement by exactly\na month, and to a outdoor kickoff rally by five days.\n\n\n\nBoth men served two terms as mayor in the largest city in their states.\nBoth were then elected statewide. And both returned to those cities this\nweek to announce their underdog presidential campaigns. But the scenes were\nvery different.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley had several hundred, perhaps a thousand, supporters to cheer him\non Saturday at a park overlooking Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s skyline. There were also\nabout a dozen protesters, who heckled O\xe2\x80\x99Malley over his policing policies\nas mayor.\n\n\n\nSanders, on the other hand, drew more than 5,000 supporters in Burlington,\na city of 40,000. A sea of fans overflowed the lakefront park Sanders\nhelped build as mayor, and packed in behind portapotties and platforms,\nwhere they had no hope of a view.\n\n\n\nAnd it was just the kickoffs. Both candidates this week visited Iowa where\nSanders drew 700 in Davenport for the biggest rally any candidate of either\nparty has seen in the state this election season, according to the New York\nTimes. In a tiny town of Kensett, population 240, Sanders drew 300.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley visited Davenport three days later and spoke to 50 supporters. He\nmet another 200 in Des Moines later that night, according to the Des Moines\nRegister.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders headed to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he fired up an\noverflow crowd of more than 3,000 in a basketball gym, according to the\nMinneapolis Star Tribune. Hundreds more listed from outside, unable to get\nin.\n\n\n\nOn the Internet, 84,000 Facebook users generated 120,000 interactions about\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley in the 24 hours after his launch, according to the social\nnetworking company. In the same period after Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 announcement,\nFacebook record 10 times the interactions \xe2\x80\x93 1.2 million \xe2\x80\x93 from 592,000\ndifferent users. (Hillary Clinton blew both of them out of the water with\n10.1 million interactions from almost 5 million users.)\n\n\n\nCraig Varoga, who served as O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s chief strategist on his 2010\nreelection campaign, but is not involved with the candidate today, said\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley needs to find a way to deal with Sanders soon.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis first real challenge is dealing with Bernie Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 campaign, rather\nthan directly going after Hillary Clinton,\xe2\x80\x9d said Varoga.\n\n\n\nOnly perhaps 30-40% of Democrats are currently not supporting Clinton. If\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley and Sanders split that bloc, neither will be seen as credible,\nVaroga said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have to find a way to talk about Sanders without talking about him.\nThe worst thing is for one longshot to get in a fight with another\nlongshot,\xe2\x80\x9d Varoga said.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s camp, however, insists they\xe2\x80\x99re not concerned about Sanders \xe2\x80\x93 in\nfact they welcome his success.\n\n\n\nAs they see it, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s more immediate challenge is breaking through the\npsychological barrier of Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s inevitability. No candidate will\nbe taken seriously until the idea that Clinton can lose is taken seriously.\nSo the more any progressive alternative to Clinton rises in the polls, the\nbetter for everyone running to her left.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s an encouragement to my candidacy,\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Malley said of Sanders\non ABC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThis Week\xe2\x80\x9d Sunday. Why should progressive support O\xe2\x80\x99Malley over\nSanders? \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I have a track record of actually getting things done,\nnot just talking about things,\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Malley added.\n\n\n\nThe former governor\xe2\x80\x99s allies view Sanders as essentially a protest\ncandidate, while O\xe2\x80\x99Malley is presidential. If they can convince voters\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a chance for an alternative to actually win against Clinton, they\nthink Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 supporters will flock to the more electable O\xe2\x80\x99Malley.\n\n\n\nTeam O\xe2\x80\x99Malley looks to the 2012 Republican presidential primary, in which\nnearly every candidate had a moment in the sun, and sees Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 fling\nwith Democratic primary voters as fleeting.\n\n\n\nAnd O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s allies are pointing to another historical parallel as well.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBernie Sanders is in some ways like Sen. McCarthy was in 1968,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nformer Maryland governor Parris Glendening, who is supporting O\xe2\x80\x99Malley.\n\n\n\nThe 1968 Democratic primary featured a thought-to-be-inevitable frontrunner\nin Lyndon Johnson, the incumbent president. None of the party\xe2\x80\x99s top\nprospects dared challenge Johnson. But the Vietnam War created an opening\nfor an anti-war progressive, exploited by underfunded longshot candidate\nSen. Eugene McCarthy.\n\n\n\nAfter McCarthy came shockingly close to winning the New Hampshire primary,\nRobert F. Kennedy sensed Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s weakness and jumped into the race. That\nprompted the once-inevitable president to throw in the towel on his\nreelection bid entirely and quit. Kennedy won a string of contests, but\ntragically did not make it to the Democratic Convention when he was\nassassinated after winning the California primary in June.\n\n\n\nIn O\xe2\x80\x99Malleyland\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, Sanders is McCarthy and O\xe2\x80\x99Malley is Kennedy, the\nyoung, handsome Catholic pol.\n\n\n\nWhile they agree on most issues, Sanders is an anti-politician at a time\nwhen politicians are liked, while O\xe2\x80\x99Malley looks like a central casting\ncandidate. And without a critical issue like the Vietnam War where the\ncandidates differ, it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear if O\xe2\x80\x99Malley can draw a clear contrast with\nhis rivals and distinguish himself.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s advantage is that he\xe2\x80\x99s not just out there on these issues, but\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s been very effective on these issues,\xe2\x80\x9d Glendening said, pointing to\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s track record in Maryland. \xe2\x80\x9cHis other big advantage is\norganization,\xe2\x80\x9d Glendening added, pointing to the former governor\xe2\x80\x99s years as\na political organizer and operative before he sought elected office himself.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSanders\xe2\x80\x99 support is just a representation of the explosiveness of these\nissues,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\n\nIndeed, even many of Sanders supporters don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily see him as\npresidential. And a danger for the self-proclaimed democratic socialist was\non display this weekend, when he had to answer questions about a\ncontroversial 1972 essay, in which he wrote that women fantasize about\nbeing raped. Sanders called it \xe2\x80\x9cstupid\xe2\x80\x9d and said he was imitating the voice\nof the male chauvinist he was criticizing.\n\n\n\nFor the meantime, though, both candidates will be focused squarely on\nClinton, not each other.\n\n\n\n*Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley misses his chance: How Hillary Clinton closed off his\nbiggest 2016 opening\n<http://www.salon.com/2015/06/01/martin_omalley_misses_his_chance_how_hillary_clinton_closed_off_his_biggest_2016_opening/>\n// Salon // Simon Maloy \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nAfter months and months of hemming, hawing, and dithering, Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\nis finally an official candidate for the presidency. He\xe2\x80\x99s entered the race\nwith literally nowhere to go but up \xe2\x80\x93 his RealClearPolitics national\npolling average is, as of this writing, a clinically dead 0.8 percent. That\nputs him at the very bottom of the Democratic primary barrel. He\xe2\x80\x99s being\nbadly outpolled by Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden, neither of whom have\ntaken any steps towards 2016 bids, and he\xe2\x80\x99s even behind bored vanity\ncandidates Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb. It\xe2\x80\x99s a weird position for an\naccomplished two-term governor of a reliably blue state to find himself in.\n\n\n\nSo what hope does O\xe2\x80\x99Malley have of snatching the nomination away from\nrunaway favorite Hillary Clinton? At the moment, not much, but he\xe2\x80\x99s at\nleast going to try and make things interesting. Both O\xe2\x80\x99Malley and Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\ncurrent chief rival, Bernie Sanders, have indicated that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to\ncome at Hillary from the left and appeal to the slice of the Democratic\nbase that is maybe a little uneasy over her perceived centrist tendencies.\nUnfortunately for O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, Clinton has already moved to cut him off at the\nknees on one issue he clearly hopes to challenger her on: immigration.\n\n\n\nRemember last summer\xe2\x80\x99s border crisis? Thousands and thousands of\nundocumented immigrant children were pouring over the southern border,\nstraining the resources of immigration agencies and causing a major\npolitical controversy. The crisis had the weird effect of dividing\nDemocrats on immigration, an issue that typically unites the party in the\nface of Republican fractiousness. At the time, the White House moved to\naccelerate deportation proceedings for the undocumented minors to send a\nmessage to Central American countries that there was no benefit in making\nthe dangerous journey through Mexico.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley, who was still governor of Maryland, very publicly broke with\nPresident Obama and condemned the White House for pursuing a cruel and\nimmoral policy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is contrary to everything we stand for as a people to\ntry to summarily send children back to death,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cin a place where\ndrug gangs are the greatest threat to stability, rule of law and democratic\ninstitutions in this hemisphere.\xe2\x80\x9d It was smart politics for O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, as he\nsimultaneously galvanized liberals on a contentious issue, put daylight\nbetween himself and a president whose popularity wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so hot at the time,\nand directly challenged Hillary Clinton, who had said the undocumented\nminors \xe2\x80\x9cshould be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible\nadults in their families are.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPicking a fight with Clinton on immigration made sense. She\xe2\x80\x99d stumbled\nbadly on the issue in 2007 when she refused to directly answer whether or\nnot she\xe2\x80\x99d back driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses for undocumented immigrants. That\nexperience, combined with her support for Obama\xe2\x80\x99s policy towards the border\ncrisis, seemed to indicate that there\xe2\x80\x99d be at least some space to attack\nher from the left on the issue. As for O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s own record, he could\npoint to legislation he signed allowing undocumented immigrants access to\ndriver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses and his support for a state-level version of the DREAM\nAct.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut O\xe2\x80\x99Malley waited too long, and while he sat on the sidelines, Clinton\nseized the initiative. Last month she laid out her own vision for\nimmigration reform that preserves and expands upon the policies Obama has\nput in place through executive action. She spoke to the urgency liberals\nand Latino voters feel about passing immigration reform, and aggressively\nchallenged the Republican presidential candidates, attacking them for not\n\xe2\x80\x9cclearly and consistently supporting a path to citizenship.\xe2\x80\x9d At the very\nleast, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley could have used the issue to be perceived as the person who\nwas forcing Hillary to the left. Instead, she went there on her own.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley still has a strong record on immigration issues, and he\xe2\x80\x99s hired\nObama\xe2\x80\x99s former director of Hispanic media to help craft policy and conduct\noutreach. And all indications are that he\xe2\x80\x99s still going to make an issue of\nHillary\xe2\x80\x99s response to the border crisis as part of a broader critique of\nher immigration stance. He\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely right to do that, but Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s\nalready making moves to align herself more closely with the portion of the\nelectorate that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be targeting. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a whole lot of room on\nHillary\xe2\x80\x99s left to begin with, and if this keeps up, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley could soon\nfind himself with nowhere left to go.\n\n\n\n*O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s Bad Timing\n<http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2015_06/omalleys_bad_timing055835.php>\n// Washington Monthly // Ed Kilgore \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nWhen I was first in the vicinity of Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, right after he was\nfirst elected mayor of Baltimore (in 1999), the prevailing question wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\nif but when he\xe2\x80\x99d run for president. In the New Democrat circles I ran in\nback then, he was a pretty hot property, interested in policy innovations\non a wide range of issues that transcended his current position on the\npolitical career ladder. Even then, there was a sort of ambivalent feeling\nabout him: he had a bit of the Bobby Kennedy aura about him\xe2\x80\x94a prized\nquality for Democrats regardless of their ideological tendencies\xe2\x80\x94but there\nwere also questions about his depth and vision. And then there was the\npersonal image: the wonky Irish rocker whom a lot of women found very\nattractive (I don\xe2\x80\x99t get the sense this last credential has survived the\nintervening decade-and-a-half, though I could be wrong).\n\n\n\nSo now after two ostensibly successful terms as mayor and then as Governor,\nthe appointed time for the O\xe2\x80\x99Malley presidential run has arrived, and you\nget the sense his timing is just completely off. His earlier time served in\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s orbit makes him an unlikely and very long-shot challenger\nto her nomination. His sudden emergence as a would-be \xe2\x80\x9ctrue progressive\xe2\x80\x9d\nchampion is singularly undermined by the prior presence in the presidential\nfield of Bernie Sanders, who has a few decades on O\xe2\x80\x99Malley in rousing\ncrowds with attacks on Wall Street and centrist \xe2\x80\x9csell-outs.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\xe2\x80\x99s\ndefinitely been wrong-footed by recent events in Baltimore, where fairly or\nunfairly the suspicion has been sowed that his supposedly wonky policing\nstrategies fed a old-school habit of harassing young black men for who they\nwere, and created a poisonous atmosphere that is now boiling over in\nviolence and mistrust of government. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help O\xe2\x80\x99Malley that his\nchief accuser on this front is television writer and producer David Simon,\nwhose depiction of Baltimore in the HBO series The Wire probably represents\n99% of what political and journalistic elites in the rest of the country\nknow about that city.\n\n\n\nAdd in the disillusionment with O\xe2\x80\x99Malley among Democrats in his home state\nafter his tax policies helped sink his designated successor in 2014,\nAnthony Brown, and you have a guy who at the age of 52 should probably\nthink about deferring his presidential ambitions until 2020 or 2024. For\nall I know, of course, this campaign is mostly strategic, aimed at\npositioning O\xe2\x80\x99Malley to become HRC\xe2\x80\x99s running-mate or a lively prospect for\nthe future. But right now he\xe2\x80\x99s in a position where if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get some\nattention by going after both Sanders and Clinton, his candidacy could sink\nlike a stone.\n\n\n\nAt FiveThirtyEight Harry Enten put up a rather deadly post about O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\nover the weekend that suggested the lack of support for his candidacy in\nMaryland made him a really unusual presidential aspirant compared to, well,\njust about everybody else past or present. He\xe2\x80\x99ll have a brief window of\ninterest in his candidacy before it closes for the cycle (barring some\ncalamity hitting Clinton). If he can reverse all the indicators pointing\ndownward in that time, then the promise a lot of people saw in him back in\nthe day can yet be redeemed.\n\n\n\n*O\'Malley on changing his mind about Clinton: \'Times change\'\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-no-support-2016-118479.html>\n// Politico // Nick Gass \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nMartin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley supported Hillary Clinton in 2008 and 2012, but \xe2\x80\x9ctimes\nchange,\xe2\x80\x9d the Democratic presidential candidate and former governor of\nMaryland said Monday in an interview with ABC News\xe2\x80\x99 George Stephanopoulos.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe that the presidency is a sacred trust,\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Malley said, echoing\nremarks from his weekend campaign announcement in which he railed against\nWall Street\xe2\x80\x99s preference for Clinton and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic Party has not \xe2\x80\x9cdelivered\xe2\x80\x9d on its promise to \xe2\x80\x9cmake the\nAmerican dream real again for more families,\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Malley said in the\ninterview aired on \xe2\x80\x9cGood Morning America.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, former top White House adviser David Axelrod tweeted that\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s support of Clinton in 2008 might make it \xe2\x80\x9ca bit awkward\xe2\x80\x9d to slam\npolitical \xe2\x80\x9croyal families\xe2\x80\x9d during his campaign. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley responded, saying\nthat while people don\xe2\x80\x99t change, the times do, noting that his support of\nClinton preceded the financial collapse.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell I was for Secretary Clinton in 2008. She and I both worked hard to\nelect the president and to re-elect the president. But times change, and\ndifferent challenges require new leadership,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, noting that he keeps\nhearing from people that new leadership is necessary.\n\n\n\nHe also fired back at a Wall Street Journal editorial published Sunday that\nwent after his gubernatorial record.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley may attract some Democrats as an alternative to Clintonian\ninevitability and cynicism, but he has little chance at the nomination\nunless Mrs. Clinton unexpectedly washes out, and then other Democrats would\njoin the race. Republicans would be only too happy to run against the\nMaryland progressive model,\xe2\x80\x9d the editorial said.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley touted his leadership of the state, mentioning the state\xe2\x80\x99s\nTriple-A bond rating, the best public schools in America, the highest\nmedian income of any state, and a better rate of job creation than\nneighboring states.\n\n\n\n*O\'Malley, stumping in N.H., sells himself as alternative to Clinton\n<http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/martin-omalley/bs-md-omalley-new-hampshire-20150531-story.html>\n//\nBaltimore Sun // John Fritze \xe2\x80\x93 May 31, 2015*\n\n\n\nAttempting to push back on the idea that his presidential campaign is a\nnearly insurmountable long shot, Martin O\'Malley arrived in New Hampshire\non Sunday to sell himself as a fresh voice and progressive alternative to\nfront-runner Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nVisiting the key presidential primary state a day after announcing his\nlong-expected candidacy in Baltimore, the former two-term Maryland governor\nused phrases like "new leadership" and "trying different things" almost\nimmediately upon hitting the ground here \xe2\x80\x94 and it was a theme he repeatedly\nreturned to throughout the day.\n\n\n\nAs he spoke with voters at a diner, addressed a small house party and\ndelivered pizza to Dartmouth College students on the eve of their finals,\nO\'Malley engaged in exactly the kind of retail politicking analysts say he\nneeds to perfect in order to climb out of the single-digits in polls.\n\n\n\n"I\'ve always been drawn to the toughest of fights," O\'Malley told a group\ngathered in Gilford, N.H., recounting his first run for mayor in 1999.\n\n\n\n"The people I\'ve met in New Hampshire refuse to be intimidated by big\nmoney, pundits, or the concentration of power [and] insisted on meeting\nevery candidate, looking them in the eye, asking them questions and making\nup their own mind," he said.\n\n\n\nO\'Malley is far less well known than either Clinton or Vermont Sen. Bernie\nSanders, the self-described democratic socialist who has carved out space\non Clinton\'s left since announcing his own campaign in April. Perhaps\nbecause of that, O\'Malley made himself perpetually available as he traveled\nthe state \xe2\x80\x94 to voters, to elected officials and to reporters.\n\n\n\nThe informal, less scripted interactions stood in contrast to the view of\nO\'Malley many have seen in national television appearances and the\nsometimes stilted speeches he has delivered during his career.\n\n\n\nAfter eating a few spoonfuls of a cup of Milky Way ice cream, O\'Malley\nworked a small crowd gathered inside the Goldenrod Drive-In Restaurant in\nManchester. He walked from table to table, fielding questions on college\naffordability, the economy and the country\'s nuclear posture.\n\n\n\nHis message appeared to resonate with several people in the room.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t think Hillary\'s a lock," said Peter Morin, a 55-year-old\nManchester resident after speaking briefly with O\'Malley. "I don\'t like to\nsee anyone anointed."\n\n\n\nBut whether O\'Malley\'s focus on his past executive leadership or his\nincreasingly strong admonishments of Wall Street will be enough to build\nmomentum for his campaign is an open question. More than 60 percent of\nDemocrats in New Hampshire identified Clinton as their first choice in a\nBloomberg Politics/Saint Anselm poll in early May.\n\n\n\nO\'Malley was the first choice for 3 percent.\n\n\n\nThe former governor spoke with several dozen Democrats gathered at the home\nof Jerry Slagle, a Maryland native who worked with O\'Malley on Gary Hart\'s\n1984 presidential campaign. He stuck mainly to lines from his announcement\nspeech, but also took questions from attendees.\n\n\n\nAs he spoke from atop a piano bench \xe2\x80\x94- so he could be heard in the back of\nthe room \xe2\x80\x94 O\'Malley did not mention Clinton or Sanders directly. But he\naddressed both of his declared rivals with subtle political code.\n\n\n\nTo draw a distinction with Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 a former secretary of state, senator\nand first lady \xe2\x80\x94 O\'Malley repeatedly described himself as a next-generation\nleader and argued that elections should not be coronations for political\nroyalty. To distance himself from Sanders, he notes he hasn\'t "just talked\nabout" liberal ideals, but has achieved them.\n\n\n\nO\'Malley announced his presidential campaign in Federal Hill Park on\nSaturday, entering a race many believe he has been considering for years.\nDuring his address, O\'Malley cast the election in broad economic terms,\nsuggesting middle class families have not benefited from the recovery as\nmuch as they should have.\n\n\n\nHe reiterated that point in an interview on ABC\'s "This Week" on Sunday,\nwhile also suggesting he is no friend of Wall Street.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t know what Secretary Clinton\'s approach to Wall Street might be.\nShe will run her own campaign and I will run mine," O\'Malley said. "I can\ntell you this. I am not beholden to Wall Street interests. There are no\nWall Street CEOs banging down my door and trying to participate or help my\ncampaign."\n\n\n\nAnother presidential candidate with Maryland ties, former Johns Hopkins\nneurosurgeon Ben Carson, also spoke on the program. The Republican was\nasked about a national poll that showed him tied for first place for his\nparty\'s nomination with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov.\nMike Huckabee, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.\n\n\n\n"Whether I\'m a front-runner or not doesn\'t matter," Carson said. "What\nmatters is that the people themselves are starting to listen and evaluate\nfor themselves rather than listening to what people say I said and what\npeople say that I meant."\n\n\n\n\n\nO\'Malley will spend significant time in early primary states such as Iowa,\nNew Hampshire and South Carolina. That\'s partly because the Iowa caucuses\ndramatically shifted the course of the race for the Democratic nomination\nin 2008, when then-Sen. Barack Obama upset Clinton there by running as a\nchange candidate.\n\n\n\nThe trip Sunday was O\'Malley\'s fourth to New Hampshire this year.\n\n\n\nPatrick Gosselin, a Hooksett, N.H., resident, wondered whether O\'Malley\ncouldn\'t do the same next year. Gosselin spoke with the former governor at\nthe diner for several minutes before revealing that he had come to hear him\nspeak despite never before voting for a Democrat.\n\n\n\n"I\'m tired of the old politics, tired of the Democrats and Republicans\ngetting entrenched with their old ideas," Gosselin said as O\'Malley walked\naway. "It just seems like he has the right personality to challenge the\nstatus quo, to challenge Hillary."\n\n\n\n*Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley is targeting Latino voters\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/06/01/martin-omalley-is-targeting-latino-voters/?wprss=rss_politics>\n// WaPo // Arelis H. Hern\xc3\xa1ndez \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nFormer Maryland governor Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley is making a special effort to\ntarget Latino voters during the first week of his presidential campaign,\nappearing on the Spanish-language television channel Univision, offering\ninterviews on immigration policy to major news outlets and speaking to the\nHispanic Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\n\n"I believe Latino Americans, like all Americans, want the American Dream to\nbe truthful and real,\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Malley (D) told The Washington Post on Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nbelieve my record speaks to my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nImmigration is among the issues where O\xe2\x80\x99Malley has sought to draw\ndistinctions between himself and Hillary Rodham Clinton, the overwhelming\nfront-runner in the Democratic primary race. While he was governor,\nMaryland passed its version of the Dream Act, which extended in-state\ntuition benefits to undocumented immigrants at public universities and\ncolleges provided their families meet certain conditions. The state also\nadopted a two-tiered system that allows undocumented immigrants to get\nlimited driver\'s licenses that can\'t be used for other purposes, such as\nboarding an airplane.\n\n\n\nDuring the battle over the state\'s adoption of the Dream Act, \xe2\x80\x9cwe met every\nweek with O\xe2\x80\x99Malley,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gustavo Torres, executive director of the\nadvocacy group CASA of Maryland.\n\n\n\nIn April, after Clinton announced her support for providing immigrants with\nlimited driver\'s licenses, O\'Malley said he was \xe2\x80\x9cglad she\xe2\x80\x99s come around to\nthat position now, too.\xe2\x80\x9d He declined on Monday to name specific differences\nbetween himself and other Democratic presidential candidates, saying only\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cthe distinctions will be made clear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley said that as president he would \xe2\x80\x9cforge a new consensus\xe2\x80\x9d and\nrevisit the criteria used by law enforcement to lock-up and deport\nimmigrants \xe2\x80\x94 a sticking point for immigrant advocacy groups who have\ncriticized the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s record number of deportations.\n\n\n\nIn a brief interview with Maria Elena Salinas -- the well-known anchor on\nUnivision, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest Spanish-language news network -- O\'Malley\nsaid he doesn\'t think any candidate can win the White House "without the\nLatino vote." Asked what he would want to say to Spanish-speaking voters,\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley replied: \xe2\x80\x9cPor favor,\xe2\x80\x9d or please. The rest of the interview with\nSalinas will air on Univision on Sunday.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley is scheduled to participate in a question-and-answer\nsession with Hispanic Chamber of Commerce president Javier Palomarez at the\nNewseum in Washington. The event is the latest in a series of forums with\npresidential candidates hosted by the organization, which says it\nrepresents 3.2 million Hispanic business owners.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley recently hired Gabriela Domenzain, director of Hispanic media for\nObama\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 campaign, as his director of public engagement. His campaign\nlaunch on Saturday included remarks from Jonathan Jayes-Green, who worked\non the governor\xe2\x80\x99s Hispanic affairs commission and is the son of\nundocumented immigrants.\n\n\n\nJayes-Green said his family came to the United States from Panama in 2005\nand, after receiving erroneous legal advice, overstayed their visas and\nbecame undocumented. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cunderstands we are Americans, we\njust don\xe2\x80\x99t have documentation yet."\n\n\n\nLast summer, O\'Malley clashed with the White House last summer over what to\ndo with migrant children streaming over the border from Central America,\naccusing the Obama administration \xe2\x80\x94 in which Clinton had served \xe2\x80\x94 of being\ntoo eager to return the children.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen refugee children arrive on our doorstep, fleeing starvation and death\ngangs, we don\xe2\x80\x99t turn them away," O\xe2\x80\x99Malley said in South Carolina in April.\n"We act like the generous, compassionate people we have always been.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAt his launch on Saturday, he said \xe2\x80\x9cthe enduring symbol of our nation is\nnot a barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhen he talks about immigration, O\'Malley recalls his own family history of\ncoming to this country from Ireland. As governor, he kept an old sign in\nhis office that says, \xe2\x80\x9cNo Irish Need Apply.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always seen, in the eyes of my Latino neighbors, the eyes of the\ngreat grandparents I never met,\xe2\x80\x9d he said on Monday.\n\n\n\n*Martin O\'Malley\'s ritzy taste can be off-putting\n<http://pagesix.com/2015/06/01/martin-omalleys-ritzy-taste-off-putting-to-some/>\n// Page Six // Richard Johnson \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nMartin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s minions need a primer on populism.\n\n\n\nWhen the Democratic presidential candidate\xe2\x80\x99s team tried to woo Allen\nRoskoff, president of the powerful Jim Owles Democratic Club, they invited\nthe gay activist to breakfast at Norma\xe2\x80\x99s at Le Parker Meridien, where only\nthe 1 percent of tourists can afford to nosh.\n\n\n\nOatmeal is $19, French toast goes for $25 and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Zillion Dollar Lobster\nFrittata\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 with 10 oz. of Sevruga caviar \xe2\x80\x94 costs $1,000.

Martin O\'Malley, who announced Saturday that he will\nofficially seek the Democratic Party\'s nomination for president, continued\ntrying to separate himself from frontrunner Hillary Clinton, telling ABC\nNews Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos during an exclusive interview\nMonday morning that the "times have changed" and pointing to the 2008 crash\non Wall Street as evidence for the country needing a new generation of\nleadership.\n\n\n\nOn the campaign trail, O\'Malley has attacked Clinton for what he says is a\nclose relationship to Wall Street.\n\n\n\nO\'Malley told Stephanopoulos that the "people of the United States, not\nWall Street," should to decide the next president, and leaders on Wall\nStreet allegedly seeming OK with a Clinton or a Bush in the White House\nshould be "wake-up call for all of us."\n\n\n\nIn 2008, O\'Malley supported Clinton\'s first run for president, a fact that\nformer Obama adviser and campaign strategist David Axelrod noted this week\non Twitter, saying, "O\'Malley is a dynamic, accomplished guy. But he was\nall in for HRC [Hillary Rodham Clinton] in \'08, so isn\'t it a bit awkward\nto rail against \'royal families\' now."\n\n\n\nO\'Malley responded by saying the country faces "different challenges now."\nHe told Stephanopoulos the most notable difference between then and now was\nthe 2008 economic crash, adding that since then the country had failed to\nreign in the "excess of Wall Street."\n\n\n\n"I believe we need new leadership," he said. "We need to get things done\nagain."\n\n\n\nHe said that he called Clinton this week and said he told her he was\nlooking forward to "a robust conversation about the issues that face our\ncountry."\n\n\n\nO\'Malley emphasized his experience as an executive, having served two terms\nas mayor of Baltimore and two terms as governor of Maryland. In response to\ncriticism in the Wall Street Journal today that he raised taxes, O\'Malley\nargued that the state enjoyed its highest median income while he was\ngovernor and had a AAA bond rating. He added that the U.S. Chamber of\nCommerce, which "hardly ever says nice things about Democratic elected\nofficials anywhere," named Maryland No. 1 in innovation and\nentrepreneurship three years in a row.\n\n\n\nFor fans of his other talents -- singing and playing guitar -- O\'Malley\nsaid stay tuned.\n\n\n\n"When I go through Iowa and New Hampshire, guitars seem to fall out of the\nrafters," he joked, saying that supporters can expect to see him strumming\nagain soon.\n\n\n\n*Martin O\'Malley\'s Hometown Challenge\n<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/martin-omalleys-hometown-challenge/story?id=31426720>\n// ABC News // Maryalice Parks \xe2\x80\x93 May 31, 2015*\n\n\n\nMartin O\'Malley faces an uphill battle. The former Maryland governor and\nBaltimore mayor who officially announced his run for the Democratic\npresidential nomination Saturday is relatively unknown nationwide, polling\naround 1 percent among Democratic voters across the country, according to a\nnew poll from Quinnipiac University this week. But perhaps his greatest\nchallenge comes from his own backyard.\n\n\n\nDuring his campaign kickoff event Saturday in downtown Baltimore, a small\ngroup of protesters made a scene, speaking out against police brutality and\nblaming O\'Malley for what they see as the negative consequences of his\ntough stance on crime.\n\n\n\n"If he wants to be president, if he wants to come home, he must atone,"\nsaid Tawanda Jones, one of the protesters. "Our streets are not even safe\nno more, because of all of the anger in our city."\n\n\n\nGov. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley Announces Run for President\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley Cites Executive Experience in Comparison to Obama\n\nWhen he first ran for mayor of Baltimore in 1999, O\'Malley promised to cut\ncrime, and when he came into office he instituted a zero-tolerance policing\npolicy. Supporters say that while arrests went up, even for minor offenses,\ncrime came down.\n\n\n\nBut critics say his methods harmed the relationship between the city\'s\nresidents and law enforcement.\n\n\n\nIn an exclusive interview with ABC News\' Chief Anchor George\nStephanopoulos, O\'Malley defended his reputation. "I would not have been\nelected with 91 percent of the vote first time, or re-elected four years\nlater with 88 percent of the vote, if we were not making substantial\nprogress," he said.\n\n\n\n"When I was elected in 1999, our city had become the most violent, and\naddicted, and abandoned city in America. It was a huge challenge. But we\nwent on in the next ten years to achieve the biggest reduction of part one\n[or serious] crime of any city in America," he continued. "For all of the\nprogress that we make, there\'s always so much more that needs to be done."\n\n\n\nLast month the violent protests in Baltimore after the death of an\nAfrican-American man at the hands of police reignited criticism of\nO\'Malley\'s policies. And in a front page article in the Baltimore Sun the\nday of O\'Malley\'s campaign kickoff event, a former head of the city\'s NAACP\nchapter hit the former mayor hard, saying, "He\'s going around now like\n[Baltimore] is his claim to fame. I think this should be his greatest\nembarrassment."\n\n\n\nO\'Malley called the unrest in Baltimore last month "heartbreaking" and said\nthe country should learn from Baltimore and focus on issues like\nunemployment and poverty to rebuild American cities.\n\n\n\n"What took place here was not only about race, not only about policing in\nAmerica. It\'s about everything it is supposed to mean to be an American,"\nhe said during Saturday\'s rally. "The scourge of hopelessness that happened\nto ignite here that evening transcends race or geography. The hard truth of\nour shared reality is this: Unemployment in many American cities and in\nmany small towns across the United States is higher now than it was eight\nyears ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe told Stephanopoulos, "A poet once wrote that the unemployment in our\nbones erupts in our hands and stones. We can do better as a country.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPrior to leaving office as governor in October, O\'Malley\'s approval ratings\nin Maryland were at an eight-year low (41 percent, according to a\nWashington Post poll), though his presidential announcement rally was full\nof energetic elected officials and supporters from across the state.\n\n\n\nOne fan, Baltimore City Councilwoman Rikki Spector, brought a rock with the\nword "Believe" etched in it as a gift for the governor.\n\n\n\nDespite all the controversy she said this was their \xe2\x80\x93 Baltimore\'s \xe2\x80\x93\npresidential race.\n\n\n\n*Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, mild-mannered man: Why the media are yawning\n<http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/01/martin-omalley-mild-mannered-man-why-media-are-yawning/>\n// Fox News // Howard Kurtz \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nOn paper, Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley should be a serious contender for the Democratic\npresidential nomination.\n\n\n\nBut on paper, the Washington Nationals should have won last year\xe2\x80\x99s World\nSeries. And campaigns, like sporting contests, have to be fought in the\nreal world.\n\n\n\nAnd in that world, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley is basically an asterisk\xe2\x80\x94or at least being\ntreated that way by the media. His official announcement on Saturday didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nmake much of a pop.\n\n\n\nThe man was a two-term governor of Maryland and spent seven years as\nBaltimore mayor, but hardly anyone knows who he is. I\xe2\x80\x99ve interviewed him\nand gone to his events and he\xe2\x80\x99s very fluent in policy, but the few outside\npolitics who are familiar with him know him mainly as the model for a\ncharacter in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wire.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHis announcement in Baltimore on Saturday, delivered in shirtsleeves, hit\nall the liberal talking points, but O\xe2\x80\x99Malley has a way of just reading his\nspeeches and there were few emotional high points.\n\n\n\nHis media drought is partly because Hillary Clinton is a million miles\nahead. It\xe2\x80\x99s partly because Bernie Sanders\xe2\x80\x94who might be viewed as more of a\ngadfly candidate\xe2\x80\x94has stolen the spotlight. And it\xe2\x80\x99s partly his own fault.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley is a careful and cautious guy, and that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make him an\ninspiring figure. He has been highly reticent about attacking Hillary,\nlimiting himself to some veiled jabs. And when you do that, you forfeit the\ncoverage you might otherwise get for taking on the front-runner. And you\nfuel suspicions that you\xe2\x80\x99re just running to raise your profile and maybe\nland a job in the next administration.\n\n\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s how the liberal New Republic puts it:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMartin O\'Malley has checked enough boxes as a prominent Democrat\xe2\x80\x94big city\nmayor, mostly successful governor, chairman of the Democratic Governors\nAssociation\xe2\x80\x94that he probably didn\'t expect to be trailing in presidential\npolls to a Vermont senator who serves as an independent and identifies as a\ndemocratic socialist. But for now he does trail, and pretty badly. O\'Malley\nis more dependably liberal than Hillary Clinton has been, but the emergence\nof a crusading progressive like Bernie Sanders has convinced some analysts\nthat O\'Malley miscalculated, and let Sanders steal his thunder.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSanders may be a socialist, but he feels like the leader of a crusade.\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley feels like the head of a good-government association.\n\n\n\nAnd with Sanders polling as high as 15 percent and O\xe2\x80\x99Malley stuck around 1\npercent, it\xe2\x80\x99s all too easy for the press to write him off as a\nloser\xe2\x80\x94especially since his lieutenant governor lost the race last fall to\nRepublican Larry Hogan.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do some progressives tend to dismiss him as a mere technocrat who\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t inspire?\xe2\x80\x9d Politico asks. It\xe2\x80\x99s in part because he\xe2\x80\x99s a policy wonk\nand not a great speaker, as those watching the 2012 Democratic convention\nmay remember.\n\n\n\nThe ex-mayor has the additional burden of being closely identified with\nBaltimore just as Baltimore has become identified with Freddie Gray,\nrioting and surging crime\xe2\x80\x94and questions about O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s zero-tolerance\npolice strategy are being revived. He went to the city after the riots but\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t make much of an imprint on the national conversation. Even some of\nhis longtime allies in the state aren\xe2\x80\x99t backing him.\n\n\n\nOne Baltimore Sun columnist is a big booster:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. O\'Malley, unlike Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, isn\'t linked to\nperpetual scandal and criticism, nor is he beholden to foreign donors,\ninvestment banks or a family surname.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPerhaps O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, who worked for Gary Hart in 1984, envisions catching fire\nif Hillary stumbles. But he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to raise the temperature for\nthat to happen.\n\n\n\n*What are Martin O\'Malley\'s chances of being Mr. Liberal 2016?\n<http://news.yahoo.com/martin-omalleys-chances-being-mr-liberal-2016-162129951.html>\n// Yahoo News // Peter Grier \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nElizabeth Warren isn\xe2\x80\x99t running. The left has tried and tried, but the\nanti-Wall Street firebrand senator from Massachusetts just isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to\nchallenge Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Party presidential nomination.\nProgressives have moved on, for the most part. They\xe2\x80\x99re looking for another\nstandard-bearer. So who\xe2\x80\x99s going to end up as Mr. (or Ms.) Liberal 2016?\n\n\n\nBill de Blasio seems to be auditioning for the role. The New York City\nmayor has lately had an active national travel schedule. But his quest\nseems quixotic \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99s only been in office 16 months. Plus, he\xe2\x80\x99s got\ntroubles back home.\n\n\n\nMartin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley might be more likely. He announced his run Saturday, and\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s going to try and position himself to Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s left. The former\nMaryland governor had a quiet meeting with a group of key progressives in\nNew York City in May and promoted himself as Warren-like, but actually in\nthe race. He said he opposes President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Trans-Pacific Partnership\ntrade deal. That\xe2\x80\x99s a litmus test for liberals.\n\n\n\nBut as far as the left is concerned Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley might be a\nMartin-come-lately. His ideology seemed more moderate when he served as\ngovernor, which is unsurprising since state chief executives have to be\npragmatic, even in a blue state. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s charisma gap. When\nyou hear him speak, \xe2\x80\x9cfirebrand\xe2\x80\x9d isn\xe2\x80\x99t a word that comes to mind, as it does\nwith Ms. Warren.\n\n\n\nSo we\xe2\x80\x99ll go with the safe choice here: Bernie Sanders. The white-haired,\narticulate Vermont senator seems the favorite to win liberals\xe2\x80\x99 hearts. He\xe2\x80\x99s\nalready declared his presidential intentions, and he\xe2\x80\x99s long resided at the\nleft edge of the Democratic Party \xe2\x80\x93 or just beyond it. He\xe2\x80\x99s the only\nsitting US lawmaker who uses the word \xe2\x80\x9csocialist\xe2\x80\x9d to describe himself.\n\n\n\nMr. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s liberal bent was on full display in a recent Reddit Q-and-A.\nHe wants public college education to be tuition-free. He said National\nSecurity Agency surveillance was \xe2\x80\x9cOrwellian\xe2\x80\x9d and that the country needs a\nconstitutional amendment to limit political campaign contributions. He\nadvocated a guaranteed basic income and said climate change \xe2\x80\x9cis the most\nsignificant planetary crisis we face.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSanders is running at nearly 9 percent in HuffPost Pollster\xe2\x80\x99s rolling\naverage of Democratic nomination surveys. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley gets about 2 percent.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s early, but we\xe2\x80\x99d say that\xe2\x80\x99s indicative.\n\n\n\n*New Evidence That Bernie Sanders Is Gaining Ground in One Key State\n<http://mic.com/articles/119798/here-s-new-evidence-that-bernie-sanders-is-gaining-ground-in-one-key-state?utm_source=policymicTWTR&utm_medium=main&utm_campaign=social>\n// Policy.Mic // Zeeshan Aleem \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nPresidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is conventionally\nconsidered to be a long-shot candidate for the Democratic nomination. But\nthere are new signs that his message has been resonating in the crucial\nstate of Iowa since kicking off his campaign in Burlington, Vermont, last\nweek.\n\n\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the hard-charging populist from Vermont\ncan already claim a noteworthy achievement. Last week, he attracted a crowd\nof 700 people in Davenport, Iowa, in what the New York Times notes is the\n"the largest rally in the state for any single candidate this campaign\nseason, and far more than the 50 people who attended a rally there on\nSaturday with former Gov. Martin O\'Malley of Maryland."\n\n\n\nSanders also generated other lively turnouts in the state on his first\nvisit to Iowa since declaring his candidacy. In Ames, he drew a crowd that\nspilled out of a brewery, and held an event in Kensett where the size of\nthe crowd exceeded the population of the town itself, according to the New\nYork Times.\n\n\n\nThe spike in attention is reflected in recent polling. According to a new\nBloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register poll of Iowa voters, Sanders has\nmore than tripled his support among likely Democratic caucus-goers than he\nwas in January, with 16% of likely caucus-goers saying Sanders is their\nfirst choice.\n\n\n\nAs you can see in the chart below, courtesy of Bloomberg Politics, Clinton\nis dominant among likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa \xe2\x80\x94 she\'s the first\nchoice for 57% (one percentage point more than in January). Sanders ranks\nsecond at 16% \xe2\x80\x94 still far from Clinton, but notable for the leap from 5% in\nJanuary. Vice President Joe Biden, who has not made any overt signals that\nhe\'s considering a bid for the White House, came in next at 8%. Former\nMaryland Gov. Martin O\'Malley was the first choice for 2%, as was former\nVirginia Sen. Jim Webb.\n\n\n\nThe Iowa caucuses, which are scheduled to be held in February, are the\nfirst contest of the presidential race, and mark a critical juncture for\ndetermining momentum in the early stages of the nomination race. Given that\nthe voting is several months away, the specific numbers right now aren\'t as\nimportant as their changes.\n\n\n\nSanders\' big bump in recent months reflects a hunger among the Democratic\nelectorate for a candidate who can serve as an alternative to the Clinton\ndynasty. The self-avowed democratic socialist doesn\'t have a history in the\nnational spotlight, but he is the king of Reddit, and he has quickly taken\nthe anti-establishment mantle from Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts,\nwho shows no signs of interest in running for president.\n\n\n\nSanders still has his work cut out for him. While Clinton\'s campaign\nalready has 30 paid staffers devoted to mobilizing caucus-goers in Iowa,\nSanders only has two, according to the New York Times. If Sanders is to\nevolve into a formidable player, his organizing apparatus will have to\nmatch the size of his ambitions.\n\n\n\nToward that end, Sanders has called for additional early presidential\ndebates this year, which would include both Democrats and Republicans. The\ndebates would provide him with a major (and free) opportunity to make his\ncase to the public in direct contrast to Clinton, and facilitate his\nability to shed the label of outsider nipping at the heels of an inevitable\nheir to the throne. According to the Huffington Post, any such debates\nmight be in violation of debate rules for Democratic candidates. Clinton is\nunlikely to benefit from such an arrangement, and her strategy so far has\nlargely been to ignore Sanders\' criticism. But as she knows all too well\nfrom 2008, she can never take her lead for granted.\n\n\n\n*Bernie Sanders pleads for more debates\n<http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/06/bernie-sanders-pleads-for-more-debates-208036.html>\n// Politico // Dylan Byers \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders has sent a letter to the\nDemocratic National Committee requesting more primary debates, including\ninter-party debates among candidates from both parties.\n\n\n\nIn a letter to DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Vermont\nsocialist argued that the candidates "should engage in a series of debates\nbeginning this summer," in order to increase voter turnout. Inter-party\ndebates could also be used to convince registered Republican voters that\nthey would be better off voting for a Democrat, Sanders said.\n\n\n\n"I am extremely concerned by the fact that many working-class Americans are\nvoting against their best economic interests by supporting right-wing\nRepublicans whose agenda represents the interests of the billionaire class,\nand not the needs of working Americans," Sanders wrote. "I believe that\nthese inter-party debates would put in dramatic focus the shallow and at\ntimes ridiculous policies and proposals being advocated by the Republican\ncandidates and by their party\xe2\x80\x99s platform."\n\n\n\nFor Sanders, a relatively little-known candidate with limited resources,\nmore debates would mean more free air time and publicity. Sanders is\ncurrently polling 54.8 points behind Hillary Clinton in the latest\nRealClearPolitics aggregate.\n\n\n\nIn an email to the On Media blog, DNC spokesperson Holly Shulman\neffectively put the kibosh on Sanders\' request: "We\xe2\x80\x99re thrilled to see the\nSenator is eager to participate in our debates," she wrote. "We\xe2\x80\x99ve already\nreleased our primary debate framework, and we believe that six debates will\ngive plenty of opportunity for the candidates to be seen side-by-side.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details in the coming weeks, and we look forward to Senator\nSanders and other candidates participating. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there will be plenty\nof other forums for the candidates to make their case to voters, and that\nthey will make the most out of every opportunity."\n\n\n\nThe DNC has sanctioned six primary debates for the 2016 cycle, which are\nscheduled to begin this fall. Host states will include the early caucus and\nprimary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, though\nthe committee has yet to announce which national broadcast media and local\nmedia outlets will sponsor and moderate these debates.\n\n\n\nBoth the Hillary Clinton and Martin O\'Malley campaigns have confirmed that\ntheir candidates will participate in all six of the debates.\n\n\n\nIn his plea for more debates, Sanders argued that low voter turnout "has\nhurt progressive candidates all across our nation" and that "a larger\nnumber of debates beginning in the weeks ahead would encourage such voter\nparticipation."\n\n\n\nSanders also said inter-party debates between Democrats and Republicans\nwould "serve to engage large numbers of voters who typically do not pay\nattention to the process until much later when the general election begins\nto come into focus. By engaging these voters early and raising the stakes\naround the election I believe we can get people to participate at higher\nlevels which will undoubtedly benefit Democrats up and down the ticket."\n\n\n\n*GOP*\n\n\n\n*Lindsey Graham on the Issues\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/us/politics/lindsey-graham-republican-presidential-candidate-on-the-issues.html?rref=politics&module=Ribbon&version=context&region=Header&action=click&contentCollection=Politics&pgtype=article>\n// NYT // Gerry Mullany- June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina announced Monday that he plans to\nseek the Republican nomination for president. In his three terms, he has\nfocused on military and foreign affairs and developed a reputation for\nworking together with Senate Democrats. Here are some of Mr. Graham\xe2\x80\x99s\nstands on important issues.\n\n\n\nForeign Policy\n\n\n\nMr. Graham has been skeptical of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to reach a deal\nwith Iran over its nuclear program, saying Congress should reject any\nagreement that does not include inspections of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s military facilities.\nHe sees the group calling itself the Islamic State as a threat to the\nmainland United States, saying \xe2\x80\x9cthe likelihood of an attack against our\nnation is growing by the day\xe2\x80\x9d and calling it a \xe2\x80\x9cfantasy\xe2\x80\x9d to think that it\ncan be defeated without American ground forces. Describing Israel as the\n\xe2\x80\x9cbest friend\xe2\x80\x9d of the United States, Mr. Graham has vowed that if the United\nNations takes actions against Israel\xe2\x80\x99s interest he will use his powers in\nCongress to cut Washington\xe2\x80\x99s financial support of the organization. He has\nsaid the United States should provide lethal weaponry to the Ukrainian\nmilitary to battle Russian-backed separatists, a step the Obama\nadministration has resisted.\n\n\n\nEnvironment\n\n\n\nUnlike other Republican presidential contenders, Mr. Graham believes that\nclimate change is a problem and that it is caused by human activity. But he\nis concerned about using federal laws to curb greenhouse-gas emissions,\nsaying he wants to make an issue of whether \xe2\x80\x9cyou have to destroy the\neconomy to solve the problem\xe2\x80\x9d of global warming.\n\n\n\nSame-Sex Marriage\n\n\n\nHe has supported a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a\nman and a woman. Mr. Graham has spoken out against the possibility that the\nSupreme Court could strike down same-sex marriage bans, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the\nlegal difference between a ban on same-sex marriage being unconstitutional\nbut a ban on polygamy being constitutional?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nImmigration\n\n\n\nMr. Graham differs from many of his fellow Republican contenders in that he\nis a strong proponent of making it possible for immigrants who are in the\ncountry illegally to become citizens. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were president of the United\nStates, I would veto any bill that did not have a pathway to citizenship,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe told USA Today, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cYou would have a long, hard path to\ncitizenship.\xe2\x80\x9d He says Republicans have been losing Hispanic support because\nof hostility toward immigrants.\n\n\n\nEconomy and Budget Issues\n\n\n\nMr. Graham supported giving Mr. Obama \xe2\x80\x9cfast track\xe2\x80\x9d authority to negotiate\nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. He opposed the president\xe2\x80\x99s $789\nbillion stimulus package in 2009. He believes the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s debt\nlimit should be increased only when that is accompanied by spending cuts,\nbut he has not ruled out tax increases, as many other Republicans have.\n\n\n\n*Lindsey Graham, in announcing White House run, gets personal\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/lindsey-graham-2016-presidential-election-announcing-bid-118489.html#ixzz3bpsFTrnZ>\n// Politico // Katie Glueck \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nCENTRAL, S.C. \xe2\x80\x94 He\xe2\x80\x99s spent a third of his life in Congress and is a fixture\non the Sunday morning news-show circuit, making nearly 70 appearances in\nthe past five years.\n\n\n\nBut as he announced his presidential bid Monday here in the tiny town where\nhe grew up, Lindsey Graham sought to knock down the idea that he\xe2\x80\x99s a\ncreature of Washington and instead told a personal story that\xe2\x80\x99s largely\nbeen overlooked over the course of his two decades in the House and Senate.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the tale of a son of pool-hall owners, who grew up near-impoverished\nin the back room of his parents\xe2\x80\x99 bar. As a college student, he raised, and\neventually adopted, his little sister after their parents died, before\ngoing on to have a career as an Air Force lawyer and then rising to become\nSouth Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s senior senator.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose of you who\xe2\x80\x99ve known me a long time know I had some ups and downs as\na young man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI lost my parents, and had to struggle financially\nand emotionally \xe2\x80\xa6 There are a lot of so-called \xe2\x80\x98self-made\xe2\x80\x99 people in this\nworld. I\xe2\x80\x99m not one of them. My family, friends, neighbors and my faith\npicked me up when I was down, believed in me when I had doubts. You made me\nthe man I am today.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGraham\xe2\x80\x99s sister, Darline Graham Nordone, spoke proudly of her brother and\nlate parents during a brief interview Sunday night before Graham\xe2\x80\x99s\nwalk-through.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur parents were small-business owners here in the town of Central,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cAs any other small-business owners, they understood the long hard\nhours that go into running a small business, and just the strong work ethic\nthat we got from that and the values \xe2\x80\xa6 It\xe2\x80\x99s just amazing that we come from\nthis and went on to bigger and better things, but our roots are here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe humble-origins narrative is a staple of presidential campaigning, but\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a fairly new device for Graham, who has only started to employ it in\nrecent years. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until his 2014 Senate race, when he squared off\nwith six primary challengers, that he slowly and sometimes reluctantly\nbegan to use that part of his biography in part to fight back against\ncriticism that he had been in Washington too long.\n\n\n\nNow, as a long-shot presidential candidate, Graham once again told that\nstory in this sleepy speck of a town located about 45 minutes from\nGreenville, where Main Street consists of a thrift shop, a hair salon, and\na restaurant or two \xe2\x80\x94 including the remnants of the Graham family\xe2\x80\x99s bar.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea for people to realize, he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a\nself-educated, self-made guy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hank Scott, a major donor who is very\nclose to Graham. \xe2\x80\x9cHe worked hard to get where he is, he\xe2\x80\x99s not a person that\ngrew up with privilege, like, say, [Jeb] Bush.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDavid Woodard, an operative and professor who managed Graham\xe2\x80\x99s first two\nHouse races in the 1990s, said he never heard Graham talk about his\nfamily\xe2\x80\x99s troubles, even when those issues were fresher for him.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he talk about it? No, he never talked about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Woodard said, adding\nlater, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a self-made story, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDuring his reelection last year, after some reluctance about getting too\npersonal, Graham allowed his team to run an ad featuring his sister,\nDarline, who grew emotional in the spot when she reflected on how Graham\nhelped raise her.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was hard when we lost my mom and my dad,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in the ad. \xe2\x80\x9cLindsey\nassured me that he was going to take care of me, he was going to be there\nfor me. He never let me down. Never. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how he did it, to take on\nthe responsibility of raising a little sister. That came from within for\nLindsey.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGraham won that race just as he\xe2\x80\x99s won every congressional contest in which\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s run, starting in 1994, many of them with the help of South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s\ntop political talent. Yet as he begins his run for president, many of them\nare not on board. When he indicated he was serious about running for\npresident, many of the state\xe2\x80\x99s most well-respected operatives were caught\noff guard \xe2\x80\x94and had already agreed to help other candidates.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been involved in all of his Senate campaigns, and it was tough, but\nmy ship has sailed,\xe2\x80\x9d said J. Warren Tompkins, a veteran South Carolina\noperative who is committed to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. \xe2\x80\x9cI had committed\nlong before I had any inkling he had any interest in running for president.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn some state political circles, even where Graham is popular, there\xe2\x80\x99s a\nsense of bewilderment about why he\xe2\x80\x99s running \xe2\x80\x94 and some donors and\noperatives say privately that they wish he\xe2\x80\x99d stick to the Senate. In a very\ncrowded Republican field, Graham barely registers in the national polls; he\nhas low name identification and his record on issues like immigration\nreform is still anathema to the grassroots conservative voters who are so\ncritical in early-voting states like Iowa.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll always be supporting Lindsey any and every way I can,\xe2\x80\x9d said Scott,\nthe donor, whose own divided loyalty is revealing \xe2\x80\x94 he says he\xe2\x80\x99s supporting\nboth his friend and Rubio. Noting how crowded the field is, \xe2\x80\x9cI tried to\nencourage him to play the Strom Thurmond role and stay in the Senate,\xe2\x80\x9d\nScott added.\n\n\n\nIn his announcement speech Monday, Graham highlighted his national security\ncredentials, another reminder that pushing a more assertive foreign policy\nis the core rationale for his run.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to be president to defeat the enemies trying to kill us, not just\npenalize them or criticize them or contain them, but defeat them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how well Graham is polling in South Carolina presidential\nsurveys \xe2\x80\x94an NBC News poll from February found him leading the pack but an\nApril poll from local Winthrop University reported that more than half of\nhis home state GOP voters would not considering voting for him for the\nnomination.\n\n\n\nHis South Carolina political colleagues aren\xe2\x80\x99t lined up behind him either:\nGOP Gov. Nikki Haley has said she won\xe2\x80\x99t be making any early endorsements\nand several of the state\xe2\x80\x99s House members appeared at a presidential launch\nevent for Rand Paul \xe2\x80\x94 Graham\xe2\x80\x99s nemesis on foreign policy matters \xe2\x80\x94 though\nthey stopped short of endorsing.\n\n\n\nGraham\xe2\x80\x99s supporters believe he will play a key role in pushing national\nsecurity issues to the forefront, and that the senator \xe2\x80\x94 who at Republican\ncattle calls so far this year has impressed with his sense of humor and\ncommand of foreign policy \xe2\x80\x94 will expand his base as more people get to know\nhim. He\xe2\x80\x99s a natural, folksy campaigner and his hawkish foreign policy\nmessage plays well with a Republican base that\xe2\x80\x99s grown increasingly anxious\nabout instability in the Middle East and the rise of ISIS.\n\n\n\nDespite the seemingly impossible path to the GOP nomination, Graham\xe2\x80\x99s\nallies insist he is seriously interested in pursuing a White House bid and\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t run if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t see a path to victory, even as speculation\nabounds in South Carolina about whether he\xe2\x80\x99s positioning for another job,\nlike secretary of defense, or to be a kingmaker during the\nfirst-in-the-South South Carolina primary.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, a super PAC supporting Graham, Security is Strength, is\nalso gearing up and announced its staff over the weekend.

Quite\nlow-energy for an announcement speech, although the typical Southern crowd\nwhooped, cheered, and applauded throughout, allowing Graham to piggyback on\ntheir liveliness. Kept unscripted asides to a minimum (for him).\n\n\n\nSubstance: Heavy rhetorical emphasis on signature issues such as fighting\nterror, building alliances around the world, and enacting entitlement\nreform, but not much specifics there or anywhere else.\n\n\n\nBest moment: Jazzed the audience by declaring he has more foreign policy\nexperience than everyone else in the race, including Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nWorst moment: Lapsed into reading his text for several minutes in the\nmiddle of his remarks, further sapping momentum.\n\n\n\nOverall: The national security candidate chose to make national security\nthe center of his announcement by starting with it, seeding it throughout,\nand ending with it. While he talked about working with Democrats, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nemphasize his past efforts on immigration reform and climate change, which\nhave put him out of step with the party base. Instead, he focused on his\nlong-time fidelity to the three-legged Reagan stool of national security,\nsocial issues, and the economy. The whole event felt more like a personal\nmoment for Graham than the launching of a national movement, and he did not\nsummon the determined air of someone who thinks he can actually win. Still,\nit was a well-written speech, and he can move on to life as an official\ncandidate, where fundraising and poll challenges await.\n\n\n\nStyle: B- Substance: B- Overall: B-\n\n\n\nNote: The overall grade is not an average of the style and substance\ngrades, but takes into account other aspects of the announcement, such as\nstaging and crowd reaction.

Graham beat Democratic state Sen.\nBrad Hutto of Orangeburg. (AP Photo/Rainier Ehrhardt)\n\nAs a native South Carolinian, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy could\nshake up that early-voting state\xe2\x80\x99s primary.\n\n\n\nBut that\'s not the same thing as shaking up the presidential race.\n\n\n\nGraham certainly carries an advantage in The Palmetto State, where his name\nrecognition is nearly universal after having serving the state as U.S.\nsenator for more than 12 years. And a February NBC News/Marist poll of\nSouth Carolina voters showed Graham leading the GOP pack with 17 percent\nsupport. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) followed Graham with 15\npercent, while Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) placed third with 12\npercent.*\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a guy like me, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty simple,\xe2\x80\x9d Graham recently told Time\nMagazine. \xe2\x80\x9cI do well in Iowa and finish in the top tier in New Hampshire,\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll win South Carolina. By the end of South Carolina there are three or\nfour people left at the most.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn other words, the strategy is: 1) Don\'t tank in Iowa or New Hampshire. 2)\nCome in strong in the home state. 3) ???\n\n\n\nAs of now, Graham is barely registering in polls anywhere else, including\nstates he would need to compete in in the later stages of the Republican\nprimary process. But let\'s start with Step 1.\n\n\n\nA WMUR Granite State poll of likely New Hampshire voters has him far behind\nmost of his would-be rivals, carrying the support of just around 1 percent\nof primary voters. For context, former Florida governor Jeb Bush leads the\npack with 15 percent. Meanwhile, even longshot candidate Donald Trump has 5\npercent.**\n\n\n\nAnd in Iowa, Graham is the first-choice candidate for just 1 percent of\nlikely GOP voters, according to a May Des Moines Register poll.*** He\ncompletely fails to register in another poll by Quinnipiac.\n\n\n\nHistory doesn\'t seem to be on Graham\'s side either. Presidential candidates\nwho hail from early voting states have frequently failed to make a splash\nnationwide and have also occasionally been met with resistance from\nin-state allies who fear their state\'s primary could be rendered irrelevant\nby a home grown contender.\n\n\n\nPut another way: in the modern era, there has never been a presidential\nnominee who hailed from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, or Nevada.\n\n\n\nConsider former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack, who made a short-lived run for\nthe 2008 Democratic nomination but quickly dropped out of the race \xe2\x80\x93 ending\nhis campaign in February of 2007. Though Vilsack stood a strong chance of\nwinning the caucuses if he had stayed in the race, Hillary Clinton and\nBarack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s fundraising strength proved to be an intractable challenge\nnationwide. For what it\'s worth, The Iowa Democratic Party responded to\nVilsack\'s candidacy by promising to remain neutral for fear that Vilsack\xe2\x80\x99s\ncandidacy would discourage candidates from competing in the state.\n\n\n\nWhen former New Hampshire senator Bob Smith ran for the 2000 GOP nomination\n\xe2\x80\x93 also as a longshot \xe2\x80\x93 New Hampshire Republicans balked at the thought of\nthe Granite State losing its sacred status as a must-compete contest. He\ntoo dropped out before the primaries actually began.\n\n\n\nIowa\'s Tom Harkin, who retired from the Senate last year, ran for the\nDemocratic nomination in 1992 and swept the Iowa contest, receiving the\nsupport of nearly 80 percent of caucusgoers. But in New Hampshire the next\nweek, Harkin took just 10 percent of the vote.\n\n\n\nOf course, Graham\'s candidacy will largely rest on his clearly-defined,\nhawkish foreign policy positions in an election where foreign affairs have\nalready taken center stage. That could bode well for him, particularly as\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul\'s strong critique of GOP hawks presents a\nheadline-grabbing foil for Graham to pit himself against.\n\n\n\n*The NBC News/Marist survey of 450 likely South Carolina GOP voters has a\nmargin of error of plus or minus 4.6 percentage points.\n\n\n\n**The WMUR survey of 293 likely GOP primary voters has a margin of error of\nplus or minus 5.7 percent.\n\n\n\n***That survey of 402 likely caucusgoers was conducted between May 25 to\nMay 29 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina Sen.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced a long-shot\npresidential campaign in his small home town on Monday predicated on\naggressively confronting threats from the Islamic State and Iran abroad.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure no one here, including me, ever expected to hear me say,\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m Lindsey Graham, and I\xe2\x80\x99m running for president of the United States,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe told a cheering crowd of dozens of flag-waving supporters gathered just\nsteps from the former pool hall on Main Street that he grew up in.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to talk about Graham\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy without mentioning his\nideological archrival, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), whose libertarian approach\nto civil liberties, dovish take on military conflict and deep skepticism of\nan active foreign policy runs directly counter to the South Carolina\nlawmaker\xe2\x80\x99s own stance.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to be president to defeat the enemies that are trying to kill us,\xe2\x80\x9d\nGraham said in his announcement.\n\n\n\nBoth candidates seem eager to play the mongoose to the other\xe2\x80\x99s snake as the\n2016 presidential campaign heats up. Their conflict reached its peak in\nrecent days after Paul successfully forced the temporary expiration of\nPATRIOT Act provisions that govern, among other things, the phone record\nspy program revealed by Edward Snowden. Graham favors a maximalist approach\nto counterterrorism.\n\n\n\nPaul frequently fires up supporters by quoting Graham\xe2\x80\x99s latest jingoisms on\nthe trail \xe2\x80\x93 this week he criticized Graham\xe2\x80\x99s boast that he would drone\nstrike an American citizen suspected of terrorism rather than \xe2\x80\x9ccall a\njudge.\xe2\x80\x9d During Paul\xe2\x80\x99s PATRIOT Act filibuster, Graham gave an eye roll\nworthy of the surliest teenager and a clip of it from a live C-Span\nbroadcast went viral. Paul went on to lambast the \xe2\x80\x9ceye roll caucus\xe2\x80\x9d in an\ne-mail to supporters last week and a pro-Paul super PAC responded with a\nweb ad going after Graham.\n\n\n\nGraham didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention Paul directly in his announcement Monday, but he\nalluded to conflicts with rival lawmakers back in Washington.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve made some dangerous mistakes in recent years,\xe2\x80\x9d Graham said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nObama administration and some of my colleagues in Congress have substituted\nwishful thinking for sound national security strategy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGraham boasted that he has \xe2\x80\x9cmore experience with our national security then\nany other candidate in this race \xe2\x80\x93 that includes you, Hillary.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe tension put USC senior Anna Chapman, 21, in an awkward spot. A devoted\nPaul supporter, she volunteered at the event as a favor to her fellow\nCollege Republicans.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m here to support Graham \xe2\x80\xa6 kind of,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is from South\nCarolina, it\xe2\x80\x99s cool that he\xe2\x80\x99s running. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to bash him, but I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to win the nomination.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nForeign affairs may be Graham\xe2\x80\x99s calling card, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hardly all he\xe2\x80\x99s\nknown for. At times he has split from GOP conservatives to broker\nbipartisan deals, most notably as co-author of the immigration reform bill\nthat passed the Senate in 2013 but never came up for a vote in the House\namid intense conservative opposition. Graham\xe2\x80\x99s speech included a message\nfor fellow Democrats, whom he pledged to work with the to make progress on\nareas of agreement should he win the White House.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur differences are real and we\xe2\x80\x99ll debate them, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not my enemy,\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re my fellow countrymen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nLanguage like this appealed to attendees like Jim Eshelman, an engineer in\nGreenville, who is interested in Graham but still not committed to backing\nhim.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love his spirit of bipartisanship \xe2\x80\x93 the gridlock has been awful,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid.\n\n\n\nGraham\xe2\x80\x99s advisers also see potential in showcasing his humble roots, which\n2016 candidates like Scott Walker and Marco Rubio have used to great effect\nin campaign speeches to connect with voters. The senator grew up in the\nback of a bar owned by his parents, who died within 15 months of each other\nwhile he was in his early 20s, leaving him to raise his younger sister\nhimself. Graham put himself through law school and took officer training in\nthe Air Force, where he ended up serving as a judge advocate.\n\n\n\nGraham, who was introduced by his sister, mentioned the Social Security\nbenefits he received after his parents\xe2\x80\x99 death in pledging to reform the\nprogram to sustain it in the long term.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs president I will gladly do what it takes to save the program that once\nsaved my family,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nA fixture on Sunday political talk shows, Graham is among the most\nprominent and frequently quoted lawmakers in the national media on a\nvariety of issues. Despite his high visibility, he\xe2\x80\x99s considered well short\nof the top tier in the presidential race, and polls show he may have a\ntough time qualifying for primary debates, which will choose participants\nbased on their support in national surveys.\n\n\n\nHe may have a bigger impact in South Carolina, however, a crucial early\nprimary state that helped galvanize conservative opposition to Mitt Romney\nin 2012 by going for Newt Gingrich and sealed John McCain\xe2\x80\x99s nomination in\n2008 against Mike Huckabee.\n\n\n\nMany of the supporters who gathered here on Monday knew Graham personally\nor mentioned his dedicated constituent work. He once threatened to shut\ndown the Senate to fast track a project deepening a major port. This\nattention to detail back home helped keep him safe from primary threats in\nhis easy 2014 re-election despite major tea party opposition.\n\n\n\nVendors at the rally sold \xe2\x80\x9cLindsey Graham: Native Son\xe2\x80\x9d buttons. If he takes\neven a sizable minority of votes, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible he could peel votes from\nother candidates in a way that affects the race. In 2008, for example,\nformer Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson was widely credited with pushing McCain\npast the finish line by splitting southern conservative support with\nHuckabee.\n\n\n\n*The Lindsey Graham record: A lot like John McCain, who also ran for\npresident\n<https://www.yahoo.com/politics/the-lindsey-graham-record-a-lot-like-john-mccain-120369603781.html>\n// Yahoo News // Meredith Shiner \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina will become the\nfifth sitting senator to formally announce a presidential bid, but his\nbiggest challenge to prove he\xe2\x80\x99s a viable candidate likely won\xe2\x80\x99t come\ndirectly from the crowded field of colleagues he\xe2\x80\x99s currently running\nagainst. It will be from the one senator who already has waged (and lost)\nmultiple bids for the White House: John McCain of Arizona.\n\n\n\nFor those who follow congressional politics, Graham and McCain have been\ninseparable \xe2\x80\x94 and practically indistinguishable \xe2\x80\x94 from each other for more\nthan a decade, since Graham arrived to the Senate in 2003. Graham is often\nspotted just feet from the Senate floor, barking into a flip phone to a\nstaffer about coordinating press strategy with McCain, meaning that\n\xe2\x80\x9cStatement by Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham on [foreign policy\nissue X]\xe2\x80\x9d is a frequent refrain in reporters\xe2\x80\x99 mailboxes. A search of\nMcCain\xe2\x80\x99s Senate website, for example , found 239 press releases mentioning\n\xe2\x80\x9cLindsey Graham\xe2\x80\x9d since 2005, many of which are from the past two years.\n\n\n\nGraham and McCain also make up the core two-thirds of a group known\ncolloquially in Washington as the \xe2\x80\x9cThree Amigos,\xe2\x80\x9d which basically is a\nsmall nucleus of senators who have consistently advocated for more U.S.\nmilitary intervention in the Middle East and have been searching for a\npermanent third \xe2\x80\x9camigo\xe2\x80\x9d since \xe2\x80\x9cfriend\xe2\x80\x9d Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., left the\nSenate in 2013. A Graham bid now completes an unofficial fraternity\npledging ritual for the original group\xe2\x80\x99s triumvirate: a presidential run.\n\n\n\nWith a 2016 Graham campaign, four of the last five presidential elections\nhave featured an \xe2\x80\x9camigo\xe2\x80\x9d vying for a place at the top of the ticket\n(Lieberman, 2004; McCain, 2000, 2008). But there\xe2\x80\x99s no requirement for\nsuccess in this political hazing process. Only once has a major party\nselected an amigo as its nominee \xe2\x80\x94 McCain in 2008 \xe2\x80\x94 and America has never\nelected one as president.\n\n\n\n*Little Sister Lauds Lindsey Graham, the Bachelor, for Raising Her\n<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/01/little-sister-lauds-lindsey-graham-the-bachelor-for-raising-her/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog%20Main&contentCollection=Politics&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body>\n// NYT // Alan Rappeport \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nCENTRAL, S.C. \xe2\x80\x94 If elected, Senator Lindsey Graham would be the first\nbachelor to win the White House since Grover Cleveland. But that does not\nmean he will be on the campaign trail without any family members in tow.\n\n\n\nMr. Graham, 59, a Republican who is a hawk on foreign policy, featured his\nrelatives prominently at his announcement here on Monday \xe2\x80\x94 none more so\nthan his sister, Darline Graham Nordone, who introduced him. Ms. Nordone\ndid her best to show Mr. Graham\xe2\x80\x99s softer side by sharing stories of how he\ntaught her to ride a bicycle and recalling the pain of losing both their\nparents, one after the other, at young ages.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLindsey was always my parent,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Nordone said in an interview in the bar\non Main Street that their family once owned. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no doubt in my mind\nor anyone else\xe2\x80\x99s mind that Lindsey was my guardian.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Graham and his sister grew up in a small room behind the bar, which was\nthen known as the Sanitary Cafe. They eventually moved into a trailer and\nthen into a house next door. In 1976, when he was 20 and his sister was 11,\ntheir mother died of Hodgkin\xe2\x80\x99s lymphoma; 15 months later, their father died\nof a heart attack.\n\n\n\nMs. Nordone said she had kept a low profile during her brother\xe2\x80\x99s previous\ncampaigns, but that she would be willing to attend events with him now and\ndo anything she could to help him win the White House.\n\n\n\nA mother of two whose occupation is helping people with disabilities find\njobs, Ms. Nordone said that her brother\xe2\x80\x99s sense of responsibility, in\ncaring for her, was why he had never married.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a young man taking on a young girl and teenager to raise,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was just dedicating all of that time to raising me and going to\nschool and trying to get an education. There\xe2\x80\x99s just only so much time in a\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Graham later became his sister\xe2\x80\x99s legal guardian while he was in the Air\nForce, allowing her to qualify for his military benefits.\n\n\n\nMr. Graham\xe2\x80\x99s bachelorhood has been seized upon by his political opponents\nbefore, most recently last year, when a little-known conservative primary\nchallenger called him \xe2\x80\x9cambiguously gay.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMs. Nordone said that such personal attacks were hard for her to take, but\nthat she tried to tune out criticism of her brother \xe2\x80\x94 while showing people\nthat Mr. Graham was much more than a politician.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s kind of like a brother, a father and a mother rolled into one,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid.\n\n\n\n*Paul: I was exaggerating on my terror attack claim\n<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/rand-paul-exaggerating-my-terror-attack-claim>\n// MSNBC //Aliyah Frumin and Anthony Terrell \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nSen. Rand Paul is backtracking on a controversial suggestion he made over\nthe weekend: that his opponents secretly want a terrorist attack on the\nU.S. so they can pin the blame on the Kentucky lawmaker and Republican\npresidential candidate.\n\n\n\nWhen Paul was asked during a Monday morning appearance on Fox News who he\nwas referring to when he made the comment on the Senate floor Sunday, the\nsenator said, \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes in the heat of a battle, hyperbole can get the\nbetter of anyone, and that may be the problem there.\xe2\x80\x9d He added, \xe2\x80\x9cThe point\nI was trying to make is that I think people do use fear to try to get us to\ngive up our liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe National Security Agency\xe2\x80\x99s controversial surveillance program allowing\nthe government to collect Americans\xe2\x80\x99 phone data in bulk expired on Monday\nafter Senate GOPers failed to reach an agreement to extend it.\n\n\n\nPaul \xe2\x80\x93 an outspoken critic of the program \xe2\x80\x93 previously insisted \xe2\x80\x9cPeople\nhere in town think I\xe2\x80\x99m making a huge mistake. Some of them\xe2\x80\x94I think\xe2\x80\x94secretly\nwant there to be an attack on the United States so they can blame it on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDuring the Fox interview, Paul called the expiration of key proponents of\nthe Patriot Act a \xe2\x80\x9cbig victory for privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d Critics like Paul have spent\nyears condemning the Patriot Act\xe2\x80\x94which was instituted after the 9/11\nterrorist attacks and allows the government to obtain telecommunication,\nfinancial and credit records without a court order\xe2\x80\x94arguing it tramples on\ncivil liberties and allows the government to spy on innocent people.\n\nMeanwhile, some conservative critics have argued Paul sounds more like a\nDemocrat on national security. Paul insisted on Monday, however, that may\nbe the case among \xe2\x80\x9cBeltway pundits\xe2\x80\x9d but not when he\xe2\x80\x99s on the road talking\nto Americans.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the American people are actually with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul on Fox News.\n\n\n\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s team recently highlighted a survey to msnbc that shows 60% of\nAmericans want to change the Patriot Act. They further point out that 65%\nof millennials and 75% of Independent men are pushing for a modification of\nthe Patriot Act.\n\n\n\nSeparately, Mallory Factor, a conservative political analyst who has helped\nSen. Paul raise money, told msnbc that the GOP is \xe2\x80\x9cdoing some soul\nsearching\xe2\x80\x9d on national security and that the rift on the issue is causing\nsome shifts in both parties.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see a whole realignment in the electorate if the general election is\nRand Paul versus Hillary Clinton,\xe2\x80\x9d Factor said, suggesting national\nsecurity is changing allegiances in both the Democratic and GOP parties.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s an issue that has divided the emerging Republican field.\n\n\n\nSome like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris\nChristie\xe2\x80\x94who have not officially declared their 2016 intentions but are\nexpected to run\xe2\x80\x94have defended the programs, arguing they are vital to\nnational security. Similarly, declared candidate, Sen. Marco Rubio of\nFlorida recently argued on the Senate floor that a perception has been\ncreated \xe2\x80\x9cthat the United States government is listening to your phone calls\nor going through your bills as a matter of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rubio. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is\nabsolutely and categorically false.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn the other side are candidates like Paul, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and\nformer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Cruz said a recent federal appeals\ncourt ruling the NSA\xe2\x80\x99s collection of millions of Americans\xe2\x80\x99 phone records\nis illegal confirmed what many Americans already know\xe2\x80\x94that the NSA \xe2\x80\x9cwent to\nfar in collecting the phone records.\xe2\x80\x9d Huckabee has gone as far to suggest\nauthorities should get a warrant if they want to listen in on Americans\xe2\x80\x99\nphone calls.\n\n\n\nThe national security debate has also highlighted a bitter divide between\nPaul and fellow Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, who wanted to extend the\nPatriot Act. On Sunday, Paul objected to the senate  majority leader\xe2\x80\x99s\nproposal to extend less controversial aspects of the surveillance programs\n\xe2\x80\x93 but allow discussions on the telephone program continue. After Paul\xe2\x80\x99s\nobjection, McConnell took to the Senate floor and in apparent aim at Paul,\naccused critics of a \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign of demagoguery and disinformation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Paul campaign video appears to run afoul of Senate rules\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/paul-campaign-video-appears-to-run-afoul-of-senate-rules-118465.html>\n// Politico // Burgess Everett \xe2\x80\x93 May 31, 2015*\n\n\n\nSen. Rand Paul may have taken his stand against government surveillance a\nlittle too far in his presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nIn a campaign video released on Friday that includes explicit links to a\ncampaign donation page, Paul (R-Ky.) extensively uses footage from his\nlengthy speech on the Senate floor on May 20 against bulk data collection\nand surveillance in the PATRIOT Act. The Senate \xe2\x80\x9cstrictly\xe2\x80\x9d prohibits any\nuse of its proceedings for campaign activities.\n\n\n\nThe video, published under the \xe2\x80\x9cOfficial YouTube Channel of Rand Paul for\nPresident,\xe2\x80\x9d says it is paid for by \xe2\x80\x9cRand Paul for President\xe2\x80\x9d and includes a\nhyperlink to a secure donation page. According to the standing rules of the\nSenate, \xe2\x80\x9cThe use of any tape duplication of radio or television coverage of\nthe proceedings of the Senate for political campaign purposes is strictly\nprohibited.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe campaign video begins with a clip of Ronald Reagan, quoting him from a\n1964 speech on individual liberty saying that \xe2\x80\x9cthose who would trade our\nfreedom for security have embarked on this downward course.\xe2\x80\x9d The video then\npivots to Paul\xe2\x80\x99s 10-hour speech earlier this month against the PATRIOT Act,\nthree key provisions of which are set to expire on Sunday at midnight if\nPaul refuses to allow quick Senate votes.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere comes a time in the history of nations when fear and complacency\nallow power to accumulate and liberty and privacy to suffer. That time is\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul says on the Senate floor in the video. \xe2\x80\x9cWe should be in open\nrebellion saying, \xe2\x80\x98Enough\xe2\x80\x99s enough, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to take it anymore.\xe2\x80\x99 We\nshould be in rebellion saying to our government that the Constitution that\nprotects our freedoms must be obeyed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPaul has come close to running afoul of Senate rules before, using a Fox\nNews clip of his 2013 filibuster in his campaign launch video, first\nreported by Time. But that video clearly showed a Fox News chyron in it,\nputting it in a grey area ethically. The most recent video includes no such\nindication that it is from news footage.\n\n\n\nCampaign and Senate aides to Paul did not respond to a request for\ncomment.\n\n\n\n*Rand Paul\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csugar daddy\xe2\x80\x9d problem: Billionaires don\xe2\x80\x99t love him \xe2\x80\x94 but that\ncould be a blessing in disguise\n<http://www.salon.com/2015/06/01/rand_pauls_sugar_daddy_problem_billionaires_dont_love_him_but_that_could_be_a_blessing_in_disguise/>\n// Salon // Jim Newell \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nCitizens United and subsequent court decisions loosening campaign finance\nrestrictions have made running for president easy-peasy: you can find one\nbillionaire to give you tens of millions of dollars and then you just do\nwhatever they tell you to do. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great country. There are billionaires\nall over the place nowadays looking to purchase politicians for themselves.\n\n\n\nAnd yet Rand Paul, who has a slender but not-nil chance of winning the\nRepublican presidential nomination can\xe2\x80\x99t find himself a single willing\nbillionaire into whose pockets he can dive deep. Tragically, this might\nmean that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to raise money in the boring, old-timey\nhorse-and-buggy fashion: by soliciting donations from a lot of people\ninstead of one. Who wants this?\n\n\n\nPolitico reports that Paul\xe2\x80\x99s inability to secure a \xe2\x80\x9csugar daddy\xe2\x80\x9d or two, so\nto speak, has \xe2\x80\x9cled to considerable frustration in his campaign, which, amid\nrising concerns that it will not be able to compete financially, finds\nitself leaning heavily on the network of small donors who powered his\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s insurgent White House bids.\xe2\x80\x9d The obvious first choice was\nbillionaire tech libertarian Peter Thiel, who gave Rand Paul\xe2\x80\x99s father a\nbunch of cash in 2012. Thiel is hesitant to play a similar role again for\nRon\xe2\x80\x99s considerably more viable spawn, and staffers don\xe2\x80\x99t know why. Some\nsuggest he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbecome tired of political giving,\xe2\x80\x9d which is understandable,\nbecause politics is bullshit and he could buy all other sorts of cool stuff\nwith that money like boats and cars and things.\n\n\n\nSean Parker, the Napster cofounder who also made a bunch of money off of\nFacebook, was also solicited but may give his money to Hillary Clinton\ninstead because his politics make no sense.\n\n\n\n*GOP senators tear into Pau\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/gop-senators-tear-into-paul-118475.html?ml=po>l\n// Politico // Manu Raju and Burgess Everett \xe2\x80\x93 May 31, 2015*\n\n\n\nThe Rand Paul pile-on session began a few hours before sunset Sunday\nevening.\n\n\n\nBehind closed doors in the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s Strom Thurmond Room, Republican\nsenators lashed out at the junior Kentucky Republican\xe2\x80\x99s defiant stance to\nforce the expiration of key sections of the PATRIOT Act, a law virtually\nall of them support. Indiana Sen. Dan Coats\xe2\x80\x99 criticism was perhaps the most\nbiting: He accused the senator of \xe2\x80\x9clying\xe2\x80\x9d about the matter in order to\nraise money for his presidential campaign, according to three people who\nattended the meeting.\n\n\n\nThe message may have gotten through to Paul except for one thing: The\nlibertarian-minded senator skipped the hour-long meeting. That only\ninfuriated his colleagues more.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything that goes against anything he believes, he never comes,\xe2\x80\x9d Coats\nsaid in an interview. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s always helpful if you\xe2\x80\x99re in there working to\nhave your position understood, and we all learn a lot and we all try to\ncome to a much better understanding of what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe needed to be there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.). \xe2\x80\x9cHe really needed\nto be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) noted that Paul has missed \xe2\x80\x9ca number of\nmeetings\xe2\x80\x9d Republicans have held on the PATRIOT Act in recent weeks. He\ncontended there was an obvious political reason for Paul\xe2\x80\x99s stance, pointing\nout how his colleague was tweeting supporters taking \xe2\x80\x9cselfies\xe2\x80\x9d of\nthemselves next to Paul speaking on TV.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what this is about \xe2\x80\x94 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very clear \xe2\x80\x93 this is, to some\ndegree, a fundraising exercise,\xe2\x80\x9d McCain said Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cHe obviously has a\nhigher priority for his fundraising and political ambitions than for the\nsecurity of the nation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe stinging personal criticism of Paul showed just how unpopular the\nKentucky Republican\xe2\x80\x99s demands to kill the surveillance law is among party\nelders \xe2\x80\x94 and portended how this battle is likely to continue to hover over\nhis presidential campaign, for better or worse. It marked the first time in\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s brief tenure in Washington where he\xe2\x80\x99s become the scourge of much of\nhis party \xe2\x80\x94 not unlike how the party establishment turned on Ted Cruz over\nhis role in the 2013 government shutdown.\n\n\n\nLike Cruz, Paul is clearly relishing it.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTonight begins the process of ending bulk collection,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul said proudly\non the Senate floor, just hours before the expiration of key provisions in\nthe law. And in a sign of the ill will between him and his colleagues, Paul\ntook a personal whack of his own.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople here in town think I\xe2\x80\x99m making a huge mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of\nthem, I think, secretly want there to be an attack on the United States so\nthey can blame it on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSince becoming a senator, Paul has long railed against the PATRIOT Act,\narguing it\xe2\x80\x99s a blatant violation of Americans\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional privacy\nrights. His position gained steam among many civil libertarians after\nEdward Snowden exposed the National Security Agency\xe2\x80\x99s bulk data collection\nprogram of Americans\xe2\x80\x99 phone records.\n\n\n\nBuoyed by Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s leaks, a bipartisan majority in the House moved to\noverhaul the bulk data program through the USA Freedom Act by proposing\nthat phone companies \xe2\x80\x94 not the federal government \xe2\x80\x94 maintain those records,\nthough the NSA could access them via a secret court order.\n\n\n\nBut Paul contends that the USA Freedom Act would be an expansion of the\nPATRIOT Act and could torpedo a lawsuit aimed at ending the bulk data\nprogram. The phone companies, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmay do the same thing\xe2\x80\x9d as the NSA.\n\n\n\nRepublican leaders in the Senate, after initially resisting the USA Freedom\nAct because of concerns it would hamper intelligence gathering, on Sunday\nreluctantly accepted it. They did so with a midnight deadline to extend the\nsurveillance law hours away, their backs against the wall.\n\n\n\nThat made Paul even more isolated than he was already.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think there are some legitimate debates going on in the country over who\nshould hold the documents,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of GOP\nleadership and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. \xe2\x80\x9cI think there\naren\xe2\x80\x99t very many people in Sen. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s place that believe that none of\nthese provisions need to be extended or held onto in some way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAfter skipping the GOP meeting, Paul appeared for a tense floor debate\nbetween him and his colleagues, including the man who has endorsed him for\npresident: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a fellow Kentuckian. The\nGOP leader was incensed at Paul\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to allow a two-week renewal of\nfar-less controversial provisions of the PATRIOT Act: The use of roving\nwiretaps for terrorism suspects that change phone numbers quickly and \xe2\x80\x9clone\nwolf\xe2\x80\x9d provisions that allow tracking of suspects who are not affiliated\nwith known terrorist groups.\n\n\n\nJust as McConnell attempted to pass a short-term extension, Paul launched\ninto his own impassioned speech\xe2\x80\x94 only to be shouted down by his colleagues.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the promises that was given when the PATRIOT Act was originally\npassed was that in exchange for allowing a less than constitutional\nstandard, we would only use the actions against \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Paul said before he was\ninterrupted by Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), who pounded his desk while\npresiding over the Senate.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there objection?\xe2\x80\x9d Wicker asked as Paul tried to continue on. A number\nof Republican senators began yelling over Paul to restore order in the\nchamber and prevent another lengthy speech.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRegular order!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and Tom Cotton\n(R-Ark.), among others.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI object,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul responded. That prompted McConnell to launch his own\nspeech. At times glaring at Paul, the Senate leader blasted what he called\n\xe2\x80\x9ca campaign of demagoguery and disinformation launched in the wake of\nunlawful actions of Edward Snowden, who was last seen in Russia.\xe2\x80\x9d Paul sat\nat his desk quietly, holding his glasses in his hand.\n\n\n\nMcConnell never named Paul in his passionate speech, but it was clearly\naimed at the man who had been a close political ally \xe2\x80\x94 until now.\n\n\n\nOther colleagues did criticize Paul by name.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t stand with Rand on this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.). \xe2\x80\x9cI want to\nmake sure the ability to monitor terrorists continues uninterrupted.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99s nestled in with a very large bunch of very radical people \xe2\x80\x93\nfrom the left to the right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the president pro\ntempore. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he feels comfortable being with all those\nleftists who hate the PATRIOT Act. But he has a right to do what he\xe2\x80\x99s\ndoing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPaul ended up delaying a final Senate vote on the USA Freedom Act until\nlater this week. After blocking that bill before the Memorial Day recess,\nMcConnell and GOP leaders agreed to move the House\xe2\x80\x99s measure, saying they\nhad no other choice. By a 77-17 vote Sunday, the Senate broke a filibuster\nand moved to begin debate on the bill.\n\n\n\nTo overcome Paul\xe2\x80\x99s delay tactics, McConnell was forced to employ a rarely\nused prerogative to force senators to debate after a filibuster has been\nbroken, allowing him to move to final passage as early as Tuesday.\n\n\n\nAs that vote was occurring, Paul was sitting at his desk. He huddled with\ntwo libertarian-minded House members: GOP Reps. Justin Amash of Michigan\nand Thomas Massie of Kentucky. His fellow 2016 rivals, Sens. Ted Cruz of\nTexas and Marco Rubio of Florida, were yukking it up nearby with a small\ngroup of senators. (Rubio voted against proceeding to the House bill, while\nCruz supported it.)\n\n\n\nIn an interview, Amash said Paul\xe2\x80\x99s positions are supported \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelmingly\xe2\x80\x9d\nby voters of \xe2\x80\x9call political affiliations.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not politically risky to stand with the vast majority of Americans,\xe2\x80\x9d\nAmash said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m astonished when I hear Republican candidates in particular\nspeak as though people want the PATRIOT Act. They don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s exposing the country to the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d Massie added. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the\nsenators that think that\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous are saying the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s\ndangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSeveral dozen Paul supporters sat in the Senate gallery on Sunday night\nclad in red \xe2\x80\x9cRand\xe2\x80\x9d T-shirts.\n\n\n\nBut Paul didn\xe2\x80\x99t have many other defenders in the halls of the Senate.\n\n\n\nRubio called the expiration of the PATRIOT Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions the result of\n\xe2\x80\x9cpolitical posturing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are other ways this could have been done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sen. Jeff Flake\n(R-Ariz.).\n\n\n\nOne way Paul could have handled the matter would have been to simply object\nto short-term extensions of current law, rather than giving a nearly\n11-hour floor speech on the floor before the Memorial Day recess, Heller\nsaid.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt accomplished just the same, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t raise money objecting,\xe2\x80\x9d\nHeller said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe could only raise money filibustering.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Mike Huckabee to Rand Paul: Decide what job you want\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/01/politics/mike-huckabee-rand-paul-patriot-act/index.html>\n// CNN // Gregory Wallace \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\n(CNN)Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee wants Rand Paul to make a choice:\nProtest the Patriot Act either on the Senate floor or on the campaign trail.\n\n\n\nHe joined a chorus of Republican presidential hopefuls weighing in on the\nKentucky Republican senator\'s protest of the Patriot Act, key provisions of\nwhich lapsed Sunday.\n\n\n\nPaul claimed credit for blocking parts of the renewal of the controversial\nlaw, and his protests included an 11-hour speech on the eve of the\nchamber\'s Memorial Day break, as well as objections to several short-term\nextensions of the Act.\n\n\n\nIn response to a question about Paul, Huckabee said on Fox News Monday\nmorning that 2016 contenders must "decide what they want to be when they\ngrow up."\n\n\n\n"If you want to be a governor, be a governor. If you want to be a senator,\nbe a senator," Huckabee said. "If you want to be president, then let go of\nwhat you\'re doing, because it\'s a full time pursuit to run for the\npresidency."\n\n\n\nThose in government positions owe a responsibility to the taxpayer, he\ncontinued.\n\n\n\n"If you want a different job, then say I don\'t want this one anymore. I\'m\nbored with it," he said. "But be honest about it and go out and give the\ntaxpayers a break, and let them have someone on the job full time."\n\n\n\nHuckabee added in a follow-up question that he did not mean to "impugn his\n(Paul\'s) motives" because "this is not something he just took up because\nit\'s a political cause."\n\n\n\nMany of those running for president are out of office, though two of Paul\'s\nSenate colleagues -- Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas -- are in\nthe race, and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is expected to announce\na bid on Monday. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is running for the\nDemocratic nomination. Several sitting governors -- including Chris\nChristie of New Jersey, John Kasich of Ohio, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal\nand Scott Walker of Wisconsin -- are considering joining the GOP field.\n\n\n\nUnlike several other Republicans who have hammered Paul for blocking the\nPatriot Act renewal, Huckabee believes the original law went too far.\n\n\n\nHe said the original law was "hastily passed" in the wake of 9/11 without\nextensive debate. Public opinion has shifted now, he said.\n\n\n\n"Fourteen years ago, we were worried about terrorists. Now we\'re worried\nabout our government," Huckabee said, singling out controversies around the\nIRS and Justice Departments.\n\n\n\n*Rand Paul\'s Stand Against the Patriot Act Is About More Than Mass\nSurveillance\n<http://mic.com/articles/119766/rand-paul-s-stand-against-the-patriot-act-is-about-more-than-mass-surveillance>\n// Policy.Mic // Mark Kogan \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nOn Sunday night, controversial elements of the Patriot Act were allowed to\nexpire for the first time since its passage following the Sept. 11 attacks\nin 2001.\n\n\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), whose procedural maneuvers prevented the Senate\nfrom renewing the bill in its entirety, declared in a press release that\n"tonight begins the process of ending bulk collection" of data for mass\nsurveillance.\n\n\n\nPaul\'s efforts, whether motivated by personal beliefs, presidential\naspirations or a healthy mix of both, mark an important moment in American\npolitics, not just for the debate over mass surveillance, but for\ncongressional gridlock in general.\n\n\n\nIn recent decades, as congressional politics became increasingly polarized\nand meaningful compromise became less common, the practical challenge for\nlegislators was the sheer impossibility of moving legislation through the\nsystem without some sort of forcing function.\n\n\n\nLegislators began pushing fewer individual bills, instead packing their\nprojects and policies into "omnibus" bills that addressed entire sectors of\ngovernment rather than individual pieces. These amalgamated bills were\noften funding bills and therefore "must-pass" legislation. Voting against\nomnibus bills became too risky because failing to pass the larger bill over\ndisagreements with one or two relatively minor provisions carried the\nthreat of tremendous collateral damage (both real and political).\n\n\n\nAs this process of smashing through "must-pass" bills became standard\noperating procedure, the political leadership made another cynical\ndiscovery. By waiting until the last second and using the subsequent fear\nof imminent expiration to force passage, politicians were able to avoid\ndebating elements of the bill that put them at risk while simultaneously\nensuring passage.\n\n\n\nThe lead-up to this year\'s renewal of the Patriot Act played out similarly:\nEveryone from President Barack Obama to Senate Republicans warned of the\ndangers of failing to pass the bill wholesale.\n\n\n\nUrging the Senate to act this week, Obama warned of the dangers of letting\nsurveillance authorities expire.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t want us to be in a situation in which for a certain period of time\nthose authorities go away and suddenly we are dark," he said. "And heaven\nforbid we\'ve got a problem where we could have prevented a terrorist attack\nor apprehended someone who is engaged in dangerous activity but we didn\'t\ndo so simply because of inaction in the Senate."\n\n\n\nOthers in the administration pushed the same message. In an interview with\nCBS, newly minted Attorney General Loretta Lynch declared that failing to\nrenew the Patriot Act would make us "less safe" and cause us to "lose\nimportant eyes on people who have made it clear ... that their mission is\nto harm American people here and abroad."\n\n\n\nRepublicans also joined in on the fear-mongering as the vote deadline\napproached. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on the\nSenate floor that failure to pass or extend the act "would mean disarming\ncompletely and arbitrarily."\n\n\n\nOthers were even more direct. "To go dark on this," said Sen. Dan Coats\n(R-Ind.), NPR reported, "is a risk on Americans\' lives."\n\n\n\nHistorically, this was a tried and true formula that would have ensured\nimmediate passage or at least temporary extension while the requisite\narm-twisting was done to secure passage. But for the first time in a long\ntime, it didn\'t work.\n\n\n\n"The people who argue that the world will end and we will be overrun by\njihadists tonight are trying to use fear... They want you to fear and give\nup your liberty," said Paul in his statement. "They tell you if you have\nnothing to hide, you have nothing to fear. That\'s a far cry from the\nstandard we were founded upon."\n\n\n\nNow, with two more days of mandatory debate forced by Paul, the contentious\nissue of mass surveillance will be brought to the forefront of civic\ndiscourse. This will almost certainly result in meaningful reforms as the\nSenate takes up the House-passed USA Freedom Act, which curtails\ncontentious mass data collection powers while leaving other elements of the\nPatriot Act in place.\n\n\n\nWhen Paul rose to speak on Sunday, he knew that his opposition was a\nbeginning, rather than an end. "The Patriot Act will expire tonight," Paul\nsaid, but, "It will only be temporary. They will ultimately get their way."\n\n\n\nYet even if they do get their way, this shock is good for the system and\nwill serve as a reminder that the politics of fear and pressure are not\nnecessary and are in fact anathema to good governance, doing far more harm\nthan good.\n\n\n\nBy forcing expiration and debate, the public has been given an opportunity\nto nudge public dialogue away from partisan grandstanding toward more\nmeaningful discussion of serious issues. Hopefully, we take advantage of it.\n\n\n\n*Rand Paul is getting way too much credit for killing 3 Patriot Act powers\n<http://www.vox.com/2015/6/1/8700111/rand-paul-patriot-act> // Vox //\nTimothy B. Lee \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nWhen three controversial provisions of the Patriot Act expired at midnight\non Sunday, May 31, 2015, news organizations put Rand Paul (R-KY) front and\ncenter. We at Vox did that ourselves, with a story titled "Rand Paul has\nforced three Patriot Act powers to expire."\n\n\n\nThis isn\'t wrong \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s true that Paul\'s obstructionist tactics helped\nensure that the Patriot Act powers would lapse before the Senate had time\nto pass a replacement. And Paul\'s dramatic 10-hour speech two weeks ago\nmade for a good story, which is why it got so much media attention. But the\nmedia\'s focus on Paul has led to the Kentucky Republican getting way too\nmuch credit for the ultimate outcome of this week\'s surveillance fight.\n\n\n\nThe fight is likely to result in the passage of the USA Freedom Act \xe2\x80\x94 which\nseeks to place stricter limits on NSA surveillance but which some privacy\nadvocates say doesn\'t go far enough \xe2\x80\x94 later this week. Paul has opposed\nthis legislation. And if Paul hadn\'t engaged in his theatrics, the most\nlikely outcome would have been exactly the same. The only difference is\nthat the USA Freedom Act might have passed a few days earlier.\n\n\n\nIf the USA Freedom Act passes in the Senate, credit (or blame) should go to\nthe 57 senators \xe2\x80\x94 mostly Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 who supported the legislation a week\nago, and to the 54 senators \xe2\x80\x94 again mostly Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 who voted down a\nstraight renewal of the Patriot Act during the same Friday-night session.\nRand Paul\'s filibuster was wildly successful at getting Rand Paul\'s name in\nheadlines. But it ultimately had little effect on the outcome of the\nlegislative fight.\n\n\n\nThe Republican leadership of the House also deserves a lot of credit for\nreining in the NSA. If the lower House had not passed the USA Freedom Act\nseveral weeks ago, Mitch McConnell might have convinced a majority of the\nSenate that renewing the Patriot Act was the only realistic option.\n\n\n\nThe Patriot Act powers died because 54 senators wanted them to die\n\n\n\nRep.

It was a series of votes taken two days later, on\nFriday, May 22. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) wanted to\nforce the Senate to renew the Patriot Act without changes. His plan was to\nbring the USA Freedom Act up for a vote, let it fail, and then tell\nsenators their only alternative was a short-term renewal of the Patriot Act\nwith no changes.\n\n\n\nThe first part of this plan worked. The USA Freedom Act got 57 votes, just\nshort of the 60 votes required to overcome a filibuster. But when McConnell\nthen called a vote on extending the Patriot Act for two months, the\nsenators didn\'t flinch \xe2\x80\x94 54 of them voted no.\n\n\n\nAt this point the question was who would blink first. Would pro-privacy\nsenators agree to extend the Patriot Act without changes? Or would\npro-surveillance senators agree to support the USA Freedom Act? On Sunday\nnight, it was McConnell himself who blinked, concluding that the USA\nFreedom Act he had opposed a week earlier was now "the only realistic way\nforward." This time 77 senators voted for the USA Freedom Act.\n\n\n\n"The Senate will pass a reform that just got 77 votes," says Julian Sanchez\na privacy advocate at the Cato Institute (where I worked from 2003 to\n2005). He notes that Paul joined "16 of the most hardcore NSA cheerleaders\nin the Senate" in opposing the legislation.\n\n\n\nMcConnell\'s capitulation was a real victory for pro-privacy senators. But\nPaul deserves little, if any, credit for it. After all, if Paul had backed\nthe USA Freedom Act and convinced two of his fellow Republicans to join\nhim, the legislation could have moved forward sooner. Paul\'s decision to\nbreak with the overwhelming majority of pro-privacy senators and oppose the\nUSA Freedom Act delayed the legislation\'s passage and created a risk that\nMcConnell would be able to stampede the Senate into renewing the Patriot\nAct.\n\n\n\nEven if Paul\'s defiant tactics didn\'t change the outcome of the debate,\nSanchez says they helped illustrate that "scaremongering" by surveillance\nhawks no longer works. "Americans aren\'t afraid of the dark anymore," he\nsays. "A sunset can\'t be used to coerce legislators into capitulation with\nunchecked surveillance powers."\n\n\n\nOther members of Congress deserve more credit than Rand Paul\n\n\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-UT) provided key Republican support for the USA Freedom\nAct in the Senate. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\n\n\nRand Paul\'s tactics have gotten him a lot of press attention \xe2\x80\x94 and,\ntherefore, a lot of undeserved credit \xe2\x80\x94 for the outcome of the legislative\nfight. But a larger share of the credit should go to other senators.\nSanchez points to Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and Mike\nLee (R-UT) as three examples of senators who did the hard work of building\na consensus for the USA Freedom Act in the Senate.\n\n\n\nAnd even more credit should go to House leaders such as Rep. James\nSensenbrenner (R-WI) who passed the USA Freedom Act in a lopsided,\nbipartisan vote several weeks ago. The fact that the House had already\npassed the USA Freedom Act made it a lot easier for pro-privacy senators to\nposition it as a reasonable alternative to renewing the Patriot Act.\n\n\n\n"It is valuable that Paul is using his platform as a presidential candidate\nto drive attention to this issue," Sanchez says. But "Paul hasn\'t\nultimately done much to drive the substantive policy outcome."\n\n\n\n*Dick Cheney and Daughter Push Hawkish Stances for G.O.P. Hopefuls\n<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/01/dick-cheney-and-daughter-push-hawkish-stances-for-g-o-p-hopefuls/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog%20Main&contentCollection=Politics&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body>\n// NYT // Jonathan Martin \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nThe rise of the Islamic State in the Middle East has pushed Republicans\ntoward embracing a more interventionist foreign policy, and now one\nprominent Republican family wants to be sure the party stays that way.\n\n\n\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz Cheney are planning\nto make their presence felt in the 2016 presidential campaign through their\nadvocacy group, Alliance for a Strong America.\n\n\n\nThe organization is planning online and perhaps television ads pushing a\nmuscular line on national security, according to a Republican strategist\nfamiliar with the group\xe2\x80\x99s planning. The initiative may also pay for polling\nto help nudge Republican candidates toward hawkish stances in the primary\nseason.\n\n\n\nWhat is not clear, though, is whether the Cheneys intend to train their\nfire on Hillary Rodham Clinton or whether they plan to target Senator Rand\nPaul, the libertarian-leaning Kentuckian who has recently sought to bolster\nhis White House campaign by trying to block a renewal of parts of the\nPatriot Act.\n\n\n\nMr. Cheney criticized Mr. Paul as \xe2\x80\x9can isolationist\xe2\x80\x9d in an interview\npublished online Sunday in The Wall Street Journal, which first reported\nthe Alliance for a Strong America\xe2\x80\x99s plans.\n\n\n\nAsked about the assessment, Mr. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s top political adviser questioned Mr.\nCheney\xe2\x80\x99s conservative credentials.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who defends warrantless spying on innocent U.S. citizens, like\nPresident Obama, has no right to call themselves a freedom-loving\nconservative,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doug Stafford, the adviser to Mr. Paul. \xe2\x80\x9cWorse is these\npeople are defending and supporting a program that the courts have said is\nillegal and the F.B.I. reports hasn\xe2\x80\x99t led to a single terrorist arrest or\nthwarted terror plot. It has only resulted in the trampling of Americans\xe2\x80\x99\nrights.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe harsh back-and-forth between the Cheneys and Mr. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s orbit\nillustrates not only the tension in the party over how to balance defense\nand civil liberties, but also, as Mr. Stafford notes, basic questions about\nwhat it means to be a conservative on matters of national security.\n\n\n\nThe resurgence of radical Islamic terrorism in the Middle East may have\npushed many primary voters toward a more hawkish orientation, but Mr.\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s success in at least temporarily stopping the N.S.A.\xe2\x80\x99s use of\nmetadata suggests that Republicans are uneasy with some of the intelligence\npolicies put into effect during Mr. Cheney\xe2\x80\x99s time as vice president.\n\n\n\nRepublicans who have spoken with Mr. Cheney, who represented Wyoming in the\nHouse for 10 years and who  maintains an intense interest in both policy\nand political intrigue, say he is plainly concerned about the party backing\naway from intelligence programs.\n\n\n\nSelective about his public appearances, Mr. Cheney is engaged in the 2016\npresidential race behind the scenes. When aides to many of the leading\nRepublican candidates descended on Wyoming this year to make their pitch to\na group of wealthy donors, some of the staff members were surprised to find\nMr. Cheney in the audience.\n\n\n\n*How Bobby Jindal lost everything: A one-time GOP hope, gutted by Grover\nNorquist worship and his own ambition\n<http://www.salon.com/2015/06/01/how_bobby_jindal_lost_everything_a_one_time_gop_hope_gutted_by_grover_norquist_worship_and_his_own_ambition/>\n// Salon // Stephanie Grace \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nThese are not happy times in Baton Rouge, where government officials are\ndesperately trying to plug a $1.6 billion budget shortfall. But even by\nthat standard, Wednesday, April 22, was particularly fraught.\n\n\n\nIn the imposing state capitol that Huey Long built, the Senate Finance\nCommittee was wrestling with a complicated cost-cutting scheme to repeal an\ninventory tax that businesses pay to local governments and that the state\nrebates to the businesses, all while promising to somehow make stressed-out\nlocal leaders whole.\n\n\n\nJust down the road, Louisiana State University President and Chancellor F.\nKing Alexander said that the state\xe2\x80\x99s flagship university, which could lose\n80 percent of state funding after years of already deep cuts, was\ndeveloping a worst-case scenario plan for financial exigency\xe2\x80\x94basically the\nacademic equivalent of bankruptcy.\n\n\n\nIn the midst of it all came a message from Republican Governor Bobby\nJindal, whose policies and priorities have contributed mightily to the\nstate\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal mess.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp wish my friends Willie, Phil and Si a happy birthday,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\ntweet, which was accompanied by a photo of Willie Robertson, whose family\nis featured on the popular homegrown reality TV show Duck Dynasty. It then\ndirected readers to the website for the American Future Project, a 527\nissue advocacy group that Jindal has set up in advance of his anticipated\npresidential run.\n\n\n\nIf the tweet suggests a stunning disconnect from the dire budget situation\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s unfolding on his watch, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s how it is these days.\n\n\n\nA Pure Record on Taxes\n\n\n\nJindal, a hard-charging former Rhodes Scholar, has always nursed grander\nambitions, and voters generally gave him a pass. That was when things were\ngoing well.\n\n\n\nThese days they\xe2\x80\x99re not, and Jindal\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the upcoming presidential\nprimaries has taken a toll back home. While he was popular and powerful\nenough to avoid a reelection fight in 2011, by 2015 his approval rating had\nsunk to 27 percent, according to one poll; a friendly survey by his own\nconsulting firm pegged the number at 46 percent, hardly a resounding vote\nof confidence.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just his frequent trips to places like Iowa, New Hampshire, and\nWashington, D.C., that have angered his constituents. (He spent 165 days\nout of state in 2014, according to The Advocate newspaper.) Nor is it only\nhis odd forays into international and national affairs, from the tall tales\nin London about Muslim no-go zones, to his op-ed in The New York Times\naccusing companies that oppose religious freedom laws inspired by the\nspread of gay marriage of forming an unholy alliance with the \xe2\x80\x9cradical\nliberals.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s not even his need to bask in the Robertsons\xe2\x80\x99 reflected\nglory.\n\n\n\nMore than any of that, his constituents are frustrated that their governor\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be bothered to do his day job\xe2\x80\x94and when he does, that his actions are\noften transparently designed to build a national profile rather than meet\nLouisiana\xe2\x80\x99s needs.\n\n\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s clear in his refusal to take federal money to expand Medicaid\xe2\x80\x94which,\nof course, would mean acknowledging there are benefits to Obama\xe2\x80\x99s health\ncare law. But nowhere is it more obvious, or more damaging, than in\nJindal\xe2\x80\x99s stewardship of fiscal affairs.\n\n\n\nJindal chalks up the current budget shortfall to the drop in oil prices,\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s definitely contributed. A larger piece of the puzzle has been\nhis determination to maintain a pure record on taxes.\n\n\n\nJindal hasn\xe2\x80\x99t always been reckless about taxation. In the midst of a budget\nsurplus early in his first term, Jindal tried to quietly head off the\nLegislature\xe2\x80\x99s move to roll back a big income tax increase that had been\nenacted several years earlier. It was only after lawmakers seemed like they\nmight eliminate the income tax entirely that he got on board with the\nrollback, and he soon was boasting that he\xe2\x80\x99d signed the biggest tax cut in\nstate history.\n\n\n\nThe first real glimpse of the future came in 2011 when Jindal fought tooth\nand nail against extending a temporary four-cent levy on the state\xe2\x80\x99s\ncigarette tax\xe2\x80\x94at 36 cents, including the levy, the third lowest in the\nnation. His reasoning? If the tax rate is scheduled to automatically drop\nand the state acts to prevent that from happening, it amounts to an\neffective tax increase.\n\n\n\nThe stance left his constituents cold, but impressed Grover Norquist of\nAmericans for Tax Reform (ATR), who would endorse Jindal as Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s\nrunning mate the following year.\n\n\n\nEven Republicans Are Bristling\n\n\n\nThese days it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to think of anyone who has as much influence over what\nJindal\xe2\x80\x99s willing to do than Norquist, whose rigid rules for what\nconstitutes a tax increase line up perfectly with Jindal\xe2\x80\x99s. In practice,\nthat means the governor has insisted that the budget be balanced without\ntax increases, despite the prospect of devastating cuts to higher education\nand health care, the two main areas that don\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy constitutional or\nstatutory protection.\n\n\n\nAnd it means some revenue-enhancing ideas the Republican-dominated\nLegislature might support, specifically a reexamination of giveaways to\nspecific industries, are off limits\xe2\x80\x94because eliminating a tax exemption\nwithout an offset that reduces another tax or cuts spending, according to\nATR, is raising a tax.\n\n\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s how the inventory tax wound up in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s crosshairs, despite the\nfact that eliminating the rebate but not the underlying tax would hurt\nbusinesses, and getting rid of the tax would devastate some parishes\n(that\xe2\x80\x99s Louisiana for county). Many companies, it turns out, receive rebate\nchecks that exceed their state tax liability, and in Jindal\xe2\x80\x99s view that\nmakes eliminating the payouts a spending cut, not a tax increase.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCorporate welfare,\xe2\x80\x9d he labeled it in his opening address to the\nLegislature, prompting chuckles from those who\xe2\x80\x99ve watched him promote\nbusiness incentives for years.\n\n\n\nIn fact, perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the frustration with Jindal\nis that it transcends partisanship.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just the Democrats who are bristling. It\xe2\x80\x99s many a Republican.\n\n\n\nNothing Left to Cut\n\n\n\nRepublicans who belong to an informal group dubbed the \xe2\x80\x9cfiscal hawks\xe2\x80\x9d have\nbeen sharply critical of Jindal\xe2\x80\x99s reliance over the years on one-time money\ntransfers and accounting gimmicks to balance the budget without making even\ndeeper cuts.\n\n\n\nOne reason everything\xe2\x80\x99s hitting the fan is there\xe2\x80\x99s not much left. Gone are\n$800 million from the Medicaid Trust Fund for the Elderly and $450 million\nfor providing development incentives, and the rainy day fund has dropped\nfrom $730 million to $460 million on his watch.\n\n\n\nRepublicans like state Rep. Jay Morris, who, after hearing Jindal\xe2\x80\x99s vow to\nveto any measure that didn\xe2\x80\x99t have Grover Norquist\xe2\x80\x99s blessing, declared the\napproach \xe2\x80\x9cinsane.\xe2\x80\x9d And like state Sen. Jack Donahue, who chairs the Finance\nCommittee and who passed a bill last year seeking to determine how much the\nstate spends on tax exemptions, only to watch Jindal veto it.\n\n\n\nAnd perhaps most tellingly, the Republicans running to replace Jindal in\nthis fall\xe2\x80\x99s election. All three\xe2\x80\x94Lt. Governor Jay Dardenne, U.S. Senator\nDavid Vitter and Public Service Commissioner (and former Jindal aide) Scott\nAngelle\xe2\x80\x94say they will look for a way to accept the Medicaid money and take\na open-minded approach to examining tax exemptions.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat this state needs right now is a leader solely focused on Louisiana,\xe2\x80\x9d\nDardenne said in a recent speech. And in a clear swipe at Norquist, he\nadded that, \xe2\x80\x9cI represent the people of Louisiana; I don\xe2\x80\x99t represent someone\nwho lives in D.C.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd Vitter said he\xe2\x80\x99d take a good, hard look at tax incentives and other\ngiveaways, even if it means raising revenue.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGov. Jindal should be doing this now,\xe2\x80\x9d he pointedly said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do it the\nminute I\xe2\x80\x99m sworn in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*UPDATE: Walker backs 20-week abortion ban with or without exemption\n<http://www.nbc15.com/home/headlines/Republicans-introduce-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks-302953851.html>\n// NBC 15 \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nUPDATED Monday, June 1, 2015---10:35 a.m.\n\n\n\nDELAVAN, Wis.

Bush first ran for president, he liked to say\nhe had inherited half of his father\xe2\x80\x99s friends and all of his enemies. For\nJeb Bush, now preparing his own bid for the White House, that may ring\nfamiliar.\n\n\n\nHis brother\xe2\x80\x99s enemies have made themselves known in recent weeks as Jeb\nBush has struggled to formulate his own take on the decisions made during\nthe last Bush presidency. But perhaps just as important for the fledgling\ncandidate has been the challenge in winning over his brother\xe2\x80\x99s friends.\n\n\n\nWhile George W. Bush himself and many in his circle, especially those\nclosest to the family, are enthusiastic about the prospect of a third Bush\npresidency, many of the Republican foot soldiers who worked for the former\npresident in his campaigns and his administration have not rushed to back\nhis brother\xe2\x80\x99s emerging operation.\n\n\n\nA sampling conducted largely by email of about 120 people who worked for\nGeorge W. Bush \xe2\x80\x94 from cabinet secretaries to foreign policy advisers to\nadvance aides \xe2\x80\x94 found about 25 who said they were supporting his younger\nbrother. Fifty others said they were neutral or supporting another\ncandidate, while the rest did not respond, passing up a chance to declare\nallegiance to the next Bush candidacy.\n\n\n\nSome harbor the same reservations that other Republicans do about the\nnotion of a dynastic presidency passed from one member of a family to\nanother. Some simply want a fresh start, concluding that the party would\nmake a stronger case against Hillary Rodham Clinton, the likely Democratic\ncandidate, by nominating a new figure like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida\nor Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin. Some nurse doubts about Jeb Bush\nspecifically, even on policies he shares with his brother.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m neutral,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matt Latimer, a former White House speechwriter. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\npressed, I\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to adopt the Barbara Bush philosophy \xe2\x80\x94 enough\nBushes.\xe2\x80\x9d (Mrs. Bush, the mother of the two brothers, who initially did say\nthat, has since taken it back. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve changed my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.)\n\n\n\nAnother former White House official who worked closely with former\nPresident Bush said it would be a mistake for the country for his brother\nto become president. \xe2\x80\x9cI happen to believe the U.S. is Bushed and Clintoned\nout,\xe2\x80\x9d said this official, who like many others asked not to be named to\navoid offending his former boss. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is time for others to lead.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA spokesman for Jeb Bush, a former governor of Florida, said he did not\ntake any support for granted. \xe2\x80\x9cGovernor Bush realizes that should he decide\nto move forward, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to work to earn support across the\nparty \xe2\x80\x94 just as the other prospective candidates will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tim Miller,\nthe spokesman.\n\n\n\nMany of the Bush veterans unwilling to back him cited work reasons,\nexplaining that their current employers would not want them to take sides\npublicly. Some are now working as academics, party officials or television\npundits, and said they wanted to retain a professional detachment from any\none candidate. Some said they hoped to be able to advise several of the\nRepublican candidates, and there was no consensus for any of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s\nopponents.\n\n\n\nOthers held back not because they oppose Mr. Bush, but because they worried\nthat publicly supporting him would only hurt his chances by reinforcing his\nties to his brother. They were acutely aware of the criticism he received\nwhen he released a list of foreign policy advisers that included many who\nhad worked for his brother, like Paul D. Wolfowitz, the former deputy\ndefense secretary.\n\n\n\nWhatever the reason, the mixed emotions in the 43rd president\xe2\x80\x99s team\nunderscore a vicious quandary for Jeb Bush. Much as he wants to present\nhimself as his own man, he cannot assume that his brother\xe2\x80\x99s supporters will\nautomatically transfer to him. So he must make the case for their support,\nand for that of the broader electorate, even as he labors to avoid being\nbranded a copy of his brother.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is fair to say that those who are inclined to support Jeb out of\nloyalty to 41 or 43 have already jumped in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stephen Yates, who worked\non national security in the George W. Bush White House and is now chairman\nof the Idaho Republican Party. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone else is up for grabs. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be\nable to get some of the remainder, but no advantage over others.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNeil Patel, a Bush White House official and publisher of The Daily Caller,\na conservative news site, said the Republican field had many good choices.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone, including Jeb Bush, should expect to automatically\npick up support to become president \xe2\x80\x94 especially by virtue of being related\nto a past president. And I doubt he would disagree with that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cLots of former colleagues are lined up behind Jeb but many are also with\nRubio, Walker and others.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe distance kept by some from the 43rd president\xe2\x80\x99s team reflects the\nreality that the two brothers have long traveled in separate political\norbits, with the elder based in Texas and the younger based in Florida.\nThere has been relatively little overlap over the years beyond family\nretainers.\n\n\n\nAnd so some of George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s former aides were willing to publicly\ncriticize Jeb Bush a few weeks ago when he stumbled over the question of\nwhether he would have invaded Iraq had he known there were no\nunconventional weapons there.\n\n\n\nKarl Rove, the former president\xe2\x80\x99s longtime political strategist; Andrew H.\nCard Jr., the former White House chief of staff; and Ari Fleischer, the\nformer press secretary, all expressed concern at the handling of the issue.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would have taken his brother that long to clean it up,\xe2\x80\x9d\nMr. Card said on MSNBC. But Mr. Card was among those who offered unstinting\nsupport for Jeb Bush. \xe2\x80\x9cI am proudly for Jeb,\xe2\x80\x9d he said by email.\n\n\n\nOthers offering their backing were some of the Republicans who were closest\nto his brother, including Margaret Spellings, the former education\nsecretary, who runs the George W. Bush Presidential Center, and Donald L.\nEvans, the former president\xe2\x80\x99s longtime Texas friend and commerce secretary.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI very much support Jeb and he would be a great president if he decides to\nrun,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Evans said.\n\n\n\nMs. Spellings said she was \xe2\x80\x9centhusiastically supporting\xe2\x80\x9d him. \xe2\x80\x9cAs you might\nimagine, Jeb and I have a relationship independent of his brother given our\nshared interest in education reform, and we have worked together for many\nyears,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nFor some, though, it seemed as much obligation as fervor. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d a longtime\nfriend and financial donor to George W. Bush said when asked if he was\nsupporting the former president\xe2\x80\x99s brother. \xe2\x80\x9cDo I have a choice?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOne who decided he did have a choice was Wayne Berman, an official in the\nadministration of the first President George Bush, and a friend and\nfund-raiser for George W. Bush and whose wife worked in the 43rd\npresident\xe2\x80\x99s White House. This time around, Mr. Berman is a senior adviser\nto Mr. Rubio.\n\n\n\nAmong those declaring neutrality rather than publicly embracing Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s\ncandidacy is former Vice President Dick Cheney, who with his daughter Liz\nCheney has started the Alliance for a Strong America to advocate tough\nnational security positions among various candidates.\n\n\n\nOthers include former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, although she is\nleading Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s education foundation; Mr. Rove, who comments on Fox News\nand in The Wall Street Journal; Mr. Fleischer; Michael Gerson, a former\nsenior White House adviser now writing for The Washington Post; Ed\nGillespie, a former presidential counselor; Mark McKinnon, a campaign\nstrategist for the former president; and cabinet secretaries like former\nAttorney General John Ashcroft.\n\n\n\nPaul J. McNulty, who served as George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s deputy attorney general and\nis now president of Grove City College in Pennsylvania, said he was torn\nbetween Jeb Bush and former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always\nbeen a big fan of Jeb,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I worry about his electability.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRyan Streeter, a former domestic policy aide to George W. Bush, said the\nissues had changed since his former boss left office. Fiscal concerns are\ngreater, and Republicans are more skeptical of enlarging the federal role\nin setting education standards for schools or expanding Medicare to cover\nprescription drugs, as the former president did.\n\n\n\nAs a result, said Mr. Streeter, who now directs the Center for Politics and\nGovernance at the University of Texas at Austin, \xe2\x80\x9clots of 43 staffers\xe2\x80\x99\nviews reflect those changes since many of them have stayed engaged in\npolicy and politics.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese issues, more than anything,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwill affect who they get\nbehind in 2016.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Huckabee: Two-State Solution Is \xe2\x80\x9cIrrational, Unworkable\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Room For\nPalestinian State Elsewhere\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/huckabee-two-state-solution-is-irrational-unworkable-plenty#.abkVmV02Q>\n// Buzzfeed // Andrew Kaczynski \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee\nargued over the weekend a two-state solution is \xe2\x80\x9cirrational and unworkable\xe2\x80\x9d\nand that if a Palestinian state is created, it must exist outside of\nIsrael. Huckabee said there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of land elsewhere in the world for a\nPalestinian state.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe two state solution, if we mean two governments holding the same piece\nof real estate is irrational and unworkable,\xe2\x80\x9d Huckabee told Arutz Sheva TV\non Sunday during an appearance at the Israel Day Concert in Central Park,\nNew York.\n\n\n\nHuckabee, who refers to the area commonly called the West Bank as Judea and\nSamaria, called arguing for the two-state solution a \xe2\x80\x9cpretentious game.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think it\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to quit playing this pretentious game that\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be a two-state solution where both sides share the same\ncountry and real estate and streets \xe2\x80\x98cause they\xe2\x80\x99re not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Huckabee.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the sides the Palestinians continue to say that Israel doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have\na right to exist. You can\xe2\x80\x99t forge an alliance with that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHuckabee cited there being \xe2\x80\x9cplenty of land in the world\xe2\x80\x9d to find a place\nfor a Palestinian state outside of Israel.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s a two-state solution, the Palestinians state needs to be\noutside the boundaries of the nation of Israel. There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of land in\nthe world where we can find a place and say, \xe2\x80\x98Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s create a\nPalestinian state.\xe2\x80\x99 But not within the confides of a secure Israel.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the event, Huckabee said \xe2\x80\x9cwe never can accept the notion that\nIsrael will be divided,\xe2\x80\x9d citing the boundaries of Israel being given \xe2\x80\x9cnot\nby the United Nations but by almighty God.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn his interview, Huckabee added he could not \xe2\x80\x9cexplain why there is a harsh\nanti-Israel sentiment that exists in the administration.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHuckabee said if Israel was attacked he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what the Obama\nadministration would do.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think if the Israelis were under attack right now, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what\nthis president would do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Huckabee when asked about Israel taking\nmilitary action against Iran.\n\n\n\n*Marco Rubio\'s appealing ambiguity\n<http://theweek.com/articles/557803/marco-rubios-appealing-ambiguity> //\nThe Week // Michael Brendan Dougherty \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio is an older Republican\'s idea of a younger Republican, we\'ve\nbeen told.\n\n\n\nIn a fun bit of racial and generational essentialism, Ana Marie Cox went\nthrough the senator\'s positions and claimed that "the only demographic\nRubio can plausibly claim to represent is old white guys." This is not a\nsurprise. It isn\'t new. People jostle over these questions of identity all\nthe time: Sarah Palin isn\'t a real woman; Barack Obama isn\'t really black.\n\n\n\nBut a very diverse democracy makes ambiguous, line-crossing identities an\nasset. And Rubio presents the most intriguing kind of biography to the race.\n\n\n\nIn fact, Rubio is running on his biography more than he is running on\nposition papers, which is a good move. The heart of his campaign\nannouncement speech wasn\'t a list of policy proposals, it was a story about\nbeing an immigrant, about being working class, about rising to a position\nof prestige and power. Most of Rubio\'s big speeches are variations on\nthemes drawn from his biography.\n\n\n\nThe multiplicity of Rubio\'s identities doesn\'t make him illegible, it makes\nhim intriguing. And it gives different groups of voters different ways of\nrelating to him.\n\n\n\nRubio traverses a wide range of experience in his economic background. "My\nfather became a bartender. My mother a cashier, a maid, and a Kmart stock\nclerk. They never made it big. But they were successful. Two immigrants\nwith little money or education found stable jobs, owned a home, retired\nwith security, and gave all four of their children a life far better than\ntheir own," he says.\n\n\n\nIn American Son and some speeches, he talks about the burden of student\nloan debt that crushed his monthly budget as a young father and that seemed\nto be leading him away from his dream of pursuing a life in public service.\nAnd yet, Rubio proved more than successful at rising.\n\n\n\nThis diversity of experience extends to his religion, where Rubio manages\nto present himself almost simultaneously as a lifelong ethnic Catholic, an\nEvangelical convert, and a Catholic convert. And that\'s because basically,\nhe is those things. He was raised Catholic. But he and his wife eventually\nbegan attending an Evangelical church where she grew spiritually, and they\nheard the Biblical preaching they hungered for. And then he can talk about\nhis attachment to the liturgical life and sacraments of the Roman Church.\n\n\n\nA few listeners will find this all a bit too exotic, or even confused. But\nwhen he conveys these stories he can touch on little details that ring in a\nvery personal way with different groups of voters. They hear something of\ntheir own story in his, and then they hear something more.\n\n\n\nThis is what presidents do. John F. Kennedy managed to be the first\nelectable Catholic candidate for president, and could connect to the\nmassive pool of voters who descended from the Great Wave of Immigration in\nthe late 19th century. But the Kennedys lived in a style and fashion that\nwas far removed from the hardscrabble roots of Al Smith, the former New\nYork governor and unsuccessful presidential candidate. Smith seemed to\nstink of New York\'s fish markets. Kennedy lived like a WASP scion.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama\'s identity was similarly mixed by the circumstances of his\nbirth. He was black and white. He was raised in Hawaii, where racial\npolitics were entirely different from those of America\'s South or cities.\nBut he had adopted Chicago as his home, and put himself at the center of\nurban organizing.\n\n\n\nLike Obama and Kennedy, Rubio seems to have sensed at an early age how his\npersonal identity could make for an attractive political persona, and then\nshaped his resume, his policy-profile, and experiences to emphasize the\npoint. Politics at this level is almost like a casting call. The life of a\nnation is a kind of drama and voters are the audience. Politicians put\nthemselves forward as a stage-character, a protagonist who can meet the\nmoment.\n\n\n\nAs a protagonist in America\'s drama, Rubio\'s role is to represent the rise\nof the last great wave of immigration to this country, and his role is to\nreconcile the Republican Party with the future that includes these\nimmigrants and their descendants not just as beneficiaries of America\'s\ngenerous immigration policy and dynamic economy, but as full Americans with\na full say in the nation\'s future.\n\n\n\nThat older white Republican voters like Marco Rubio is only going to help\nMarco Rubio. He gives them hope that their ideals will outlive the\nNixon-Reagan coalition. And the voters that matter in battleground states\nare not always so ideological as journalists think.\n\n\n\nThere is no chance that, like Ana Marie Cox, voters will quickly roll\nthrough a known rolodex of Rubio\'s political positions and then re-classify\nhim as old, rich, and white. People in a diverse democracy want "one of us"\nto represent them; sympathetic voters will find the part of Rubio that\nmatches their own self-conception.\n\n\n\nOf course there is an element of fakery to political personas at this\nlevel. Rubio\'s own biography is sometimes messier than presented. But\nfakers have a way of becoming what they present, at least in America.\n\n\n\n*In Marco Rubio vs. Jeb Bush fight, will other GOP candidates compete in\nFlorida\xe2\x80\x99s March 15 primary?*\n<http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article22746717.html#storylink=cpy>*\n// Miami Herald // Adam C. Smith \xe2\x80\x93 May 31, 2015*\n\n\n\nLeave it to Florida to host the best political soap opera of the\npresidential campaign.\n\n\n\nThe mega-state that all but delivered the Republican nomination to Mitt\nRomney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008, likely won\xe2\x80\x99t reprise that role\nagain because as many as two dozen states will weigh in before Florida. But\nthe March 15 Sunshine State primary is shaping up as potentially\nspectacular theater nonetheless.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush versus Marco Rubio.\n\n\n\nTwo Florida favorite sons, longtime friends, mentor and protege, near\nneighbors in Miami-Dade facing off in America\xe2\x80\x99s most important battleground\nstate. What many viewed as almost unthinkable a few months ago \xe2\x80\x94 Rubio\nbeating Bush among Florida Republicans \xe2\x80\x94 no longer seems far-fetched.\n\n\n\nOther leading candidates already are pondering whether even to compete in\nFlorida\xe2\x80\x99s primary.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s a state out there we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t play in \xe2\x80\x94 other than\nmaybe Florida, where Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio are in some of the polls\nessentially tied, and they are going to eat up a good amount of that\nfinancial advantage that Gov. Bush is going to have,\xe2\x80\x9d Wisconsin Gov. Scott\nWalker said on Laura Ingraham\xe2\x80\x99s radio show last week.\n\n\n\nWe may see a preview of that Bush/Rubio campaign contrast Tuesday at Disney\nWorld when Gov. Rick Scott hosts an \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic summit\xe2\x80\x9d that will include\nspeeches by presidential prospects Bush, Rubio, Govs. Walker, Chris\nChristie of New Jersey, Rick Perry of Texas and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana,\nand former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who now lives in Florida\xe2\x80\x99s\nPanhandle.\n\n\n\nThat so many candidates would commit to a forum hundreds of miles away from\nearly voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire is testament to Florida\xe2\x80\x99s\nlofty status as a critical battleground and fundraising mecca. But Florida\nis treading on new ground this election cycle in fielding two frontrunners\nfor the GOP nomination and deciding for the first time in several cycles\nagainst holding one of the earliest primaries in the country.\n\n\n\nIn 2008 and 2012, state Republican leaders blatantly defied national party\nrules by holding earlier-than-allowed primaries, arguing that the country\xe2\x80\x99s\nbiggest and most diverse battleground state deserved more say in picking\nthe major party nominees. The Republican National Committee responded by\ncutting in half the number of delegates, but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop the leading\ncandidates from campaigning ferociously in Florida.\n\n\n\nThis year, with Bush looking increasingly likely to run, Republican\nlegislative leaders chose not to risk losing Sunshine State delegates.\nUltimately it takes about 1,235 delegates to win the nomination.\n\n\n\nFlorida legislators earlier this year scheduled the primary for March 15,\nthe earliest date in which a state can hold a \xe2\x80\x9cwinner-take-all\xe2\x80\x9d primary.\nThat means whoever wins the primary would win all 99 of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s\ndelegates. Another candidate could spend millions, fall just behind the\nwinner, and walk away with zero delegates.\n\n\n\nAt the time that was widely seen as a gift to Bush. Now, with Rubio off to\na strong early start and Bush struggling to generate widespread excitement\nwith the base of the party, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so clear.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe winner-take-all primary was a very good thing for Jeb \xe2\x80\x94 before Marco\ngot in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ana Navarro, a Bush supporter in Miami who is friendly with\nboth. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen people, including me, were calling their legislators, telling\nthem to make it winner-take-all, we were all still under the mistaken\nimpression that Marco wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to run.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe cost of campaigning in winner-take-all Florida provides a significant\nincentive for candidates to focus their efforts elsewhere. But that\xe2\x80\x99s a\nrisk, too.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTactically, looking past Florida could make sense to some of the other\ncandidates not named Jeb or Marco,\xe2\x80\x9d said Republican strategist Kevin\nMadden. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Florida, as a major swing state, is still an important test\nfor any candidacy looking to make an argument that you can win a general.\nIt puts a lot of pressure on a campaign to really perform in Ohio and the\nother contests.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nEight months is an eternity in presidential politics, and the landscape is\nlikely to look far different by the time any actual voting begins next\nyear. Former 2012 Republican frontrunners Rick Perry, Herman Cain, Michele\nBachmann and Newt Gingrich can attest to how quickly the ground can shift.\n\n\n\nMaking it even harder for 2016 candidates to decide whether or not to spend\ntime and money in Florida is the prevalence of early voting. Florida\xe2\x80\x99s\nprimary may be in mid-March, but half the votes will be cast by then.\nOverseas absentee ballots start going out by Jan. 30 \xe2\x80\x94 before Iowa voters\ncast a single vote \xe2\x80\x94 and in-state mail ballots are sent starting Feb. 9.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\n\nNot only should Florida\xe2\x80\x99s primary feel different from its recent contests,\nbut so should the entire primary season.\n\n\n\nParty leaders concluded that the protracted and contentious 2012 primary\nseason put Mitt Romney at a disadvantage heading into the general election.\nThe mandate for 2016 was fewer debates and a shorter primary season. Rather\nthan a late August nominating convention like Tampa hosted, the 2016\nconvention will be July 18-21 in Cleveland.\n\n\n\nThe season is expected to kick off in February, rather than January. And\nafter the initial four states cast their votes, the campaign for the\nnomination is likely to be defined by a series of election days featuring\nmultiple states voting.\n\n\n\nCome March 15, Florida probably will share the stage with Ohio, Missouri\nand Illinois.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be longer, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be more intense,\xe2\x80\x9d Sean Spicer,\ncommunications director for the RNC, said of the 2016 nominating season.\n\n\n\nFlorida won\xe2\x80\x99t be the first big prize after the earliest contests in Iowa,\nNew Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, as it was in the last two\npresidential election. By March 15, at least 20 states will have voted and\nprobably half of all the available delegates awarded. March 1 is expected\nto serve as a Southern primary with half a dozen or so states voting.\n\n\n\nAll those pre-Florida states, however, will allocate their delegates\nproportionally rather than winner-take-all, which means no candidate may\nhave a big lead in delegates by March 15.\n\n\n\nAnother huge question for 2016? Money versus momentum. The advent of\npolitical committees accepting unlimited contributions and billionaires\nbankrolling campaigns has knocked aside some of the old assumptions about\npresidential campaigns and made it easier for candidates to keep pushing\nahead into state after state.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the past, if you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t raise money, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t raise enough donations\nof $2,500 or less, that told you something politically,\xe2\x80\x9d said Republican\nstrategist John Weaver, another veteran of several presidential campaigns.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you only need one person to back you up and you can go deep into the\ncalendar whether you deserve to or not politically.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBush is expected to have a vast fundraising advantage over the rest of the\nfield, which means he likely would have the resources for a long slog of a\ncampaign. Even an unlimited campaign account is not necessarily enough to\novercome a string of losses, however.\n\n\n\nRubio has at least two billionaires, Oracle founder Larry Ellison of\nCalifornia and auto dealer and former Philadelphia Eagles owner Norman\nBraman of Miami, supporting his campaign.\n\n\n\nThe 2016 primary calendar is in constant flux and will remain so for\nmonths, but Republican campaign officials say the rough, tentative schedule\nleading to Florida is shaping up along these lines:\n\n\n\nFeb. 1: Iowa\n\n\n\nFeb. 9: New Hampshire\n\n\n\nFeb. 20: South Carolina\n\n\n\nFeb. 23: Nevada\n\n\n\nMarch 1: Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Massachusetts, Vermont, Minnesota,\npossibly Alabama, Wyoming, Virginia\n\n\n\nMarch 5: Kansas, Louisiana, possibly Washington State\n\n\n\nMarch 8: Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, possibly North Carolina and\nAmerican Samoa\n\n\n\nMarch 12: Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico\n\n\n\nMarch 15: Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, possibly Northern Mariana\nIslands\n\n\n\n*Trump: I won\xe2\x80\x99t do straw poll if everyone backs out\n<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/06/01/donald-trump-straw-poll-mitt-romney-gucci-store/28313569/>\n// The Des Moines Register // Josh Hafner \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nDonald Trump, the reality TV star, businessman and serial flirter with\npresidential campaigns, recently announced that he\xe2\x80\x99ll declare his 2016\nambitions on June 16 in New York City.\n\n\n\nBefore he heads to Iowa this week with visits in Mason City and Coralville,\nTrump spoke with The Des Moines Register about the Iowa Straw Poll, his\n\xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful\xe2\x80\x9d solution to the Islamic State, and discerning between celebrity\nand political appeal.\n\n\n\nAre you going to announce that you\xe2\x80\x99re running for president this month?\n\n\n\nA lot of people think that now. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget they never did think it. I do\nwell in the polls and nobody thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m running. The theme of my campaign\nis \xe2\x80\x9cMake America Great Again.\xe2\x80\x9d We\xe2\x80\x99re going to make America great again.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what people want.\n\n\n\nWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re Iowa testing the waters, how do you gauge whether these big\ncrowds you draw are people wanting to see a reality TV star or wanting to\nsee someone they think could run the country?\n\n\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that. You say to yourself: \xe2\x80\x9cDoes it translate?\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt may not translate, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But I know one thing that translates:\nThe politicians \xe2\x80\x94 and I know all of them \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re never going to make this\ncountry great.\n\n\n\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re doing well enough in polls now to nab a spot in the televised\npresidential debates. In our latest Iowa Poll, however, 85 percent of\nlikely GOP caucusgoers said they would \xe2\x80\x9cnever\xe2\x80\x9d support you for president.\n\n\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s because they don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m running. When they think I\xe2\x80\x99m running,\nthey go through the roof. I see it even on Twitter. I have millions of\npeople on Twitter and Facebook, like 6 million people on Twitter and\nFacebook. They say: \xe2\x80\x9cPlease run, but if you don\xe2\x80\x99t run, well, just leave me\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s sort of interesting. But they want me to run.\n\n\n\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re getting better numbers in some polls than several candida\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far.\nNobody\xe2\x80\x99s ever been more successful than me. I\xe2\x80\x99m the most successful person\never to run. Ross Perot isn\xe2\x80\x99t successful like me. Romney \xe2\x80\x94 I have a Gucci\nstore that\xe2\x80\x99s worth more than Romney.\n\n\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your commitment to the Iowa Straw Poll, here?\n\n\n\nIf people got together and wanted the Iowa Straw Poll, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine with it.\nBut it looks to me like it\xe2\x80\x99s not doing so well right now. If it\xe2\x80\x99s good for\nIowa and good for the poll itself, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an institution, I\xe2\x80\x99d be in\nfavor of it.\n\n\n\nSo you might not play in the Iowa Straw Poll if enough players don\xe2\x80\x99t show\nup?\n\n\n\nWell if everyone\xe2\x80\x99s going to drop out? What\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose?

The Senate was on recess last week.\n\n\n\nAfter senators pass a procedural measure on Monday to consider the House\nbill, they will begin amending it, a process that could take one to three\ndays.\n\n\n\nMr. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s stand may have forced the temporary expiration of parts of the\npost-9/11 Patriot Act used by the National Security Agency to collect phone\nrecords, but he was helped by the miscalculation of Senator Mitch\nMcConnell, the majority leader, who sent the Senate on a weeklong vacation\nafter blocking the House bill before Memorial Day.\n\n\n\nMr. McConnell, also of Kentucky, relented on Sunday, setting up a final\nround of votes on Tuesday or Wednesday that will most likely send a\ncompromised version of the House bill to President Obama for his signature.\nEven Mr. Paul, using the procedural weapon of an objection, conceded he\ncould not stop that.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle by little, we\xe2\x80\x99ve allowed our freedom to slip away,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Paul said\nduring a lengthy floor soliloquy.\n\n\n\nThe expiration of surveillance authority demonstrates a profound shift in\nAmerican attitudes since the days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist\nattacks, when national security was pre-eminent in both parties. Fourteen\nyears after that attack, even as American conflicts continue abroad, a\nswell of privacy concerns stemming from both the vast expansion of\ncommunication systems and an increasing distrust of government\xe2\x80\x99s use of\ndata has turned those concerns on their head.\n\n\n\nWhile it would represent a retrenchment on the part of the government, it\ndoes not end the argument over the dual imperatives of security and\nindividual liberty brought to light by Edward J. Snowden, the former\ncontractor for the National Security Agency.\n\n\n\nThe expiration of three key provisions of the Patriot Act means that, for\nnow, the N.S.A. will no longer collect newly created logs of Americans\xe2\x80\x99\nphone calls in bulk. It also means that the F.B.I. cannot invoke the\nPatriot Act to obtain, for new investigations, wiretap orders that follow a\nsuspect who changes phones, wiretap orders for a \xe2\x80\x9clone wolf\xe2\x80\x9d terrorism\nsuspect not linked to a group, or court orders to obtain business records\nrelevant to an investigation.\n\n\n\nHowever, the Justice Department may invoke a so-called grandfather clause\nto keep using those powers for investigations that had started before June\n1, and there are additional workarounds investigators may use to overcome\nthe lapse in the authorizations.\n\n\n\nMr. McConnell and other national security hawks who failed to continue the\nprogram badly underestimated the shift in the national mood, which has\nfound its voice with Democrats and the libertarian wing of the Republican\nParty. The moment also put him at odds with Mr. Paul, whom he has endorsed\nfor president.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remain determined to work toward the best outcome for the American\npeople possible under the circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. McConnell said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\nwhere we are, colleagues \xe2\x80\x94 a House-passed bill with some serious flaws, and\nan inability to get a short-term extension to improve the House bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s effort clearly angered many of his Republican colleagues, who\nmet without him an hour before the Senate began to vote Sunday night.\nSenator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who sparred with Mr. Paul on\nthe floor over procedure, said later that Mr. Paul was not fit for the\nWhite House job he seeks. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve said on many occasions that I believe he\nwould be the worst candidate we could put forward,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nEven as senators were trickling into the Capitol from the airport, Mr.\nMcConnell attempted to extend some aspects of the law. He asked senators to\nconsider a two-week continuation of the federal authority to track a \xe2\x80\x9clone\nwolf\xe2\x80\x9d terrorism suspect not connected to a state sponsor and to conduct\n\xe2\x80\x9croving\xe2\x80\x9d surveillance of a suspect, rather than of a phone number alone, to\ncombat terrorists who frequently discard cellphones.\n\n\n\nBut Mr. Paul objected, and Mr. McConnell denounced from the Senate floor\nwhat he called \xe2\x80\x9ca campaign of demagoguery and disinformation\xe2\x80\x9d about the\nprogram.\n\n\n\nMr. McConnell then moved to a second option, a procedural move to take up\nthe bill passed by the House, which he said the Senate would amend this\nweek. It was unclear Sunday how many amendments, including any from Mr.\nPaul, would be considered and whether any could pass the Senate or be\nadopted by the House.\n\n\n\nThe House bill would overhaul the Patriot Act and scale back the bulk\ncollection of phone records revealed by Mr. Snowden. Under the provisions\nof the House bill, sweeps that had operated under the guise of so-called\nnational security letters issued by the F.B.I. would end. The data would\ninstead be stored by the phone companies and could be retrieved by\nintelligence agencies only after approval of the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act court.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama and his director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper\nJr., have made dire warnings in recent days about the perils of letting the\nlaw expire and called for immediate approval of a surveillance bill passed\nby the House. The C.I.A. director, John O. Brennan, echoed the president on\nSunday during an interview on the CBS show \xe2\x80\x9cFace the Nation,\xe2\x80\x9d saying there\nhad \xe2\x80\x9cbeen a little too much political grandstanding.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn a statement issued Sunday night, the White House said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe call on the\nSenate to ensure this irresponsible lapse in authorities is as short-lived\nas possible. On a matter as critical as our national security, individual\nsenators must put aside their partisan motivations and act swiftly. The\nAmerican people deserve nothing less.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, also urged the Senate to act,\nciting the threat of groups like the Islamic State. \xe2\x80\x9cAl Qaeda, ISIL and\nother terrorists around the globe continue to plot attacks on America and\nour allies,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Boehner said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who is satisfied with\nletting this critical intelligence capability go dark isn\xe2\x80\x99t taking the\nterrorist threat seriously.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. McConnell had sought to get a series of short-term extensions passed so\nthat Congress could continue to work on a compromise \xe2\x80\x94 like giving the\nphone companies more time to adapt to the new law \xe2\x80\x94 but that effort\ncollapsed under the objections of Mr. Paul and two Democrats, Ron Wyden of\nOregon and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico. Further, members of the House\nrejected extending the current law, given the support for their bill.\n\n\n\nAfter a middle-of-the-night vote for a short-term extension failed on the\nSaturday before Memorial Day, senators left for a weeklong recess as the\nclock ticked. Senate Republican leaders sought a compromise that would make\na new bill acceptable to both hawkish lawmakers and Mr. Paul. \xe2\x80\x9cI still have\ndeep concerns,\xe2\x80\x9d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine.\n\n\n\nOver the week, negotiators on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees\nhad laid out a series of options to revise the bipartisan USA Freedom Act,\nincluding the addition of a certification process to ensure that the\ntechnology is ready to move metadata storage to the phone companies and\nallowing for a longer transition to phone company storage of the data. The\nHouse negotiators were skeptical of all efforts.\n\n\n\nDemocrats were critical of Mr. McConnell on Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cThe job of the leader\nis to have a plan,\xe2\x80\x9d Senator Harry Reid of Nevada said on the Senate floor.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this case, it is clear the majority leader simply didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a plan.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Muslim Woman Denied Job Over Head Scarf Wins in Supreme Court\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/us/supreme-court-rules-in-samantha-elauf-abercrombie-fitch-case.html>\n// NYT // Adam Liptak - June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 The Supreme Court on Monday revived an employment\ndiscrimination lawsuit against Abercrombie & Fitch, which had refused to\nhire a Muslim woman because she wore a head scarf.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is really easy,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Antonin Scalia said in announcing the\ndecision from the bench.\n\n\n\nThe company at least suspected that the woman, Samantha Elauf, wore the\nhead scarf for religious reasons, Justice Scalia said, and its decision not\nto hire her was motivated by a desire to avoid accommodating her religious\npractice. That was enough, he concluded, to allow her to sue under federal\nemployment discrimination law.\n\n\n\nThe vote was 8-to-1, with Justice Clarence Thomas dissenting.\n\n\n\nThe case started in 2008, when Ms. Elauf, then 17, applied for a job in a\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s clothing store owned by Abercrombie & Fitch at the Woodland\nHills Mall in Tulsa, Okla. She wore a black head scarf but did not say why.\n\n\n\nThe company declined to hire her, saying her scarf clashed with the\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s dress code, which called for a \xe2\x80\x9cclassic East Coast collegiate\nstyle.\xe2\x80\x9d After the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued on Ms.\nElauf\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, the company said it had no reason to know that Ms. Elauf\xe2\x80\x99s\nhead scarf, a hijab, was required by her faith.\n\n\n\nIn its Supreme Court brief in the case, E.E.O.C. v. Abercrombie & Fitch\nStores, No. 14-86, the company argued that job applicants should not be\nallowed \xe2\x80\x9cto remain silent and to assume that the employer recognizes the\nreligious motivations behind their fashion decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAfter the case was argued in February, an Abercrombie spokesman said the\ncompany \xe2\x80\x9chas a longstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion, and\nconsistent with the law has granted numerous religious accommodations when\nrequested, including hijabs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that Ms. Elauf did not have to make a specific\nrequest for a religious accommodation to obtain relief under the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, which prohibits religious discrimination in hiring.\n\n\n\nAt the trial, Ms. Elauf said she loved movies, shopping, sushi and the\nmall. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like my second home,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Her experience with\nAbercrombie, she said, made her feel \xe2\x80\x9cdisrespected because of my religious\nbeliefs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was born in the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I thought I was the same\nas everyone else.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA jury awarded Ms. Elauf $20,000.\n\n\n\nBut the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver,\nruled for the company.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMs. Elauf never informed Abercrombie prior to its hiring decision that she\nwore her head scarf, or \xe2\x80\x98hijab,\xe2\x80\x99 for religious reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Jerome A.\nHolmes wrote for the court.\n\n\n\n*Supreme Court Overturns Conviction in Online Threats Case\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/us/supreme-court-rules-in-anthony-elonis-online-threats-case.html?contentCollection=us&action=click&module=NextInCollection&region=Footer&pgtype=article>\n// NYT // Adam Liptak \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 The Supreme Court on Monday made it harder to prosecute people\nfor threats made on Facebook and other social media, reversing the\nconviction of a Pennsylvania man who directed brutally violent language\nagainst his estranged wife.\n\n\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, said that\nprosecutors must do more than prove that reasonable people would view\nstatements as threats. The defendant\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind matters, the chief\njustice wrote, though he declined to say just where the legal line is drawn.\n\n\n\nChief Justice Roberts wrote for seven justices. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.\nvoted with the majority, though he said that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s recklessness\nshould suffice. The majority opinion took no position on that possibility.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAttorneys and judges are left to guess,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Alito wrote.\n\n\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas issued a similar criticism in his dissent.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur job is to decide questions, not create them,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cGiven the\nmajority\xe2\x80\x99s ostensible concern for protecting innocent actors, one would\nhave expected it to announce a clear rule\xe2\x80\x94any clear rule. Its failure to do\nso reveals the fractured foundation upon which today\xe2\x80\x99s decision rests.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe case concerned threatening rap lyrics that arose from domestic\ntroubles. Anthony Elonis, a Pennsylvania man who had adopted the rap\npersona Tone Dougie, posted long tirades in the form of rap lyrics on\nFacebook.\n\n\n\nMr. Elonis wrote that he would like to see a Halloween costume that\nincluded his wife\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chead on a stick.\xe2\x80\x9d He talked about \xe2\x80\x9cmaking a name for\nmyself\xe2\x80\x9d with a school shooting, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHell hath no fury like a crazy man\nin a kindergarten class.\xe2\x80\x9d He fantasized about killing an F.B.I. agent.\n\n\n\nSome of the posts contained disclaimers or indications that they aspired to\nbe art or therapy. At Mr. Elonis\xe2\x80\x99s trial, his estranged wife testified that\nshe understood the posts as threats.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt like I was being stalked,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt extremely afraid for\nmine and my children\xe2\x80\x99s and my family\xe2\x80\x99s lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Elonis was convicted under a federal law that makes it a crime to\ncommunicate \xe2\x80\x9cany threat to injure the person of another.\xe2\x80\x9d He was sentenced\nto 44 months.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has said that \xe2\x80\x9ctrue threats\xe2\x80\x9d are not protected by the\nFirst Amendment, but it has not been especially clear about what counts as\nsuch a threat.\n\n\n\nThe question for the justices in the case, Elonis v. United States, No.\n13-983, was whether prosecutors had done enough to prove Mr. Elonis\xe2\x80\x99s\nintent. Prosecutors had argued that the words and their context were\nenough, saying that people should be held accountable \xe2\x80\x9cfor the ordinary and\nnatural meaning of the words that they say in context.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Elonis\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers said more was required. Ideally, they said,\nprosecutors should have to prove that the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s purpose was to threaten\nsomeone. Failing that, they said, prosecutors should at least have to prove\nthat the speaker, whatever his or her purpose, knew that it was virtually\ncertain that someone would feel threatened.\n\n\n\nThe lower courts sided with the government. All the prosecution had to\nprove, the trial judge ruled, was that a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable person\xe2\x80\x9d would foresee\nthat others would view statements \xe2\x80\x9cas a serious expression of an intention\nto inflict bodily injury or take the life of an individual.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is distinguished,\xe2\x80\x9d the judge said, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom idle or careless talk,\nexaggeration, something said in a joking manner or an outburst of\ntransitory anger.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Caitlyn Jenner, Formerly Bruce, Introduces Herself in Vanity Fair\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/business/media/jenner-reveals-new-name-in-vanity-fair-article.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news>\n// NYT // Ravi Somaiya \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nIn April, Bruce Jenner spoke about her transition to being a woman in a\ntelevision special that drew nearly 17 million viewers.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, that woman revealed her new identity, appearing as Caitlyn\nJenner on the cover of Vanity Fair. The photograph of Ms. Jenner in a\ncorset, shot by Annie Leibovitz and accompanied by the headline \xe2\x80\x9cCall Me\nCaitlyn,\xe2\x80\x9d immediately became a sensation on social media when the magazine\nposted the article online.\n\n\n\nMs. Jenner, 65, who won an Olympic gold medal in the decathlon, has had a\nlong public life. As Bruce Jenner, she had been on the cover of Playgirl,\nan author, an actor and most recently a part of the Kardashian family\xe2\x80\x99s\nreality television empire. Earlier this year, reports emerged that Bruce\nJenner was in the process of becoming a woman.\n\n\n\nThe Vanity Fair article represents the latest in a carefully calibrated\nseries of public steps by Ms. Jenner and her team, as she moves toward the\ndebut of a new reality show on the E! network that will begin at the end of\nJuly, and a new public life as a woman. A Twitter account, in the name of\nCaitlyn Jenner, was started at the same time that the Vanity Fair article\nwas published online. Within hours, the account had more than 1.1 million\nfollowers.\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the perception from some that the article was part of an\norchestrated campaign by Ms. Jenner, Vanity Fair\xe2\x80\x99s editor, Graydon Carter,\nsaid that \xe2\x80\x9call stories are part of some coordinated rollout, all stories\neverywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d citing movie releases and even presidential campaigns.\n\n\n\nThe article was written by Buzz Bissinger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning\nreporter and the author of the acclaimed book \xe2\x80\x9cFriday Night Lights,\xe2\x80\x9d about\na high school football team in Texas. The magazine had first thought of\nrunning an article on Ms. Jenner last year, a spokeswoman said, but it\nbegan taking shape this year when a publicist for Ms. Jenner contacted an\neditor at Vanity Fair.\n\n\n\nA truly news-making magazine cover story has become increasingly rare in\nthe digital age, though Mr. Carter said that the covers of magazines remain\ncultural touchstones. (The online rollout of the article seemed to tacitly\nacknowledge that rarity; the physical copy of the magazine with Ms. Jenner\non the cover won\xe2\x80\x99t be available at newsstands until June 9. The online\nversion of the article could be purchased for $4.99, and the website had\nbroken its traffic record in just a few hours, with more than 6 million\nunique visitors.)\n\n\n\nVanity Fair went to extraordinary lengths to keep its scoop a secret, a\nspokeswoman said.\n\n\n\nOnly a few people at the magazine knew about the article. It was held on a\ncomputer that was kept in a locked office and not connected to the\nmagazine\xe2\x80\x99s server. There was security at the photo shoot and at the plant\nwhere the magazine is printed.\n\n\n\nMr. Bissinger said in a telephone interview that he was assigned to write\nthe article because \xe2\x80\x9cof the sports connection, and my own journey into the\nworld of cross-dressing,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to a revealing article he wrote for GQ\nmagazine in 2013 in which he detailed his fondness for designer clothing\nintended for both genders.\n\n\n\nHe first met with Ms. Jenner in February, he said, and was allowed \xe2\x80\x9cpretty\nmuch carte blanche to be there, to soak him up, to have access to other\npeople in his life,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the kind of journalism you don\xe2\x80\x99t see\nany more.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Carter said the magazine was not forced to leave any details\nout.\n\n\n\nMr. Bissinger, who describes himself in the article as \xe2\x80\x9ca cross-dresser\nwith a big-time fetish for women\xe2\x80\x99s leather,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote that he spent hundreds\nof hours with Ms. Jenner over three months, and that it was an occasionally\nsurreal experience.\n\n\n\nMs. Jenner had started to make the transition in the 1980s, the Vanity Fair\narticle reveals, shortly after winning the gold medal at the Montreal\nOlympics in 1976. Even as she traveled the United States, making speeches\nand starring in commercials, she wore pantyhose and a bra underneath her\nsuit. She stopped, fearful of the public reaction, but began again recently\nwhen her marriage to Kris Jenner, the matriarch of the Kardashians, ended.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I was lying on my deathbed and I had kept this secret and never did\nanything about it, I would be lying there saying, \xe2\x80\x98You just blew your\nentire life,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d she told Mr. Bissinger. Bruce Jenner was always lying, she\nsaid; Caitlyn can be honest.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she doing a TV show? Sure,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bissinger said. \xe2\x80\x9cIs she doing it for\nmoney personally? Sure. This is America. But I saw a person transformed\ninto a woman, who is joyous and happy and free and living life in a way\nthat Bruce Jenner never did.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*California Senate votes to raise state minimum wage to $13 in 2017 - LA\nTimes\n<http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-california-senate-votes-to-raise-wage-20150529-story.html?track=rss&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&dlvrit=1153586>\n// LA Times // Patrick McGreevy \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nThe state Senate on Monday approved a bill that would raise the minimum\nwage in California from $9 to $11 an hour on Jan. 1 and boost it again to\n$13 in 2017, with supporters saying it is necessary to lift millions of\nworkers out of poverty.\n\n\n\nSen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) introduced the measure out of concern that\na quarter of the state\xe2\x80\x99s 38 million residents live in poverty, according to\nthe U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is time that we make it illegal to pay sub-poverty wages in\nCalifornia,\xe2\x80\x9d Leno told his colleagues during the heated floor debate.\n\n\n\nHe said the wage increase would boost the economy because working families\nwould be able to spend more money at local businesses. \xe2\x80\x9cIts going to be\nspent immediately to meet daily needs in our community," he said.\n\n\n\nThe Senate approved the bill on a 23-15 party line vote.\n\n\n\nSen. Jeff Stone (R-Murrieta) predicted raising the minimum wage would force\nbusinesses to cut their number of workers. The proposal \xe2\x80\x9churts the economy\nby causing job losses," he said.\n\n\n\nAdded, Sen. Tom Berryhill (R-Modesto), \xe2\x80\x9cMinimum wage was never meant to be\na living wage. It is a start-up wage for kids.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAn employee working full time and earning $9 per hour takes home $18,000\nannually before taxes, Leno said, noting that is 75% of the federal poverty\nline for a family of four.\n\n\n\nA bill approved two years ago has the minimum wage increasing to $10 on\nJan. 1 in California. His new bill would have set raises and then increase\nwages with the rate of inflation starting in 2019.\n\n\n\nLeno failed to win legislative approval last year of a bill similar to his\nnew proposal.

Abu\nFiras, a former Syrian air-force colonel who defected and now serves as\nspokesman for the Levant Front, a local coalition of rebel groups.\n\n\n\nTurkish officials expressed concern Monday, as the group advanced within 30\nmiles of Bab es-Salam, one of the main border crossings between Syria and\nTurkey.\n\n\n\nAlso known as Oncupinar, Bab es-Salam is the gateway to the Turkish border\ncity of Kilis, a way station for jihadists making their way in and out of\nSyria.\n\n\n\nTurkey closed the crossing in early March, citing security concerns. It\nreopened in May to commercial trucks and humanitarian aid deliveries, but\nnot to Syrian civilians wanting to cross into Turkey.\n\n\n\nA Turkish official at the crossing said Turkey was preparing to receive an\nadditional 60,000 Syrian refugees should the group manage to seize the\nSyrian cities of Mare and Tel Rifat, located about 13 miles from Kilis.\n\n\n\nRebels in northeast Aleppo have been fighting Islamic State for a year and\na half in northeast Aleppo province. The battle has become a microcosm of\nSyria\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly complicated war, with rebels, Islamic State and the\nregime vying for territory on interconnected front lines.\n\n\n\nIn an increasingly partitioned country, areas controlled by Islamic State\nabut areas held by the regime and opposition, with civilians often caught\nin the middle of the warring sides\xe2\x80\x99 territorial gains and losses.\n\n\n\nIslamic State\xe2\x80\x99s latest advance, in the wake of its May conquests of the\nstrategic central Syrian city of Palmyra, and Ramadi, the capital of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s\nlargest province, showcases its growing strength against a fractious\nopposition and weakening Syrian regime forces.\n\n\n\nFollowing the capture of Palmyra, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights,\nan opposition monitoring group, said Islamic State now controls 50% of\nSyria.\n\n\n\nOn the heels of its speedy capture of Palmyra, the group\xe2\x80\x99s advance into\nAleppo has rebel fighters questioning the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to containing\nthe group.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dependability and seriousness of the West is questionable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ahmad\nQura Ali, spokesman for the Aleppo-based Ahrar Al Sham faction.\n\n\n\nThe timing of Islamic State\xe2\x80\x99s Aleppo offensive has also prompted rebels to\nallege that it has been coordinating with the Syrian regime.\n\n\n\nOpposition fighters had been planning to launch an offensive against regime\nforces in the city of Aleppo, in an attempt to finally win a yearslong\nbattle of attrition that has severely damaged Syria\xe2\x80\x99s onetime economic hub.\n\n\n\nBut the arrival of Islamic State delayed those plans, as rebels scrambled\nMonday to divert reinforcements from the city to the new front lines.\n\n\n\nRebels said plans to strike regime strongholds in central Syria and the\nwestern coast, President Bashar al-Assad\xe2\x80\x99s ancestral homeland, have also\nbeen put on hold as fighters focus on curbing Islamic State\xe2\x80\x99s gains in the\nnorth.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe timing of this serves the interests of the regime completely,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Ali\nsaid.\n\n\n\nResidents said Monday that government planes have increased their shelling\nof opposition-held areas in Aleppo city and province since April, killing\nand wounding hundreds of civilians.\n\n\n\n*What\xe2\x80\x99s actually in Obama\xe2\x80\x99s secret trade deal?\n<http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/06/the-overlooked-burden-of-overseas-tariffs-000059?hp=t1_r>\n// Politico // Michael Grunwald \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nVietnam slaps tariffs of 70 percent on U.S. cars and machinery, 35 percent\non U.S. chemicals, 30 percent on U.S. biscuits and baked goods, and 25\npercent on U.S. recording equipment. Japan marks up our oranges 16 percent\nfrom June through November and 32 percent from December through May; it\nmarks up our beef exports 38.5 percent all year long. Cars made in America\nface a 30 percent tariff in Malaysia, which might not seem stiff compared\nto 50 percent on motorcycles or 35 percent on plywood, except that cars\nmade in Japan and other Asian nations don\xe2\x80\x99t face any tariff in Malaysia.\n\n\n\nThese burdensome overseas tariffs, provided to POLITICO by US Trade\nRepresentative Michael Froman, are the kind of problems President Obama\nhopes to address with the free trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific\nPartnership, which has not yet been finalized but has recently erupted into\none of the most contentious topics on Washington\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.\n\n\n\nThe public debate has focused on the adequacy of TPP\xe2\x80\x99s environmental and\nlabor safeguards, its potential to feather the nests of well-connected\npharmaceutical, software and finance interests, and the secrecy of its\nnegotiations. But the heart of the deal is an effort by the twelve\nparticipating countries to phase out tariffs and other export barriers for\nmore than 11,000 categories of commodities, and Froman is frustrated that\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t getting more attention. In an interview with POLITICO, he said\nexport-supported U.S. jobs pay 13 to 18 percent more than the average job,\nand argued that freer trade along the Pacific Rim would create a lot more\nof them.\n\n\n\nSo I asked if Froman would give me a rundown of actual tariffs he\xe2\x80\x99s trying\nto remove, and he agreed. Global tariffs are not secret information\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re\nkept on file at the World Customs Organization, and Froman has mentioned a\nfew in speeches\xe2\x80\x94but they\xe2\x80\x99re rarely seen in large quantities outside\ntechnical reports, and Froman hopes that taking a bunch of examples public\nwill help build support for TPP. The deal is not done yet, so Froman can\xe2\x80\x99t\ndiscuss how much the various import restrictions he cited will be reduced,\nbut the point of the negotiations is to reduce them. There are plenty of\nlegitimate concerns about free trade and TPP that have nothing to do with\ntariffs, some of them highlighted in a critique in POLITICO last week  by a\nDemocrat who read a draft, but Froman believes most Americans would at\nleast back the administration\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to tear down these tariffs.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot easier for our critics to focus on this controversial\nelement or that controversial element, rather than what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to\nachieve,\xe2\x80\x9d Froman told me.\n\n\n\nFroman and I spoke last Friday in his office a block from the White House;\nI noticed the 1934 law repealing the notorious Smoot-Hawley tariffs, which\nhelped drag America into the Great Depression, hanging on the wall of his\nanteroom. Critics like New York Times columnist Paul Krugman  and MIT\neconomist Simon Johnson have suggested that TPP isn\xe2\x80\x99t really about breaking\ndown Smoot-Hawley-style barriers, because previous trade deals over the\nlast three decades have already created a low-tariff world. But while\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s mostly true of the U.S., which imposes no duties on 70 percent of\nour imports\xe2\x80\x9480 percent from TPP nations\xe2\x80\x94Froman offered a slew of data and\nexamples suggesting that\xe2\x80\x99s not always true abroad.\n\n\n\nOverall, the U.S. imposes an average tariff of 1.4 percent on foreign\ngoods, less than half the average for the rest of the nations Froman is\nnegotiating with, barely a fourth the average in Vietnam and Malaysia. And\nit can get much worse for specific industries and products. TPP nations\nhave tariffs ranging up to 100 percent on textiles, 87 percent on corn, and\n75 percent on consumer goods, not to mention selected Japanese tariffs that\namount to 189 percent on U.S. shoes and a don\xe2\x80\x99t-even-think-about-it 778\npercent on U.S. rice above a certain annual quota.\n\n\n\nEven our friendly trading partner to the north has some brutal\nanti-American protectionism on its books. The North American Free Trade\nAgreement of 1994 broke down a slew of barriers between the U.S. and\nCanada, but it exempted the poultry and dairy industries, which is why U.S.\neggs face tariffs of up to 163.5 percent\xe2\x80\x94and not less than 79.9 cents per\ndozen\xe2\x80\x94in the land of ice hockey and eh. U.S. yogurt, milk, cheese, and\nfrozen chicken all face tariffs between 237.5 percent and 249 percent in\nCanada.\n\n\n\nIn some TPP countries, tariffs not only make U.S. exports more expensive,\nthey make U.S. exports more expensive relative to goods from other\ncountries. For example, America\xe2\x80\x99s construction equipment only faces a 5\npercent tariff in New Zealand, but construction equipment from Southeast\nAsia faces no tariffs there. Vietnam slaps tariffs of 20 percent on beauty\nand skin products from the U.S. while importing similar products from its\nAsian neighbors duty-free. Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s tariffs for U.S. poultry are also\ntwice as high as for Australian poultry, and its tariffs for switches,\nrelays and fuses made in America are four times as high as for the same\nproducts made in China. Our polymers and tree nuts face similar\ndiscrimination in Malaysia, as do our aluminum bars and frozen potatoes in\nJapan. American vineyards are among the biggest losers from Japanese\nprotectionism, facing a 50 percent wine tariff while their Chilean and\nAustralian rivals face none.\n\n\n\nFroman provided a wide-ranging list of categories where TPP countries still\nmaintain tariffs, from health products to communications technologies to\nhigh-tech instruments to fish. The biggest category was agriculture, where\nU.S. farmers and ranchers face tariffs on apples, cotton, wheat, soybeans,\nfresh and processed vegetables, pork, feeds, and just about everything\nelse. Overall, American exporters shipped more than $700 billion worth of\nstuff to TPP nations last year, so better access to TPP markets could bring\na lot of additional revenue into the United States.\n\n\n\nWhile global tariffs clearly have not disappeared, it\xe2\x80\x99s true that they\xe2\x80\x99re\ngenerally much lower than they were decades ago, even where they\xe2\x80\x99re much\nhigher than ours. The U.S. already has bilateral trade deals with many TPP\nnations. But Froman says the TPP will also tear down the kind of\n\xe2\x80\x9cnon-tariff barriers\xe2\x80\x9d that countries have used to protect their industries\nwithout violating the earlier deals, like sudden declarations that U.S.\nturkey products are unsafe for Australian consumers, or selective laws\nrestricting U.S. express delivery services from doing business in Malaysia.\nThe TPP is also expected to prohibit laws requiring foreign businesses to\nlocate their computer servers in the country, as well as excessively\nburdensome regulations on global e-commerce. These kinds of barriers can be\nparticularly troublesome in finance, data processing, engineering and other\nservice industries where U.S. firms tend to be prominent.\n\n\n\nIt must be said that removing some non-tariff barriers\xe2\x80\x94for example, forcing\nTPP nations to respect patents for expensive U.S. pharmaceuticals, or\ncopyrights for U.S. software\xe2\x80\x94would not necessarily be good for the world\xe2\x80\x99s\nconsumers. But they would be good for the U.S. industries in question. It\nshould also be mentioned that some U.S. industries\xe2\x80\x94notably textiles,\nfootwear, sugar, and dairy\xe2\x80\x94still enjoy trade protections that would be\nreduced through TPP. But Froman said the administration is working hard to\nmake sure their concerns are addressed, and the textile industry actually\ncame out in favor of the Trade Promotion Authority \xe2\x80\x9cfast-track\xe2\x80\x9d bill that\nis considered a prerequisite for TPP\xe2\x80\x99s passage.\n\n\n\nFroman made TPP sound so rosy for U.S. companies that I finally asked him:\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s in it for the other countries? The answer, he said, is a combination\nof improved access to U.S. markets, greatly improved access to Japan, the\nopportunity to lure U.S. businesses away from a restrictive China, and a\nkind of Good Housekeeping seal of approval as a member of the free-trade\nclub. I also suggested to Froman that if TPP will really do so much more to\nlower trade barriers abroad, it must seem weird to his negotiating partners\nthat the deal is so hotly disputed in the U.S., especially among members of\nObama\xe2\x80\x99s party. He said the fraught domestic debate actually bolsters the\nU.S. negotiating position, because those partners are savvy enough to\nunderstand that a deal without strong support from the U.S. agriculture and\nbusiness communities and strong labor and environmental protections would\nhave no chance of passing.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey follow our politics. They read POLITICO Pro,\xe2\x80\x9d Froman said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey know\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re not bluffing, and that has helped us strengthen this deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFroman refused to discuss what the final TPP will do to any of the specific\ntariffs and general tariff categories we discussed, but he hinted that just\nabout all of them will be cut or eliminated. In any case, when the deal is\ndone, the text will be published at ustr.gov\xe2\x80\x94and POLITICO will do a\nfollow-up comparing the before and after tariffs on U.S. products.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot wait,\xe2\x80\x9d Froman said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to clear up a lot of\nmisconceptions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*OPINIONS/EDITORIALS/BLOGS*\n\n\n\n*The more the merrier: Democratic candidates for 2016\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/01/opinions/pfeiffer-democrats-more-candidates-the-better/index.html>\n// CNN // Dan Pfeiffer \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\n(CNN)This is something I don\'t find myself saying very often: I agree with\nKarl Rove.\n\n\n\nIn a recent post on Medium, the former strategist for President George W.\nBush made the case that the historically large size of the GOP primary\nwasn\'t a disadvantage, rebutting some conventional wisdom that a\n20-candidate field would be a net negative for the Grand Ole Party. There\nare so many candidates running that some have compared it to a clown car\nand not just because Donald Trump is thinking of running.\n\n\n\nWhile the Democratic primary doesn\'t resemble the clown car nature of the\nRepublican field (in part because it\'s not filled with clowns), it did get\na little bigger this weekend, with former Maryland Gov. Martin O\'Malley\njoining Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the race. And\nwhat Rove wrote about the Republicans is even more true of the Democrats. A\ncompetitive primary is not just not a disadvantage as Rove writes; it will\nactually be an advantage. A fight for the Democratic nomination is good for\nthe party and will help us, not hurt us, next year in November.\n\n\n\nFirst, competitive primaries make better general election candidates. As\ndivisive, heated and long as the 2008 Democratic primary was, there is no\nquestion that Barack Obama was a much stronger nominee because of Clinton.\nHe honed his skills as a candidate, sharpened his message and became a\nstronger debater. He learned how to take a punch and throw one right back.\nMost importantly, he faced political adversity time and again and learned\nhow to handle it.\n\n\n\nIf Clinton is our nominee, which is at this point the overwhelmingly most\nlikely scenario, she will be better prepared to take on Jeb Bush, Marco\nRubio or whoever else the Republicans nominate because Sanders and O\'Malley\nmade her that way.\n\n\n\nSecond, competitive primaries make better general election campaigns. In\n2008, Obama won Indiana, North Carolina and Virginia in large part because\nwe ran hard in those states in the primaries. The primary gave us the\nopportunity to build large grass-roots organizations with well-trained\norganizers and volunteers.\n\n\n\nWe were able to try out our get out the vote machinery in almost every\nstate in the country months before the election. Iowa and New Hampshire may\ndecide the presidency in 2016, and the Democratic nominee will be better\npositioned to win those states because of the organizations built and\ntested in the primaries.\n\n\n\nFinally, competitive primaries make better political parties. Many of the\nissues that have driven the Democratic Party in recent decades -- health\ncare, the Bush tax cuts, the Bush wars -- have been largely resolved during\nthe Obama presidency. The party is grappling a bit with what comes next --\nwith which issues and solutions are going to animate us as Democrats.\n\n\n\nUnlike the Republicans, Democrats are not a collection of competing and\noften contradictory interests. We are unified, we know what we stand for\nand are confident in our ideals, but how do we apply those ideals to a new\nset of evolving challenges?\n\n\n\nHistorically, these questions have been answered in robust primary debates.\nIf O\'Malley and Sanders run good, idea-driven campaigns, there will be a\nrobust debate about the future of the Democratic Party that will make us\nbetter in the 2016 general election and in years to come.\n\n\n\nIt\'s clear that the Clinton campaign understands this. They are running\nvery hard and building the sorts of campaigns in Iowa and New Hampshire\nthat are designed to win tough races. They are running like an underdog,\nnot the biggest favorite in history.\n\n\n\nThere is an important caveat -- one that Rove hints at in his column about\nthe Republican side: Competitive, hard-fought primaries are good until they\naren\'t. There is a moment where they can go from competitive to irreparably\ndivisive. The Obama-Clinton race came close to crossing that line a couple\nof times, but never did because both candidates worked hard to repair the\nbreach.\n\n\n\nThere should be robust debate about ideas and issues, about who would make\na better president and leader of the party. But when Democrats use\nRepublican talking points to describe other Democrats, that crosses a line.\nIf that happens, it will be incumbent on the whole party -- from President\nObama on down -- to call foul. Fortunately, the risk of this primary\ngetting out of hand is very small, given the individuals involved and the\nshared sense that winning this election is critical for the future of the\nissues that matter to Democrats.\n\n\n\nReporters, pundits and people who own television stations in places such as\nIowa are rooting for a fight for the Democratic nomination, and Democrats\nshould be, too. A competition, not a coronation, is what\'s best for our\nchances in 2016.\n\n\n\n*Why Hillary should stop running as the incumbent\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/achenblog/wp/2015/06/01/why-hillary-should-stop-running-as-the-incumbent/>\n// WaPo // Joel Achenbach \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nJack Shafer nailed it when he wrote recently in Politico that Hillary\nClinton is not running for president, but running as president. She rarely\ntakes a question from a reporter. News organizations spend a small fortune\ndispatching  reporters and photographers and camera crews to follow her\naround, but they\xe2\x80\x99re treated like carry-on baggage.\n\n\n\nOne can understand why anyone in the Clinton camp would have a jaundiced\nview of the news media and might view news in general as something that\nshould be planned and crafted in advance, protected against unsupervised\nnuances and unhelpful twists, and approved by at least four layers of\nmanagement, including the candidate herself, Bill, the folks at the\nFoundation and their various foreign benefactors. I\xe2\x80\x99m sympathetic, in other\nwords. Still, the obvious downside is that it makes the candidacy\nuninteresting. As a citizen, you have to force yourself to pay attention.\nThe Democrats don\xe2\x80\x99t have much of a contest, with all due respect to\nfiring-on-both-cylinders candidates Bernie Sanders and Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley.\n\n\n\nSuccessful candidacies and successful presidencies have a point to them;\ninevitability isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a question that I throw out in all\nsincerity: Why is Clinton running? No doubt she has explained her candidacy\nmany times and in many ways, and I just missed those news reports (and I am\nnot being sarcastic here, it\xe2\x80\x99s just, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been distracted by\nother stuff, like the destiny of the species and the fate of the universe\nand whatnot). She certainly has an impressive r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 and most folks who are\nnot hard-core haters would view her as qualified to be president. But\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s her candidacy about?\n\n\n\nThose of us who have been around awhile remember the telling moment when\nRoger Mudd asked Teddy Kennedy why he wanted to be president. The senator\nfumbled the answer. The real answer was: Because he could. Because he might\nwin. Because he was a Kennedy.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillary: It\xe2\x80\x99s My Turn\xe2\x80\x9d is Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign motto, my friend and\ncolleague Marc Fisher joked the other day at a panel discussion at our alma\nmater.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, on the Republican side, there are 137 people running for\npresident (including Lindsey Graham, who is announcing today). Do we have\nto pay attention to all these folks? No, not all of them. Not Donald Trump,\nfor example. But the standard that should guide us is not how well a\ncandidate is doing in the polls. Richard Just, another of the panelists,\nand the editor of National Journal, made a great point about news coverage\nof presidential candidacies: What they say matters, even if they have close\nto zero, or literally zero, chance of winning.\n\n\n\nThis is how political parties are shaped, Richard said. This is how a party\ndefines itself and how ideas get into circulation even if they will take\nmany years to gain traction. Goldwater was trounced in 1964, but his\nconservative ideals found their way to the White House when his acolyte\nRonald Reagan won in 1980.\n\n\n\nDana Milbank correctly notes that many of Sen. Rand Paul\xe2\x80\x99s statements in\nrecent months sound more like Democratic positions than Republican\npositions, and this will make it hard for Paul to capture his party\xe2\x80\x99s\nnomination. But I suspect he is playing a longer game. His people told me\n(when I did my profile on the senator) that they don\xe2\x80\x99t think the GOP can\nwin a national presidential election unless they expand the coalition,\nbringing in more young people, minorities and people who are normally\ndisaffected and don\xe2\x80\x99t go to the polls. The Republican candidate has won a\npopular-vote majority only once in the past six elections. That\xe2\x80\x99s likely a\nmulti-election project. And it\xe2\x80\x99s why Paul is an interesting candidate \xe2\x80\x94\neven if he\xe2\x80\x99s not likely to be the Republican nominee in 2016.\n\n\n\n*Populism Strains Both Parties; Can They Adapt?\n<http://www.wsj.com/articles/populist-election-themes-show-strains-in-both-parties-1433177188>\n// WSJ // Gerald F. Seib \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nIs a third political party straining to break out in America?\n\n\n\nListen to the early sounds of the 2016 presidential campaign, in which\ncandidates of the left and the right sound almost identical populist,\nanti-Wall Street, antiestablishment themes, and the idea doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem so\ncrazy.\n\n\n\nWhen you have Republican presidential contenders opposing free-trade\nagreements, and at least one backing an increase in the minimum wage; when\nDemocratic firebrand Bernie Sanders (technically an independent to begin\nwith) is speaking to overflow crowds; and when left and right come together\nto halt a prominent national-security program backed by the foreign-policy\nestablishment\xe2\x80\x94well, something is going on.\n\n\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s stipulate up front that a serious third party isn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to emerge,\nat least not in this cycle. A viable third party requires money and an\noutsize personality (think Ross Perot), and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t clear those elements\nexist right now.\n\n\n\nStill, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to see the ideological foundations for one. Similar\npopulist refrains are coming from a diverse cast of political characters\nwith real followings: Mr. Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren on the left,\nand Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee and Sen. Rand Paul on the right. Listen to\nthe remarks of declared 2016 contenders and you can almost hear a potential\nthird-party platform emerging. Here would be its main elements:\n\n\n\nBig banks and Wall Street have too much power in Washington. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have come\nto take our country back from the special interests that use Washington as\ntheir personal piggy bank,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Paul said in opening his presidential\ncampaign. Said Mr. Sanders: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we talk about power, we talk about Wall\nStreet. In my view, it is time to break up the largest financial\ninstitutions in this country.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe economic system is stacked against the middle class, and government\npolicies are making that worse. In his announcement, Mr. Santorum referred\nto \xe2\x80\x9cworkers\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cworking families\xe2\x80\x9d a dozen times, and said they have\nsuffered because of the policies of \xe2\x80\x9cbig government and big business.\xe2\x80\x9d He\nhas broken with GOP orthodoxy by supporting a \xe2\x80\x9cmodest\xe2\x80\x9d minimum-wage\nincrease and continuation of the Export-Import Bank to bolster\nmanufacturing.\n\n\n\nFree-trade deals are bad for America and U.S. workers. Speaking from the\nright, Mr. Huckabee declared: \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t create good jobs for Americans by\nentering into unbalanced trade deals that forgo congressional scrutiny, and\nthen looking the other way as the law is ignored so that we can import\nlow-wage labor, undercut American workers, and drive wages lower than the\nDead Sea.\xe2\x80\x9d From the left, Mr. Sanders declared: \xe2\x80\x9cThe bottom line of these\ntrade agreements is to force American workers to compete against people in\ncountries around the world who make pennies on the hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBig money is corrupting politics. \xe2\x80\x9cWorking families don\xe2\x80\x99t need another\npresident tied to big government or big money,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Santorum said in\nannouncing his candidacy. Said Mr. Huckabeein announcing his: \xe2\x80\x9cI never have\nbeen and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be the favored candidate of those in the\nWashington-to-Wall Street corridor of power.\xe2\x80\x9d He added that his campaign\nwill be \xe2\x80\x9cfunded and fueled not by billionaires but by working people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe U.S. is overextended abroad. \xe2\x80\x9cI am vigorously opposed to an endless,\nperpetual war in the Middle East,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sanders. Said Mr. Paul: \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s\nquit building bridges in foreign countries and use that money to build some\nbridges here at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBig brother is dangerous. The effort to stop the National Security Agency\xe2\x80\x99s\ncollection of cellphone bulk data has, of course, become a signature issue\nof Mr. Paul, who has tied the Senate in knots over the issue and finds\nhimself aligned with many liberals as a result. But he isn\xe2\x80\x99t alone; Mr.\nHuckabee said on Fox News over the weekend that U.S. officials should get a\nwarrant before collecting phone data: \xe2\x80\x9cIf this is so effective, how come it\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t resulted in the foiled terrorist plots?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nObviously, there are many core issues on which the antiestablishment forces\nof left and right disagree, climate change and the virtues of Obamacare\nprominent among them. Still, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that Mr. Sanders packed a\nhall with 3,000 enthusiastic supporters over the weekend in Minneapolis,\nwith more waiting outside because there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t room for them. Meantime, Mr.\nSantorum\xe2\x80\x99s overtures to the working class help show that the Republican\nParty now includes a sizable blue-collar, Wal-Mart wing.\n\n\n\nAt a minimum, mainstream candidates in both parties will have to hew to\nsome populist themes emerging from the antiestablishment crowd. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are\nvotes in both primaries to be found for the candidates that say, \xe2\x80\x98We want\nto change the system and level the playing field,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d says Democratic\npollster Peter Hart, who helps conduct The Wall Street Journal/NBC News\npoll.\n\n\n\n*How to Kill the Background Briefing\n<http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/how-to-kill-the-background-briefing-20150601>\n// National Journal // Ron Fournier \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nI\'ve got a plan to bust the background briefing racket. Of the many ways\nthat modern journalists cede power to authority, none is easier to fix than\nthe notion that government officials are allowed to gather several\nreporters in a room or on a conference call, spew their clever lines of\nlies and spin, and declare it all "on background"\xe2\x80\x94shielded from\naccountability "on condition of anonymity."\n\n\n\nReporters are increasingly allowing public relations teams to set the terms\nfor coverage of politics, business, sports, and even entertainment. It\'s a\ntroubling trend for an industry in flux. But the media in Washington are\nthe most unnecessarily and dangerously cowed.\n\n\n\nWhen reporters call the shots, anonymous sources are vital to uncovering\ngovernment secrets and wrongdoing (Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein used\nMark Felt and other whistleblowers to chase Richard Nixon out of office).\nWhen government officials call the shots, there is no incentive to tell the\ntruth, no punishment for deception, and the journalism itself is diminished\nby canned news.\n\n\n\nIn rare cases, approved in advance by journalists, an anonymous source\ntalking to a bunch of reporters might serve a public service. For instance,\nsecurity details for a presidential trip to a war zone may need to be\nshared privately with the traveling media corps. Most editors would\nconsider that a good case for a briefing that shields the identity of the\ngovernment officials and embargoes news of the trip itself.\n\n\n\nBut in recent years, public relations officials have been allowed to assume\nthat they get to decide the terms for briefing reporters, and what was one\na unique courtesy is now a daily disservice to the public. Just last week,\nthe Obama administration sought to to build public support for extending\npost-911 domestic spying programs it lied about until Edward Snowden blew\nthe whistle.\n\n\n\nThe New York Times reported:\n\n\n\n"What you\'re doing, essentially, is you\'re playing national security\nRussian roulette," one senior administration official said of allowing the\npowers to lapse. That prospect appears increasingly likely with the\nmeasure, the USA Freedom Act, stalled and lawmakers in their home states\nand districts during a congressional recess.\n\n\n\n"We\'re in uncharted waters," another senior member of the administration\nsaid at a briefing organized by the White House, where three officials\nspoke with reporters about the consequences of inaction by Congress. "We\nhave not had to confront addressing the terrorist threat without these\nauthorities, and it\'s going to be fraught with unnecessary risk."\n\n\n\nNow ask yourself: If these scare tactics are legitimate, why wouldn\'t\nadministration officials allow their names to be public? (Josh Earnest had\nthe chance today, and wouldn\'t.) When they refused, why would the Times and\nseveral other news organizations publish the quotes?\n\n\n\nThe standard rule for using anonymous sources, published in Associated\nPress stylebooks used in almost every newsroom, is: "Whenever possible, we\npursue information on the record. When the source insists on background or\noff-the-record ground rules, we must adhere to a strict set of guidelines."\n\n\n\nFirst, the material is information "and not opinion or speculation, and is\nvital to the news report." Second, the information is not available on the\nrecord. Third, the source is reliable.\n\n\n\nThe White House briefing was a total rule-breaker: 1) The material was\nopinion and speculation; 2) There is no shortage of on-the-record hyperbole\nabout the National Security Agency program; 3) The Obama administration,\nlike the Bush White House, routinely deceives the public about NSA\'s\nactivities.\n\n\n\nThese are not credible sources.\n\n\n\nJust last week, reporters wrote and broadcast material from a background\nbriefing conducted by Hillary Clinton advisers who insisted they not be\nidentified. This from Politico:\n\n\n\nAt Clinton campaign headquarters, meanwhile, senior campaign officials told\nreporters Thursday at a background briefing that Hillary Clinton has not\nbeen damaged or distracted by the revelations about her family\'s foundation.\n\n\n\nAgain: If that paragraph is true (it\'s not), why wouldn\'t the Clinton\nadvisers put their names behind it? Why did the media report anonymous,\ninaccurate spin? Google the Bush White House. Watch how the GOP\npresidential campaigns deal with the media. The background briefing is a\nbipartisan racket. So why do journalists let their sources get away with it?\n\n\n\nFear: Reporters and editors don\'t want to get beat by competitors who bow\nto the terms of a public relations team. They don\'t stop to realize very\nlittle news comes from these briefings, and none of it is worth ceding\nprecious leverage to the government.\n\n\n\nHabit: It\'s a lazy way out. I know, because it\'s a route I\'ve taken. As a\nreporter and editor, I\'ve also taken part in countless (and useless)\nprotests against background briefings.\n\n\n\nVanity: There actually are some reporters who prefer anonymous sources over\nnamed ones, because they believe "on condition of anonymity" creates the\nperception that they\'re plugged into their beats. They\'re fooling\nthemselves and, worse, their audiences.\n\n\n\nAccess: Reporters are increasingly kept apart from the people they cover.\nThey don\'t recognize that the way to get access is by raising hell\xe2\x80\x94by\nmaking yourself such a source of surprise and disruption that the people\nyou cover realize they need to get to know you.\n\n\n\nJonathan Allen of Vox, one of the better reporters on the beat, explained\nwhy he accepted the Clinton ground rules last week. "These officials are\npeople who could easily avoid interacting with reporters for the entire\ncampaign if they chose," he wrote. "Given the option of talking to them or\nnot, major news organizations chose the former."\n\n\n\nI get it. I used to think that way. But I\'ve learned over the years that I\ndon\'t need to talk to campaign people. They need to talk to me. Freeze me\nout? Fine\xe2\x80\x94that\'s just more time to talk to rival campaigns, political\nscientists, and the best sources on any campaign: voters.\n\n\n\nEven the dimmest public relations officials eventually learn that they\ncan\'t put a good reporter on ice and, even if they could, they would be\nfreezing themselves out of the reporter\'s stories.\n\n\n\nSecond, why would I let the Clinton campaign\xe2\x80\x94or any entity I cover\xe2\x80\x94give me\n"the option" to choose? On this and so many other ways the media has ceded\npower, I say flip the script. Make them choose. Put them on the sorry end\nof a devil\'s choice.\n\n\n\nWhich gets me to my plan to bust the briefing racket.\n\n\n\nIf you\'re a reporter who gets sucked into a "background briefing," don\'t\nlet anonymous spin creep into your stories. Ignore it (National Journal\nattended the Clinton briefing but didn\'t write it up). Or call it out, as\nJohn Harwood did here: "How\'s Hillary Doing? Wish We Could Tell You"\n\n\n\nWish I could tell you more. But they said very little.\n\n\n\nNotice that I typed very little and not "very little," because under the\nground rules of Thursday\'s briefing reporters were not allowed to quote\ntheir words directly.\n\n\n\nYou\'re not missing much.\n\n\n\nFor all its understated brilliance, Harwood\'s column won\'t put a dent in\nthe background briefing racket. It was, after all, a retroactive hit\ndirected at just one PR team on behalf of just one reporter.\n\n\n\nThe media should be more proactive, like Adam Nagourney of The New York\nTimes, who tweeted today the details of Clinton\'s presidential announcement\nevent and directly attributed them to spokesman Jesse Ferguson. The aide\nhad emailed the information to reporters, presuming that he could deem the\nmaterial "on background."\n\n\n\nWrong.\n\n\n\nIf you\'re a reporter, go to your email now and write to the director of\ncommunications for whatever beat you cover \xe2\x80\x93 a campaign, an agency, a\nbusiness, a sports team, whatever.\n\n\n\n"Dear ___," your note starts.\n\n\n\n"I just wanted to remind you of a long tradition in journalism: Everything\na reporter sees and hears is on the record and attributable directly to the\nsource unless the reporter and source mutually agree in advance to other\nterms."\n\n\n\n"That means, of course, that every briefing I attend, in person or on\nconference call, will be on the record unless you get my permission in\nadvance. (Knowing my editor\'s commitment to transparency and\naccountability, I suspect permission will only be granted in extreme\ncases.)"\n\n\n\nCongratulations. You just forced the PR types to choose: Do we want a\nbriefing bad enough to play by this person\'s rules? The answer will almost\nalways be yes, and when it\'s not, you won\'t miss much. Hell, you\'re a good\nenough reporter to find out what\'s said at briefings you don\'t attend.\n\n\n\nYou might want to add to your note:\n\n\n\n"Same applies to every email you send me. Writing "OFF THE RECORD" at the\ntop doesn\'t make it so.\n\n\n\n"I\'m always open to using anonymous sources, but only when we\'re dealing\nwith important information (not spin) and when my editor and I determine\nit\'s in the best interest of our audience."\n\n\n\nIf you\'re an editor, consider giving your reporters cover (these are your\nrules, after all). Email the communications director at every beat your\nnewsroom covers, and tell them:\n\n\n\n"If the briefing material is important and true, there\'s no good reason to\nhide the source\'s identity. Unless you get prior permission from one of my\nreporters, all briefings are on the record. Same for your emails.\n\n\n\nRemind them who\'s in charge.\n\n\n\n* NYT The Upshot: G.O.P. Women in Congress: Why So Few?\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/upshot/gop-women-in-congress-why-so-few.html?rref=upshot&abt=0002&abg=0>\n// NYT // Derek Willis \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nThe rising number of women in Congress can obscure another trend: The\nnumber of Republican women has remained roughly stagnant for more than a\ndecade.\n\n\n\nAlthough women in both parties have increased their numbers in Congress\nduring the past 25 years, the share of Democratic women \xe2\x80\x94 now nearly 33\npercent \xe2\x80\x94 has continued to climb, while the Republican female share has\nleveled off since hitting 10 percent during the mid-2000s. And political\npolarization seems to be a major reason.\n\n\n\nModerate Republican women \xe2\x80\x94 think of Olympia Snowe, the former Maine\nsenator, or Connie Morella, the former Maryland congresswoman \xe2\x80\x94 were once\ncommon in the party, according to research by Danielle Thomsen, a political\nscientist at Duke. But moderate Republicans of both genders are nearly gone\nfrom Congress today. Some conservative women, like Senator Joni Ernst of\nIowa, have been elected, but there are relatively few of them in a\ntraditional pipeline to Congress: state legislatures. In other words, the\ngap is likely to persist for some time.\n\n\n\nAs one measure of the gap, 17 Republican women have served in the\n\nSenate in its history, and 14 Democratic women currently serve in the\n\nSenate.\n\n\n\nThe pattern is part of a larger gender disparity in American politics, of\ncourse. In 2012, 55 percent of women voted for President Obama, while 52\npercent of men voted for Mitt Romney, according to exit polls. The gap\nfigures to continue, if not widen, in 2016, with Democrats seeming likely\nto nominate a woman for president and Republicans likely to nominate a man.\n\n\n\nThere is plenty of research that the presence of women in legislative\nbodies makes a difference, particularly on the policies that many female\nlawmakers prioritize, such as health care and children\xe2\x80\x99s issues. Interviews\nwith women in Congress by the Center for American Women and Politics have\nfound that many see themselves as \xe2\x80\x9csurrogate representatives\xe2\x80\x9d for women in\ngeneral.\n\n\n\nA root cause of the gap is that Democratic women who are potential\ncongressional candidates tend to fit comfortably with the liberal ideology\nof their party\xe2\x80\x99s primary voters, while many potential female Republican\ncandidates do not adhere to the conservative ideology of their primary\nvoters.\n\n\n\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not just moderate Republican women who have been affected by the\npolarization of the parties. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you look at the moderate men, they\xe2\x80\x99re not\nthere, either,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and conservative Democrats in state legislatures\nalso aren\xe2\x80\x99t running for Congress.\n\n\n\nMs. Thomsen found that one in five Republican state legislators of either\nsex could be described as moderate, based on their voting history and\ndonors, but moderates were not nearly as eager as conservatives to run for\nCongress.\n\n\n\nIsn\'t the real reason there are less females in Congress the fact that less\nof them aspire to go into politics?\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cConservative Republican men and women state legislators are equally likely\nto run for Congress, but women are outnumbered five to one,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Thomsen\nsaid.\n\n\n\nSeparate research, by Shauna Shames, a political scientist at Rutgers\nUniversity, suggests that women with fiscally conservative and socially\nliberal views particularly struggle to find a party home. \xe2\x80\x9cA whole lot of\nwomen who could run are not running, because they know they will not be\nsupported and don\xe2\x80\x99t feel that they fit in the party anymore,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Shames\nsaid.\n\n\n\nThe Republican women who have run in congressional primaries over the past\n25 years have been as conservative as Republican men, according to a study\nproduced this year by Political Parity, a program that pushes for more\nwomen in Congress. (Ms. Thomsen and Ms. Shames both worked on the study).\nThere simply have not been very many highly conservative female candidates,\ncompared with men.\n\n\n\nOn the Democratic side, the situation is different. Female candidates for\nCongress were more liberal on average than their male counterparts, the\nstudy found, helping them do well in party primaries, which emphasize\nideological purity.\n\n\n\nMs. Thomsen\xe2\x80\x99s research does suggest that the number of conservative women\nin Congress will increase in coming years, because the number of\nconservative women in state legislatures has recently risen, albeit slowly.\nThe three most recently elected female Republican senators \xe2\x80\x94\n\nMs. Ernst, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Deb Fischer of\n\nNebraska \xe2\x80\x94 are all conservative and all served in their state legislatures.\n\n\n\nYet the share of congressional Democrats who are female may also continue\nrising, which could keep the current gap from shrinking.\n\n\n\n*A Bad Voting Ban in Maryland\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/01/opinion/a-bad-voting-ban-in-maryland.html?ref=politics>\n// NYT // The Editorial Board \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nWhat is the logic behind state laws that deny the vote to people who have\nbeen convicted of a felony, even after they are released from prison? The\nshort and easy answer is: there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any.\n\n\n\nFor a longer, nonsensical answer, ask Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, who on\nMay 22 thwarted strong majorities in both houses of the state legislature\nto veto a bill that would have restored voting rights to about 40,000\nMaryland residents currently on probation or parole.\n\n\n\nSome of these people never went to prison at all. Those who did are now in\nthe process of reintegrating themselves into their communities. Restoring\ntheir ability to have a say in choosing their elected representatives \xe2\x80\x94 the\nmost fundamental of all democratic rights \xe2\x80\x94 should be an obvious element of\nthat reintegration. But to Mr. Hogan, a Republican, people on probation or\nparole are \xe2\x80\x9cstill serving their time as a debt to society for their\nactions,\xe2\x80\x9d and so it is appropriate to continue to bar them from the ballot\nbox.\n\n\n\nThis is terrible reasoning. Voting bans \xe2\x80\x9cdefy the principles \xe2\x80\x94 of\naccountability and rehabilitation \xe2\x80\x94 that guide our criminal justice\npolicies,\xe2\x80\x9d as former Attorney General Eric Holder said last year in calling\nfor their repeal.\n\n\n\nThere has never been a whit of evidence that restoring voting rights has\nany negative impact on society, and yet disenfranchisement laws have a long\nand often racist pedigree in American history. States passed them in the\n19th century to block African-Americans from voting. Today about six\nmillion people nationwide are disenfranchised because of a criminal record,\nwith blacks disproportionately burdened. In Maryland, nearly two-thirds of\npeople who can\xe2\x80\x99t vote because of a felony conviction are African-American.\n\n\n\nThe governor\xe2\x80\x99s veto was all the more vexing given what has been happening\nin Baltimore, where residents \xe2\x80\x94 mostly poor people of color \xe2\x80\x94 have erupted\nin outbursts of anger and frustration because they feel they have little\nsay in the direction of their communities. Mr. Hogan could have supported\nthe law and reaffirmed that Maryland values the voices of all its citizens.\nInstead his veto means that 40,000 of them will have to wait until the\nLegislature reconvenes next January for a veto override vote.\n\n\n\nMr. Hogan\xe2\x80\x99s action is out of step not just with common sense, but with a\ngrowing segment of his own party. In recent years both red and blue states\n\xe2\x80\x94 from Texas to Connecticut to Alabama to New Mexico \xe2\x80\x94 have reduced or\neliminated barriers to voting for people coming out of prison. Maryland\nended its own lifetime ban on voting for those with felony convictions in\n2007.\n\n\n\nThis is a moment of great promise for new efforts to reform the nation\xe2\x80\x99s\ncriminal-justice system. Disenfranchising people who are already back in\ntheir communities is nothing but punitive and counterproductive, and\ndismantling such laws should be an easy call.\n\n\n\n*Congress Should Extend PATRIOT Act Provisions to Keep Us Safe\n<https://medium.com/@JebBush/congress-should-extend-patriot-act-provisions-to-keep-us-safe-e7c77224b3ef>\n//Medium // Jeb Bush \xe2\x80\x93 June 1, 2015*\n\n\n\nThe failure of President Obama and the U.S. Congress to preserve key\ncounterterrorism authorities before they expired is an abdication of their\nresponsibility to protect the United States.\n\n\n\nToday we have lost the metadata program, authorized by Section 215 of the\nUSA PATRIOT Act, an important tool in helping law enforcement and the\nIntelligence Community connect the dots between known foreign terrorists\nand potential operatives in the United States.\n\n\n\nCongress still has the opportunity to remedy this mistake and extend these\nimportant tools that have kept us safe. They should do so.\n\n\n\nIt is incredible that we would weaken our ability to protect the Homeland\nas ISIL, Al Shabbab, Al Qaeda, and other affiliated terrorist groups expand\ntheir reach.\n\nEven President Obama, who spoke often about protecting civil liberties,\nsupported these authorities as Senator and preserved the program when he\ncame into office. Backing down in the face of liberal interest group\npressure is just another failure of presidential leadership.\n\n\n\nIn 2013 new safeguards were put in place \xe2\x80\x94 including requiring the\ngovernment to seek an individual court order every time it queried the\ndatabase \xe2\x80\x94 but maintained the essential structure of a database of call\nrecords that can be searched in the event we have intelligence warnings of\nplots to the homeland.\n\n\n\nThat was the right call. Because in total, the PATRIOT Act has kept us\nsafe, plain and simple.\n\n\n\nDespite the fear-mongering of some, there is no evidence the bulk metadata\nprogram has ever been used to violate civil liberties.\n\n\n\nThe terrorist threat to the United States is growing. It is incredible that\nwe would weaken our ability to protect the homeland as ISIL, Al Shabbab, Al\nQaeda, and other affiliated terrorist groups expand their reach.\n'
