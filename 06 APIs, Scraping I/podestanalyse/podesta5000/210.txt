john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi John,\n\nImpressive statement by the President.\n\n And my congratulations on a terrific week for HRC. On Benghazi, HRC showed her toughness and Presidential gravitas; the R\'s looked mean and petty.\n\nKen\n\n\nSent from my iPad\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n\n> From: "White House Press Office" <noreply@messages.whitehouse.gov>\n> Date: October 23, 2015 at 4:48:05 PM MDT\n> To: kennethlsalazar@gmail.com\n> Subject: EMBARGOED: WEEKLY ADDRESS: Protecting our Planet for Future Generations\n> Reply-To: noreply@messages.whitehouse.gov\n> \n> THE WHITE HOUSE\n> Office of the Press Secretary\n> EMBARGOED UNTIL 6:00 AM ET, SATURDAY, October 24, 2015\n>  \n> WEEKLY ADDRESS: Protecting our Planet for Future Generations\n>  \n> WASHINGTON, DC \xe2\x80\x94 In this week\'s address, the President laid out the importance of serving as good stewards of the environment and maintaining the planet for generations to come.  Since taking office the President has prioritized protecting the places that make America special.  He has repeatedly said that no challenge poses a greater threat to our future than a changing climate, which is why he\xe2\x80\x99s taken bold actions at home and encouraged historic action abroad on the issue.  In his address, he encouraged Congress to reauthorize and fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund which has protected more than 5 million acres of land for more than half a century, without costing taxpayers a dime.  Republicans in Congress let the fund expire despite strong bipartisan support. And he reminded us that we all have to do our part to address climate change, promote clean energy and energy efficiency, and ensure a cleaner, more stable environment for future generations. \n>  \n> The audio of the address and video of the address will be available online at www.whitehouse.gov at 6:00 a.m. ET, October 24, 2015.\n>  \n> Remarks of President Barack Obama\n> Weekly Address\n> The White House\n> October 24, 2015\n>  \n> Hi, everybody.  Our country is home to some of the most beautiful God-given landscapes in the world.  We\xe2\x80\x99re blessed with natural treasures \xe2\x80\x93 from the Grand Tetons to the Grand Canyon; from lush forests and vast deserts to lakes and rivers teeming with wildlife.  And it\xe2\x80\x99s our responsibility to protect these treasures for future generations, just as previous generations protected them for us. \n>  \n> Since taking office, I\xe2\x80\x99ve set aside more than 260 million acres of public lands and waters \xe2\x80\x93 more than any President in history.  Last month, we announced that 11 states had come together with ranchers, and industry groups to protect a threatened species \xe2\x80\x93 the sage grouse \xe2\x80\x93 without jeopardizing local economies.  Two weeks ago, we announced that we\xe2\x80\x99re creating one new marine sanctuary on the Potomac River in Maryland, and another along Lake Michigan in Wisconsin \xe2\x80\x93 part of unprecedented efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes.  We also joined a coalition of countries cracking down on illegal fishing that threatens jobs and food security around the globe. And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep protecting the places that make America special, and the livelihoods of those who depend on them. \n>  \n> We\xe2\x80\x99ll also keep doing what we can to prevent the worst effects of climate change before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late.  Over the past six years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve led by example, generating more clean energy and lowering our carbon emissions.  Our businesses have stepped up in a big way, including just this past week.  Some of our biggest companies made new commitments to act on climate \xe2\x80\x93 not just because it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the planet, but because it\xe2\x80\x99s good for their bottom line. \n>  \n> This is how America is leading on the environment.  And because America is leading by example, 150 countries, representing over 85% of global emissions, have now laid out plans to reduce their levels of the harmful carbon pollution that warms our planet.  And it gives us great momentum going into Paris this December, where the world needs to come together and build on these individual commitments with an ambitious, long-term agreement to protect this Earth for our kids. \n>  \n> Now Congress has to do its job.  This month, even as Republicans in Congress barely managed to keep our government open, they shut down something called the Land and Water Conservation Fund.  For more than half a century, this fund has protected more than 5 million acres of land \xe2\x80\x93 from playgrounds to parks to priceless landscapes \xe2\x80\x93 all without costing taxpayers a dime.  Nearly every single county in America has benefited from this program.  It has bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate.  Republicans in Congress should reauthorize and fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund without delay.\n>  \n> After all, as Pope Francis reminds us so eloquently, this planet is a gift from God \xe2\x80\x93 and our common home.  We should leave it to our kids in better shape than we found it. \n>  \n> Thanks, and have a great weekend. \n>  \n> ###\n> -----\n> \n> Unsubscribe\n> \n> The White House \xc2\xb7 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \xc2\xb7 Washington DC 20500 \xc2\xb7 202-456-1111\n'
