We're gearing up for even more Tea Party shenanigans, but here is the thing. We're facing our final FEC deadline of 2014 in just two days.\n\nThat means that Speaker Boehner and his Tea Party allies will have a chance to see just how strong we are going into 2015. We can't hold them accountable alone though, John. We need your help before the clock strikes midnight on the 31st.\n\nCan you click here and contribute before it's too late?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/hmphelpsdems?refcode=em122914_1&amp;amount=25.00&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;zip=20016&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=&amp;phone=&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=\n\nThanks,\n\nStop the Tea Party\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContributions or gifts to House Majority PAC are not tax deductible\n\nPaid for by House Majority PAC. www.thehousemajoritypac.com.
