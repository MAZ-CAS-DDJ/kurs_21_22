This is Jason, Arthur and Harriet Shapiro\x92s son.  I hope that this email finds you, Susan, Jimmy and their families in good health.  I am writing this email to you on behalf of Martin O\x92Malley, the Governor of the State of Maryland.\n\nThe Governor must have a good memory, because shortly after our dinner in College Park, Maryland I mentioned to the Governor that we met and how impressed I am with all the fantastic work that your foundation facilitates.  As a lifetime asthmatic, I especially appreciate the interest that your foundation has in finding a cure for this condition.  I mentioned to the Governor how awe-inspiring it must be to be part of a foundation that can literally change the world.  It makes all of the community service projects that I work on pale in comparison to the change for good that your foundation can effectuate.\n\nI infer that the Governor must have a good memory as he has just contacted me to ask if you would have the opportunity to grab a cup of coffee with him on his next trip to California.  The Governor will be in the San Francisco area on March 7, 2014 and would love to meet with you.  Although I am probably not needed for this meeting, I can fly out to properly introduce you to the Governor.\n\nPlease let me know if you are open and available to this meeting.  Please also extend my best to Susan, and to Jimmy as well, although I\x92m not sure if he remembers me since the last time we met over 35 years ago.  I plan to visit Uncle Mannie in Florida in about two weeks and I will extend to him your good wishes.\n\nAll my best,\n\nJason\nJason A.
