john.podesta@gmail.comb'I am forwarding a response I just received from Marriott after I emailed them about the phishing scam their customer support agent confirmed for me in our telephone conversation on Tuesday (7/14/15).  This new email now says that the initial Marriott email was, in fact, legitimate. In order to avoid future problems, I would recommend that those of you who have Marriott accounts go to the Marriott.com website and make sure that your profile information is up to date. I apologize for the confusion my initial email has caused. I suppose there is a lesson in here about trying to do good deeds (although I am not quite sure what the lesson is).\n\nGerry Spann\n\nGirardeau A Spann\nJames and Catherine Denny Professor of Law\nGeorgetown University Law Center\n600 New Jersey Ave, NW\nWashington, DC 20001-2075\nPhone: 202-662-9103\nFax: 202-662-9495\nEmail: spann@law.georgetown.edu<mailto:spann@law.georgetown.edu>\n\n\nFrom: Internet Customer Care <Internet.Customer.Care@marriott.com<mailto:Internet.Customer.Care@marriott.com>>\nDate: Thursday, July 16, 2015 at 2:34 PM\nSubject: Marriott Rewards Security Update\n\nHello!\nI appreciate you taking the time to verify the email you have received regarding your Marriott Rewards account.
