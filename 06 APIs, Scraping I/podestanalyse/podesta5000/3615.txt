Based on this, for a reason I cannot elaborate on and will not write\nabout,  I believe with 95% confidence that at least one of the following is\ntrue: either Warren holds a strong antipathy towards Hillary Clinton or\nthere is a much greater chance she runs in the primaries than people\nbelieve. It would  be a very smart move for HRC to endorse the\nWarren-McCain partial Glass-Stegall bill for reasons I state in my column,\nunrelated to what Elizabeth does or does not think of her.  Though I doubt\nshe will while her consultants are telling everyone in town about her\ndominating fundraising, which is reminiscent of her campaign in 2007.\n\nThe two women, I suspect, one way or the other, are destined to clash,\nwhich would not be in the interest of either of them.\n\nSent from my iPad\n'
