GRAHAM\n\n 12:02 PM ET\n\nFor months, Hillary Clinton and her allies have complained that the House\nselect committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks is nothing but a\nRepublican political ploy, but she has failed to find an effective way to\ndefuse it.\n\nNow, it seems she\xe2\x80\x99s getting some help from unlikely allies: Republicans\nthemselves.\n\nOver the holiday weekend, it emerged that a staffer on the committee had\nbeen fired\xe2\x80\x94he says after raising objections to the increasingly political\nnature of the investigation. Bradley Podliska, an Air Force Reserve major,\nformer intelligence analyst, and self-described lifelong Republican, says\nhe complained the committee had become a political witch hunt and had lost\nsight of actually investigating the attacks in Libya, which killed four\nAmericans, including an ambassador.\n\n\nPodliska\xe2\x80\x99s accusations, and some of the details he offers, are damning, but\nthey take on extra weight in context. In late September, House Majority\nLeader Kevin McCarthy argued on Fox News the committee had effectively\nharmed Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s standing\xe2\x80\x94taken by many observers to be an implicit\nadmission that the panel\xe2\x80\x99s goal all along had been to cut the Democratic\nfrontrunner down to size. (McCarthy argued, only somewhat convincingly,\nthat he did not mean this.) His verbal missteps are seen as one factor in\nhis surprise decision to drop out of the race to be speaker last week.\n\nMany Republicans rushed to insist the Benghazi committee had the purest of\nmotives\xe2\x80\x94a difficult argument given its focus has drifted away from the\nattacks themselves and toward Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s email fracas, and because the\ninquiry has nowdragged on for 17 months. Other influential voices see no\npoint in playing that game. Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly said that \xe2\x80\x9cof course\xe2\x80\x9d the\ninvestigation is political: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you think those guys, those Republicans on\nthat panel, don\xe2\x80\x99t want to bring down Hillary Clinton, you\xe2\x80\x99re 6 years old,\nbecause they do, so it is political.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn a statement Saturday, Podliska said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy non-partisan investigative work\nconflicted with the interests of the Republican leadership, who focused\ntheir investigation primarily on Secretary Clinton and her aides.\xe2\x80\x9d He\npromised to file suit in federal court over his dismissal; the committee\nsaid he\xe2\x80\x99d been fired for cause. They said he\xe2\x80\x99d been sloppy in his\ninvestigations and, perhaps surprisingly, showed animus toward Clinton.\n\nAs with any firing, it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to tell whose motives, if any, are pure. But\nPodliska\xe2\x80\x99s accusations line up with a good deal of the public story. Many\nof the intelligence and defense figures Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina\nRepublican who chairs the panel, had announced an intention to interview\nstill haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to the committee, for example. Podliska claims the\ncommittee leapt to investigate Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s emails after the revelation that\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d used a private server and address while serving as secretary. He also\nalleged an environment that was unserious and delighted in partisan\nrecrimination, The New York Times reported:\n\n\n\n\n\n*With the slow progress, members have engaged in social activities like a\nwine club nicknamed \xe2\x80\x9cWine Wednesdays,\xe2\x80\x9d drinking from glasses imprinted with\nthe words \xe2\x80\x9cGlacial Pace,\xe2\x80\x9d a dig at Representative Elijah E. Cummings,\nDemocrat of Maryland and the committee\xe2\x80\x99s ranking member, Major Podliska\nsaid. Mr. Cummings used the term to question the speed of the committee\xe2\x80\x99s\nwork.At one point, several Republican staff members formed a gun-buying\nclub and discussed in the committee\xe2\x80\x99s conference room the 9-millimeter\nGlock handguns they intended to buy and what type of monograms they would\ninscribe on them, Major Podliska said.Gowdy told the Times he would have\npreferred for a separate committee to investigate the emails, but that\nSpeaker John Boehner declined the request.*\n\nThat points to the central dilemma of the committee. So far, the email\nscandal is the only particularly juicy revelation to emerge from its\ninvestigations. Promises the committee would reveal malice, negligence, or\nanything other than tragic but sincere mistakes at the State Department\nhave so far gone unfulfilled. Perhaps there\xe2\x80\x99s a barnburner of a revelation\nstill under wraps (though given the way things have unfolded so far, how\nlikely does it seem such a revelation could stay under wraps for long?).\nSince the email flap is so far all the committee has turned up, it can\xe2\x80\x99t\ngive up pursuing it. Yet in light of the comments from McCarthy, Podliska,\nand others, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for the committee to remain politically viable as\nlong as it\xe2\x80\x99s focusing only on emails and not producing any substance on the\nSeptember 11, 2012, attacks. (Meanwhile, the drip-drip of news on email\ncontinues, with an AP investigation finding hacking vulnerabilities in her\nsetup.)\n\nNow the Benghazi committee will face new political pressures to put up or\nshut up. But how much pressure? Democrats attempted a procedural maneuver\nto kill the committee immediately after McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, but the try\npredictably failed, given their numerical disadvantage in the House. At the\nmoment, it seems more likely the controversy will just erode the\ncommittee\xe2\x80\x99s credibility, and with that, its power as a political bludgeon\nagainst Clinton. It remains murky whether and to what extent she broke the\nletter of the rules, but it is clear that in many ways she violated its\nspirit. But Clinton has often fared best throughout her career when she is\nseen as being bullied. Then again, she has so far failed to find a good\nanswer to questions about her emails. In this spin war, no one seems\ncapable of pulling out a win.\n'
