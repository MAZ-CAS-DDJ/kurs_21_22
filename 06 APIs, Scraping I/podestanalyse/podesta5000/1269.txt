In a piece a couple of days ago, Ryan called Hillary "formidable - and beatable. [ http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/08/18/paul-ryan-on-defeating-hillary-clinton-in-2016/13825083/ ]" If the Republicans keep the House in November, Ryan will become the Chair of the Ways and Means Committee [ http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/07/06/paul-ryans-presidential-stock-is-rising/ ] and he will be able to raise enormous sums from special interests. \n\nIn short, he will have money, power, and a platform. *We can stop him. But we need your help.* \n\n*I am writing to ask you to contribute to our campaign [ https://www.agendaproject.org/give_c4/ ] to make sure that Paul Ryan never becomes President of the United States. You can contribute HERE [ https://www.agendaproject.org/give_c4/ ].* \n\nThree years ago in reaction to the enormous cuts he proposed to Medicare, we created a powerful and controversial ad [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGnE83A1Z4U ] that depicted Paul Ryan throwing Granny Off A Cliff. It became a media sensation. We brought Granny out again when Ryan was selected as Mitt Romney\'s running mate in 2012 and then again when he released his budget in 2013. Today we rolled out Granny again, populating book stores with a new and improved version of the Ryan book cover. Copies of the book with the fake cover have been sent to every major media outlet. \n\nTomorrow, we are arming protestors with posters of the GRANNY COVER [ http://s26.postimg.org/n59cqq7s9/PAUL_RYAN_COVER_resized_FINAL.jpg ]. We\'ve already contacted local activists who are ready and willing to go. Those protestors are going to show up at every stop on the Paul Ryan book tour. \n\nIn 2012 Granny became synonymous with Ryan\'s healthcare plan. Our goal with this work and other Ryan efforts is to create a permanent connection between Paul Ryan and Granny. If we do that successfully we will create enough doubt in the minds of seniors that it will be impossible for him to win a general election. Seniors are a major voting block and in 2012 they broke 56/44 for Mitt Romney. [ http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_12.html ] \n\nGuerrilla Granny has already been covered in the DAILY CALLER [ http://dailycaller.com/2014/08/19/liberal-activists-plot-to-sabotage-paul-ryans-book-with-fake-covers/ ], the WEEKLY STANDARD  [ http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/activist-encourages-defacement-cover-paul-ryans-book_803424.html ]and the WASHINGTON POST [ http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-paul-ryans-memoir-sings-to-the-choir/2014/08/19/8588af96-278a-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html ]. It\'s clear that Republicans understand the threat that Granny poses to Ryan. \n\nI\'ve enclosed the book tour schedule below. I am writing to see if you will contribute to our Granny campaign to make sure that we can stop Paul Ryan. You can contribute to the Agenda Project Action Fund HERE. [ https://www.agendaproject.org/give_c4/ ] \n\nThanks so much. Together we can do this. \n\nErica \n\n*BOOK TOUR SCHEDULE* \n\n\n\n\n\nON SALE: August 19, 2014 \n\n\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUGUST 20th \n\nWorld Affairs Council \n\nPhiladelphia, PA \n\nTalk & Signing \n\nIN CONVERSATION with MICHAEL SMERCONISH \n\n6:00 PM ET \n\nThe Union League of Philadelphia \n\n140 South Broad St. 19102 \n\nwww.wacphila.org \n\n\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, AUGUST 21st \n\nJohn K.
