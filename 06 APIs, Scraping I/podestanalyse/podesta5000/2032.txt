john.podesta@gmail.comb'Yeah I think it\'s a fine line.  One the one hand you want to show that\nsomething\'s at stake...on the other, you don\'t want people to get confused\nor think they\'ll be turned away.  I also think a presidential is so\ndifferent than a midterm (or Terry\'s race, for example, where we REALLY\navoided discussion of ID laws, etc)--Presidential people are going to set a\nmuch higher bar to stay away and in that case it\'s easier to raise fear.\n\n\nOn Mon, Mar 31, 2014 at 6:34 PM, David Plouffe <daplouffe@icloud.com> wrote:\n\n> That\'s true with the toughest to capture.
