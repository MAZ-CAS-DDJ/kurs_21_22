All high school seniors\ntake the SAT, and their average score in 2012 was higher than the college-readiness\nbenchmark set by the College Board. Students have closed ethnic and income achievement\ngaps four times as often as schools across the country with similar demographics,\nunderscoring the charter organization\'s commitment to create a college-going culture.\n\nWe recently sent a team of researchers to Uncommon Schools, a network of 38 public\ncharter schools in New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts that serves nearly 10,000\nlow-income, African-American and Latino students, to learn what practices led to\n these remarkable results.\n\nThey found the following strategies have been implemented across the network:\n\n\n1. A governance structure where each school is co-led by a director who oversees\n operations and a principal who focuses on teacher support;\n2. Frequent analysis of data, including quarterly assessments that help principals\nand teachers discover patterns in student learning so they can tailor instruction\nto reach every student;\n3. Consistent and frequent teacher training and support, including intensive coaching\non the techniques of effective teaching and one-on-one weekly sessions with an instructional\nleader;\n4. A longer school day and year; and\n5. A school culture that emphasizes joy, social justice and character.\n\nThis new white paper details these practices and the stories behind Uncommon\'s success.\nWe hope the findings are practical to the work you do to improve public schools \nin America.\n\nAs the 2013 winner of The Broad Prize for Public Charter Schools, Uncommon received\n$250,000 for college-readiness efforts. Uncommon is using its prize winnings to \noffer high school and college counseling and mentorship for high school seniors \nand alumni in New York and Massachusetts. The funds will also support the salary\n of a director of college completion, who is helping Uncommon students advance to\nand graduate from college.\n\nAs you know, we created The Broad Prize for Public Charter Schools to spotlight \nhigh-performing charter management organizations that, like their traditional public\nschool counterparts in Broad Prize districts, are making progress toward the goal\nof preparing all students, not just the privileged, for life after high school. \nWe hope you\'ll be inspired by the example of Uncommon Schools.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBruce Reed\n\nPresident\n\nThe Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLike us on Facebook [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0018FNdflBMrVq7m7E-dSv_XoJ7JUW3hYJUu6Q-USzXsMcwY4asbVOLjJj1pR3FMMfy-WEP-gwtJFSVls4PGEI1m8vg5-7I2Ykl9ppFwzNbE_ulILOUmDHXoUVP1N9RcIMZkwetp6bw0es=]\n   Follow us on Twitter [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0018FNdflBMrVqWAKLWyHRnpkrYdJVGpTcB6_nb7YZcBn5rEYTwrnCTd5OYh_G-QrJt5UyUH78xAJQaL2byhrk9TH9qQvCC-QjiN0cK55mRa1U_Bq4inGnE9ALMEE0GzZGKy41Ffe3Clgk=]\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nForward this email\nhttp://ui.constantcontact.com/sa/fwtf.jsp?llr=ittlagmab&m=1112598236776&ea=john.podesta@gmail.com&a=1116802860864\n\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com by press@broadfoundation.org.\n\nUpdate Profile/Email Address\nhttp://visitor.constantcontact.com/do?p=oo&mse=001_ZFr6KrqiGy_c8nzNAJadVxHWLrxCYCs&t=001YSuEPKLF7N8LBOKuzxeEtw%3D%3D&llr=ittlagmab\n\n\nInstant removal with SafeUnsubscribe(TM)\nhttp://visitor.constantcontact.com/do?p=un&mse=001_ZFr6KrqiGy_c8nzNAJadVxHWLrxCYCs&t=001YSuEPKLF7N8LBOKuzxeEtw%3D%3D&llr=ittlagmab\n\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttp://ui.constantcontact.com/roving/CCPrivacyPolicy.jsp\n\n\nOnline Marketing by\nConstant Contact(R)\nwww.constantcontact.com\n\n\nThe Broad Foundation | 10900 Wilshire Boulevard | 12th Floor | Los Angeles | CA | 90024'
