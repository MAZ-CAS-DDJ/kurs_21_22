john.podesta@gmail.comb'Erin, thanks for the quick response but this reaffirms my belief that I\nshould have had the Fellowship training.  First, it encompasses the three\ncomponents that comprise the Clinton Team Leader position; second, it would\nhave given me an official staff role in the campaign.\n\nSo, Ally, an eight-week intern can be an Organizer after the training, but\nme, absent it and in for the campaign\'s duration, can now only say that I\nhave a "role".  I cannot go back to those who I have contacted in this\nsituation.  I will lose their respect; my credibility and political future\nwill suffer as a result.\n\nI cannot go forward simply by telling the rest of my supporters I have a\n"role", guess what question they will ask next?  Besides this, some of\ntheir neighbors will recall how I previously answered that question (as you\nsaw in the email I showed you, several are Town officials).\n\nI became a Town official because the voters respect my sincerity, honesty,\nand integrity.  I believe you understand this and that I cannot disappoint\nthem.\n\nGeorge\n On Jun 25, 2015 9:48 PM, "Erin Turmelle" <eturmelle@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hi George!\n>\n> Allyn has just hit the ground as the fellow in your area.
