john.podesta@gmail.comb"Denis,\n\nJohn suggested emailing you - on the heels of your talk with WJC about PM Tsipras - to also let you know that we've been in close touch with Merkel's folks this week in advance of WJC's Bosnia visit and given Merkel's visit to Bosnia earlier this week - so it would be an innocuous and easy lift - if a nudge to Merkel is needed - to have WJC call Merkel on basis of checking in for guidance on Bosnia and then casually asking her about Greece on the back end. Just in case helpful. Although it's getting late now in Berlin. Sincerely, Ami\n\nMr. Amitabh Desai\nForeign Policy Adviser to President Clinton\nOffice: +1.212.348.0452\nCell: +1.917.488.1397\nEmail: ami@presidentclinton.com\n\nThis e-mail, and any attachments thereto, is intended only for use by the addressee(s) named herein and may contain legally privileged and/or confidential information.
