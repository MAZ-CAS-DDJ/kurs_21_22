After two years of campaigning it would seem that politicians, academics, and journalists would have a good understanding of the public sentiment.   Using very recent data from the only large-scale, representative, and comprehensive attitudes surveys in Scotland, however, this talk will highlight where the general &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; about Scots&rsquo; attitudes towards the referendum may be empirically wrong.   After showing where the polls stand and what we may expect as polling day approaches, this talk will focus in particular on how the attitudes of Scottish people towards international affairs have often been misrepresented, in particular in relation to the European Union, Scotland&rsquo;s role in   the world, and nuclear weapons in Scotland.   The talk will identify issues that may still move people, in either direction, before casting their vote.</p> <h2 style="margin-top: 0; padding-top: 0; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif; font-size: 18px;">Introduction</h2> <p><strong>Samuel Wells</strong><br /> Senior Scholar, Wilson Center</p> <h2 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif; font-size: 16px;">Speaker</h2> <p><strong>Jan Eichhorn</strong><br /> Chancellor\'s Fellow in Social Policy, University of Edinburgh</p> <h2 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif; font-size: 16px;">Moderator</h2> <p><strong>Samuel Wells</strong><br /> Senior Scholar, Wilson Center</p> \n\n\n\nRSVP NOW \xc2\xbb <http://pages.wilsoncenter.org/2014_09_03ScotlandontheEveoftheReferendum_GlobalEuropeEvent.html>\n\nForward to a Friend <http://go.wilsoncenter.org/v/DM6000o0UVy00L07D80q0Vb>\n<http://pages.wilsoncenter.org/2014_09_03ScotlandontheEveoftheReferendum_GlobalEuropeEvent.html>\nSeptember 3, 2014\n\n3:30 - 5:00pm\n\n6th Floor Boardroom\n\nDirections <http://www.wilsoncenter.org>\n\nWilson Center\n\nRonald Reagan Building and\n\nInternational Trade Center\n\nOne Woodrow Wilson Plaza\n\n1300 Pennsylvania, Ave., NW\n\nWashington, D.C. 20004\n\nPhone: 202.691.4000\n\nEuropean.Studies@wilsoncenter.org <mailto:European.Studies@wilsoncenter.org>\n\nPrivacy Policy <http://www.wilsoncenter.org>\n\n<div style="text-align: center">Subscriber: podesta@law.georgetown.edu.
