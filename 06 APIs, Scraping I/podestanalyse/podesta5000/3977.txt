Today, the Ironworkers Union and Laborer International Union (collectively representing another 820,000 members) voted to endorse HRC.  Very exciting!  Their press releases are scheduled to go out on Monday (Ironworkers) and Tuesday (LIUNA).  Again, great collaboration with our policy team on both of these.\n>>\n>> **I have submitted to Amanda two call sheets to thank O'Sullivan and Dean for their endorsement.  It would help me a lot to get those calls completed by Monday.  Just quick thank yous.  Those sheets are attached.\n>>\n>> 2.  We are building for a great crowd in Boston for our Hardhats for Hillary launch on November 29th.  We have four national building and construction trades Presidents confirmed to attend already.  We've hosted three build calls and should have hard counts on Monday.  T-shirts, signs, banners are being ordered.  I expect a great turn out of rank and file union members for this event.  We'll be signing folks up to help in NH.\n>>\n>> 3.  With LIUNA's endorsement, the National Building and Construction Trades President Sean McGarvey has the support to bring a national building and construction trades endorsement for HRC to a vote.  I would be on the look out for this immediately after Boston.  The final politics are being worked out now.  They have never endorsed a Presidential candidate as a body before.\n>>\n>> 4.  HRC met with AFGE Executive Board yesterday.  They were very friendly and positive.  I  am following up with them as they are next endorsement top target.\n>>\n>> If only all weeks could be this sweet:)\n>>\n>> Thanks all.\n>>\n>> --\n>> Nikki Budzinski\n>> Labor Outreach Director\n>> Hillary for America\n>> 646-854-1442 (direct)\n>> <Eric Dean 11.20.docx>\n>> <O'Sullivan call sheet 11.20.docx>\n"
