On\n   the economy, Obama has a 16-point margin over McCain, 48% to 32%.\n   - Middle tier: Iraq, healthcare, and terrorism. Obama and McCain are tied\n   as to who would be best able to handle Iraq; Obama wins by a substantial\n   25-point margin on healthcare; and McCain wins over Obama on terrorism by 19\n   points. (Terrorism is the only issue of the eight tested on which McCain has\n   a significant margin over Obama.)\n   - Bottom tier: taxes, moral values, and illegal immigration. On two of\n   these issues -- moral values and illegal immigration -- Obama and McCain are\n   tied. Obama has a smaller, nine-point lead over McCain on taxes.\n\nJune 24, 2008 Obama Has Edge on Key Election Issues Better positioned than\nMcCain on top two issues -- gas prices and economyby Frank Newport\n\nPRINCETON, NJ -- Americans see Barack Obama as better able than John McCain\nto handle energy issues and the economy, the two most important election\nissues in the public\'s eyes, according to a recent Gallup survey. Six other\nissues were tested in the poll, with the two candidates positioned roughly\nevenly on Iraq, moral values, and illegal immigration, while Obama has an\nedge on healthcare and taxes. McCain\'s only advantage is on terrorism.\n\nThe June 15-19 *USA Today*/Gallup poll asked Americans to rate the\nimportance of the presidential candidates\' positions on eight policy issues.\nThe poll then asked respondents questions designed to measure the degree to\nwhich they perceive Obama and McCain as comparatively able to handle each of\nthe eight issues.\n\nA majority of Americans believe that the candidates\' positions on all issues\ntested will be either "extremely" or "very important" to their vote, not a\nsurprising finding given that each issue included in the list was one that\nhas received attention and focus in the campaign this year. The proportion\nof Americans who rate each issue as "extremely" important, perhaps a better\ntest of each issue\'s impact this fall, ranges from 27% to 51%.\n\nTwo issues top the list, based on the percentage rating each as extremely\nimportant in choosing between candidates: energy/gas prices and the economy.\n(Energy has spiked in its importance to voters in recent months as gas\nprices have risen to the $4-per-gallon level.)\n\nObama has a clear advantage over McCain on both of these top two issues.\nAmericans give Obama a 19-point edge over McCain as best able to deal with\nenergy, with 47% choosing Obama and 28% McCain. On the economy, Obama has a\n16-point margin over McCain, 48% to 32%.\n\nThe next tier of issues -- Iraq, healthcare, and terrorism -- receive\n"extremely important" ratings from 41% to 44% of Americans. The positioning\nof the candidates on these three issues is mixed. Obama and McCain are tied\nas to who would be best able to handle Iraq; Obama wins by a substantial\n25-point margin on healthcare; and McCain wins over Obama on terrorism by 19\npoints. (Terrorism is the only issue of the eight tested on which McCain has\na significant margin over Obama.)\n\nThe bottom tier of issues is seen as extremely important by no more than a\nthird of Americans: taxes, moral values, and illegal immigration. On two of\nthese issues -- moral values and illegal immigration -- Obama and McCain are\ntied. Obama has a smaller, nine-point lead over McCain on taxes.\n\n*Summary*\n\nObama is leading McCain by six points among registered voters in the\nhead-to-head matchup included in the current *USA Today*/Gallup poll, and\nthere are significantly more Americans at the moment who identify themselves\nas Democrats than as Republicans. So it may not be surprising that Obama is\nrated as better able to handle more of the tested issues than is McCain.\n\nRegardless of the cause, the finding that Obama has significant strength on\ndomestic issues is potentially quite meaningful in this year\'s election,\ngiven that gas prices and the economy are the two issues the public is most\nlikely to see as important in choosing between presidential candidates. In\nfact, further analysis of the poll results shows that less than half of\nAmericans believe McCain would be able to do a good job of handling either\ngas prices or the economy, while 59% say Obama would be able to do a good\njob on both of these issues.\n\nIraq, on which the two candidates have sharply divergent positions, is not\ntoo far behind energy/gas prices and the economy in terms of imputed\nimportance. At the moment, Americans are equally likely to choose Obama as\npositioned to do the better job on Iraq as they are to choose McCain.\n\nThe poll points to one undisputed strength for McCain: terrorism. Slightly\nless than half of Americans say Obama would do a good job of handing\nterrorism, while 70% say that about McCain. But terrorism is slightly less\nimportant as a voting issue in Americans\' eyes than are economic issues, gas\nprices, and Iraq. Indeed, a separate question in the poll, to be examined in\ndetail later this week on gallup.com, shows that given a choice, Americans\nwould rather have a president whose greatest strength is fixing the economy\nrather than one whose greatest strength is fighting terrorism.\n\nThese data would suggest that from a campaign perspective, Obama would be\nadvised to play off his domestic strengths, particularly in terms of the\neconomy, to attempt to neutralize McCain\'s strength on terrorism, and to\nincrease his (Obama\'s) perceived strength on Iraq. McCain, on the other\nhand, has a clear base of strength on national security, but needs to move\ninto a more competitive position with Obama in terms of critical domestic\nissues relating to the economy and gas prices.\n\n\n-- \nRebecca Buckwalter-Poza\nProgressive Media USA\nrbuckwalterpoza@progressivemediausa.org\n202-609-7674 (o)\n919-423-4783 (m)\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
