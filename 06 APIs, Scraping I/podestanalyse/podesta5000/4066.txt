I am glad to report that we are witnessing a striking development in response to climate change: investors are increasingly tackling climate change-related risks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis movement is due to:\r\n\r\n-          A growing awareness of the economic risks presented by climate change (e.g. exposure to increased taxation and stranded assets),\r\n\r\n-          The emergence of innovative investment solutions aimed at reducing these risks,\r\n\r\n-          The establishment of knowledge transfer organizations to exchange best practices, such as the Portfolio Decarbonization Coalition (PDC).\r\n\r\no   The PDC is supported by the United Nations and by its Environment Program (UNEP),\r\n\r\no   PDC signatories have recently made a commitment to decarbonize $45 billion of their portfolios,\r\n\r\no   This initiative sends a strong message to the investor community: reducing climate change related risk is feasible and is being undertaken on a large scale.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe policy makers are very interested into these initiatives:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\xa2         The Chief Economist of People\xe2\x80\x99s Bank of China asked me to present our work at his own conference three weeks ago,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\xa2         France is accelerating this process by passing a law that makes the carbon footprint mandatory for all asset owners,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\xa2         President Francois Hollande referred to our project in his recent speech (after Ban Ki-moon and Dr Kim).\r\n\r\nI am attaching a couple of documents for your review.  Please be advised, I will be in Washington this Friday (July 24) and will be glad to catch-up with you if it works well with your schedule. Alternatively, I should return back to the US mid-August.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nFred\r\nPs I am attaching a 2 page note, a ppt presentation and an academic paper.\r\n\r\n"
