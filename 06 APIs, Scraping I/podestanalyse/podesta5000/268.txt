If there is no EU/Greece\ndeal, it\'s important that there be a Plan B to stabilize Greece --e.g.\nhumanitarian assistance, efforts to provide some level of stability for a\nnew drachma, etc.\n\n\xe2\x80\x8b\n\nWe may be putting together a group of key Greek American (as well\nas non-Greek American economic and national security leaders) to advocate\nfor/support any Administration efforts if a Plan B becomes necessary. I\nwould like to get some feedback on this front -- I may call tomorrow or\nThursday. Hopefully, a credible deal comes together -- but just in case.\n\n\n Last item: it would be great if Secretary Clinton could weigh in in the\nappropriate manner - perhaps a statement in support of the Administration\'s\nefforts to help achieve a positive resolution and emphasizing the economic,\nhumanitarian, and geopolitical importance of a good resolution. But I\'ll\nleave it to you as to whether or not this make sense from your/the\nSecretary\'s perspective.\n\n\n Best,\n\n\n Phil\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhil Angelides\n\n3001 I Street, Suite 200\n\nSacramento, CA 95816\n\n916-448-1998\n  ------------------------------\n*From:* Phil Angelides (RCI)\n*Sent:* Monday, July 6, 2015 5:07 PM\n*To:* john.podesta@gmail.com\n*Cc:* eryn.sepp@gmail.com\n*Subject:* Greece\n\n\nJohn -\n\n\n I hope all is well with you. I tried to call you today, but apparently the\nnumber I had for you is inoperative.\n\n\n I wanted to speak with you briefly re: Greece - given the restrictions on\nthe ELA lending to the Greek banks, the financial (and thus\ncivil/political) system may dissolve quickly.\n\n\n I know that you are very busy, but if you have a moment, I can be reached\nat 916-919-1177.\n\n\n Eryn -\n\n\n For future reference, what is the best number to reach John or to leave a\nmessage? - if via you/your number, that\'s more than fine.\n\n\n Thanks.\n\n\n Phil\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhil Angelides\n\n3001 I Street, Suite 200\n\nSacramento, CA 95816\n\n916-448-1998\n'
