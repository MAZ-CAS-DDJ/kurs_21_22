She said this could be c3 or c4 political advocacy depending on what\r\nthe group is that's doing it.  if its engaging in would more likely be c4 pol advocacy.  but if they only engage in c3 type stuff -- it could qualify for that too. Should of course have grp's lawyer decide - between u and I, given import of relationship w/ MH I would not do it through page. I don't know steve but they seem like a good route esp given stepped up AA outreach in FL.  Quick convo in am about how to hand off to him?\r\nSent via BlackBerry from T-Mobile\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: john.podesta@gmail.com\r\n\r\nDate: Thu, 9 Oct 2008 23:01:07 \r\nTo: <laurasnichols@yahoo.com>\r\nSubject: Re: Mellody hobson\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably steve phillips power pac or wvwv.

GL is committed to putting a $1m down on ad buy for reagaon spot but wants to do it in FL.  I think I can talk them into a smallish DC buy.  Now we need to determine grp to put their name on it (will robinson will put together a buy rec)...what would u recommend?

I felt them out about it a few days\r\nback, and they are very open to it.\r\nMy c4, American Family Voices, is another possibility. \r\nThere might be some others we could explore the idea with, although as\r\nyou know way too many progressive groups tend to be single issue focused\r\nand less interested in running generic spots like this. But PFAW and CAF\r\nare both multi-issue and might be possibilites, although there are some\r\nbranding and political issues with both that would need discussion.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMike Lux\r\nPresident\r\nProgressive Strategies, L.L.C.\r\nP.O.
