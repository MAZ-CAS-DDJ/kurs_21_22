Will it be Jeb Bush who consolidates\nestablishment support? Can Rand Paul or Ted Cruz break through with a\npowerful grassroots coalition? Could Scott Walker thread the needle between\nboth sides? What about Marco Rubio?\n\n\n\nAnd then there\xe2\x80\x99s the Democratic side. Will it be Hillary Clinton who\nprevails? Or will\xe2\x80\x93actually, you know what, it will probably just be Hillary\nClinton.\n\n\n\nWhile the former secretary of state hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even said whether she\xe2\x80\x99ll seek\nthe party\xe2\x80\x99s nomination, her overwhelming dominance in polls, organization\nand endorsements raises the question of whether the Democratic vacuum might\ndrag the Republican primary into its orbit \xe2\x80\x93 and even carry over into the\ngeneral election.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a scenario that has veteran operatives from both parties talking in\nearly primary and caucus states, where a Clinton coronation could prompt\nsome less partisan voters to skip the Democratic contest and participate in\nthe more competitive Republican race.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Hillary Clinton is viewed as having the Democratic caucus in the bag,\nRepublicans will be vying for independents and other persuadable voters,\xe2\x80\x9d\nJeff Patch, a Republican strategist in Iowa and former state GOP spokesman,\ntold msnbc.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s pretty typical if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a heavily contested election that\nindependents would be more interested in voting in a contested election,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Kathy Sullivan, the former chair of the New Hampshire Democratic Party.\n\n\n\nPoliticos for the most part see true blue Democrats leaping to the\nRepublican side as an unlikely scenario, but the large, varied and poorly\nunderstood group of undeclared and independent voters are another story. In\nthe right circumstances, a surge in participation could swing the race to\nthe candidate who courts them hardest.\n\n\n\nIndependents Day\n\n\n\nThe imbalance between the two parties would hardly be a first. After all,\nit was just four years ago that a crowded Republican field hogged the\nspotlight while President Obama went uncontested for re-election.\n\n\n\nRepublicans were hoping for a surge of interest and turnout in early states\nversus 2008, when the prolonged Democratic primary ended up boosting that\nparty\xe2\x80\x99s registration in key states and strengthening Obama, the eventual\nnominee. The GOP surge didn\xe2\x80\x99t materialize in most cases, but with one key\nexception: Turnout did go up in states where independents could vote or\neasily switch their party registration on the day of the race, suggesting\nthe lack of Democratic competition may have brought some crossover votes\nwith it.\n\n\n\nThese include the critical contests of Iowa, where voters can change party\nregistration at the caucus site on the day of the election; New Hampshire,\nwhere undeclared voters can vote in either party\xe2\x80\x99s primary; and South\nCarolina, which has a fully open primary. In that state, 25% of GOP primary\nvoters described themselves as independents in 2012 exit polls, up from 18%\nin 2008. In New Hampshire, the number jumped from 34% in 2008 to 47% in\n2012.\n\n\n\nPolitical analysts sometimes sneer at the notion of true \xe2\x80\x9cindependents,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaying many behave like partisans or are on the fringes of electoral\npolitics and hard to reach. In 2012, a significant chunk of tea party\nconservatives traded in their \xe2\x80\x9cR\xe2\x80\x9d for an \xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d which lulled Mitt Romney\nsupporters into the false belief that their candidate\xe2\x80\x99s lead with\nindependents showed he was winning swing voters.\n\n\n\nBut that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean voters outside the traditional party bases aren\xe2\x80\x99t\nrelevant, especially in a low turnout caucus or primary where even a small\nnumber of surprise votes can swing the outcome. In Iowa, a record 122,000\npeople showed up to vote in the 2012 Republican caucuses \xe2\x80\x93 but they were\nonly about 19% of registered GOP voters.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy,\xe2\x80\x9d Ann Selzer, the pollster behind\nthe famed Des Moines Register survey, said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf candidates go in thinking\nthe only way to win the caucuses is to turn out Christian conservatives,\nthan that\xe2\x80\x99s how they campaign and that\xe2\x80\x99s who shows up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what happened in Iowa in 2008 and 2012, when Mike Huckabee and Rick\nSantorum four years later rode social conservative support to victory. On\nthe Democratic side, however, Obama toppled Clinton in 2008 in Iowa thanks\nto an intense organizing effort that enlisted thousands of new\ncaucus-goers, including independents. The then-Illinois senator won that\ngroup in the caucuses by an 18 point margin over second-place finisher John\nEdwards. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible that in 2016, the right candidate could accomplish\nsomething similar on the GOP side.\n\n\n\nOne Republican candidate in particular is building their campaign hopes\naround this idea: Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. \xe2\x80\x9cI think Rand Paul has an early\nedge in trying to expand the Republican electorate,\xe2\x80\x9d Patch, the former Iowa\nGOP spokesman, said.\n\n\n\nThe Kentucky senator\xe2\x80\x99s father, former Congressman Ron Paul, finished a\nstrong third in Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 caucuses while winning 43% of independents, and\na distant second in libertarian-heavy New Hampshire while also leading the\nfield with independents at 31%. The younger Paul has spent the last four\nyears pitching the GOP on attracting younger voters and minorities, even if\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re in the other party\xe2\x80\x99s camp, by promoting causes like sentencing\nreform and protection from federal surveillance.\n\n\n\nDoug Stafford, a senior Paul adviser, told msnbc Paul is \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly well\npositioned to reach out to Independents and Democrats, whether that is in a\nprimary or a general election,\xe2\x80\x9d in addition to Republicans.\n\n\n\nPaul \xe2\x80\x9cseems to cross party lines, particularly with younger voters,\xe2\x80\x9d\nStephen Duprey, the former chairman of the New Hampshire GOP, told msnbc.\n\n\n\nBut while Paul has been most explicit about appealing outside the\nRepublican box, he\xe2\x80\x99s not the only candidate who could benefit from an\ninflated independent vote if they play their cards right. Duprey noted that\ncentrist Republicans have performed well in New Hampshire by targeting\nindependents, who made up close to half of GOP primary voters in 2012.\n\n\n\nThe most famous example is John McCain, who romped to an upset victory in\nthe Granite State over George W. Bush in 2000 thanks in part to a\nstaggering 41-point lead with independents. They played a big role in\nMcCain\xe2\x80\x99s crucial 2008 South Carolina primary win as well in which he\nnarrowly defeated Mike Huckabee in part by winning independents by a\n17-point margin. Perhaps someone like Jeb Bush could make a similar play to\noffset conservatives upset with his position on Common Core education\nstandards and immigration reform.\n\n\n\nDemocratic Danger\n\n\n\nWhether or not an individual Republican candidate can ride independent\nsupport to victory, party officials are hoping a more competitive race will\ngive them an extended opportunity to make their pitch to persuadable voters\nthat carries over into the general election.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think theres a danger on the part of the Democrats in settling too early\nand I think, quite frankly, that helps us,\xe2\x80\x9d Iowa GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann\ntold msnbc. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have an electorate that\xe2\x80\x99s still searching, and some of the\nenergy might carry over into the independents.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDemocrats are aware that contested primaries in swing states like Iowa and\nNew Hampshire may give the GOP a head start when it comes to organizing\nvoters. Primary campaigns invest months and millions of dollars on\nidentifying, persuading, and mobilizing voters on behalf of their\nindividual candidates, and all that work can end end up benefiting the\nparty\xe2\x80\x99s nominee as well.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFolks who turn out to vote in primaries are much, much more likely to turn\nout to vote in the fall,\xe2\x80\x9d Josh Putnam, a professor of government at\nAppalachian State University who runs election site Frontloading HQ, told\nmsnbc.\n\n\n\nTo confront this issue, Obama\xe2\x80\x99s reelection campaign began preparing for the\n2012 general election in 2011, using the remnants of his 2008 campaign and\nthe Democratic National Committee to pummel Republican frontrunner Mitt\nRomney in early primary states and organize Democrats. When the primaries\ndid roll around, his campaign used them as a dry run to test\nget-out-the-vote efforts ahead of the general election.\n\n\n\nClinton will still need to compete in those primaries, but she can take a\npage from Obama in organizing early even if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t face a serious\nchallenger. It may be a tough task to keep voters\xe2\x80\x99 interest in her\ncampaign, even though many will view her candidacy as a forgone conclusion,\nbut Democrats say she can stay relevant by varying her message as time goes\non, layering one rationale for a run on top of another.\n\n\n\nMitch Stewart, one of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s top organizers from both the 2008 and 2012\ncampaigns, and current advisor to the pro-Clinton super PAC Ready for\nHillary, acknowledged the challenge, but said he\xe2\x80\x99s not too concerned about\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the Republican primary is more interesting, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re doomed in the general election,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nHe recalled an example from his work during the 2004 election cycle for\nEdwards in Iowa. President George W. Bush was running for reelection and\nhad no primary, so Republicans spent far less time organizing in the\nstate.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn 2003, when I was in Iowa working on the caucus, there were five\nor six [Democratic] campaigns actively working the states for the year, and\nI remember leaving the state and thinking, there\xe2\x80\x99s no way a Democrat will\nlose in Iowa in 2004,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nBush ended up narrowly defeating John Kerry in Iowa en route to his\nre-election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Associated Press: Potential 2016 Presidential Candidates Face A Big\nLearning Curve\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/16/2016-presidential-candidates_n_6691892.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Nancy Benac\n\nFebruary 16, 2015 9:43 a.m. EST\n\n\n\nIf you\'re an aspiring presidential candidate, says professional crisis\nmanager Eric Dezenhall, right now is "a great time to take a pratfall\nbecause it\'s so far away from anything major."\n\n\n\nThat\'s a good thing because so many of the candidates\' feet have been\nsliding out from under them.\n\n\n\nThe first six weeks of 2015 have featured mangled messages, snappishness, a\nbad hire and other flubs from the Republicans who would be president.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\'s pretty much to be expected in the earliest stages of a campaign with\njust short of a gazillion potential candidates who haven\'t done this before.\n\n\n\nIn recent days:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x94Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush cut loose a new hire with a history of\ninappropriate comments about women, gays and blacks.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x94New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul struggled to\nstrike the right tone on whether parents should have to vaccinate their\nchildren.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x94Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker caught flak for ducking questions and picking\na fight with the revered University of Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nCandidates-in-waiting got peevish. They gave underwhelming speeches. They\ntried to disavow their own words. And so on.\n\n\n\nDo these responses sound like guys who are ready to be president?\n\n\n\nDo you believe in evolution, Gov. Walker? "I\'m going to punt on that one."\n\n\n\nWhat about the Islamic State group, Gov. Christie? "Is there something you\ndon\'t understand about, \'No questions?\'"\n\n\n\nIt\'s part of the long and brutal learning curve for a presidential race,\nwhere even seasoned politicians find the scrutiny more intense than for\nlesser offices.\n\n\n\nDezenhall calls this the season of "gaffe congestion" for would-be\ncandidates and says 20 months out from Election Day 2016 is a good time to\nget them over with.\n\n\n\nIn an earlier time, even eight years ago or 12, none of this recent drama\nwould have been much more than a paragraph in the saga that is a\npresidential race.\n\n\n\n"Now, thanks to Twitter and the immediacy of political commentary, mistakes\nare much more painful," says Ari Fleischer, a communications consultant who\nwas President George W. Bush\'s press secretary.\n\n\n\nStill, he says, the best candidates will learn from their early stumbles\nand quickly regain their stride.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush\'s team probably will check out future job applicants more\ncarefully. A less bombastic Christie was back working in Iowa not long\nafter snapping at reporters in London. Walker turned to Twitter to at least\nexplain, somewhat, his thinking on evolution after his refusal to answer a\nquestion on the subject during his own trip to London became a distraction.\n\n\n\n"Much of what\'s happening right now won\'t be remembered a year from now or\nin a general election," says Stephanie Cutter, a veteran of Democratic\npresidential campaigns for Barack Obama and John Kerry. She said part of\nthe problem may be that potential candidates don\'t yet have a full\ncomplement of campaign staff.\n\n\n\nBut she also said that some of the recent commotion, such as the vaccine\nflap, could signal a dynamic that will carry forward in the race as GOP\ncandidates try to cater to primary voters without tacking so far to the\nright that it causes them trouble in the general election.\n\n\n\nIt\'s also clear that even if regular voters aren\'t tuned in yet, the\npotential candidates are being sized up by donors, activists and potential\nstaff who will be crucial to helping them run an effective campaign.\n\n\n\nMo Elleithee, communications director for the Democratic National\nCommittee, predicts that some of the recent GOP missteps could turn out to\nbe particularly telling for voters in the long run.\n\n\n\nChristie and Paul, with their bluster and argumentative interaction with\nthe press, are "letting people see who they really are," he said.\n\n\n\nFor now, Democrats can largely sit back and enjoy the GOP clatter because\nexpected candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton has the experience of the 2008\nDemocratic primaries on her resume and is expected to face little primary\nopposition this time.\n\n\n\nBut Fleischer said even Clinton will have an adjustment to make if she\njumps back into the presidential mosh pit after eight years of "the paid\nspeaker\'s life, which is scrutiny-free, and the charmed life of a secretary\nof state, where you\'re not covered in the same way you are in political\ncampaigns."\n\n\n\nDezenhall said one skill that candidates on both sides will need to learn\nearly on is damage control \xe2\x80\x94 both how to respond and what safely can be\nignored \xe2\x80\x94 because errors are inevitable.\n\n\n\n"Politics used to be about where you stood," he said. "Now, it\'s about what\nyou stepped in."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*CNN: \'President\' Hillary Clinton: Good for stocks?\n<http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/16/investing/hillary-clinton-2016-stock-market/>*\n\n\n\nBy Patrick Gillespie\n\nFebruary 16, 2015 10:35 a.m. EST\n\n\n\nPresident Bill Clinton brought Wall Street arguably its best bull market\never. There\'s historical precedent to believe Hillary -- or any Democrat in\nthe White House -- could deliver even more good times to investors.\n\n\n\nOverall, stocks perform better under Democratic presidents than Republican\nones, according to S&P Capital IQ.\n\n\n\nIn the last 100 years, the S&P 500 (SPX) had about a 12% median annual gain\nduring the tenures of Democratic presidents. Republican presidents only saw\na median rise of just over 5% a year.\n\n\n\nOf course, any analysis comes with the large disclaimer that the past is no\npredictor of future returns. But investors have started to take notice.\n\n\n\n\'90s throwback? President Clinton is in a league of his own when it comes\nto stock market performance. The S&P 500 rose by a total of 210% during his\ntwo terms, well ahead of any recent president. To put that in context, the\nindex has grown 160% since Obama took office.\n\n\n\nThere\'s hope that Hillary would bring more of the same.\n\n\n\n"She would be very well received," by Wall Street, says Greg Valliere,\nchief political strategist at Potomac Research Group. "There\'s a certain\ncomfort level there because of Bill."\n\n\n\nGridlock city: Hillary -- or any Democrat in the executive branch -- would\nlikely continue the gridlock between the White House and a Republican-led\nCongress. Considering the opposition Bill faced from a GOP Congress, that\nmay not be a bad scenario for markets.\n\n\n\nWhen Congress is split, the S&P 500 gains 10% a year with Democratic\npresidents and 3% a year with Republicans presidents, according to data\nfrom Standard & Poor Equity Research.\n\n\n\nFor better or worse, gridlock means no significant reforms to Wall Street.\nInvestors like that, says Valliere.\n\n\n\n"The markets, in general, can live with gridlock," Valliere says. "They\npass less activist legislation."\n\n\n\nBush, Clinton compete on the Street: As the election nears, all the\ncandidates\' policies will be in the spotlight.\n\n\n\nThe most formidable candidate competing for Wall Street\'s hearts, minds and\ncheckbooks so far is former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. No stranger to Wall\nStreet, Bush recently quit a stint as an adviser to investment bank\nBarclays.\n\n\n\nInvestors\' views of any candidates could hinge on one big issue for\ncorporate America: cybersecurity, says Kristina Hooper, U.S. investment\nstrategist at Allianz Global Investors.\n\n\n\nAlmost 90% of CEOs say cybersecurity is their top priority this year,\naccording to a recent survey by investment bank Piper Jaffray. TurboTax and\nAnthem can speak from experience.\n\n"It is a huge issue now among corporate leaders," Hooper says.\nCybersecurity "is completely under the radar now for investors in terms of\nthe election [and that] could really come to the fore in the next 18\nmonths."\n\n\n\nHow much does a president do? Of course, some point out that a president\'s\npolicies don\'t really drive the markets much. These days, every investor is\nhanging on the words and actions of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, and\nwhen the Fed decides to raise interest rates.\n\n\n\nLove it or hate it, the Fed\'s stimulus program undoubtedly played a major\nrole in the U.S. economy over the past six years.\n\n\n\n"Sometimes we ascribe more influence by administrations to the performance\nof the economy and the financial markets than they really deserve," says Ed\nYardeni, president of Yardeni Research, an investment strategy firm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*NBC News: 2016 Off To Slower Start Than Previous Cycles. Really.\n<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/2016-slower-start-previous-cycles-really-n305741>*\n\n\n\nBy Shaquille  Brewster\n\nFebruary 16, 2015\n\n\n\nIt\'s President\'s Day, less than a year away from the first votes being cast\nin the 2016 presidential race and just one major candidate has announced\nhis intention to formally launch a campaign through an exploratory\ncommittee. At this point eight years ago (the last time there was a pending\nvacancy in the Oval Office), most candidates had either already announced\nor were days away from making their grand entrances into the presidential\ncontest.\n\n\n\nJust look at what the political landscape looked like by President\'s Day\nweekend in 2007.\n\n\n\nFor Democrats:\n\n\n\nMike Gravel announced in April 2006\n\nTom Vilsack (currently U.S. Agriculture Secretary) launched his candidacy\nin Nov. 2006\n\nDennis Kucinich announced in Dec. 2006\n\nJohn Edwards announced in Dec. 2006\n\nChris Dodd announced on Jan. 11, 2007\n\nHillary Clinton announced on Jan. 20\n\nBill Richardson announced on Jan. 21\n\nJoe Biden announced on Jan. 31\n\nBarack Obama announced on Feb. 10\n\nTom Vilsack was preparing to withdraw the next week to endorse Hillary\nClinton.\n\n\n\nFor Republicans:\n\n\n\nDuncan Hunter announced on Oct. 30\n\nSam Brownback announced on Jan. 20\n\nMike Huckabee announced on Meet the Press Jan. 28\n\nMitt Romney announced on Feb. 13\n\nRudy Giuliani confirms his candidacy on Feb. 14\n\nJohn McCain was preparing to announce on David Letterman on Feb. 28\n\nIn fact, many of the candidates listed above officially launched\nexploratory committees well before their formal and ceremonial\nannouncements.\n\n\n\nThis year, Former Virginia Senator Jim Webb is the only major candidate to\nsay he is launching an exploratory committee (technically there are 165\nfederally registered 2016 candidates race).\n\n\n\n"Whether people are formally declared\xe2\x80\x94or not\xe2\x80\x94isn\'t the whole story here,\nthey\'re running anyway"\n\n\n\nDespite the formal announcements, staffs are growing, donors are being\nlocked down, and book tours and trips to Iowa and New Hampshire are\nincreasing. A glance at the speakers at the Republican cattle calls last\nmonth\xe2\x80\x94or the one coming up in March\xe2\x80\x94 will show a list of "likely"\ncandidates giving policy speeches and openly working to build support.\n\n\n\nInstead of creating the exploratory committees, these "likely" candidates\nhave launched their own fundraising groups that allow them spend money for\npolitical activities. Out of the major candidates, 15 potential republicans\nand two democratic candidates have announced forming these Leadership PACs\nor 527s.\n\n\n\nUniversity of Maryland Government and Politics Professor David Karol\nstudies elections and agrees this election cycle is developing slower than\nprevious years, but warns that\'s not the entire picture.\n\n\n\n"Whether people are formally declared\xe2\x80\x94or not\xe2\x80\x94isn\'t the whole story here,\nthey\'re running anyway," Karol explained to NBC News.\n\n\n\n"I think if Jeb [Bush] is going around making speeches on key issues,\ngetting reported on by you guys, talking to Republicans in key states,\nthen" Karol continued, "he\'s out there and people know he\'s out there."\n'
