If she has no value for TP, you might give her\nsome pointers to other possibilities. Thx.\nJohn\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: *Jessica Montoya Coggins* <jessica.m.coggins@gmail.com>\nDate: Monday, August 31, 2015\nSubject: Las Vegas Hillary Briefing -- from Jessica Montoya Coggins\nTo: John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>\n\n\nJohn,\n\nIt was such a pleasure to see you last week at the Hillary for America\nbriefing you gave in Las Vegas. It was a coincidence to be there but I was\nhappy to attend. Also, congratulations on such a successful clean energy\nsummit. I know how much work it has taken!\n\nAs my mother Regina Montoya mentioned to you I am a writer and journalist\nliving in New York City. My passion has been focusing in on policy issues,\nincluding education, income disparity and immigration (which obviously has\ncome to the forefront in today's political climate).\n\nI would be so appreciative if you could provide an introduction to Think\nProgress. I've previously written for NBC News, Salon, Jezebel and a few\nother publications. I've attached a few of my stories below and also a\nresume. I am very grateful for any assistance or advice that you could\nprovide.\n\nI look forward to seeing you again soon. My mother is frequently visiting\nme in New York and always enjoys visiting the Brooklyn Hillary\nheadquarters!\n\nSincerely,\nJessica Montoya Coggins\n\nChicago Program Uses Home Visits to Boost Latino Early Education:\nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/chicago-program-uses-home-visits-boost-latino-early-education-n311711\n\nAt White House Summit, Advice For 1st-Gen Latino College Students:\nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/white-house-summit-advice-1st-gen-latino-college-students-n397511\n\n-- \nJessica Montoya Coggins\nE-mail: jessica.m.coggins@gmail.com\n<javascript:_e(%7B%7D,'cvml','jessica.m.coggins@gmail.com');>\nCell: (214) 532-0520\nTwitter: @JessicaMCoggins <https://twitter.com/#!/JessicaMCoggins>\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/jessica.m.coggins\nWebsite: http://jessicamontoyacoggins.com/\n"
