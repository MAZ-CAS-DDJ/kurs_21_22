john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hello All,\nJust off the phone with our tracker Ryan who is on the ground today in\nRochester.

Julie Brown, and special to\n   Doris Steinbach and Tom Gibson (thanks for your sacrifice, thank you to vets\n   - I need to start out talking to you about Iraq--there\'s been a lot of\n   back-and-forth about whether the surge has succeeded, etc. A lot of you will\n   remember about a year ago when people were questioning the war, I said the\n   surge would succeed. "And we are winning that war." I\'m proud and grateful\n   of the great young men and women who have succeeded and of Gen. Petraeus.\n   - Obama said the surge wouldn\'t succeed. He would have had us out last\n   March and we would never would have succeeded, we would\'ve been defeated. He\n   was wrong then, wrong now.\n   - He just received his first briefing from Petraeus, but he declared his\n   policy before he left.\n   - Our troops will come home with honor and victory. And n*ow Obama wants\n   to reverse the gains we have made and set a date for withdrawal. *\n   - This success is fragile and we cannot reverse it, which we would do if\n   we don\'t listen to conditions on the ground.\n   - If we win, we will contain Iranian influence in the region, we will\n   stabilize Iraq--they have a long way to go but we have seen the progress as\n   the government takes control of Mosul and Basra. Obama will do the wrong\n   thng.\n   - I had the courage to win a war and lose a campaign. *It seems Obama\n   would rather lose a war and win a political campaign. *\n   - *The same strategy in Iraq can win in Afghanistan,  but there\'s also\n   the poppy plan and dealing with the border with Afghanistan. We need more\n   troops, but we need more help from our NATO allies.*\n   - BTW, Obama just made his first trip to Afghanistan. I look forward to\n   havign more meetings with Obama.\n   - Divided We Fail is here. ONE is here. Great organizations. I\'m proud\n   Cindy and a number of other people are in Africa with ONE right now helping.\n   Maybe later on we\'ll let both of the orgs have a 60-sec commercial.\n\n\n\n   - Issue #1 on people\'s minds is energy. This energy crisis is real;\n   economic, enviro and national security.\n   - I have a plan to fix this crisis. WE can do it. WE can become energy\n   independent in  short period of time. We have to act fast and act together.\n   - We need alt energies, hydrogen-powered cars, 200-mi-battery-operated\n   cars.\n   - We are sending billions to foreign countries that don\'t like us, incl.\n   some into the hands of terrorists. This is one of the biggest transfers of\n   wealth in the history of the world--think of what that does to our deficit.\n   - I know it\'s been derided by some--but why not give them a little gas\n   tax holiday? I met a guy the other guy that owns 2 diesel trucks who could\n   stay in business longer with this.\n   - People here know about *Seabrook* and you know about nuclear power.\n   It\'s clean. It\'s integral to our effort to reduce and eliminate greenhouse\n   gas emissions. We\'ve gone 60 years and never had an accident with nuclear\n   plants on Navy ships.\n   - We always want to imitate the French. It takes them 5 years to build a\n   nuclear plant. Why should it take US 10-15 years+? Why can\'t we build 45\n   plants and employ 700k people.\n   -  In MI, I met with GM people and saw the Volt. I think technology is\n   there. I\'d give $5k tax credit. With hybrid cars, flex fuels (incl ethanol),\n   electric cars, we can become energy independetnt. Lexington Project.\n   - We have to drill off shores. It\'s out there and we can do it. *The oil\n   execs say we could see results within a couple years.* When Prez\n   announced we are lifting the fed moratorium, price of gas went down $10 /\n   barrel. So it will have a beneficial effect in the short-term as well as\n   long-term.\n   - Obama doesnt want to store or reprocess nuclear fuel, doesn\'t want to\n   drill offshore, doesn\'t want gas tax holiday. His president seal should\'ve\n   said \'No we won.t\'\n   - 1 of the greatest experiences of my life has been spending so much time\n   here in NH. This is going to be a battleground state. I need your support, I\n   need you out there registering voters. Im not going to let you down.\n   [enthusiastic chanting from crowd]\n\n\nQuestion and Answer\n\n   - 1Q) [disabled Iraq war vet having trouble getting benefits from VA]\n   Will you facilitate change in the adjudication process that\'s 90 years old?\n      - MCCAIN: We need make some improvements in the recent bill that was\n      passed. I think we can do more. thank you for your service. [rampant\n      applause.\n      - McCain makes awkward sound]. There\'s another vet I see here from the\n      Greatest Generation--Please stand, thank you. We have vets of\nall wars here\n      and you continue to inspire all of us. I carry with me usually a\nquote from\n      George Washington about how important it is to treat vets. I was\nrecently at\n      Phoenix V.A., doing a great job. There aren\'t enough facilities.\nWe need to\n      concentrate our efforts to handle combat-related injuries. We\nneed to expand\n      our ability to treat PTSD--it\'s going to be big in this war.\nPeople stand in\n      line to stand in line for routine health care needs. We need to\ngive them a\n      plastic card to take to their doctor and get the care they need.\nAnd we can\n      concentrate on our ability to treat battle-related wounds (PTSD,\nand battle\n      wounds).\n      - And there are numerous efforts where we treat our homeless vets--in\n      Concord... Nashua... Concord and Nashua [tosses microphone to\nguy in crowd]\n   - AUDIENCE MEMBER: Makes one of McCain\'s fellow POWs stand.\n   - AUDIENCE MEMBER (vet): *"You may get mixed up, John, but we know where\n      your heart is."*\n\n\n\n   - MCCAIN: "Call me"\n\n\n\n   - 2Q) I\'m going to give a little straight-talk. [jokes back and forth\n   about NYYs] I have a statement about a lot of your staffers. I know I\'m\n   going to be on their shit-list, but I don\'t care. [MCCAIN: "shh"] These 2\n   volunteers have done more work than any of your paid staff people. You gotta\n   make some changes. [McCain says a lot of them are on work-release program].\n      - MCCAIN: I\'ll fix it. Our folks will sit down and chat with you about\n      what needs to be fixed. I know that campaigns succeed through volunteers.\n\n\n\n   - [inaudible from crowd]\n   - 3Q) ONE campaign-- [Volunteer explains what organization is] [McCain\n   tries to hurry him] thank you for your help un-sticking PETFAR--it\'s already\n   saved a couple million lives around the world. Our reputation isn\'t getting\n   out into the world. Recently Secr of Def Gates called for more nonmilitary.\n   Will you make sure necessary appropriations are made so PETFAR, etc. will be\n   funded under your administration?\n      - MCCAIN: I admire Gates and the point he was making is that defense\n      is not just military; it\'s diplomatic, it\'s ideological. *We need to\n      eliminate poverty, HIV/AIDS, etc. which cause people turn to\nextremism, esp\n      Islamic extremism*. Gates is trying to say of course we need a strong\n      military, but this struggle is going to be won too with orgs like yours.\n\n\n\n   - [Divided We Fail rep -- explains organization -- thanks McCain for\n   bipartisanship] Thanks these orgs. Back in the primary, DWF had a forum and\n   Huckabee and I did it together. and by the way, I thought Huckabee had the\n   best line of the primary: "Jesus would be smart enough not to run for public\n   office"\n\n\n\n   - 4Q) I\'m a loyal supporter, I have a friend with LUPUS.* Can I tell my\n   friend you will cover her on pre-existing conditions?*\n      - MCCAIN: I will take a look at my website and make sure it\'s as\n      specific as possible. I want to put health care decisions in the hands of\n      families, not government run healthcare, which is what Obama wants. There\n      are people who are \'unisurable\'. We need GAPs: fed government\nand states get\n      together and establish risk pools. Florida has a good proposal.\nWe need to\n      provide health ins and health care to every American: that is\naffordable and\n      available.\n\n\n\n   - 5Q) [volunteer] Have you forgiven Mitt Romney? And "Russia. Question\n   mark."\n      - MCCAIN: Mitt has been a great friend. He does a better job for me\n      than he did for himself. And his whole fam. Ann is great. Our party is\n      united.\n      - *MCCAIN: I\'m very concerned about Russia. Recently, because they cut\n      oil supplies to the Czechs --they are tremendous allies.*\n         - *Says "Czechoslovakia"--corrects himself "the Czech Republic." As\n         you know, they split years ago and some of us misstate it\nfrom time to time.\n         *\n      - Theyr\'e being aggressive toward Georgia, they\'re not helping with\n      Iran.\n      - They\'re being increasingly autocratic, stifling internal dissent.\n      - The Czechs and Slovakia have been good friends since they were\n      behind the Iron Curtain.\n      - I worry. I don\'t think there\'s going to be a return to the Cold War.\n      But Russian behavior is less helpful to the world than we anticipated.\n\n\n\n   - 6Q) We entered the Iraq War illegally and wrong. Americans think USA on\n   the wrong track, Americans want a timeline for withdrawal, and now so\'s the\n   Iraqi PM. Given the $$$ we\'re spending in Iraq, that we\'re creating\n   terrorists there [massive boos from crowd--McCain "trying to ensure right\n   now" that everyone be respectful of everyone\'s view]. Our tax dollars are\n   needed here for health care, education, real energy solutions. Isn\'t it time\n   to end the occupation?\n      - MCCAIN: thank you. I respect those views. When I proposed the surge,\n      those [poll] #s were a lot worse than the ones you cite. Because my 1st\n      obligation is my country. And I thank you that you would come\nhere and state\n      your views. It\'s a lot better than the shouting Americans sometimes have.\n      For 4 years, this war was badly mishandled. and we failed. I believe a\n      change in strategy would succeed and it did. Obama said surge wouldn\'t\n      succeed and it did and he still refuses to acknowledge. I respect Obama\'s\n      views, but he\'s wrong. The most important is the future: We have\nsucceeded\n      and we\'re winning. I\'m confident we will reduce Iranian influence, we\'ll\n      have a stable "flawed but functioning" democracy there, we\'ll . "Our\n      victory--we are winning, and we have succeeded."\n      - FOLLOWUP: We are in IRaq against international law. The deaths of\n      our soldiers and of Iraqi citizens are tragedies and maybe\ncriminal because\n      we invaded. The idea that we may have a stable democratic\ngovernment there\n      is not ours to impose. WE need to leave, the people of Iraq are\nasking us to\n      leave, the Iraqi PM is asking us to leave. Why do we have the largest\n      embassy there if we\'re not trying to steal their oil?\n      - MCCAIN: That\'s not what Americans are fighting for. We\'re going to\n      withdraw. The question is whether we\'re going ot withdraw in\nvictory or in\n      defeat. We have succeeded--Sadr City, Basra, Mosul. The people there are\n      safe. [crowd applauds] There will continue to be "spectacular\nattacks". AQI\n      is not completely defeated.\n      - FOLLOWUP: Don\'t you believe we are inflaming the Muslim world by\n      staying there?\n      - MCCAIN: I do not. If we had pulled out, the extremists would\'ve been\n      inflamed...\n\n\n\n   - 7Q) We\'re the only state in the US without a full-service hospital.\n   Health care concern.\n      - MCCAIN: Thank you.\n\n\n\n   - MCCAIN [to Iraq questioner] thank you again for your question.\n   - I will not put my party first, I will put my country first.\n\n\n\n   - 8Q) For the first time, we have a Dem in all branches. They have\n   fiscally mismanaged. I\'m very concerned for people like Sen Sununu; We need\n   to get rid of Porter, etc. Obama has said he will raise taxes. How can you\n   support "our crisis" across this state and nation to bring GOP back into\n   office?\n      - MCCAIN I have to run effective campaign and cmapaing hard. I have to\n      campaign with people like our Gov. Peterson. Sen. Sununu is\nprobably one of\n      the smartest in the US Senate. I have to restore trust and confidence in\n      government. And by the way, I agree Sen. Sununu needs to returned. I also\n      agree Obama will raise your taxes. I won\'t raise your taxes.\n\n\n\n   - 9Q) I\'ve been to NOLA with aid orgs. How are you going to make response\n   quicker to natural disasters like Katrina?\n      - MCCAIN: One of the great tragedies in recent history is not only\n      Katrina but our ability to react to that. It\'s inexcusable. It\'ll never\n      happen again when I\'m POTUS. We need to have private enterprise more\n      involved. We need to have the best people at the ehad of FEMA,\netc. and not\n      political appointees. We need to have state and fed working\nTOGETHER--there\n      was a breakdown in comms among levels of govt. Some of the fixes have\n      already been implemented, some haven\'t. We have to be prepared.\n      - We have a struggle against radical Islamic extremism, we have to be\n      prepared for them. We also have to be prepared for these other\nattacks that\n      affect American lives.\n\n\n\n   - I\'m so glad to be back here with you. This is what we need to do. But\n   we need your help. I\'ll be back and back and back.\n   - I repeat: I love this country. I\'ve had teh opportunity not to put the\n   country first. Poll recently showed 9% approval rating of Congress. We have\n   to restore trust and confidence in government, namely reaching across the\n   aisle. I have done that my whole life. thank you and God bless.\n\n\n\n-- \nSara DuBois\nDeputy Director of Tracking & Media Monitoring\nProgressive Accountability Office\nsara@progressiveaccountability.org\n202-609-7681 (office)\n410-967-7306 (cell)\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
