Given today\'s stark news of 159,000 jobs lost in September,\nthis report will shed an important light on McCain\'s job creation claims.\n\nThe report, by CAPAF Senior Policy Advisor Brian Levine, reveals that\nMcCain\'s plan will not create a meaningful number of jobs in the short-term.\nThe situation in America\'s labor market cries out for urgent action but\nMcCain has no answer. The report analyzes the corporate tax breaks that make\nup John McCain\'s "economic stimulus" plan and concludes that they create\nvery few jobs, despite their high cost. A more efficient stimulus plan,\ncosting the same amount, would create more than four times as many jobs as\nthe McCain plan. *CAPAF Senior Fellow **Dr. Christian\nWeller<http://www.americanprogressaction.org/aboutus/staff/WellerChristian.html>\n** and Brian Levine* will discuss the implications of McCain\'s policies\ngiven the current economic crisis.\n\n*WHAT: Teleconference on John McCain\'s Economic Policy*\n\n*WHEN: Today, October 3, at 12:30pm*\n\n*CALL IN: **888-674-0222*\n\n*ID: McCain Job Creation*\n\n*WHO: *\n\n*Christian Weller, PhD., Senior Fellow, Center for American Progress Action\nFund*\n\n*Brian Levine, Senior Policy Advisor, Center for American Progress Action\nFund*\n\nPlease email John Neurohr at jneurohr@americanprogressaction.org if you plan\nto attend the call.\n\n*Read the report\nhere*<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/mccain_jobs1.pdf>\n\n*The Center for American Progress Action\nFund<http://www.americanprogressaction.org/>is the sister advocacy\norganization of the Center\nfor American Progress <http://www.americanprogress.org/>.
