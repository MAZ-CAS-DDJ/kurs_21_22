john.podesta@gmail.comb"Anything I can do for you guys?   I just finished directing a film -- origin story of Bruce Lee.   We are editing now so I have a few spare hours.   Also I'm sure you are swamped but if you have the mental space I have a few thoughts on messaging regarding reaching less informed (often younger) voters.  It's stuff I've talked to you about before, i.e. making sure the vocabulary and political concepts and processes that are assumed in a given statement are simple enough that these less informed voters are able to actually receive the message.  I could be specific by referencing the actual language of tonight's debate for example.   If it's too late in the game to discuss that, I get it.   Whatever you think will be valuable.   Just let me know.  I want to help if I can.   I'm in DC through Monday, then in NYC next week, then back to LA.\n\nBest,\n\nGeorge\n\n> On Feb 12, 2016, at 1:14 AM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com> wrote:\n> \n> Yup\n> \n>> On Thursday, February 11, 2016, George Nolfi <georgenolfi@icloud.com> wrote:\n>> This email still good for you?\n"
