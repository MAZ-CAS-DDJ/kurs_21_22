I said 15 months is not realistic and you should commit to 3 years.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, September 25, 2015, Molly McUsic <mcusic@wyssfoundation.org<mailto:mcusic@wyssfoundation.org>> wrote:\r\nHi John,\r\nYou told me that we should give him fifteen months on the phone yesterday but I think perhaps we should give him two years worth of funding.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he will come and do it without knowing he has two years to make it happen and prove it works.  We won\xe2\x80\x99t give it up front so if the first year is a disaster  we can cut it but I fear fifteen months is too short a time.\r\n\r\nMolly McUsic | President\r\nThe Wyss Foundation\r\n1601 Connecticut Ave. NW, Suite 800 |  Washington, DC 20009\r\nPhone: 202-232-4418 Ext. 12 | Fax: 202-232-4419\r\nwww.wyssfoundation.org<http://www.wyssfoundation.org/>\r\n\r\n"
