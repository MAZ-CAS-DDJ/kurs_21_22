Would it only\nanger Russia and make it more aggressive? Would it escalate the warfare and\nmake a political solution more difficult to achieve? \n\nThe question that Washington policy makers and President Obama should be\nasking is -- if weapons are NOT supplied to Ukraine, Then What ?\n\nThe argument not to supply military aid to Ukraine is based in large part on\nthe na\xefve assumption that hostilities in the eastern part of Ukraine are\nsomehow not a war of aggression by Russia but are internal rebel activities\nby Ukrainians of Russian ethnicity and that Russia has good and honorable\nintentions to find a peaceful solution to this alleged \x93internal\x94 crisis.\nThis fallacious notion has been debunked by clear and convincing evidence to\nthe contrary and is not reflective of a rational view of reality.  The\nalleged \x93separatist rebels\x94 are mercenaries hired, trained, supplied with\nweapons, and directed by Russia.  Russian military personnel in the\nthousands are openly fighting, and many are dying, alongside these\n"separatist rebels\x94 on Ukrainian soil. \n\nThere is also an unstated view in Western political circles that Russia\nwould be politically satisfied with holding onto Crimea and that Eastern\nUkraine [Luhansk and Donetsk regions] be quasi-independent entities within\nthe sphere of direct influence of the Kremlin.  According to this misguided\nrationale, if the West were to accept this scenario as the status quo [and\nconvince Ukraine to such draconian terms], Russia would readily enter into a\nbinding international agreement which would guarantee peace on the European\ncontinent for the future.  As a reality check to this flawed logic, one only\nhas to recall from recent memory countless historical events to realize that\nRussia has never lived up to any of its international agreements including\nnuclear non-proliferation treaties.  One such glaring example that comes\nimmediately to mind is the 1994 Budapest Memorandum wherein Russia profusely\nguaranteed that it would not violate Ukrainian sovereignty in exchange for\nwhich Ukraine surrendered the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world.\nFurther, the Kremlin flagrantly continues to violate various other nuclear\naccords and proudly states that it will be expanding its nuclear armaments\nas well as its military potential -- and all international covenants to the\ncontrary be damned.  There is a saying \x93The best predictor of future\nbehavior is past behavior.\x94\n\nHistory is also the best teacher.  To understand Russia and its political\nand military intentions towards Ukraine, we need to look at history.  Over\nthe centuries, Russian political thought always viewed Ukraine as the\nlinchpin to its imperialistic ambitions and desires.  It has continuously\nfought to control not only Ukraine\x92s territory, but also sought to destroy\nUkrainian culture and ethos.  As former Ukrainian Ambassador to the United\nKingdom, V. Vassylenko stated in his recent essay,\n<http://www.uaba.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode=bTdp\nSMafkkVqMULZSmidCiL9k8cDAelCrYMMiFzyax2w3IohSh%2bbBeFeqYI6nqQ39qjrAgsmBHUNrE\n6X0XCg1vw%2fJRbUPkRbUcyop8u1nsg%3d> The 2014 War: An Endeavor for a\nComprehensive Analysis;\n\nThe restoration of Ukraine\x92s independence is intertwined with the inevitable\nrevival of its national memory and individual national history, thus\nstripping Russia of a part of its alleged history, thereby destroying the\nmyth of its millennium-old statehood, European identity and supposedly\neternal and natural place of Russia in European civilization. Russian\nempire-minded chauvinists realize that, unless Ukraine with its territory,\nresources and human potential, is not subdued once again, Russia\x92s attempts\nto restore its status of an empire will be futile\x85..  p. 4\n\nMeanwhile, another less obvious goal of the Russian aggression is to test\nhow ready and capable Western democracies are in resisting Russia\x92s\nrevanchist and expansionist plans to use force to return territories that\nhad been parts of the Russian empire in the past. \x85..p. 8\n\nRussia\'s covert foreign policy objective is to undermine European and\nEuro-Atlantic unity and to create a Euro-Asian empire, stretching from\nVladivostok to Lisbon thereby challenging and threatening the United States.\np. 8\n\nViewed from the historical perspective, if weapons are not supplied to\nUkraine so it can defend itself now, [and thereby,  in essence, protect\nWestern Europe] any \x93political solution\x94 that does not permanently insure\nUkrainian territorial integrity and the inviolability of its borders from\nRussian incursion by giving Ukraine the unfettered military ability to\nprotect its national boundaries, is only temporary window dressing to\nappease the gullible conscience of Western leaders and to lull them into an\nunrealistic sense of security.  If Ukraine is not afforded the necessary\nmeans to defend itself, then after a temporary illusionary respite in\nhostilities and the easing of economic sanctions, Russia will regroup,\nstrengthen itself, and will exponentially continue its assault on Ukraine,\nthus drastically expanding the existing conflict to the entire European\ncontinent in the future.  In the process, Russia will successfully undermine\nWestern and NATO unity, European economic integration and security, greatly\njeopardize world peace, and put America\x92s national interests and security at\nhigh risk. \n\nThen Washington foreign policy makers and future American Presidents will be\nasking the question:  NOW WHAT?\n\nFebruary 6, 2015\n\nMyroslaw Smorodsky, Esq.\n730 West Saddle River Rd., Ho-Ho-Kus, NJ 07423\nCommunications Director of the Ukrainian American Bar Association (UABA)\nTel: 201-507-4500; Email;  <mailto:myroslaw@smorodsky.com>\nmyroslaw@smorodsky.com; Website;\n<http://www.uaba.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode=eTIF\nT3OO%2bynrORB6bEj2TCe4jygJTLdNiRBCXGNYHK%2fpQMrutmi7TcnOXRzT2l19FUuW5Rhf6JKu\n2YQVK4d5WVJLliJoh0upj%2fcxjGiWJjM%3d> www.smorodsky.com\n\n \n\n'
