john.podesta@gmail.comb'\nyou can be sure that\'s IT, so good for her for \'fessing up.   Despises him, and as you all know, she\'s in the Warren Camp full of such resentments.   I think if you decide you want to confer with her, which would be good for the rumblings on the "hundreds" being involved in economic and tax policy, you consider a high level outreach who can verbally put Summers\' role (or non-role) in perspective.    She\'s a total diva, all the time, I know in being responsible for her at Pew!\n \n\nTamera Luzzatto\nluzzatto@aol.com\nM:  202-329-6864\nW: 202-540-6501\n\n\n \n \n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>\nTo: Jake Sullivan <Jake.Sullivan@gmail.com>; Tamera Luzzatto <luzzatto@aol.com>; John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>\nSent: Thu, Feb 12, 2015 10:33 am\nSubject: Sheila Bair\n\n\n\nWell, maybe this is the answer\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\nFrom: Sheila Bair <sbair@pewtrusts.org>\nDate: Thursday, February 12, 2015 at 10:23 AM\nTo: Dan <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>\nSubject: RE: Pleased to e-introduce Sheila Bair to Secretary Clinton\'s lead for policy, Dan Schwerin\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Dan,\n \nI appreciate that. \n \nI must say it gave me pause when I read in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s NY Times that Larry Summers is taking such a prominent role in her policy operation (or at least, that was the impression he was trying to create).   I don\xe2\x80\x99t think people view him as someone who understands or is sensitive to middle class issues, and justifiably so.  Frankly, the policies he has embraced have done a lot to help Wall Street but not much for Main Street.   I am not a Democrat, but it seems clear that he will be a divisive, not a unifying force, among your Party\xe2\x80\x99s differing constituencies.\n \nBest,\nSheila\n \n \n \n\nFrom: Dan Schwerin [mailto:dschwerin@hrcoffice.com]\nSent: Wednesday, February 11, 2015 12:58 PM\nTo: Sheila Bair\nSubject: Re: Pleased to e-introduce Sheila Bair to Secretary Clinton\'s lead for policy, Dan Schwerin\n\n \n\nSheila, thanks for your note.

I\'m afraid that I have a very heavy travel schedule over the next few months. \n\n \n\nIn any event, please give Mrs Clinton my best. I will always remember the way she reached out to me in late 2008 during the transition to the new Obama Administration to offer her support for my foreclosure prevention efforts. And please say hello to John Podesta for me as well. I have known him for many years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt makes me feel good to know that Mrs Clinton has people like John and Tamera advising her. \n\n\n\n\n\n I am sorry we will not have a chance to talk on Thursday, but I appreciate your gesture in reaching out.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nSheila Bair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
