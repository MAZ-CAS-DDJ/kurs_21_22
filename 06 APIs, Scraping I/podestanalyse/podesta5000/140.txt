john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John,\n\nWe interrupt the planet hurtling toward its inevitable destruction to bring you a few tiny glimmers of good news. The U.S. and China, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably heard, announced an historic agreement to cut carbon that is, in the words of Grist\xe2\x80\x99s Ben Adler, \xe2\x80\x9ca game changer <http://link.grist.org/525c85edc16bcfa46f7788ad1zklt.gb/VGOdW0mO8Okcmre7Ce924>.\xe2\x80\x9d (Ben also explains why some Republicans are losing their minds <http://link.grist.org/525c85edc16bcfa46f7788ad1zklt.gb/VGTwQ0mOMpXfG55mC3cda> over the deal.) And though that agreement is only a starting point, one look at the growing movement on the ground -- seen in the faces of the climate marchers <http://link.grist.org/525c85edc16bcfa46f7788ad1zklt.gb/VCBRgkmOI0t6D93JCeabb> in New York this fall -- suggests the pressure for real change is increasing.\n\nHey, I said they were glimmers.\n\nThe dearth of good news doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we should keen and wail and tear our hemp shirts. In fact, Grist\xe2\x80\x99s entire existence is built on the idea of laughing in the face of impossibly tough odds -- we are your \xe2\x80\x9cbeacon in the smog\xe2\x80\x9d after all -- and then rising up to do something about the mess we\xe2\x80\x99re in. I truly believe in that prescription for survival. If we can\xe2\x80\x99t laugh, what can we do?\n\nThis month, we\xe2\x80\x99re bringing that mantra to the live stage, hosting a Grist comedy night on November 16 in Brooklyn, N.Y. <http://link.grist.org/525c85edc16bcfa46f7788ad1zklt.gb/VGIjdcPoK9UG1KzFC7b47> Featuring our board member and all-around funny guy Eugene Mirman, the night will also showcase comedians Todd Barry, Mike Birbiglia, Maeve Higgins, and Brooks Whelan. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll join us if you can -- it should be a great event, and a perfect way to release all that post-election tension. (Email Patrick Schmitt at pschmitt@grist.org if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to attend, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll hook you up ASAP.)\n\nIf you can\xe2\x80\x99t meet us in person, allow me to suggest a Top Five of recent Grist pieces that approach the issues in an unexpected, irreverent way: \n\n1. As part of an exploration of sustainability and reproduction, one of our journalism fellows, Eve Andrews, watches and analyzes a video of several vasectomies <http://link.grist.org/525c85edc16bcfa46f7788ad1zklt.gb/VGD4RkmOVU-ItSobCe076> -- over breakfast\n\n2. We feature an elevator pitch about a cap-and-dividend system <http://link.grist.org/525c85edc16bcfa46f7788ad1zklt.gb/VGFbUEmOMpXfG4RXC9d12> -- in an actual elevator\n\n3. Several staffers brave that most daunting of assignments -- seeing a movie -- then engage in a lively roundtable about the science of Interstellar <http://link.grist.org/525c85edc16bcfa46f7788ad1zklt.gb/VGD4RkmOVU-ItSoYC8dfc>\n\n4. Deep thinker David Roberts explains postmodern conservatism in 36 tweets <http://link.grist.org/525c85edc16bcfa46f7788ad1zklt.gb/VGKd4cPobtPxqClGC6943> (and earns retweets from Mark Ruffalo and Joss Whedon, among others)\n\n5. Beloved advice columnist Umbra Fisk tackles the meaty question of whether a vegan can ever truly love a carnivore <http://link.grist.org/525c85edc16bcfa46f7788ad1zklt.gb/VGTwQ0mOMpXfG55oC0898>.\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re not forsaking the tough assignments -- in another one of my favorite recent pieces, writer Brentin Mock digs into the true story behind why a coalition of black politicians is pushing against renewable energy <http://link.grist.org/525c85edc16bcfa46f7788ad1zklt.gb/VEFFDUmOEXlwTGH-C6b4c>. But we think our readers (and writers) deserve to lighten their existential loads once in a while. If a spoonful of agave makes the medicine go down, we\xe2\x80\x99re happy to serve it up.\n\nThanks for your support,\n\nChip\n\nChip Giller\nFounder and CEO, Grist <http://link.grist.org/525c85edc16bcfa46f7788ad1zklt.gb/UktQaOYQ1eYSXqaaC1a68>\n@cgiller <http://link.grist.org/525c85edc16bcfa46f7788ad1zklt.gb/VGZIwUmOoYLjnTLQCdaa0>\n\n<a href="http://link.grist.org/525c85edc16bcfa46f7788ad1zklt.gb/UpS4oMJSxbpM7PldA16fa><img src="http://link.grist.org/img/525c85edc16bcfa46f7788ad1zklt.gb/0847795c.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a>\n\nIf you believe this has been sent to you in error, please safely unsubscribe <http://link.grist.org/oc/525c85edc16bcfa46f7788ad1zklt.gb/38e92510>.'
