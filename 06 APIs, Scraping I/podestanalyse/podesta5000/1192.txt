Our campaign is leading in the polls in Prince George's County. \n\nPolitico this morning reported that our recent polling has us tied up with Anthony Brown across the 4th District while other candidates are running far behind in the single digits.\n\nThe momentum is real and it's all thanks to supporters like you!\n\nBut, we can't lose focus at this critical juncture in the campaign. Again, we raised the bar on our competition and for ourselves. Our opponents will now step up their efforts so we need to as well. With less than 90 days until Election day and even fewer until Early Voting begins, we need you to step up now. \n\nWith only 3 days until our end of January 31st deadline, I need you to make a donation of $25, $50, $100, or $250 today. \n\nWe are the hardest, smartest working grassroots campaign and we couldn't do it without you. Help us dig deep and keep the momentum alive.
