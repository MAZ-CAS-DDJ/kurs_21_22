They really are smart and\ncommitted to the work.\n\nThey have a lot of questions that I can't answer. They want to join\nthe conversation rather than be subject to it. Seems fair. Because Ari\ngets married on Sunday we have a window to have them all on the line\nThursday afternoon. Ari meets with his wedding Rabbi at 4:30 Eastern\nbut we're otherwise clear on our end. Can we try 3:00 PM Thursday?\n\nThere was also a feeling that we should open-source a lot of the\nresources that we have--dump the research book and the video, etc.. on\nthe web. Something to discuss.\n\nbest,\n\n-Tom\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n****************************************************\n\nTo ensure compliance with Treasury Department regulations, we advise you that, unless otherwise expressly indicated, any federal tax advice contained in this message was not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of (i) avoiding tax-related penalties under the Internal Revenue Code or applicable state or local tax law provisions or (ii) promoting, marketing or recommending to another party any tax-related matters addressed herein.\n****************************************************\n****************************************************\n\nThis email and any attachments thereto, is intended only for use by the addressee(s) named herein and may contain legally privileged and/or confidential information.
