Last year, during an interview with NPR, she said that she\nsupported the expansion of same-sex marriage rights on a state-by-state\nbasis.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, marriage had always been a matter left to the states,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\nClinton said, going on to explain that such a path of progress was working.\n\nThe interview frustrated some in the gay community as Mrs. Clinton was\nreluctant to say if she always believed that homosexuals should have the\nright to marry or if her opinion changed since the 1990s when her husband,\nPresident Bill Clinton, signed the Defense of Marriage Act.\n\nMrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s shift comes ahead of a decision by the Supreme Court,\nprobably in June, on whether all 50 states must allow gay and lesbian\ncouples to marry.\n\nMrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign initially made the statement on Wednesday to\nBuzzFeed news.\n\n-- \nJesse Lehrich\nRapid Response Associate\nHillary For America\n781-307-2254\n@JesseLehrich\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups\n"HRCRapid" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an\nemail to hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups\n"HRCRapid" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an\nemail to hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n\n --\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups\n"HRCRapid" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an\nemail to hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "HRCRapid" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n'
