The Iraqi government has been trying to clarify its position on a possible troop withdrawal since al-Maliki was quoted in a German magazine last week saying he supported Obama\'s timetable.\n\nThe Iraqi government later said the prime minister\'s remarks were misinterpreted.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP\'s earlier story is below.\n\nBAGHDAD (AP) - The U.S. military in Iraq says it has arrested a suspected propaganda expert linked to a militant group that receives training from Iran.\n\nThe military says it believes the man is a member of the Hezbollah Brigades, an Iraqi group it describes as "an offshoot of Iranian-trained special groups." That\'s how the U.S. refers to Shiite fighters defying a cease-fire order from radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.\n\nA military statement says the man uploads to the Web images and video of attacks on Iraqi and U.S.-led forces. The information is allegedly used to raise money and other kinds of support from Iranian backers.\n\nThe suspect was arrested Monday in Baghdad.\n\nCopyright (c) 2008 The Associated Press.
