Your comments were very helpful\nand got the conversation going in a good direction.\n\n \n\nNicole's comments are below and I have copied you on her email and this\none, so if you have any questions, she can answer them.\n\n \n\nI would add that we did not eat in any great restaurants in Madrid,\nthough we tried to find one.  We tried a fancy restaurant near Bilbao on\nthe Atlantic Coast, but were not that impressed.  In some ways, the most\nmemorable meal is to have the classic cuisine from the countryside\naround Madrid.  Botin which dates back to 1725 and is supposed to be the\noldest restaurant in the world serves this type of food - very meat\noriented.  If you go with a few people, have a few people order meat -\nleg of lamb or suckling pig and the rest order vegetable dishes like\nartichokes beans, etc.  The Spanish wine is very good and well priced.\n\n \n\nHave a great trip.\n\n \n\nDan\n\nDaniel Leeds\n\n3205 R Street NW\n\nWashington, DC 20007\n\nOffice (202)338-4555 x2\n\nFax (202) 338-0229\n\n \n\nFrom: Nicole Leeds [mailto:nrleeds@gmail.com] \nSent: Tuesday, September 29, 2009 1:42 PM\nTo: Daniel Leeds\nCc: jpodesta@americanprogress.org; John.podesta@gmail.com\nSubject: Re: John Podesta is going to Madrid for the weekend\n\n \n\nHi Dad,\n\nWith a half day in Madrid, I would do a walking tour of the city and,\ndepending on his interests, either the Royal Palace or the Prado. Both\nare fabulous; I'm not really into art so I enjoyed the Palace more but\nthe Prado is probably Madrid's most famous sight and has a lot of\nbeautiful and famous works. The Palace is in the old part of the city\nand has some stunning views of the surrounding area.\n\nIf he has enough time, I would see the Palace for an hour, then walk\nfrom Plaza del Opera  (right near the Palace) up to Plaza del Sol.  Then\nI would use Plaza del Sol as a base to walk to the Plaza Mayor and the\nPlaza de Cibeles. The weather should be great this time of year. If he'd\nrather do the Prado than the Palace, the Prado is right off of Plaza de\nCibeles. It all makes sense if you look at a map.\n\nI would have either lunch or tapas in the Plaza Santa Ana (right off the\nplaza del Sol), which has beautiful outdoor seating (the restaurants are\npretty much all the same - I would get a glass of Spanish red wine and a\nbunch of traditional tapas like squid, octopus, jamon iberico, tortilla,\netc).\n\nHope this helps! Feel free to forward me any questions.\n\nNicole\n\nOn Tue, Sep 29, 2009 at 9:49 AM, Daniel Leeds\n<DLeeds@fulcruminvestments.com> wrote:\n\nHi Nicole -\n\n \n\nJohn Podesta is going to Madrid for the weekend.
