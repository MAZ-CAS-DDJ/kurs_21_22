Another 60 Plus spot<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhrac9ibQZY> last week warned that the Greatest Generation had already "sacrificed enough."\n\nBoth ads were made by McCarthy Marcus Hennings. This firm\'s president, writer, and communications consultant, Larry McCarthy, was the creator of the Willie Horton spot during the 1988 Bush-Dukakis presidential race. That ad infamously bashed Michael Dukakis for granting Horton a weekend pass from prison, leading to the murder of a little boy.\n\nYou can see the credit for McCarthy\'s firm right at the beginning of last week\'s 60 Plus spot<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhrac9ibQZY>. A source familiar with the creation of this week\'s ad confirmed it was made by the same firm.\n\nThe well-funded 60 Plus presents itself as a group that\'s all about protecting the interests of seniors. But its ad campaign was created by one of the most hard-boiled GOP operatives of the last generation - one well schooled in some of the nastiest ad tactics in memory.
