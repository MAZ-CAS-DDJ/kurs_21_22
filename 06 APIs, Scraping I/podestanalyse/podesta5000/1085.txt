john.podesta@gmail.comb'Friend,\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot at stake for women right now.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruled that corporations could deny birth control coverage for employees, Governor Quinn signed a bill that will give voters a chance to weigh in on this important issue when they vote.\n\nIt sends a message: Policies that discriminate against women have no place in Illinois.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s just one of many reasons why I\'m whole-heartedly supporting Governor Quinn.\n\nIf you agree with me and Governor Quinn that health care decisions should be between a woman and her doctor, NOT her boss, you must commit to vote in this election:\n\nhttps://quinnforillinois.com/stand-with-illinois-women\n\nI\'m a Midwesterner, too, and I believe that the Midwest leads the nation.\n\nGovernor Quinn is the most pro-woman, pro-child governor in the country, and we can\'t afford to lose him. A vote for him is a vote for choice, equal pay for equal work, and access to quality, affordable health care for all women.\n\nBruce Rauner says he is "pro-choice," but with "reasonable restrictions" -- the exact same code words used in places like Texas to shut down health clinics.\n\nSpeak up, and let\'s put a stop to deception and discrimination.\n\nRemember, the voting booth is the only place on Earth where the most powerful and least powerful are equal.\n\nMake your voice heard for women by voting in this election:\n\nhttps://quinnforillinois.com/stand-with-illinois-women\n\nThe eyes of the world are on the state of Illinois. Thank you for standing against the Bruce Rauners and the Koch Brothers of the world -- and for human rights.\n\nWith friendship,\n\nGloria\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nContributions are not tax deductible.
