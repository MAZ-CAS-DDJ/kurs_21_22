john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear Friends:\n\nToday has been a big day for the League of Conservation Voters, and I wanted you to be among the first to hear our news. Today, LCV added California ballot measure Proposition 23 to our 2010 Dirty Dozen list, released two new political TV ads, and officially reported that our organization has raised or contributed more than $1,000,000 to pro-environment candidates this cycle. Please see LCV\'s press release below for more information.\n\nThank you for all that you do for us.\n\nWarmly,\nGene\n\nLeague of Conservation Voters\n\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nOctober 14, 2010\nContact: Kate Geller, (202) 454-4573 or kate_geller@lcv.org\n\nLCV Names Prop. 23 to 2010 Dirty Dozen, Reaches $1M in Campaign Contributions to Pro-Environment Candidates, Releases New Political TV Ads\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - Today, the League of Conservation Voters (LCV), which works to turn environmental values into national priorities, announced the unprecedented addition of a ballot measure-California\'s Proposition 23-to the 2010 Dirty Dozen list, released two new political TV ads and reported that the organization has contributed or raised more than $1,000,000 for pro-environment congressional candidates this cycle.\n\n"Our members are fired up - and angry - about the fact that Big Oil\'s congressional allies have blocked action on comprehensive energy reform that creates jobs, makes America more energy independent and reduces\nharmful carbon pollution," said LCV President Gene Karpinski. "We are\ncontinuing to ramp up efforts and mobilize our supporters to defeat the dirty\nenergy measure in California, re-elect House members who voted for comprehensive energy and climate legislation and defeat climate change\ndeniers running against Senate clean energy champions."\xa0\xa0\n\nLCV and the California LCV announced the unprecedented addition of ballot measure Proposition 23 to the 2010 Dirty Dozen list. For the first time, LCV named the dirty energy measure to its trademark Dirty Dozen program, which traditionally targets candidates for Congress, based on the grave threat Prop. 23 poses to California\'s landmark air pollution standards and growing clean energy industry. LCV and its sister organization, LCV Education Fund have contributed over $1.2 million so far to defeat this measure, which has been funded largely by Texas oil companies.\n\n"If Big Oil successfully repeals\xa0California\'s clean energy law, there\'s no doubt that these dirty energy interests will step up their efforts to stifle new energy policies in Congress and in other states - and that\'s why LCV is working with\nCalifornia LCV to mobilize our members in California and around the country," said Karpinski.\n\nLCV and CLCV are working to defeat this dirty energy proposition through CLCV\'s No on 23 ballot measure committee. The addition of Prop. 23 makes this cycle\'s Dirty Dozen a baker\'s dozen.

By comparison, LCV Action Fund contributed or raised $850,420 during the entire 2008 election cycle, while in 2006 the organization contributed or raised $573,261. As of October 14th, LCV Action Fund had contributed $315,524 to House and Senate candidates, while raising an additional $691,904 for candidates through its GiveGreen program. The GiveGreen website, http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=1Ff9mbC-qKyrDS6bcsFJqA.. , is the only bundling website devoted exclusively to raising money for environmental champions and candidates.\n\nThe candidates who have received at least $20,000 from LCV Action Fund\'s fundraising efforts* this cycle are:\n\nSenate Candidates\nRobin Carnahan (MO) $63,053.56\nBarbara Boxer (CA) $58,977.93\nHarry Reid (NV) $58,008.17\nMichael Bennet (CO) $44,948.51\nPaul Hodes (NH) $44,724.18\nJoe Sestak (PA) $39,961.41\nRuss Feingold (WI) $34,864.85\nPatty Murray (WA) $30,381.74\nAlexi Giannoulias (IL) $21,536.16\n\nHouse Candidates\nTom Perriello (VA-05) $51,941.42\nBetsy Markey (CO-04) $37,735.10\nMartin Heinrich (NM-01) $32,188.41\nDina Titus (NV-03) $24,553.03\nCarol Shea-Porter (NH-01) $24,525.41\nMark Schauer (MI-07) $23,789.48\nJohn Boccieri (OH-16) $22,955.18\n\n* Figures include direct contributions from LCV Action Fund and money raised via LCV Action Fund\'s GiveGreen program for candidates.\n\nLCV launched two new political TV ads today targeting candidates seeking to replace conservation and clean energy champions this November. A $200,000, Western Slope broadcast and cable ad buy in Colorado hits Senate candidate Ken Buck for his previous support for Referendum A, a\nwater grab that sought to take water from rural Colorado for corporate\ninterests and was overwhelmingly rejected by Colorado voters. A $200,000 ad buy in Nevada\'s 3rd district hits House candidate Joe Heck for his opposition to creating clean energy jobs in Nevada and will be running in the Las Vegas media market.
