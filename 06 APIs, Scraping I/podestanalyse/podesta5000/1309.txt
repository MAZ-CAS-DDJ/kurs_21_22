It looks like they want to avoid a Sid\nscenario\n<http://www.nationalreview.com/article/425641/huma-abedin-email-address-discovered-benghazi-committee-testimony>\n:\n\nUpdate: A Benghazi Committee aide said in a statement sent to reporters\nthis afternoon that Abedin \xe2\x80\x9cwill be questioned about issues pertaining to\nthe committee\xe2\x80\x99s charter,\xe2\x80\x9d specifically the September 11, 2012, attack on\nthe U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya and the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s\nsubsequent response. It appears she will not be subject to questioning on\nTeneo or the Clinton Foundation.\n\nAs for updates - We\'ve worked with Matt on the list of comparative\nterrorist attacks and finishing up the ARB recommendations. These are\nmostly done, and 3 have congressional funding components. We also updated a\ndoc on leaks, and are tying a bow on the comparative transparency doc, with\nCorker\'s statements included. Last but not least we received three items\nfrom Heather to update for the briefing book.We also sent the Asked/Answer\ndoc and the compilations of HRC\'s characterizations of Benghazi.\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Oct 15, 2015 at 2:01 PM, Matt Siegler <matt@sb-atalaya.com> wrote:\n\n> Updated tracking document attached.\n>\n> Thanks,\n> Matt\n>\n> On Wed, Oct 14, 2015 at 8:02 PM, Amanda Renteria <\n> arenteria@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n>\n>> For all,\n>> We had great meetings today - Phil laid out the issues involved and\n>> reiterated the "themes" so everyone was on the same page.\n>> They mentioned the following "tools" would be helpful:\n>> -Fact sheet on a list of unsubstantiated attacks from the past\n>> -Sharing previous quotes from previous hearings re: Corker saying how\n>> transparent she was, date of the same questions asked, etc)\n>> -Time comparison of the length of this investigation vs others\n>> -Ideally, a press story that talks about the link to all the attacks of\n>> the past which can be used as a validating tool to show it\'s all partisan\n>> (and inappropriate) from the beginning.
