Republican John McCain called for, quote, "meaningful\nsanctions." Earlier today, I asked Sen. McCain about a possible attack by\nIsrael against Iran. [cut to interview] Would you discourage Israel if their\nleadership came to you as President and said we\'re going to strike Iran\'s\nnuclear sites?\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: I can\'t get into that kind of hypothetical but the Iranians are\ntesting these missiles not because of action on the part of the Israelis in\nmy view. *This is part of a calculated plans [sic], developing nuclear\nweapons and the means to deliver them. And nations led by all of our\nEuropean friends as well as other countries, we have to impose meaningful,\ntough effective sanctions on the Iranians to modify their behavior. We\ncannot ever allow a second Holocaust.*\n\nCOURIC: Do you get a sense, Sen. McCain, that an attack by Israel on Iran is\nimminent?\n\nMCCAIN: I have no idea. I know this, that Iran continues to develop nuclear\nweapons in violation of various treaties and their own commitments and we\nneed to do everything we can to modify that behavior in the form of very\ntough economic and other sanctions. Their economy is not strong because they\nhave a lousy government.\n\nCOURIC: What do you think should be done right now that isn\'t been done in\nthat department?\n\nMCCAIN: Impose tough sanctions. There are European financial institutions\nextending unlimited lines of credit to the Iranians. Shut all that down.\nMake things very, very tough economically on the Iranians and trade and\nother ways and I think it can have a beneficial effect.\n\nCOURIC: Beyond a summer gas tax plan that nobody thinks will pass, are you\noffering any kind of relief to the American people who as you know are\nreally struggling right now?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, uh, we\'ve got quickly, um go offshore if the states agree and\nexplore and exploit those areas. If you lift the moratorium on offshore\nexploration, uh, I think that will send a signal and have an affect on gas\nprices immediately. The gas tax holiday was just a chance to give some\npeople a little bit of relief [laughs] that\'s all it was. A lot of people\nsay it was a gimmick and wouldn\'t work. A lot of people who are driving the\nfurtherest [sic] in the oldest cars are low income Americans, really would\nlike to have a little bit of relief.\n\nCOURIC: Your advisors say you\'re promising to balance the budget by the end\nof your first term, Sen. McCain. Are you personally making this commitment\nto the American people?\n\nMCCAIN: Yes. Absolutely. And if we reduce spending, then we can do it. It\nall has to do with spending. It all has to do with discipline, which is out\nof control.\n\nCOURIC: What\'s your reaction to leading economists who say it\'s all but\nimpossible to meet that goal? That you\'d have to cut spending or raise taxes\nbeyond what anyone could anticipate is possible. Is it really achievable?\n\nMCCAIN: I\'m saying that there is five Nobel laureates and 300 economists who\nthink my economic plan is a good one. I say that those that disagree, I\nrespect their opinion but growth and revenue increases is what will balance\nthe budget.\n\nCOURIC: Some Republicans meanwhile have privately complained that your\ncampaign organization is in disarray and if you can\'t effectively run a\ncampaign, how can you effectively run the country? What\'s your response to\nthat?\n\n*MCCAIN: My response is that I do town hall meetings all the time.* And not\na single person in the town hall meetings says, "How\'s your campaign\norganization doing?" What they say is, "How you going to get my health care\naffordable?" "I\'m worried about my job." "I can\'t afford to drive my car\nanymore." "How am I going to, uh, er, keep my home loan, stay in my home,\nafford my mortgage." That\'s what they\'re talking about. That\'s what I\'m\ntalking about.\n\n*John McCain Invokes Specter of a Second Holocaust with Regard to Iran* (ABC\n07/09/08 6:44pm)\nJOHN MCCAIN [on Iranian missile tests]: It\'s alarming. *It\'s part of the\noverall effort on the part of the Iranians to acquire nuclear weapons and\nthe means to deliver them. I strongly feel that we must enact meaningful and\npowerful sanctions, joined by our European allies and others who consider\nthis threat very seriously.*\n\nCHARLES GIBSON: But, with all due respect, that\'s what the president has\nbeen calling for for some time in reaction to the Iranians and it hasn\'t\ngotten us anywhere\n\nMCCAIN: Well, we haven\'t done it, Charlie. I hope that this may be a\ncatalyst to actually come together and impose these sanctions on the\nIranians. At the end of the day, also *we cannot afford to have a second\nholocaust.*\n\n[...]\n\nGIBSON: [...] Well John McCain has been hammering away at Barack Obama for\nhis position on Iran and he\'s also criticizing Obama for changing position\non a number of other issues [...].\n\nGIBSON: I\'m curious, there\'s been a lot of speculation in the press about\nwhether your opponent may be shifting positions in some areas, moving to the\ncenter, a little more right than he was in the primaries. Do you see him\nshifting positions?\n\nMCCAIN: It appears so, although I have not been pa ying real close\nattention, but I would say on the issue of Iraq, I\'m glad he\'s going for the\nfirst time in 900 days. I\'m glad he is, for the first time, asking for a\nsit-down briefing with General Petraeus and I would be very interested in\nwhat his position on Iraq is when he returns.\n\nGIBSON: You\'re not ready yet to call him a flip-flopper?\n\nMCCAIN: Oh, *it\'s obvious that what I say doesn\'t affect American public\nopinion nearly as much as what he says does.*\n\nGIBSON: You think so?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, the fact is he has changed his positions on FISA, on public\nfinancing, on his agreement that he says he\'d go back any time, any place to\nhave a town hall meeting with me. We were before the same organization\nyesterday. We could have just stood there together and answered their\nquestions. I think LULAC would have gotten a lot more out of it. He said\nthat he would do that. He said he would take public financing for the\ngeneral election if I did as well and said that he agreed to it, but those\nthings will be judged by the American people, but I won\'t hesitate to point\n\'em out.\n\n*Williams Asks McCain about His New Ad, Iran *(MSNBC 07/09/08 7:20pm)\nBRIAN WILLIAMS: . . . since this day, again, started with that missile\nlaunch of Iran, that topic dominated a morning round of interviews, ours\nincluded, with the presumptive nominee John McCain . . .\n\nMCCAIN: Hopefully, at this event, it will serve as a catalyst that will gel\nall of the different factors that have been out there that will allow us to\nact with our friends and allies in the most effective fashion and modify\nIranian behavior but we cannot allow a second Holocaust.\n\nWILLIAMS: Senator, let\'s switch to the domestic campaign.  You have a new ad\nout that contrasts a lot of behavior in this country in, one presumes, the\nsixties with your record of service. What it says is your record of\npatriotism, love of country. In the ad you say we live in a dangerous world\nand you call the US economy a shambles, which seems to be a tougher, more\nmorose message than you\'ve been using on the campaign trail. Do you stick by\nthat message?\n\nMCCAIN: I think our economy, it, it, it is certainly in dire situation. We\ncontinue to see the economy deteriorate. We continue to see the increase in\na price of a gallon of gas. We continue to see jobs lost in this country and\nwe have a great deal to do.\n\nWILLIAMS: The ad seems to play on the word "hope" many times and in the\nscript it appears in quotes, "don\'t \'hope\' for a better life, vote for one,"\n. . . the implication is rather clear, but matched against the video, say\nthe height of the domestic uprising, 1968, your opponent was about six years\nold. What are you trying to imply about what he was doing during the Viet\nNam years as opposed to what we know you were doing?\n\nMCCAIN: [laughs] I-I-I\'m not, I think the point is that this nation has\nbe--, was united after the Ronald Reagan came to the presidency, we joined\ntogether in common cause we joined together to win the Cold War. Now we face\nnew challenges, the threat of radical Islamic extremism, we\'re in two wars,\nwe were just discussing the Iranian threat and we have major challenges\nobviously to our economy and our children\'s\' future. I\'m trying to say that\nI\'m prepared to take on those challenges.\n\nHighlight #2\n*Lindsey Graham Invokes Hitler in Relation to Iran* (FNC 06/09/08 4:05pm)\nDAVID ASMAN: [\x85] is there any room for dialogue do we have to stand tough?\n\nLINDSEY GRAHAM: The dialogue has to be between the world community and Iran.\nWe have to be tough. The world should unite around the idea that this\nmissile testing along with Iran\'s refusal to abandon their nuclear weapons\nprogram presents a grave danger to the world. So the right solution to this\nproblem is not to sit down unilaterally with the Iranians and give them\nsomething. It is for the world to coalesce around the idea that Iran will\npunished if they move forward with their efforts to get a nuclear weapon and\nput it on top of the missile.\n\nASMAN: We do not have to give our man anything if we sit down and talk to\nthem.\n\nGRAHAM: What are you going to talk to them about?\n\n[long silence]\n\nASMAN: You cannot think of anything?\n\n*GRAHAM: No. [\x85] Talk does not matter to Iran. They will respond to action *and\nI do not want a military engagement with Iran. It would be a very difficult\ntask for us, the world at large, but talking is not going to work. What we\nneed to do is impose sanctions that will.\n\nThey depend on gasoline. The western world, China and Russia can change\nIranian behavior if we act. Talking will embolden *these people*. Acting\nwill deter them.\n\nASMAN: We just had a release of hostages in Venezuela and we had been in\nthis almost endless conversation. Hugo Chavez got in the middle of it. We\nhad been told time and time we have to sit down with the rebels. The sitting\ndown obviously did nothing but in power the rebels and Hugo Chavez at the\nsame time. Is there a similarity here in these situations?\n\nGRAHAM: Yeah, the Colombian president took matters into his own hand. They\ncame up with the military strategy that was marvelous [...]. *We sat down\nwith Hitler and it never worked. Give him one more country. Appease this\nguy. Talking with Iran is a form of appeasement.*\n\nWe need world action, not just United States action, not just Israeli\naction. The world needs to rally around the idea that we\' re not going to\nlet Iran get a nuclear weapon.\n\nASMAN: Would we support Israel if, on its own, it tried to take out those\nnuclear installations?\n\nGRAHAM: In my opinion there is time to avoid that choice. *Now is the time\nto act decisively* with the world, speaking with one voice, but here is the\nquestion for the world. Are we going to sit on the sidelines and allow a\nnuclear weapon and missile technology to start world war three? The answer\nto me is not.\n\nASMAN: Israel will not. The question is, will we support it if they act\nunilaterally?\n\nGRAHAM: It is my belief that the scenario of Israel attacking Iran is not a\ngood scenario for the world or Israel, *we need to avoid that if possible*.\nIf I\'m the Israeli prime minister I am not going to sit the sidelines and\nlisten to the rhetoric coming out of Iran, watch this weapons test and their\nnuclear program mature without doing something. The worst option in my\nopinion is to do nothing while you still can do something.\n\nHighlight #3\n*Matthews: McCain Sounds Like Cheney *(MSNBC 07/09/08 5:55pm)\nJOHN MCCAIN: We cannot allow a second Holocaust.\n\nCHRIS MATTHEWS: . . . a second Holocaust. Of course John McCain there this\nmorning referring to the test firing of the Iranians . . . Jill Zuckman, a\nsecond Holocaust, it looks to me like politics is in play here. Serious\npolitics.\n\nJILL ZUCKMAN: Well, Sen. McCain has taken a very hard line on Iran for a\nvery long time and one of the things he talks about is President\nAhmedinijad\'s own words. Calling Israel a, "stinking corpse," calling the\nHolocaust a "myth." He goes on and on ad on like that and Sen. McCain is\nvery clear that he doesn\'t think Iran should get any benefit of the doubt\nfrom the United States . . .\n\nMATTHEWS: . . . is this usual politics in America? . . . anything unusual\nabout it? Over the line? Within the line? Appropriate politics, whatever?\n\nJOAN WALSH: I think a little bit over the line. I mean, "second Holocaust"?\nCome on. Again, this is John McCain helping Barack Obama because he sounds\nlike a lunatic and he makes clear that he\'s running for Bush\'s third term.\nHe sounds like a neocon in the room with Cheney planning the next strike on\nIran. It\'s really beyond mainstream politics in my opinion.\n\n[. . .]\n\nMATTHEWS: Sometimes I do hear Dick Cheney talking when John McCain talks.\n\nWALSH: Absolutely.\n\n*Republicans in Senate Move Towards Obama\'s Position on Iran While McCain\nSticks With Bush *(MSNBC 07/09/08 5:07pm)\nCHRIS MATTHEWS: Here\'s Sen. McCain talking to Brian Williams . . .\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: This kind of progress and this kind of testing that the\nIranians are making is here and now and it cries out for collective action\nto cut off now the liens of credit that the Iranians are getting to cut off\nnow the trade and diplomatic activities . . . we\'re in a situation where we\nhave to act now . . . we can\'t just wait until next January to take\nmeaningful action.\n\nMATTHEWS: Andrea, I feel like one of those people with the earphones on\ntrying to figure out the translation there. What is the difference there\nbetween what Barack said and what McCain said?\n\nANDREA MITCHELL: Barack Obama is saying that we should have aggressive\ndiplomacy . . . John McCain is saying we need sanctions, economic\npunishment, diplomatic pressure on Iran, not diplomatic engagement.\n*Interestingly\nDick Luger, the Republican vice chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations\ncommittee during a hearing on Iran this afternoon agreed with Barack Obama .\n. . Luger and other Republicans are beginning to move to the side of those\nDemocrats . . . calling for some kind of diplomatic involvement with Iran\nwithout preconditions. The McCain position is identical to the Bush position\nbut it is not universally accepted within the Republican Party.*\n\nMATTHEWS: Let\'s talk about the politics on the home front. Everybody in\nAmerica, practically, roots for Israel in a general sense, obviously people\nthat are Jewish have a deeper commitment than most people. But there\'s also\na huge Christian conservative element in this country that\'s deeply\npro-Israeli. When John McCain made a statement, here, let\'s talk a look at\nwhat he said . . .\n\nMCCAIN: If Iran attacked Israel, I\'d have no doubt that the entire nation\nwould erupt in conflict. The Irani\x97the Iraqis would have to respond, as any\nnation does that\'s attacked and the entire region and the United States\nwould probably be drawn into the conflict . . .\n\nMATTHEWS: Sen. McCain also talked this morning about the possibility of a\nsecond Holocaust, that\'s certainly incendiary language politically.\n\nROGER SIMON: . . .Sen. McCain has used that as his argument for staying in\nIraq . . . we have to have a peacekeeping presence in the region otherwise\nwe face open warfare. The problem is, the other bite you showed, *Sen.\nMcCain calls for isolating Iran. The trouble with isolation is, once you\nisolate them, then what\'d you have left?*\n\nHighlight #4\n*On Iran \'Joke,\' Borger Says: That\'s Just McCain Being McCain* (CNN 07/09/08\n6:41pm)\nWOLF BLITZER: What do you make of Senator McCain joking\x97and it was clearly,\nhe was trying to be funny\x97when he said, you know the US is exporting a lot\nof cigarettes to Iran and he said maybe that\'s good \'cause they\'ll all die\nfrom the cigarettes then he quickly said, \'You know, I\'m just joking.\'\n\nDAVID BRODY: I mean, obviously McCain\'s critics will say he\'s got an itchy\ntrigger finger so clearly, a comment like that isn\'t gonna play well\ninitially, but let\'s take a step back here for a moment and go to\npre-implosion McCain. Remember that where he was the front-runner and a lot\nof people said that he was too guarded, that he was too close to the vest\nand he didn\'t really open up too much and he needed to get back to that\nstraight talk express.\n\nWell, you know, some of those moments are really gonna have to work for him\nto be successful. In other words, he may have a bomb like the one we\'re\ntalking about today and the \'Bomb [\x85] Iran\' one as well. That may backfire,\nbut, if he gets nine out of ten right, it actually could actually [sic] help\nhim a little bit.\n\nBLITZER: When you\'re running for president, you\'ve gotta have a filter.\n\nJACK CAFFERTY: Well, you know, the cigarettes are slower than \'bomb [\x85]\nIran\' as was just suggested. The essence of the story is that our sales of\nexports from this country to Iran are up more than ten-fold during the seven\nand a half years of the Bush administration. They\'ve gone from $8 million a\nyear to $150 million a year while President Bush stomps around, talking\ntough about sanctions.\n\n\'We gotta crack the whip. We gotta isolate Iran.\' We\'re selling \'em\ncigarettes and braziers and a whole bunch of other things to the tune of\nabout $150 billion a year. It\'s a hypocrisy with a capitol HIP.\n\n[\x85]\n\nGLORIA BORGER: *I say let McCain be McCain.* *This is who John McCain is and\nyou knew it was real because his wife started jabbing him in the back,\ntelling him to be quiet and this is John McCain. The public ought to get to\nknow who he is.*\n\nHighlight #5\n*Tom Delay Expresses Classic Liberal Views on Deficit, Declares Willingness\nto Bomb Iran *(MSNBC 07/09/08 5:07pm)\nCHRIS MATTHEWS: Let me ask you about your Republican party which you have\nfought so hard and some people would say over the top in winning for  . . .\nTom Davis . . . he said if the Republican Party were a dog food, it would be\ntaken off the shelves right now, is it that bad?\n\nTOM DELAY: It\'s pretty bad and I\'m done pointing fingers . . .\n\nMATTHEWS: A lot of people would say the biggest thing that went wrong with\nthe Republican party wasn\'t the personality of this president or ther war in\nIraq but the fact that Republicans weren\'t Republicans, they ran up big\nspending in the last seven years . . .\n\nDELAY: We did balance the budget, back in the 90s\x97\n\nMATTHEWS: I\'m talking about the last eight years. Did you know the national\ndebt has gone from 6,000,000,000,000 to 10,000,000,000,000?\n\nDELAY: And we fought a war.\n\nMATTHEWS: I know. 4 trillion. That didn\'t all go to the war.\n\nDELAY: Almost 1 trillion of it is the war.\n\nMATTHEWS: 4. Trillion.\n\nDELAY: Yup.\n\nMATTHEWS: The world economy\'s 50 trillion. We owe 10 trillion.\n\nDELAY: I understand but as a percentage of GDP it has grown a little but\x97\n\nMATTHEWS: What are you, John Kenneth Galbraith?\n\nDELAY: No.\n\nMATTHEWS: Those are the old liberal arguments, it\'s a percentage of GDP. You\ndon\'t think overspending has been a problem for the Republicans?\n\nDELAY: The perception of overspending has been a problem for Republicans.\nAnd it\'s a bad problem for the Republicans . . . it\'s not spending, it\'s\nredefining government, we need to go back to constitutional principles that\ngo back to our base . . . they want to see leadership, and they\'re starting\nto do that. Whether our members can do that by \'08, I don\'t know . . .\n\nMATTHEWS: Do you think we\'re going to go to war before the election?\n\nDELAY: I think it\'s possible.\n\nMATTHEWS: . . . Olmert\'s got a weak government in Israel. He might . . .\nfeel in a position to show his strength? . . . we may decide, Dick Cheney\nmay say, influence the president, say, if Israel has to attack, it\'ll take\nthem two thousand sorties to do the job, we can do it in a day, why don\'t we\ndo it clean and get it over with because we\'ll get blamed anyway?\n\nDELAY: And particularly if Obama is the next president.\n\nMATTHEWS: Tell me what you think as a conservative hawk, do you think we\nshould move over there--\n\nDELAY: Absolutely.\n\nMATTHEWS: --between now and the election?\n\nDELAY: We should\'ve moved a lot earlier.\n\nMATTHEWS: What should we do?\n\nDELAY: First and foremost we should blockade Iran, quit dallying around in\nall this diplomatic and sanctions . . .\n\n[. . .]\n\nDELAY: We should never take a military strike off the table.\n\nMATTHEWS: What if Olmert calls up you and says, "should I go?"\n\nDELAY: I\'d say go.
