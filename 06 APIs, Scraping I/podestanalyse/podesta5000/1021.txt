john.podesta@gmail.comb"John --\n\nI have one question for you:\n\nIf you're with me in this election, will you say it right now?\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/In9\n\nEvery day I'm reminded of how much more there is to do, \nand how hard we have to fight if we want to finish the job \nwe started four years ago.\n\nThe other side will have more money. They'll have more \nof the powerful interests and outside groups supporting \nthem in this race.\n\nWe do this differently, just like we have from the beginning -- \nrelying on millions of Americans who are stepping up to \nplay a role.\n\nThis is my last campaign, and I intend to fight as hard as \nit takes.\n\nBut I can't do this alone.\n\nLet me know you're with me:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/In9\n\nThank you,\n\nBarack\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Obama for America\n\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo update your address, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/change-address?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe from these messages, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscription\nTo contact the campaign with any questions or concerns, go to: http://www.barackobama.com/contact-us\n\n"
