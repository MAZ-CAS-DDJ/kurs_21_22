Corsi shot to the top of the best-seller lists as co-author of \x93Unfit for Command,\x94 the book attacking Senator John Kerry\x92s record on a Vietnam War Swift boat that began the larger, damaging campaign against Mr. Kerry\x92s war credentials as he sought the presidency.\n\nAlmost exactly four years after that campaign began, Mr. Corsi has released a new attack book painting Senator Barack Obama as a stealth radical liberal who has tried to cover up \x93extensive connections to Islam\x94 \x97 Mr. Obama is Christian \x97 and questioning whether Mr. Obama\x92s admitted experimentation with drugs during high school and college ever ceased.\n\nSignificant portions of the book, released by Threshold Editions, a division of Simon & Schuster that has as its chief editor, Mary Matalin, the former Republican operative turned publisher-pundit, have already been challenged as misleading or false in the days since it made its debut on Aug. 1.\n\nBut it is to make its first appearance on The New York Times best-seller list for nonfiction hardcovers this Sunday \x97 at No. 1. The book is pushed along by a large volume of bulk sales, intense voter interest in Senator Obama and an aggressive marketing campaign that already has included 100 author interviews with talk radio hosts across the country, like Sean Hannity and G. Gordon Liddy, Mr. Corsi said on Tuesday.\n\nIt is a significant, early success for Ms. Matalin\x92s three-year-old imprint, Threshold Editions, which is also planning to publish the memoirs of Karl Rove, President Bush\x92s longtime political guru. The publishing house says it has undertaken an aggressive printing effort for anticipated demand, with 475,000 copies of \x93The Obama Nation\x94 produced so far.\n\n\x93The goal is to defeat Obama,\x94 Mr. Corsi said in a telephone interview. \x93I don\x92t want Obama to be in office.\x94 He said he was also planning to assist several conservative groups that intend to run advertisements against Mr. Obama this fall, though he would not name them. Mr. Corsi, who has over the years written critically about Senator John McCain as well, said he supported the Constitution Party presidential nominee, Chuck Baldwin, and had not been in touch with McCain aides. He called his reporting on Mr. Obama, which he stands by, \x93investigative,\x94 not prosecutorial.\n\nMs. Matalin said in an interview that the book \x93was not designed to be, and does not set out to be, a political book,\x94 calling it, rather, \x93a piece of scholarship, and a good one at that.\x94 She said she was unaware of efforts to link the book to any anti-Obama advertising.\n\nIn its timing, authorship and style of reportage, the book is strikingly reminiscent of the book that Mr. Corsi wrote with his co-author, John O\x92Neill, about Mr. Kerry, \x93Unfit for Command,\x94 which included various charges that were ultimately undermined by news reports pointing out the contradictions. (Some critics against Mr. Kerry quoted in the book had earlier praised his bravery in incidents they were charging he had fabricated; one of them had earned a medal for bravery in a gun battle he accused Mr. Kerry of concocting.)\n\nBut books like \x93Unfit for Command,\x94 which remained for some 12 weeks on the Times best-seller list, and, now, \x93The Obama Nation,\x94 have become an effective and favored delivery system for political attacks. There have been anti-Clinton (both Bill and Hillary) and anti-Bush tomes too numerous to name. The sensational findings in these books, whether dubious or true, can quickly come to dominate the larger political discussion in the media, especially on cable television and the less readily detectible confines of talk radio and partisan Web sites.\n\nFact-checking the books can require extensive labor and time from independent journalists, whose work often trails behind the media echo chamber.\n\nWeb sites on the left have begun poring over Mr. Corsi\x92s latest book. Media Matters, which is run by David Brock, a former right-wing journalist who wrote a classic of the genre, \x93The Real Anita Hill,\x94 has been particularly aggressive in fact-checking the book, and its press releases on inaccuracies in the book have gotten some attention on television programs on cable.\n\nSeveral of the book\x92s charges, in fact, are unsubstantiated, misleading or inaccurate.\n\nFor instance, Mr. Corsi writes that Mr. Obama had \x93yet to answer\x94 whether he \x93stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college, or whether his drug usage extended to his law school days or beyond,\x94 asking, \x93How about in the U.S. Senate?\x94\n\nBut Mr. Obama, who admitted to occasional marijuana and cocaine use during his high school and early college years, wrote in his memoir that he had \x93stopped getting high\x94 when he moved to New York in the early 1980s. And in an interview in 2003 with The State Journal-Register of Springfield, Ill., he said in response to questions of his drug use, \x93By the time I was 20, I don\x92t think I indulged again.\x94\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Corsi said Mr. Obama\x92s word was not to be trusted because \x93self-reporting, by people who have used drugs, as to when they stopped is inherently unreliable.\x94\n\nIn exploring Mr. Obama\x92s denials that he had been present for the more incendiary sermons of his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Mr. Corsi cites a report in the conservative Web site NewsMax.com that Mr. Obama had attended a sermon on July 22, 2007, in which Mr. Wright blamed \x93the \x91white arrogance\x92 of America\x92s Caucasian majority for the world\x92s suffering, especially the oppression of blacks.\x94 Mr. Obama was giving a speech in Florida that afternoon, and his campaign reported he had not attend Mr. Wright\x92s church that day. William Kristol, a columnist for The New York Times, had cited the same report in a column, but issued a correction. \x93There is a dispute about the date, and Kristol chose to side with Obama,\x94 Mr. Corsi said. \x93We can nitpick the date to death,\x94 Mr. Corsi said, saying his \x93fundamental point\x94 was Mr. Obama\x92s close association with someone ascribing to \x93black liberation theology\x94 like Mr. Wright.\n\nMr. Corsi described most of the critiques of his book as \x93nitpicking,\x94 like a contradiction of his claim in the book that Mr. Obama had failed to dedicate his book \x93Dreams of My Father\x94 to his family; Mr. Obama dedicated the book to several family members, in the introduction. He called the Media Matters critique inconsequential because it was forwarding a liberal, political agenda.\n\nMedia Matters was created in part to answer a conservative \x93echo chamber\x94 \x97 one that liberal activists say they have still yet to match \x97 that gives books like Mr. Corsi\x92s extra bounce. \x93There\x92s just no doubt that in terms of longer term infrastructure, there\x92s more out there on the right than there is on the left,\x94 said Cliff Schecter, author of a liberal attack book on Mr. McCain, \x93The Real McCain,\x94 which, with 35,000 copies in print, did not hit The New York Times bestseller list.\n\nMr. Obama\x92s campaign has yet to weigh in heavily on the charges itself in Mr. Corsi\x92s book, appearing to face the classic decision between the risk of publicizing the book\x92s claims by addressing them and the risk of letting them sink into the public debate with no response.\n\n\x93This book is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited, written by an individual who was discredited after he wrote a similar book to help George Bush and Dick Cheney get reelected four years ago,\x94 said Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Mr. Obama. \x93We will respond to these smears forcefully, with all means necessary.\x94\n\nSeveral Democrats associated with Mr. Kerry\x92s campaign in 2004 said in interviews Tuesday that they were comfortable so far with Mr. Obama\x92s more muted response to the book, which has not showed up yet in television advertisements.\n\nEven Mr. Corsi said this book did not have what \x93Unfit for Command\x94 had: a built-in interest group, the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, to run advertisements against its target.\n\nWhile he said he thought it was a certainty that he would be \x93assisting in the creation of ads in the fall,\x94 he did not say what he believed their content would be.\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
