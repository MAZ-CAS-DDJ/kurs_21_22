That's why shady special interest groups will be targeting Cheri, ready to spend HUGE amounts of cash to buy this seat.\n\nIf we are going to win a Democratic majority against the right-wing establishment and all the cash that goes with it, Cheri needs to have a huge showing for Monday's big FEC fundraising deadline. Will you help her do it?\n\nPlease help Cheri have a strong grassroots showing by giving $5 or more before Monday's critical fundraising deadline >>\nhttp://action.cheribustos.com/september25-1\n\nEvery dollar counts, so we need every one of you to step up and give whatever you can.\n\nPlease dig deep for Cheri:\n\nhttp://action.cheribustos.com/september25-1\n\nSteve\n\nRep.
