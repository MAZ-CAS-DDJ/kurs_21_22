The early Congressional votes\non the Vietnam and Iraq wars were lopsided affairs as Members took the bait\nthat a vote against administration policy is a vote against our troops. With\nthis vote, it\'s clear that a majority of Congressional Democrats understand\nthat establishing a clear mission that includes a strategy for getting our\ntroops home is necessary to support and protect the men and women we\'re\nsending into harm\'s way. Endless war is not.\n\nOn the other hand, the glass is half empty: Congressman McGovern\'s proposal\nwas very modest. It did not proscribe what the exit strategy should be or on\nwhat time-line it should be accomplished. It simply required the\nadministration to come up with one. As Congressman McGovern argued on the\nfloor today: "This should not be controversial." How does something that\ndoes what the president himself told a national television audience last\nmonth was needed in Afghanistan go down to defeat in the House? How does one\noppose such a reasonable and modest proposal?\n\nSimple. You find yourself under pressure from your party leadership-be it\nDemocratic or Republican-and the administration. Leaders on both sides of\nthe aisle pulled out all the stops to defeat this measure. The Democratic\nand Republican leaders of both the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs\nCommittees lobbied hard. They circulated a letter from all four leaders of\nthe committees imploring a no vote while the debate was underway on the\nHouse floor. The administration enlisted the direct engagement of Secretary\nof State Clinton and Ambassador Holbrooke to convince Members to say no. The\npresident may believe in the necessity of an exit strategy for US forces in\nAfghanistan but his administration is loathe to actually come up with one.\n\nThe McGovern amendment may have come up short today, but nevertheless count\nme in the glass-half-full camp. Winning the House Democratic Caucus on an\nissue opposed by Democratic leadership and the White House is no small feat.\nIndeed, it is hard to vote against the position of a president who you so\ndesperately want to succeed. But this is precisely why many did just that.\nThey do not want to see this administration-and all of the hope and promise\nthat it brings-mired in an endless war that ends in a disaster for all. The\nvery real prospect that the escalation of our forces in Afghanistan will\nmake things much worse and not better is why 80% of Afghans oppose it.\n\nOur congratulations and thanks go to Congressman McGovern (D-MA),\nCongressman Walter Jones (R-NC), Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-Ca), and\nCongresswoman Chellie Pingree (D-ME), the lead sponsors of this amendment.\nThey deserve our thanks not only for taking a principled stand on an\nimportant and controversial issue, but for going to work to make this a\nsignificant vote - one that will stand as a marker for the struggle ahead.\nCome to think of it, with friends like these in Congress, our glasses are\nmore than half full.\n\nNow, back to work.\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
