I am seeking a double degree in\nPolitical Theory/Constitutional Democracy and Social Relations/Policy with\na minor in Public Relations. While here at Michigan State University, I am\naffiliated with College Democrats, the Alexander Hamilton Society, Common\nSense Action, and much more.\n\n\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton, formally, announced her bid for the 2016 Presidential\nElection I was beyond excited and began to think on how I can help her get\ninto office. I have developed a proposal that I hope can be set in action\nby fall of this year:\n\n\n\n*I propose that Hillary Clinton open a Michigan Campaign Office, and I\nwould be happy to run it. *\n\n\n\nRunning for President of the United States is an intense job that requires\nthe assistance of willing citizens across the nation. You may think that I\nam just a college student and there is no way that I can run a campaign\noffice, but I am sure that my experience will remove that doubt.\n\n\n\nThroughout my high school career (all 4 years) I served as a\ndistrict/campaign intern for my State Representative - Stacy Erwin Oakes.\nThis position included: extensive communication with constituents (phone,\nemail, face-to-face), canvassing, attending coffee hours, attending\npolitical meetings, *helping run the office*, and much more.\n\n\n\nOnce I came to Michigan State I served as a legislative intern (1 year) for\nState Representative Adam Zemke. My duties included: extensive\ncommunication with constituents (phone, email, face-to-face), research and\nanalysis on laws/bills. briefing, attending committee meetings, attending\nsession, making tributes, and scheduling.\n\n\n\nI am currently working on a large project that will help benefit the state\nof Michigan: Washtenaw community will soon accept President Obama\'s\ncall-to-action called My Brother\'s Keeper. Representative Zemke and I are\njust getting started but we have laid out the foundation to accepting this\ncall to action  - setting up meetings, drafting bills, and making sure it\nis in the budget.\n\n\n\nIf I have not sold you yet it is probably due to my lack of Washington\nexperience, but that is soon to come. I am pleased to have secured\n*two *internships\non Capitol Hill this summer. For the first half - May and June - I will\nserve as a press intern in Congressman Kildee\'s Office. For the second half\n- July and August - I am pleased to be a legislative intern in Senator\nStabenow\'s Office.\n\n\n\nWhen I tell people that I will help get Hillary Clinton into office, they\ntell me there is no way that she will make it. I do not take rejection very\nwell and when people tell me that it makes me want to work *twice *as hard\nto do my job. If this proposal is accepted, you will receive nothing but\nthe best from me. To conclude, as you can see, I will be in Washington for\nthe entire summer so if you would like to schedule a time to meet/discuss\nmy thoughts in more depth I would be glad to do so.\n\n\n\nThank you for reading my email and enjoy your day!\n\n\nRonald E.
