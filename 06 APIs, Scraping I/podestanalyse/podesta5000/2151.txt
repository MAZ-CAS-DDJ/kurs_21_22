john.podesta@gmail.comb'<!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="content" -->Can I count on you?\n\nWe\'re just 317 donors away from reaching our grassroots\ndonor goal by the January 31st deadline.\n\nHere\'s why that matters: I\'ve been fighting for economic \nopportunities for the middle class and standing up to extreme \nright-wing forces for thirty years  - and if I learned one thing,\nit\'s that in elections like this one, the side with the most \ngrassroots support always emerges victorious. \n\nWill you make a $5 donation today and make sure\nwe don\'t fall short?\n\nhttps://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/8102/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=7874\n\nThe stakes are higher than ever -- just look at who is on\nthe other side of this fight.\n\nThe people bankrolling Ken Cuccinelli\'s campaign are the\nsame big donors who funded some of the most extreme Tea\nParty candidates in 2012: Rick Santorum, Todd Akin, and\nAllen West.\n\nAll three of those extremists lost because Democratic\ngrassroots support overcame conservative SuperPAC spending.\n\nThat\'s how we won in 2012. And it\'s how we\'ll win this year.\n\nMake a $5 donation today and make sure we hit\nour goal.\n\nhttps://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/8102/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=7874\n\nIf you have my back now, I\'ll have your back for the next \nfour years.\n\nThanks, \nTerry\n\n\n\n------\n\nOn Sat, Jan 19, 2013 at 12:36 PM, Robby Mook\n<info@terrymcauliffe.com> wrote:\n\n\nWhat do the Koch Brothers (the people who\'ve spent tens of\nmillions advancing the Tea Party agenda), Foster Friess (the\nRick Santorum mega-donor who said that in lieu of birth\ncontrol women should put aspirin between their knees), and\nPhyllis Schlafly (who doesn\'t think women should work\noutside the home) have in common? \n\nAnswer: They\'re all funding Ken Cuccinelli\'s campaign.\n\nThis is what we\'re up against. While we\'re building a\ngrassroots movement of people who care about the future of\nVirginia, Cuccinelli is relying on donations from special\ninterest groups and wealthy champions of the Tea Party\nmovement. We can defeat these people, but we need your help.\n\nMake a $5 donation today and help us reach our\ngoal of 500 more donors to Terry\'s campaign by the end of\nthe month. It\'s not surprising these extremists are coming\nto Ken Cuccinelli\'s aid:\n\nhttps://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/8102/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=7874\n\nThis guy is the Tea Party\'s dream candidate. \n\nThe Washington Post said he\'s been "the most overtly \npartisan Attorney General in Virginia\'s history" who "has\nwaged war on Obamacare, harassed climate-change scientists, \nsanctioned discrimination against homosexuals and embraced \nArizona\'s (now mostly gutted) immigration law." Just \nimagine the harm he\'d cause to Virginia if he got to be \nGovernor.\n\nCan you help stop Ken Cuccinelli by making a donation today?\nWe need to add 500 new donors by the January 31st deadline, and \neven $5 will make a big difference:\n\nhttps://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/8102/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=7874\n\nJust last year, we saw what can happen when tens of\nthousands of concerned citizens stand together against a\nsmall group of conservative billionaires who want to elevate\nthe most extreme candidates they can find into power.\n\nI know that if we join together, we can do it again -- and\nmake Terry McAuliffe our next Governor.\n\nRobby Mook \nCampaign Manager \nTerry McAuliffe for Governor\n\n\nDONATE NOW: https://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/8102/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=7874\n\n_______________\n\nThis message was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.
