I will\npublish it on New America's Medium channel, but wanted to send it to you\ndirectly. I think it is very much a part of what you are about.\nBest,\nAM\n\n\n A New America\n\n Today was the Memorial Day parade in Princeton. It was a postcard day; the\nsky a deep blue, the sun sparkling, the air sharp with an invigorating\nspring chill. I walked into town to get my hair done and happened to follow\nthe parade route, which starts just near our house. After a couple of\nblocks, passing the firetrucks, the motorcycle riders, the marching bands,\nthe kids, tears began streaming down my cheeks. Tears of joy, and of that\nemotion that I have recently learned only older people can experience -\npoignancy. That bittersweet feeling of happiness and sadness combined:\npleasure in the present mixed with awareness of loss, the fragility of the\nmoment, the ever-marching passage of time.\n\nThe tears came in part because of the achingly wonderful small-townness of\nit all. The parade included the fife and drum corps of local musketeers,\nLittle League teams, the 4H club, cub scouts and Eagle scouts, the local\nchapter of the New Jersey national guard. And the crowds on the sidewalks\nwere overwhelmingly families, parents and grandparents pushing strollers\nand keeping excited toddlers and elementary school kids close. Older\ncouples too, holding hands, and periodically a knot of veterans honoring\nthe day. The police kept order at intersections, smiling with the crowd.\n\nMy emotions may have been particularly strong because I am tired.  I flew\nto Malaysia and back this week to give a speech, a four-day marathon that\nturned into five because of one delayed flight that led to a cascade of\nrescheduling. That kind of travel wreaks havoc on the body and disorients\nthe mind, hours working on a screen in a darkened airline cabin, sleeping\nin snatches when it is noon at your destination but midnight at home, being\nserved breakfast at the end of one flight just before landing only to take\noff again on a red-eye to get home. To be finally in my own bed again last\nnight was particularly sweet, a sensation of being *home *that perhaps\npainted the parade and my neighbors in brighter and more intense colors\nthan usual.\n\nBut I think it was more than that. For so much of my trip the narrative in\nmy head was a steady drumbeat of worry about the mess America is in\ncompared to Asia. The gleaming airports of Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur, in\nwhich customs, immigration, and security lines move far more quickly and\nefficiently than here (the Malaysians use much more advanced technology for\nfingerprinting than we do). The ubiquitous, fast and free public wifi. The\nexpress train that got me from the Hong Kong terminal to downtown in 20\nsilent, swift minutes. The sense of hope and possibility expressed by\neveryone from drivers to bellboys.\n\nWhen I landed at Kennedy on Friday morning, the usual endless lines for\ncustoms and immigration were relatively short and the long walk from the\njetway to the terminal itself was through a corridor that was less\ndilapidated than usual. But then it took longer to get from the\ninternational terminal to my Delta flight to DC than the duration of the\nsubsequent flight: an endless and stupid merry-go-round of taking an air\ntrain to one terminal to check in and go through our cumbersome and\ninefficient airport security system to get to a set of gates that led me to\ncreaky makeshift stairways and an aging bus that took us to yet another\nterminal and another set of gates before finally boarding the plane, with\nno wifi available, much less free. And then my regular weekly commute on\nAmtrak, which is surprising when the train is on time rather than when it\nisn't, and is so bumpy that it is almost impossible to walk between the\ncars even without carrying something, where in the winter the snow comes in\nbetween the cars and the doors freeze - all this even without the specter\nof last week's tragic crash.\n\nThe Memorial Day parade was not efficient or teched up. Princeton is a\nwealthy town, but the parade route wended its way past a long-boarded up\nformer video rental store and many little restaurants and stores that\nchange hands every couple of years as small business owners realize they\ncannot make a go of it. But what hit me over and over again, watching the\nmarchers, was the tremendous inclusion. The scout groups and marching bands\nhad kids of every color. One group of baton twirlers featured a heavy girl\nwith light purple hair who certainly would never had made the cut when I\nwent to school. Several of the white grandparents I saw were pushing\ngrandkids of different races. A number of the families watching had two\nmothers or two fathers. Equally important, as I age, was to see how many of\nthe participants were older Americans - veterans, of course, but also\nteachers, coaches and bandleaders investing their time in kids.\n\nThe stores lining the parade route were owned by Mexican-Americans,\nIndian-Americans, Chinese-Americans. When I finally got to my hairdresser,\na Moroccan immigrant named Aziz who is practically part of our family, he\nand I discussed the horrors of ISIS from the perspective of someone who\nhates the damage it is doing to Islam. When I moved on to my local branch\nof Bank of America, I looked up to hear an older white male bank manager\nengaging in a long discussion with a client in fluent Spanish.\n\nThis is the new America. The United States has always been an immigrant\nnation;  the original colonists created a political entity composed of\ncitizens who had dispossessed the native Americans who were already here.\nFor centuries our narrative was one of absorption: the melting pot that\ndissolved old identities and cultures and forged a homogeneous national\nnarrative. Then it was multi-culturalism, a mosaic of different pieces. Now\nit is *inclusion*: genuine belonging in the one whole of *e pluribus unum *but\nwithout dissolution of the differences that make us strong. Because it is\nall those differences -- old and young; black and white and every color in\nbetween; Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and many more; gay and\nstraight; men, women, and transgender; old families and immigrants - that\ncreates the energy and creativity of multiple perspectives and experiences.\nDifference provides a thick, many-layered quality to our society that makes\nit much more difficult to march efficiently together in one direction but\nthat ensures a deep resilience when troubles come.\n\n If we can learn, once again, to embrace both difference and inclusion as\nthe heart of what being American means, we will be able to celebrate an\nAfrican-American president and elect a woman president. Better still, we\nwill launch a century of leaders of every race, religion, gender, and\nsexual orientation who will no longer need hyphenated adjectives to\nidentify what kind of American they are. They will be new Americans,\ncitizens of a renewed America.\n"
