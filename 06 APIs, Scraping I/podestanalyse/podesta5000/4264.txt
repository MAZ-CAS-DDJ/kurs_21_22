I am so glad to see you in the trenches for HRC.\n\nI recently learned that I\'m a finalist to become a Fellow at New America, which funds bold thinkers and writers. I submitted a proposal for a book I want to write on social discounting, short-term metrics, and long-term thinking in the era of big data. (Working title: The Gambler\'s Telescope.)\n\nThe finalist field this year is fiercely competitive. The team at New America just told me that they would like to call references for me next week.\n\nI would be deeply grateful if you were willing to support me.  If you\'d like to get a sense of what I\'m pursuing, here\'s a recent think piece I wrote that hits one angle of the book: https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2015/05/16/the-race-preserve-disappearing-data/0KPHAx5iK6jaLIvWQqIl4O/story.html\n\nThe book will span many topics beyond this, including climate change, antibiotic resistance, the management of tech companies and NBA teams like the Spurs vs. the Bulls.\n\nWould it be OK to give them your name and if so, a good number to reach you?\n\nThank you for considering this amid your many commitments to making the world better. I hope to reconnect with both of you in person soon.\n\nWarm regards,\nBina\n917.691.8056<tel:917.691.8056>\n\n'
