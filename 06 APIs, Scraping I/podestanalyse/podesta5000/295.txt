I want to keep climate central to the national security debate.  Matt Browne is keen to aim high on Global Progress and I'd like to discuss our ideas with you more in May. Ken Gude and I will follow up as we learn more about AUMF moves on the Hill.\n\nYou insights on the team and some individual dynamics were extremely helpful.\n\nAll the best,\n\nVikram\n\nVikram J. Singh\nVice President\nNational Security and International Policy\nCenter for American Progress\n\n"
