john.podesta@gmail.comb'Jake,\r\nI just had dinner this week with  Zalman Shoval, who was twice Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. (1990-93 and 1998-2000), and is a keen observer of the Palestinian issue. He does not think a third intifada is likely, but that there will be persistent, uncoordinated, random acts of violence. Of course, an incident could lead to greater violence, particularly since the Prime Minister has given great latitude for the use of force in suppressing violence.  But, basically, the Palestinian leadership\xe2\x80\x99s strategy is unilateral actions to isolate Israel and elevate the Palestinian cause, in the UN, ICJ, and with various BDS strategies, including the EU on West Bank labeling, rather than a third intifada. Moreover, given the enormous disruption in the region, the Palestinian people do not seem to have an appetitive for a major disruption.\r\n\r\nThat having been said, I am starting work on an op-ed on a \xe2\x80\x9cPlan B\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cpeaceful coexistence\xe2\x80\x9d, under the assumption that the peace process is stalled for the medium term and that greater economic development and opportunity for the Palestinians is good for them, good for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security, and will reduce the risk of a third intifada. In the Clinton Administration, I was responsible for the economic dimensions of the peace process, which led to a QIZ in Gaza, the Gaza airport, a huge increase in Palestinian workers in Israel, some 20,000 Palestinian business leaders with passes to come into Israel, etc. New steps could include more vetted Palestinian workers coming into Israel (at the height it was around 100,000, of which 50,000 were legal and the balance tolerated); fewer checkpoints in the West Bank (I have a friend, David Harman, the son of Abe Harman, one of the first Israeli Ambassadors to the U.S. and then long-time president of Hebrew University), who teaches at Bard College, Hebrew University and al-Quds University in the West Bank. He tells me it takes some of his students 2 to 3 hours to get to classes: QIZs in the West Bank (there are none now, although there are about a dozen in Jordan and several in Egypt), which allow duty free treatment for goods produced in the QIZ, with as little as 10% Israeli content); more Palestinian construction permitted in Zone B and C, and transfer of some land from B and C to Zone A; greater Western/US assistance and development (it is unclear what happened to Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s pledge of $ billion).\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n\r\nStu\r\n\r\nFrom: Jake Sullivan [mailto:jake.sullivan@gmail.com]\r\nSent: Friday, October 09, 2015 9:11 AM\r\nTo: Eizenstat, Stuart\r\nCc: John.Podesta@gmail.com; huma@hrcoffice.com\r\nSubject: Re: Women in the workforce\r\n\r\nStu -- will take a look.  And will follow up on the other issues.  How worried are you about a third intifada or something similar?\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Oct 8, 2015 at 11:50 PM, Eizenstat, Stuart <seizenstat@cov.com<mailto:seizenstat@cov.com>> wrote:\r\nDear Jake,\r\n\r\nThere is an excellent piece in today\'s (October 8) Washington Post by Danielle Paquette, "Rising in Japan\'s Workforce: Women, A8) which describes the pro-female/family policy on paid maternity leave and paternity leave in Japan, day care, etc.n and the dramatic impact it has had in just a few years on female employment and income. By comparison, 43 million American workers have no paid leave. Hillary may have already spoken to this issue, but it would a great pro-family, pro-female issue to highlight in the debate.\r\n\r\nLet me know if there are any way I can help by reviewing q\'s and a\'s on Iran, Israel, Syria, etc.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\nStu Eizenstat\r\n\r\n'
