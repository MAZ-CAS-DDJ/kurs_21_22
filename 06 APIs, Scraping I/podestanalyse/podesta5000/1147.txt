Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, are tiny countries and not a serious threat.\nAnd he also said, very specifically, that he would cut tens of billions of\ndollars of defense spending, cut investments in missile defense, and slow\nthe development of future combat systems. This is your area of expertise\nSenator, why would that not be a good plan?\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: Well, again, I think Senator Obama has had no experience with\neither national security nor the specifics of how we can best defend this\nnation and secure a better future for our children and grandchildren, and\nthat of course means how we equip, and how we train. And how we have an\noverall strategy. I don\'t think Senator Obama knows much about our defense\nsystems, because he\'s never had any background on it. But more importantly,\nwhen he does not support the mission that General Petraeus outlined and that\nhas succeeded, and fails, absolute fails to recognize that he was wrong when\nhe opposed the surge, said it wouldn\'t work, it would lead to increases in\nethnic violence, etc. So you have to start from an overall strategy and then\nequip the military with the tools necessary to implement that strategy. He\ndoes not understand the strategy, either there or in Afghanistan. And to sit\ndown with those three dictators you talked about, the Castro Brothers, Hugo\nChavez, or Ahmadinejad, without preconditions, obviously is an incredibly\nnaive approach to these challenges.\n\nHANNITY: Both of you have used the term, wave the white flag, or surrender.\nWe would have lost if he had his way.\n\nSARAH PALIN: Barrack Obama has not understood that, I said this in my\ndebate, you don\'t have to believe me, the hockey mom from Alaska proclaiming\nthat the war in terror in our central front there has been Iraq, but please\nbelieve General Petraeus, an American hero. Please, unfortunately, you got\nto believe even Bin Laden, the terrorists, who have claimed too that the war\non terror, the central front there, has been in Iraq. So to retreat from\nthere, and allow them to get back in there, and build more strongholds, is ,\nI say beyond na\xefve, and that is what Barack Obama has chosen his position.\n\nHANNITY: Beyond na\xefve, beyond irresponsible, dangerous for the American\npeople.\n\nPALIN: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: So if he\'s elected president, he would be a dangerous president,\nbecause of his judgment?\n\nPALIN: If we were to withdraw prematurely from Iraq, we put our country in\ndanger.\n\nMCCAIN: Let me just tell you just a brief vitiate that\'s really insightful\nabout Senator Obama\'s attitude. When General Petraeus came back to testify\nfor the first time, and the Democrats and some Republicans were doing\neverything that they could to force a date for withdrawal, this is about the\ntime when Senator Obama voted against further funding of the troops in\nAfghanistan and Iraq.  MoveOn.org, one of the real base supporters of\nSenator Obama ran a big ad in the New York Times, it had a picture of\nGeneral Petraeus, and the title underneath his picture was General Petraeus\nor General Betray Us? Here\'s a guy who served his nation for 35 years, one\nof the great generals in American history, and Senator Obama and MoveOn.org\nruns an ad questioning his loyalty. We were very unhappy, to say the least.\nSo we proposed a resolution on the floor of the Senate condemning that\nquestioning of the loyalty and patriotism of a great American. Senator Obama\nwas in the Democrat cloak room. He refused to come out and vote. He refused\nto come out and vote to condemn that resolution, just like in the State\nSenate of Illinois, he voted present 120 times. In this case, he didn\'t even\ncome out of the cloak room to vote, to condemn a direct attack on the\nloyalty of one of America\'s great leaders.\n\n\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-_UbJj8aVE>\n\n*Highlight #2*\n\n*McCain Interviewed on FNC: Says Lindsey Graham is his adoptive son,\nExplains His Housing Mortgage Bailout plan, and how he has never lied or\nmislead the American people *(FNC, 10/09/08, 9:24pm)\n\nSEAN HANNITY: You had a big debate last night, how do you feel?\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: Good, good, raised some, a lot of good issues. And they asked\nsome questions that Senator Obama had no answer to. Whether it be the fines\nthat small business people are going to have to pay, or whether it is he\nactually wants $160 billion in new spending. And of course, taxes, his plan\nincreases taxes on 50 percent of small business income. So he had no\nresponse, so I\'m glad, most importantly last night Americas are hurting,\nthey need help now, and we ought to go out and buy up this bad home loan\nmortgages, get them at the level they are actually valued at, and let people\nstay in their homes.\n\nHANNITY: That was a new proposal last night, that you came up with. When you\nlook at the world markets, and they\'re suffering, is it sort of a ripple\neffect for the American economy? Do you see it stabilizing at some point in\nthe near future?\n\nMCCAIN: I do Sean, but I also strongly feel is that, as we all know, that\nthe home values have to stabilize. We have to stabilize that. We go out and\nwe buy up these bad loans, these bad mortgages, and give them back to people\nat levels that they can afford and pay for, then we can stabilize this\nhousing market. Then I\'m confident that we can start back up.\n\nHANNITY: [\x85] Now on the personal level, so you\'ve got your daughter, you\'ve\ngot your wife, then you got this guy [Lindsey Graham], I don\'t know where\nhe\'s from.\n\nMCCAIN: I\'m going to adopt him.\n\nHANNITY: You\'re adoptive family.\n\nMCCAIN: He\'s our adopted son, but we still haven\'t been able to reform some\nof his habits, which we won\'t go into detail about.\n\nHANNITY: [\x85] A lot of cities, a lot of travel.\n\nMCCAIN: Yeah, but what an experience. It\'s once in a lifetime. [\x85] The\nenthusiasm that Sarah Palin has ignited out there. She\'s a marvelous, she\ninspires me! She really does. And she [Cindy McCain] inspires me, he\n[Lindsey Graham] depresses me.\n\nHANNITY: You\'ve become good friends now.\n\nCINDY MCCAIN: Oh yes, we have a lot in common because of the military, it\'s\na great bond between mothers. And more importantly, she is a perfect fit for\nJohn. She\'s a reformer, she\'s a straight talker, she\'s just all about what\'s\nbest for our country, and I\'m just so proud of her, she\'s wonderful.\n\nHANNITY: Did you guys give each other debate advice before you go into these\ndebates?\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: You know, the only advice that we both got is have fun. [\x85]\n\n[\x85]\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: I\'m inspired by the people that come to see us, they take their\ntime, their effort, their energy, and their love on our behalf, and that\nmeans we\'re going to do everything we can not to disappoint them.\n\nCINDY MCCAIN: Can I say something, I am so proud of my husband for what he\nhas done, but more importantly because he has always told the truth, he has\nnever one time mislead the American people. And he stands for what is best\nin America. I\'m just so proud of him for what he has done for this race and\nfor this country.\n\n\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTIyyBO_8Mc>\n\n*Highlight #3*\n\n*NBC Story Uncritically Reports that McCain is an "Earmark Reformer"* (NBC\n10/09/08 06:50pm)\n\nLISA MYERS: As for John McCain, he has made opposition to earmarks a\ncrusade.\n\nSTEVE ELLIS: He was an earmark reformer before earmark reform was cool.\n\nMYERS: And on this issue, experts say, his words pretty much match his\ndeeds. He has not asked for an earmark in his 26 year career.\n\n*\n*\n\n*Highlight #4*\n\n*Nancy Pfotenhauer claims on FNC that Obama and Ayers connection "ties\ndirectly to what he\'s proposing on the economy," Will not Deliver on\nPromised Middle Class Tax Cuts* (FNC, Fox News Live, 10/10/08, 9:14am)\n\nNANCY PFOTENHAUER: You can\'t trust Barack Obama, what he says and what he\ndoes are two different things. It ties directly to what he\'s proposing on\nthe economy. Because he\'s out there promising the Middle Class a tax cut,\nwhen he ran for the Senate he promised a tax cut, and then did nothing to\ndeliver it. He\'s not going to deliver on any Middle Class tax cut that he\'s\npromising right now, at least if past is prologue.\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
