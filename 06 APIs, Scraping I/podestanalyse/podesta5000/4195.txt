FYI, Dinora will be there to let you into Tony's on Tuesday afternoon. She is already scheduled to be there from 12-4 pm. What time you want me there? Was planning to get to EG quite early in the morning anyway (we have new hires coming on board), so I can take off earlier without it affecting my hours.\n\nEryn M.

Maybe one of their cabbies can bring to 1333 H on Monday and you can do a street handoff.  They can charge you the cab fare and tip and I can reimburse you on Tuesday. Thanks!\n> JP\n> PS any interest in helping out with the Leahy party? I definitely can handle on my own unlike the labor reception, but I thought you might have fun with the old gang.\n> \n>> On Sunday, July 19, 2015, Eryn Sepp <eryn.sepp@gmail.com> wrote:\n>> After much searching, they found it! What do you want to do, John? Cabbie is bringing it back to their office in Northeast for now. I can go get it Monday, charge it up, and drop it at your house on my way home if you like. Their office closes at 5 pm so it would be too late by the time you got back from NY.  Will do vmail checks today and tomorrow to ensure you aren't missing too much. \n>> \n>> Eryn M.

It must have fallen off my belt getting in or out of the cab. I used Diamond and had a 4:45 pick up at Brandywine. Can you call Diamond Cab and see if the cab driver found it. They should be able to figure it out given the pickup. The receipt says #Diamond 444 C502\n"
