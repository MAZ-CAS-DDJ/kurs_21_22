I\xe2\x80\x99m in the race for New York's 13th Congressional District!\n\nThis community is my home. My wife Mona and I are proud to be raising our children in one of the greatest neighborhoods in New York City!\n\nBut we can \xe2\x80\x93 and must do better.\n\nFor the first time in nearly half a century, you have a real choice.  We can turn the page on corrupt machine politics of the past (http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/05/how-new-york-became-most-corrupt-state-in-america-117652) , and the politicians who help their own careers more than the people they represent.\n\nOver the last few months, I have traveled the entire district (http://clydewilliams2016.com/donate/) and talked to hundreds of residents in Washington Heights, East Harlem, Central Harlem, Inwood, Kingsbridge, Norwood, and Bedford Park about their hopes, fears and greatest challenges.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgwFoiako54&feature=youtu.be\n\n\n** Clyde Williams Announces Run for Congress\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat I heard is that people want their political leaders to talk less and deliver more.  We all want real solutions (http://clydewilliams2016.com/ideas-impact/)  to generate affordable housing for our families, more economic opportunity, better schools for our kids, safer streets, and easier access to quality healthcare.\n\nAfter 20 years in public service, including working for President Clinton and President Obama, I want to work for you (http://clydewilliams2016.com/donate/)  in Congress.  I am the only candidate in this race who can hit the ground running (http://clydewilliams2016.com/donate/)  from day one to deliver results for this community.\nOur community deserves better political representation. To meet the challenges of the future, we need a new generation of leadership (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/18/nyregion/for-clyde-williams-a-rangel-challenger-only-voters-opinions-matter.html)  that can produce real results.\nI am ready to earn your vote.\n\nPlease visit our website (http://clydewilliams2016.com/)  to learn more about the campaign, donate (http://clydewilliams2016.com/donate/) and join our journey!
