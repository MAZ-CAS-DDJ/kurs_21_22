That represents a 10 point net decline in the NRA\'s favorability from the week before the press conference when a national poll we did found it at 48/41. Its image has taken a hit with both Democrats (from 29/59 to 22/67) and Republicans (71/19 to 66/18).\n> The NRA\'s focus on putting more guns in schools is likely what\'s driving the decline in the organization\'s image. Only 41% of voters support the organization\'s proposal to put armed police officers in schools across the country, with 50% opposed. Democrats (35/57) and independents (38/51) both oppose the push and even among Republicans only a narrow majority (52/39) supports it.\n> On the broader issue of giving teachers guns, only 27% of voters are supportive with 64% opposed. There\'s bipartisan opposition to that concept with Republicans (35/50), independents (31/59), and Democrats (19/77) all standing against it. Gun owners (37/52) oppose it as well.\n> The holidays and the fiscal cliff took a lot of the spotlight off gun control measures, but in general 53% of Americans say they support stricter gun laws with 40% opposed.\n> Congress emerged from the fiscal cliff debate with a 7% approval rating, with 81% of voters disapproving of it. But the two parties aren\'t going in for equal blame. While the Democrats in Congress aren\'t popular (-12 at 38/50) their approval rating is a net 48 points better than their Republican counterparts (-60 at 15/75).The Republicans in Congress have only a 25/61 approval rating even with the GOP base, suggesting the potential for 2014 to bring a lot of primary challenges.\n> The considerably higher esteem the Democrats in Congress have compared to the Republicans is extending to our early generic ballot polling for 2014- 47% of voters say they\'d support the Democratic candidate for the House from their district if there was an election today to 41% who say they would vote for the GOP nominee.\n> That disparity in approval numbers extends to the leaders in both the House and Senate. It would have been unthinkable a couple years ago but Nancy Pelosi now has a net approval rating (-21 at 34/55) that\'s 18 points better than John Boehner\'s (-39 at 21/60). Boehner has lost the faith of his party base, with Republicans giving him a 36/43 rating. On the Senate side Harry Reid comes in at 30/46 to Mitch McConnell\'s 24/46. Although both bodies of Congress are unpopular, the Senate (28/56) has a better image with the public than the House (15/69). Asked straight up which body they have a higher opinion of, voters pick the Senate over the House by a 38/27 margin.\n> Other notes from this poll:\n> -Barack Obama\'s approval rating stands at 51/46, up a shade from 50/47 a month ago. Mitt Romney\'s image has taken a big hit since the election. On our final poll in November he was at 47/50 but now he\'s dropped a net 8 points to 40/51, suggesting that his public statements since his defeat haven\'t done much to help his image.\n> -Chris Christie is now more popular with Democrats nationally than he is with Republicans. His overall favorability is a very strong 51/23, but his +29 standing with Democrats (52/23) is higher than his +21 with GOP voters (48/27). He\'s most popular with independents at +34 (52/18).  Compared to a month ago he\'s up a net 12 points with Democrats and down a net 11 points with Republicans. We\'ll have a more full look ahead to the 2016 Presidential race tomorrow.\n> \n> Robert Creamer\n> Democracy Partners\n> creamer2@aol.com\n> DC Office 202-470-6955\n> Cell 847-910-0363\n> \n> \n> \n\nRobert Creamer\nDemocracy Partners\ncreamer2@aol.com\nDC Office 202-470-6955\nCell 847-910-0363\n\n\n\n-- \n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.
