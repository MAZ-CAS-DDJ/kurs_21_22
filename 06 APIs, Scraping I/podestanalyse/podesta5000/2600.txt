Dana Bash\ncomments that his negative comments about Christianity also will not go\nover well with evangelical Christians. John Kasich to kick-off campaign at\nOhio State university. Athena Jones says that he seems "tailor made" for\nthis presidential campaign having served in Congress for 18 years and\nhaving been on the Budget Committee and the Armed Services Committee and is\ncurrently his second term as Governor of Ohio but doesn\'t have name\nrecognition. Jeb Bush praised, through letter, 2004 "Swift Boat" attacks on\nKerry. Nia-Malika Henderson says that when it\'s helpful to you to attack\nanother candidate, attacks are ok but when it\'s not, then attacking another\ncandidate (i.e. Trump on McCain) is "reprehensible."\n\n*Fox News\' Fox and Friends:* Kilmeade reported Kasich will enter the race\ntoday, and a new poll shows Trump leading the GOP field; Leland Vitter\nreported Trump is leading the GOP polls, and Walker is second; Vitter said\nthe new poll was conducted before Trump made his comments about McCain;\nVitter reported that the Des Moines Register said Trump\xe2\x80\x99s comments were\ndisgraceful and that he has disqualified himself from being President;\nplayed a clip of Trump on Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly, where Trump said McCain is the\n\xe2\x80\x9chead of the group that runs\xe2\x80\x9d; Vitters reported Kasich jumped into the race\ntoday; Kilmeade and Doocy discussed Kasich\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for joining the race\nnow. Kilmeade played a clip of Trump from last night, when he said\nregardless of whether McCain is a hero, he\xe2\x80\x99s no hero to veterans; Amber\nSmith of Concerned Veterans For America said she has talked to many\nveterans who are disgusted with Trump\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, and that he is ignorant of\nmilitary service and the sacrifices they make; Kilmeade said Trump was\nattacking McCain\xe2\x80\x99s lack of support for veterans, and only accidentally went\nafter his war record; Former U.S. Navy Seal Carl Higbie said many veterans\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s talked to agree with Trump\xe2\x80\x99s blunt approach and would still vote for\nhim, though he should probably apologize for attacking McCain\xe2\x80\x99s military\nservice; Amber Smith said she\xe2\x80\x99s glad of any opportunity to talk about\nveterans issues; Higbie said soldiers should be able to carry weapons on\nmilitary bases, and Amber Smith agreed.\n\n*MSNBC\'s Morning Joe:* Trump-McCain war hero saga. Trump is doubling Jeb\nBush in the new ABC/WaPo poll. Trump *did* call McCain a war hero but\nnational media keeps showing 5-second clip when he said something\ndeplorable and not report on when he did call him a hero 15-20 times. There\ncould be fallout from his comments in the poll. Gene Robinson said\nattacking Trump only seems to make him stronger because he has nothing to\nlose and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care what people say. The GOP campaign is about him,\nnot about nayone else, and in Trump\xe2\x80\x99s world that means he\xe2\x80\x99s winning.\nSanders is not leading the field (HRC at 68%, Sanders at 15%), but there is\nan anti-politician appeal to Trump and Sanders. There\xe2\x80\x99s a disaffection out\nthere with politics, politicians, and people are being turned off. Mika\nsaid there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference because Sanders has worked in Washington and he\nhas a consistent record. Kasich is joining the field in a few hours.

Said he\xe2\x80\x99s different from other Republicans because he expanded\nMedicaid under Obamacare, favors a path to citizenship for undocumented\nimmigrants, and even voted for an assault weapons ban. Could be a tough\nsell for conservative primary voters. Said Bush needs to make a big mistake\nso Kasich could make a big break, and if he does it would be in New\nHampshire. Joe Scarborough talked about his personal relationship with\nKasich when he was in the House. Said Kasich could be the ideal VP.\n'
