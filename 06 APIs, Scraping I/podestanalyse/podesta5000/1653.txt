john.podesta@gmail.comb'Laura,\n\nPer our call, please look at news reports widely available on the web of Abu al-Ayna al-Ansari and his comments on Trump from last week. Ansari is a militant jihadist from Gaza. He said that Trump\'s comments prove that America is at war with Islam and that this will risk further attack.\n\nI will reach out to people I know to see if I can get any info on any actual "video" (I don\'t have any personal knowledge of this) but that is most definitely besides the point. ISIS is an ideology, not just a specific chain of command, as the San Bernardino attacks clearly showed. Deranged radicals (ISIS and ISIS sympathizers) here in the US and around the world are watching the news, follow social media, and listening to Donald Trump\'s comments - the news stories about Ansari\'s reactions prove that. It is obvious then that his comments would be mentioned in the world of shadowy blogs used for recruitment as well. Trump\'s comments threaten national security, without any doubt, and play into the recruiting narrative of ISIS which is not based so much on theology as it is a political narrative of the West vs. Islam.\n\nI don\'t know if you want to introduce Israel into the discussion, but I personally think that Israel\'s rebuff of Trump\'s recent proposed trip is the strongest proof of Secretary Clinton\'s point. Because Trump\'s rhetoric is such a clear propaganda tool for terrorists such as ISIS, Prime Minister Netanyahu had to publicly state his rejection of the comments and refused to host him since it would threaten Israel\'s national security. No one can argue that Israel is weak or uninformed on terrorism, quite the opposite, so when Israel has to distance itself from Trump, it really proves the point.\n\nKamran\n\n---------------------------------------\nKamran S.
