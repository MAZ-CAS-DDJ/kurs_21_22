john.podesta@gmail.comb"John --\n\nThe McCain campaign is bragging that they are out-raising and out-spending us.\n\nThey had their best month ever in June, and combined with the Republican National Committee, they now have more than $95 million in cash on hand.\n\nWith this massive fundraising effort, they claim they've been out-spending us 3-to-1 on TV ads over the past couple months.\n\nUnfortunately, when it comes to collecting giant checks from Washington lobbyists and special interest PACs, McCain and the RNC do have a lot to brag about.\n\nThey are raking in huge donations from those who want to keep Washington just the way it is. And they are pulling ahead in the money race.\n\nTo compete against these big money interests in all 50 states, this campaign is relying on you.\n \nWe need to respond to the McCain campaign and show them how presidential campaigns should be funded -- by ordinary people like you giving only what you can afford.\n\nI recorded a short video in my office about what we are up against and why now is the time to step up and make your first donation.\n \nWatch the video and make a donation of $25 now:\n\nhttps://donate.barackobama.com/stepup6\n\nAs much money as they already have, this is just the beginning.\n\nOn top of their current $95 million in cash on hand, the campaign has said they expect to raise another $95 million by the end of the summer.\n\nBased on their record so far, they're good for it.\n\nThey know that the big money interests will continue pouring millions into McCain's campaign, the RNC, and shadowy outside money groups -- whatever it takes to stop our movement so they can hold on to their influence in Washington.\n\nIt's going to take unprecedented resources and organization to compete against this broken, entrenched system.\n\nTogether, we've created the largest grassroots movement in history, and your efforts have put us in a position to build a campaign for change in all 50 states. Now, we need your help to keep us in a strong position at this crucial moment.\n\nWatch the video and make your first donation of $25 to help this movement take on John McCain and the RNC:\n\nhttps://donate.barackobama.com/stepup6\n\nTogether, we have already accomplished so much in this campaign. But we cannot take it for granted.\n\nThis grassroots movement won't just happen on its own. It's up to you to make it happen.\n\nJohn McCain and the RNC are committed to stopping us -- and they are prepared to raise and spend as much as they can from Washington lobbyists and special interest PACs.\n\nWe must let them know that this time, the election won't be bought by big money interests. And that a campaign of grassroots donors can overcome the entrenched Washington powers to bring about the change we need.\n\nIt's up to you.
