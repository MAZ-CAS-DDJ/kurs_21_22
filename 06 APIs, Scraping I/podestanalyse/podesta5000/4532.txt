Israel must NEVER become a partisan issue in the U.S. That is a real risk. Pew surveys indicate a significant drop in support from Democrats. This is NOT anti-Semitism, it is concern with Israeli settlement policies.\r\n\r\n2. Likewise, we must NEVER lump in those, like Tom Friedman and Leon Wieseltier, who are committed Zionists, as being somehow the enemy, if they criticize Israeli policies. Israel has a robust democratic dialogue; the Diaspora is entitled to the same.\r\n\r\n3. This represents the broader phenomenon of the collapse of the middle, both in US and Israeli politics. Those of us who love Israel and puts its security at the top of their agenda, must be able to find space for reasoned, balanced criticism, that must include criticism of the Palestinians as well. The polarization in both our body politics is a dangerous trend that threatens to weaken support for Israel for Israel.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n\r\nStu Eizenstat\r\n\r\nFrom: Eizenstat, Stuart\r\nSent: Thursday, June 18, 2015 11:19 AM\r\nTo: \'Dennis Ross\'; Avinoam Bar-Yosef; Stuart Eizenstat\r\nCc: John Ruskay; Holte, Laurina; Adams, Patricia; Glenn, Steven\r\nSubject: RE: 10-06-15 Gil Drivers US - Israel Relationship track\r\n\r\nDear Dennis and Avinoam,\r\nI agree with Dennis. The table is a guide, but there needs to be some synthesis for the executive summary.\r\n\r\nAlso, it is important to understand how Dennis and I will divide up our remarks, particularly since he cannot come in person. I would like to briefly summarize Schmuel Rosner\'s two projects (Israel as a Jewish and Democratic State and the use of arms by the IDF), since they underscore our unique mission and reach.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, Avinoam, I want to address the BDS movement with the following general points (I have given several speeches on this topic).\r\n\r\n1. Israel is subject to a new kind of war-- a subtle, insidious war without guns and rockets, but a war nevertheless.  At a time when Israel\'s high tech economy is the envy of the world, and when the IDF is one of the strongest and most ethical fighting forces in the world, Israel is more diplomatically isolated than ever before. There is a real possibility the US will support a new UN Resolution. The BDS campaign is instigated as a substitute for the Palestinians lack of willingness to make the compromises necessary in bilateral negotiations on final borders, ending claims on their "right of return", and full acceptance of Israel as part of two state solution, as a State for the Jewish people.\r\n\r\n2. Many of those who have taken up this new front in the war, want to delegitimize Israel\'s right to exist as a free. sovereign state.\r\n\r\n3. Nothing justifies the BDS campaign, including the odious statement by the CEO of the French telecom company, Orange. It is an illegitimate way to express opposition to Israeli policies. We must combat it, including support for counter-legislation in several states that would bar companies participating in BDS from public procurement in those states.\r\n(1) It is a double-standard, not holding the Palestinians up to similar scrutiny, for policies far worse.\r\n(2) It hurts Palestinian workers in the West Bank.\r\n\r\n4. However, it is a mistake to lump everyone together and call it a new form of anti-Semitism. Of course, for some this may be an underlying motive, but not for the majority.  Many of those who support the BDS campaign in European and on US campuses, are galvanized by the sense of "victimization" of the Palestinians, the expansion of settlements in ways that complicated achieving a two state solution,  but who accept a two state solution, including a Jewish State. This includes EU officials pushing for labeling requirements and the EU itself, which  To fail to understand that those who initiate the BDS campaign find support because of these Israeli policies. To fail to understand that current Israeli policies make it easier for Israeli haters and BDS leaders to recruit non-Israeli leaders, is to fail to understand the full picture necessary to deal with it.\r\n\r\n(1) Israel was the darling of the left and much of Europe in 1967 and 1973, when it was perceived as the weaker party. Now the Palestinians take that role.\r\n(2) Israel cannot negotiate peace with itself and with an unwilling partner, but it can and should adopt policies (e.g. building only in settlement blocs; proposing to go back to the negotiating table on the basis of the last Kerry offer; more free movement in the West Bank and fewer checkpoints; more economic development) which will make it more difficult for BDS champions to find fertile ground for broader support for their campaign.\r\n(3) Israel should adopt policies that make it clear it is the Palestinians who are the barriers to a negotiated settlement.\r\n\r\nPlease give me your thoughts on this and how Dennis and I divide our remarks,\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n\r\nStu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Dennis Ross [mailto:Dross@washingtoninstitute.org]\r\nSent: Wednesday, June 10, 2015 8:17 AM\r\nTo: Avinoam Bar-Yosef; Stuart Eizenstat; Eizenstat, Stuart\r\nCc: John Ruskay\r\nSubject: RE: 10-06-15 Gil Drivers US - Israel Relationship track\r\n\r\nI think the substance is very good.  One small comment and then a larger one.  There is a typo in the first paragraph that suggests that all that follows is inconsequential.  You mean consequential.  The larger comment is the presentation.  Conceptually it is very good, but I think it is easy to get lost in the parallel columns.  Moreover, there is no sense of what is most important here-at least not in  the lay-out.  I see what you are trying to do by identifying the different drivers-but what is most important here among the drivers?  Is it the shared values on the positive side, particularly at a time when the demographics in terms of minorities and a younger population has no historic connections to Israel?  Is it the shared sense of threat?  The breakdown into  helpful and harmful actions is good but again the current table creates for some redundancy and makes it hard to determine  what is considered most important.  I am not sure that it is so easy to walk away with a clear picture.  I would rather find a different way to summarize the key priorities in drivers and helpful and harmful  actions.  Maybe it is just me and I am thinking of how  to present this verbally.  Maybe if people study the table it can be helpful.\r\n\r\nFrom: Avinoam Bar-Yosef [mailto:avinoam@jppi.org.il]\r\nSent: Wednesday, June 10, 2015 7:18 AM\r\nTo: Stuart Eizenstat; \'Eizenstat, Stuart\'; Dennis Ross\r\nCc: John Ruskay\r\nSubject: 10-06-15 Gil Drivers US - Israel Relationship track\r\n\r\nDear Stu and Dennis,\r\n\r\nAs discussed the last time you  were here, Avi Gil conducted an effort to map the main drivers affecting the US-Israel relationship. The work is based on some seminars with Israeli and foreign experts held at the Institute, the of findings of which were integrated into the attached paper. I believe that Avi did extremely valuable work in laying out the dynamics of the relationship. In my view, it is critically important that the attached table be presented to the new government as part of our executive summary of the Annual Assessment as many of the ministers are unfamiliar with full picture, and it may give them  a more comprehensive understanding of the issues at stake.\r\n\r\nThis is not the final paper of the project, but as we would like to include it in the executive summary we\'d appreciate your input and comments very much. I am copying John Ruskay as well, so he also will be able to weigh in.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know as soon as possible so we can close it for printing.\r\n\r\nWarmest regards,\r\nAvinoam\r\n\r\n'
