john.podesta@gmail.comb'Starting a clean chain on this.\n\nDeadline tonight.\n\nJonathan Allen from Reuters spoke with Jared and Nate (the engaged couple\nfrom the video) and has the following questions. Including draft answers.\n\nCouple quick\'uns, Josh, if I may:\n1. Are Jared and Nate correct to believe Hardpin Media produced the film?\nDraft response (on background): The video was produced in house by the\ndigital led by Teddy Goff.\n\n2. As I think you know, they have invited Mrs. Clinton and a guest to their\nwedding in Chicago on July 19th - can she make it?\nI can\'t imagine we answer this.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "HRCRapid" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.\nTo view this discussion on the web visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/hrcrapid/CAPrY%2B5Kon4CQFCbdUHXM%2BR%3DaEySVJz%2B497dDaY2O-X4cC-qEVw%40mail.gmail.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n'
