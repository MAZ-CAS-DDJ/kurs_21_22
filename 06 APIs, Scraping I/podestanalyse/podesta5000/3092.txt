But alas, she wants to work for Hillary. So I have reluctantly agreed to try to help her make the move. She is smart, hardworking, a quick study, and plays well with others. She would be great fit in the Brooklyn office, as a chief deputy or dept. deputy or exec. asst., a policy or issues researcher, actually just about anywhere. She is a real talent. Please pass her resume around. I'm happy to talk about her with anyone. Hate losing her but this campaign is her calling. Thanks for any help you can offer.\n\nFrom: Valdivia, Vanessa\nSent: Tuesday, April 14, 2015 9:19 AM\nTo: Spahn, Andy; Gonring, Jennifer\nSubject: Vanessa's resume\n\nAs discussed, please find my resume attached.
