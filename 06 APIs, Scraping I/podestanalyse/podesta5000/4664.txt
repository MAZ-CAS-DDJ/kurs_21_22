john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John,\n\nWhen the Washington Center for Equitable Growth was founded nearly two years ago, we gave ourselves the goal of building a bridge between cutting-edge research addressing whether and how economic inequality affects growth and decisionmakers in the political world. In 2015, discussions of economic inequality and growth became a big part of the political debate, so we are excited to share the news that Politico Magazine today named Equitable Growth\'s executive director and chief economist, Heather Boushey, as one of the 50 most influential leaders transforming U.S. politics. According to Politico, the list includes, "the thinkers, doers and dreamers who really matter in this age of gridlock and dysfunction."\n\nRead Heather\'s ranking at http://politi.co/1Nri94n\nSee the full Politico 50 for 2105 at http://www.politico.com/magazine/politico50\n\nThis year Politico dedicated a portion of its top 50 to leaders driving the conversation on the economy and inequality in Washington. The list included not just Heather but also Equitable Growth Steering Committee member Raj Chetty. This is another sign of the impact the organization and our partners can have when we bring data-driven research to the forefront of vital policy debates. In Washington, we will continue to amplify the voices of leading researchers and helping them to break through into the policy world. We\'re so excited to have a great leader like Heather at the helm taking on this important work.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEd Paisley\nManaging Director\nWashington Center for Equitable Growth\nepaisley@equitablegrowth.org<mailto:epaisley@equitablegrowth.org>\n'
