In going\nthrough the Kerry transition documents, I found an interesting memo and\naccompanying spreadsheet that analyzed the entire Kerry campaign staff.\nI'll scan the cover memo and a sample page, but the criteria that the\nKerry folks used might be a helpful template for us.  For each campaign\nstaffer, there was the following analysis:\n\n \n\n*         Overall assessment as a staffer (ranked 1-5, with 1 being the\nbest)\n\n*         Priority placement in the administration (ranked 1-5, with 1\nbeing must place, 5 being don't place)\n\n                                They deliberately made sure than not\nmore than 20% of a department's total staff could be ranked as 1, 20% as\na 2, etc.\n\n*         Professional experience (ranked 1-5, with 1 being 15+ years of\nprofessional experience)\n\n*         Kerry service (ranked 1-5, based on the beginning of their\nservice date with Kerry)\n\n*         Prior administration experience (yes or no)\n\n*         Transition/inaugural (yes or no, based on people who they\nwanted to tap immediately for participation in either activity)\n\n \n\nAnd then they totaled it up:\n\n \n\nOverall assessments\n\n                1's - 162\n\n                2's - 155\n\n                3's - 123\n\n                4's - 27 \n\n                5's - 7\n\n \n\nPriority placements\n\n                1's - 125\n\n                2's - 125\n\n                3's - 96\n\n                4's - 122\n\n                5's  - 6\n\n \n\nThis will all be a little more clear when I redact a sample page and\nscan it for your review.  But just wanted to get people thinking about\nthis.\n\n \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nChris Lu\n\nclu@barackobama.com\n\n(312) 505-4864 (cell)\n\n \n\n \n\n"
