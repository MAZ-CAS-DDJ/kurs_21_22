President Obama will be holding a health reform rally at the Comcast Center in College Park tomorrow -- don't miss it.\n\nIf you haven't already, please RSVP:\n\nhttp://md.barackobama.com/PresidentCollegePark\n\nMitch\n\n---------------Original Message---------------\nFrom: Jason Waskey, BarackObama.com\nSubject: Thursday: President Obama in College Park\n\nFriend --\n\nThis Thursday, President Obama will be coming to speak in College Park, MD. Following his major address on health reform to Congress last week, we're at an important turning point in our push for real reform, and it's critical that we seize this moment.\n\nSo we're inviting folks like you to come and support him. Please join us -- here are the details:\n\nhttp://md.barackobama.com/PresidentCollegePark\n\n    What: Health Reform Rally with President Obama\n\n    Where: Comcast Center\n    1 Terrapin Trail\n    College Park, MD 20742\n\n    When: Thursday, September 17th\n    Doors Open: 9:00 a.m.\n    Start Time: 11:00 a.m.\n\nLast fall, when Swiftboaters and special interests attacked President Obama, folks like you came to his defense. We knocked on doors, talked to neighbors, and made our voices heard.\n\nNow, we need to do it again. This time, he's under attack by Washington insiders, insurance companies, and well-financed special interests who don't go a day without spreading lies and stirring up fear. We need to show that we're sick and tired of it, and that we're ready for real change, this year.\n\nJoin us on Thursday to stand up for President Obama and publicly show your support for the big changes that the President is fighting for and that this country needs.\n\nAdmission is on a first-come, first-served basis, so please arrive as early as possible.\n\nRSVP today:\n\nhttp://md.barackobama.com/PresidentCollegePark\n\nThanks,\n\nJason\n\nJason Waskey\nMaryland State Director\nOrganizing for America\n\nP.S. -- All attendees will go through airport-like security and should bring as few personal items as possible.
