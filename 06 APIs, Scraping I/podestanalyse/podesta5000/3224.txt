john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi all - we wanted to update you on news surrounding today\x92s donor release and encourage you to share on your social media channels.\n\nPerry Yeatman, a Clinton Foundation donor and Clinton Global Initiative member, posted an op-ed about why she supports the Clinton Foundation and the value she sees in CGI.\n\n\x93The heart of CGI is smart people, with good intentions, committed to partnering in new ways in order to accomplish valuable and life-saving work for those in need - humans, animals and the planet. Why not simply applaud both the work that\'s being done and the fact that it\'s even possible in the first place?\x94\n\n\x93Sensational headlines may get attention but I\'m less interested in headlines than trendlines - many of which are now moving in the right direction. I would ask that if we really want to scrutinize something, we scrutinize all the life-changing work CGI has done and it\'s all too rare ability to bring people together to make the world a better place. Why? Because we need even more of that, not less.\x94\n\nRead it here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/perry-yeatman/why-the-clinton-global-in_b_8421930.html\nShare the piece on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/ClintonFdn/status/659861771059118080\n\n\nThe Hill wrote about new CGI commitments and members and how, compared to the same period last year, donations have increased during the first three quarters of this year.\n\n\x93[CGI] Commitments include \x91efforts to employ 40,000 health workers around the globe; rebuild schools and infrastructure after the Nepal earthquake; major corporations joining to improve their parental support policies; and professional training for garment workers worldwide.\x92\x94\n\n\x93First-time CGI members include Apple, Cardinal Health, GlaxoSmith Kline, Xerox and Zurich Insurance, the source said.\x94\n\n\x93Instead of these controversies driving donors away, more people sent checks to the foundation during the first three quarters of 2015 than they did over the same period last year.\x94\n\nRead it here: http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/258603-clinton-foundation-donors-keep-giving-despite-scrutiny\nShare the piece on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/thehill/status/659842910100316160\n\n\nThe Washington Post also wrote about how donations to the Clinton Foundation are up over last year, and the high level of transparency of the Foundation.\n\n\x93According to the foundation, donations are up \x97 both measured in dollars given and in number of contributions to the charity, which runs health, environmental and education programs around the world. A spokesman said there were also more sponsors this year of the foundation\'s annual multi-day Clinton Global Initiative in New York in September, countering reports that corporate supporters had backed off because of a newly politicized atmosphere around the gathering.\x94\n\n\x93While it is not required to disclose its donors by law, the Clinton Foundation has done so annually since 2008, when it agreed to publish donor names as part of an agreement with the White House when Hillary Clinton was nominated to become secretary of state. The charity announced in the spring that it would disclose donors more frequently, updating the list once a quarter, part of new measures taken when Hillary Clinton launched her presidential campaign.\x94\n\nRead it here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/29/clinton-foundation-says-donations-are-on-the-rise/\nShare the piece on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/postpolitics/status/659822369364668416\n\n\nIn case you missed it, this afternoon Donna Shalala posted a retrospective of the Foundation\x92s work this past quarter on the Clinton Foundation blog:\n\n\x93Compared to this time last year, donations are up\x97both in terms of the amount donated and the number of donors. And, as was the case in previous years, about 90 percent of donations were in the amount of $100 or less.\x94\n\n\x93But whether it\x92s $5 or $5,000, every single donation matters, and collectively they are enabling us to help more people in more places live their best life story.\x94\n\nRead it here: https://www.clintonfoundation.org/blog/2015/10/29/our-donors-and-important-work-they-make-possible\n\n\nFrom: Clinton Foundation Press Office\nSent: Thursday, October 29, 2015 3:57 PM\nTo: Clinton Foundation Press Office <press@clintonfoundation.org>\nSubject: Clinton Foundation News & Guidance: Donor Update\n\nToday, the Clinton Foundation updated its donor posting with contributors who gave in the third quarter of 2015, which included CGI\x92s Annual Meeting. We wanted to make sure you were aware and had information about today\x92s news. We were pleased with the results this quarter, because:\n\n\n\xb7         Total amount donated to the Clinton Foundation in the first three quarters of 2015 is higher than the same period in 2014.\n\n\xb7         The number of donors is higher compared to the first three quarters of 2014.\n\n\xb7         Consistent with previous years and the first two quarters of 2015, approximately 90 percent of donations were $100 or less.\n\n\xb7         CGI sponsorship revenue rose in 2015, with 33 new and returning sponsors. These include Procter & Gamble, The Coca-Cola Co., Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, Cisco, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Ford Foundation, Gap Inc., NRG Energy, Swiss Reinsurance Co., the Rockefeller Foundation and Western Union.\n\n\xb7         Membership in CGI is strong, with 16 of the 30 companies in the Dow Jones industrial average part of CGI. First-time CGI members this year included Apple, Cardinal Health, Xerox and Zurich Insurance.\n\nDonna Shalala posted a retrospective of the Foundation\x92s work this past quarter on the Clinton Foundation blog:\n\n\x93The Clinton Foundation has a strong commitment to transparency and accountability. In fact, we take measures that make us one of the most transparent nonprofits in the world\x97including disclosing all of our donors on a quarterly basis. We released the latest update just today.\x94\n\n\x93Compared to this time last year, donations are up\x97both in terms of the amount donated and the number of donors. And, as was the case in previous years, about 90 percent of donations were in the amount of $100 or less.\x94\n\nRead it here: https://www.clintonfoundation.org/blog/2015/10/29/our-donors-and-important-work-they-make-possible\n\nLast month, Bob Harrison, the CEO of the Clinton Global Initiative, wrote an op-ed about how support for CGI has strengthened:\n\n\x93Despite our mission, some have characterized the turnover of a handful of CGI\x92s sponsors as \x91trouble\x92 for CGI and \x91abandoning\x92 the Clintons, but this is just another example of critics trying to politicize philanthropy, and the facts don\x92t bear out the argument.\x94\n\n\x93At CGI, corporations not only provide funding, but also apply their expertise in management, technology, manufacturing, distribution and research to help non-governmental organizations and foundations be more effective. These corporate commitments are providing better access to education and healthcare in the developing world, creating jobs and improving infrastructure in the U.S, and protecting the environment.\x94\n\nRead it here: http://www.foxbusiness.com/business-leaders/2015/09/22/corporations-stay-committed-to-clinton-global-initiative/\nShare the piece on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/ClintonGlobal/status/646441578366672896\nShare the piece on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/clintonglobalinitiative/posts/10153246430420318\n\nAnd yesterday, the Chronicle of Philanthropy reported on the Foundation\x92s hiring of Kevin Thurm as the new Chief Operating Officer:\n\n\x93Kevin Thurm will serve as executive vice president and chief operating officer, Ms. Shalala said in a message to foundation staff. He will focus on strategy, day-to-day operations, and the Clinton Foundation\x92s administrative units. He will report directly to Ms. Shalala.\x94\n\n\x93\x92Kevin has been a trusted colleague and partner since he served as my chief of staff and then deputy secretary for HHS in the \x9290s, where he oversaw major policy and management issues, including the implementation of legislative initiatives like the Government Performance and Results Act and challenges like the \'Y2K\' computer programming situation,\x92 Ms. Shalala said, referring to the fear in 1999 of a breakdown in important communications when computers switched to 2000.\x94\n\nRead the story here: https://philanthropy.com/article/Shalala-Hires-Former-Colleague/233964\n\nThe support to the Clinton Foundation has enabled specific programs to expand their work and reach even more individuals across the globe. Over the past three months, we have seen many examples of this work in the news:\n\nAn Associated Press article looked at Commitments to Action that came out of CGI\x92s Annual Meeting, profiled the unique commitment model. The piece cites several commitments, including:\n\n\x93One such pledge has led to financial education for more than 1.2 million poor women and youths and scholarships for more than 10,000 students in Kenya. Another has spawned more than 430 successful online crowdfunding campaigns for projects centered on women and girls. A third, aimed at enlisting African-American churches in combatting HIV and AIDS, has trained more than 500 religious leaders.\x94\n\n"We\'re in the middle of defining the terms of our interdependence in a world where so much of our identity is caught up in our differences," Bill Clinton said. "So our job, as citizens \x97 those of us who have no political power \x97 is to do what we can to build up the positive forces of our interdependence and reduce the negative ones."\n\nRead the piece here: http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/bill-clinton-global-initiative-results-34083188\n\nIn September, the Atlantic wrote about the importance of closing the word gap not only to resolve education consequences, but also to improve health outcomes saying, \x93Children with more words do better in school. Adults who were good students and earned a college degree have longer life expectancies.\x94 The article sites Too Small to Fail\x92s \x93Talking is Teaching\x94 campaign as one of the organizations focusing on this issue.\n\n\x93There are certainly people watching, from state health officers in California and Indiana to academics at the University of Kansas. The White House has issued a \x91call to action\x92 to reduce the word gap, spotlighting the Georgia program specifically. And the Clinton Foundation has launched \x91Talking is Teaching\x92 through its early childhood Too Small to Fail campaign.\x94\n\nRead the article here: http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/09/georgias-plan-to-close-the-30-million-word-gap-for-kids/403903/\n\nAt the beginning of September, Reuters published an article about climate change\x92s effects on island nations and how the Clinton Climate Initiative\x92s Islands Energy Program is helping to develop sustainable, renewable energy solutions.\n\n\x93Dymphna van der Lans, CEO of the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI), which is working with around a dozen Caribbean and East African island nations to develop and roll out renewable energy strategies, said there was both a moral and economic imperative for such states to transition away from costly diesel imports.\x94\n\nRead the article here: http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/01/us-islands-climatechange-energy-idUSKCN0R13BB20150901\n\nIn August, Refinery29 posted a story about the Clinton Foundation\x92s recent trip to Haiti, where they got a firsthand look at our work there and what we\x92re doing to empower girls and women.\n\n\x93I think there is such a case for optimism about Haiti,\x94 Chelsea says. \x93And also really about what women can do when we\x92re truly unfettered.\x94 These female entrepreneurs strive for success not because it will bring them wealth or fame, but because with steady employment, they\x92re able to economically support not just their families but also other women as well.\n\nRead the article here: http://www.refinery29.com/2015/08/92969/chelsea-clinton-foundation-haiti-women-empowerment#.mfdbkf:4DM6\n\nIn August, Forbes wrote about how the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership is working with CropConnect Enterprises to streamline the farming process in India. This partnership empowers farmers and reduces agricultural waste.\n\n\x93Partnering with former president Bill Clinton and Canadian philanthropist Frank Giustra\x92s Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, [CropConnect Enterprises] is currently working to create joint platform across India\x92s often ignored northeastern states. They plan to introduce a crop cycle that allows farmers to maintain a sustainable business throughout the year by growing different types of fruits and vegetables.\x94\n\nRead the article here: http://www.forbes.com/sites/abehal/2015/08/18/in-indias-disorganized-agricultural-sector-a-connector-of-crops-to-markets/\n\n\n'
