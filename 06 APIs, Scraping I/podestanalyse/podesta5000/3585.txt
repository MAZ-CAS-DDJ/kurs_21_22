We seem to have a settled on a team for the research project--we just\nneed to lock in the media people.  Attached is the latest draft of the one\npager.  I'm hoping to get the team discussing and editing the project\ndesign over the holiday so we can present a proposal to HRC at the\nbeginning of Jan.  Fingers crossed.\n\n2. Good discussion about digital and tech.  I think we have some good\ndigital options...she approved setting up an interview process for CTO\ncandidates, since we want someone outside politics for this role and we\nneed outside advice on candidates.\n\n3. Self research: Cheryl, she wanted to keep Heather and the team going\nfrom DC.  I flagged that we will likely need to expand the team to 5-10\npeople, which she seemed fine with.  I also flagged that self research is\nso integral to rapid response, vetting, content, etc that we'd probably\nwant a contingent in HQ to prevent bottlenecks.  We agreed I'd loop back\nwith you to discuss options--I think a hybrid model may work.  Let's\ndiscuss.\n\n4. We had a good discussion about communications.  John there are some WH\npeople I'd like to discuss.  I'll follow up.  Any names welcome!\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Dec 17, 2014 at 1:41 PM, Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com> wrote:\n>\n> Meant to email sooner that she was seeing Pollack and Anzalone today.\n> She seemed to like both of them and basically told them both they would be\n> part of this initial plan.
