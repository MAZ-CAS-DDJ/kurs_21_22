Mika said that was entertainment. It shines a light on how\ndonors feel completely entitled by this process. Every time anyone picks a\nfight with him, Trump says you actually hit me up for campaign\ncontributions two years ago. Willie Geist said Trump thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s in first\nbecause he\xe2\x80\x99s being himself and providing an alternative to the politicians.\nFor now, it\xe2\x80\x99s a show and most people don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99ll get far enough that\nthey need to look at his policy proposals. Most polls are Trump, Bush, and\nWalker in the top three, and it must be frustrating for everyone else. New\npolls out this morning, Trump has negative favorability ratings in Iowa,\nColorado, and Virginia. HRC does not have much higher approval ratings,\nexcept in Virginia. HRC is upside down by 23 in Iowa, by 9 in Virginia, and\n23 as well in Colorado. Chuck Todd said if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for Trump, the\nbiggest story of the summer would be HRC solidifying herself within the\nDemocratic party. Both parties are seeing its populist base \xe2\x80\x9cflex its\nmuscles\xe2\x80\x9d and who have felt marginalized by this economy, the political\nestablishment, and the media. When HRC is the focal point of the Democratic\nparty, her numbers go down. In Iowa, HRC would lose to Rubio, Walker, and\nBush by 5-10 points according to the new Quinnipiac poll. In Colorado, she\nis also losing to the three Republicans by 5-10 points as well. In\nVirginia, she performs better but still losing to the three Republicans by\n1-3 points. Said HRC\xe2\x80\x99s numbers are a reflection of a lot of people\xe2\x80\x99s\nestrangement from the political process and HRC just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t wear well.\nImmigration put Trump on the map and it\xe2\x80\x99s not just dissatisfaction about\npolitical process, it\xe2\x80\x99s that Republicans are trying to appeal to Hispanics.\nIf Trump runs as third party candidate, it will hurt Bush badly in a\npotential HRC/Bush match up.\n\n*CNN\'s New Day: *Donald Trump gave Lindsey Graham\'s personal phone number\nto hundreds of people at a rally in South Carolina. Trump once was a\nDemocrat. Mel Martinez, former chairman of the RNC, supports Jeb Bush and\nthinks that Donald Trump\'s success in the polls will wane. John King\nbelieves that if Trump runs as a third party candidate, he will guarantee\nHillary Clinton\'s victory. Commentator states that Trump is his own enemy\nand that he doesn\'t have the political infrastructure that other candidates\nhave. Clip of Donald Trump from a past interview stating that he sees\nhimself as a Democrat because "the economy does better under Democrats." King\nstates the two issues Clinton faces are trust and leadership and polls show\nClinton is showing vulnerabilities in swing states. Juana Summers has\nstrong competition in the right and within the left with Sanders and\nO\'Malley. King states that Kasich, on paper, is a strong candidate but\nSummers states that he needs to get on the debate stage because he has no\nname recognition as of now.\n'
