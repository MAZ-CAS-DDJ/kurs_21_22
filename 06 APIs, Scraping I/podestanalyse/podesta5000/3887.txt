Some participants are asking for a position\n> paper/memo on where Secretary stands on some key issues.\n>\n> I\xe2\x80\x99ve been leading the EU/Russia sub-group effort on the migration crisis,\n> so I have a good idea of how you are formatting the framing memos. This\n> would be a little different, but would you let me take a crack at a 1 pager\n> on issues important to the community, that they can use with their networks?\n>\n> We would also like to let call participants know that something is coming,\n> if that works for you.\n>\n> Thanks and hope to hear back soon.
