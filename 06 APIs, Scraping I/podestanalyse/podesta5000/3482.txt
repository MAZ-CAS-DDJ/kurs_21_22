It's something we all have an opportunity to \ntake part in -- whether it's meeting up at a rally, \ncontacting an elected official, or even starting a \nconversation about the issues that matter to you.\n\nThose first steps are important -- and they're the focus \nof our next summit, where you'll have the chance to meet \nPresident Obama. And whether you're a fledgling \norganizer or an expert, you have an opportunity to make \nyourself heard.\n\nSay you're ready to take a new step to fight for change this \nfall, and you'll be automatically entered for a chance to meet \nthe President at our summit this November:\n\nhttps://my.barackobama.com/Your-Chance-To-Meet-The-President\n\nWe already know more battles are looming -- there's no \ndoubt that for a lot of folks, kitchen table conversations are \nheating up. \n\nWhen it comes to issues like equality for all and a smart \nbudget, if we want to see real success, we've got to be \nready to work for it -- and for many, that means getting \nback in touch with the basics of community organizing.\n\nOFA has resources to help just about anybody who's \ninterested -- whether it's our Connect platform, our \ngrassroots network, online resources like our climate \ntraining site, or our letter to the editor tool, we couldn't be \nprouder to offer many next steps for millions of organizers.\n\nThat's why I'm so excited about this summit.
