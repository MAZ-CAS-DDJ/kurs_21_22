NEA is concerned their VT affiliate could do a Tuesday (next week)\nrecommendation of endorsement (with potential press release).  This is not\nconfirmed.  The bigger concern is that RI and MA might go with VT as well.\nMA holds significant weight on their PAC committee.  This doesn't pose\nserious concern for the NEA overall endorsement, its a optics problem\nheaded into the RA.  NH NEA is poised to endorse HRC, but so far that\naffiliate is the only one we know ready to go.  Iowa is not there yet.  I\nam working with Carrie Pugh on options to head this off.  On Monday night,\nNEA is hosting a member teletown hall where we'll know more on where\nmembers and leaders are currently.\n\nI'm working on options for outreach to NEA and state affiliates for you to\nconsider very soon.  Please let me know any guidance you might have here.\n\n2.  The IAFF endorsement is moved to September 2015.  They are able to\nschedule a date anytime after their Redmond Conference at the end of\nAugust.  This would be a event scheduled in Iowa.\n\nTrade Update:\nFocus continues on the 14 Senate Democrats that voted for TPA/TAA in the\nSenate.  Top targets are Shaheen, Bennett, Coons, Heitkamp, Cantwell and\nWarner.  Shaheen is giving labor the most heart burn.  Cloture vote is\nstill expected on Tuesday.  Special note, because of the trade movement in\nboth chambers the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (top priority for\nNEA/AFT) vote has been pushed in the Senate to August.\n\n-- \nNikki Budzinski\nLabor Outreach Director\nHillary for America\n646-854-1442 (direct)\n\n<6.19.15.xlsx>\n"
