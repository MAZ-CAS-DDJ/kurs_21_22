To sign your organization on please\ncontact Ross Wallen at **rwallen@usaction.org* <rwallen@usaction.org>*,\n202-263-4573. *\n\n*Dear Members of Congress:***\n\n\n\nThe undersigned organizations represent millions of Americans with a\ntremendous stake in the outcome of the ongoing budget process. As Congress\ndebates the debt ceiling, automatic spending cuts and spending in 2013 and\ngoing forward, our organizations urge you to ensure adequate funding to\npreserve the basic functions of government and real security for all our\npeople.\n\n\n\nThere are two paths toward accomplishing this goal and both must be\nfollowed. First, additional new revenues must be enacted. President Obama\nhas identified at least $600 billion in new revenues if the wealthiest\nAmericans are required to pay their fair share. We can raise more than $600\nbillion by closing tax loopholes for corporations, for the wealthiest 2\npercent and for companies that outsource jobs overseas.\n\n\n\nSecond and just as important: we must rein in wasteful Pentagon spending.\nWe believe Pentagon spending should be cut by a minimum of $500 billion to\n$550 billion over 10 years \x96 similar to the automatic cuts to the Pentagon\nthat go into effect beginning in March if Congress does not act (the\n\x93sequester\x94). We note that many military experts say cuts could be as high\nas $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion over the next decade without compromising\nnational security.\n\n\n\nPentagon spending, which comprises more than half of the current\ndiscretionary budget, continues to absorb the lion\x92s share of the money\nCongress appropriates. Without more cuts to Pentagon spending, even very\ndeep cuts to all other discretionary funding taken together will fall far\nshort of alleviating deficit spending and the rising debt.\n\n\n\nWe view reining in wasteful Pentagon spending as a mandate. We must stop\npaying for the things we don\x92t need so that we can afford to pay for the\nthings we do need. This includes Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food\nstamps, and the Affordable Care Act. And it includes discretionary domestic\nprograms such as Head Start, nutrition aid, job training, education and\ncancer screening, just to name a few.\n\n\n\nAs a community of advocates, we are committed to creating good jobs here in\nAmerica, providing our families with security and building a brighter\nfuture for our children.  If we invest some of the billions we spend on the\nPentagon in other sectors of our economy, we would actually generate MORE\njobs, strengthening the middle class and protecting essential services that\nhelp our families. Economists at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst\nfound that public dollars invested in clean energy, health care, and\neducation all create significantly more jobs within the U.S. economy than\ninvesting an equivalent amount in the military.** As we struggle with high\nunemployment rates across the nation, this is a critical point to consider.\n\n\n\nWe want a safe and secure nation. The safety of our residents is of utmost\nimportance. Proposals to rein in wasteful Pentagon spending should not\nthreaten that priority. But the Pentagon budget should not be immune from\noversight and fiscal responsibility. Like any other department, the\nPentagon must be held accountable for its spending and be able to prove\nthat its programs are a responsible and worthwhile use of our limited tax\ndollars.\n\n\n\nWe believe budget decisions reflect our values, and we believe that we can\nresponsibly pare down wasteful Pentagon spending without compromising our\nnation\'s security. We can shift from spending on outdated, unnecessary\nweapons to investments in projects that keep us secure and help us prosper-\nfirst responders, teachers, bridges, roads, and rails. As you face some of\nthe most difficult budgeting challenges in our nation\'s history, we urge\nyou to consider all the paths we must embark upon in order to achieve\nresponsible investments at home.\n\n\n\n*Sincerely,** [List in Formation]*\n\n* *\n\n*9to5*\n\n*Action for the Common Good*\n\n*Advocacy for Justice and Peace Committee of the Sisters of St. Francis of\nPhiladelphia*\n\n*Alliance for a Just Society*\n\n*Alliance for Global Justice*\n\n*American Friends Service Committee*\n\n*Americans for Democratic Action*\n\n*Brake the Cycle of Poverty*\n\n*Campaign for America\'s Future*\n\n*Campaign for Community Change*\n\n*Caring Across Generations*\n\n*Center for Conscience & War*\n\n*Center for Effective Government*\n\n*Center for International Policy*\n\n*Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP)*\n\n*Children\'s Defense Fund*\n\n*Cleric of St. Viator Provincial Council (Viatorians)*\n\n*Coalition for Peace Action*\n\n*Coalition on Human Needs*\n\n*Collaborative Center for Justice*\n\n*Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism (CCDS)*\n\n*Community Action Partnership*\n\n*Conference of Major Superiors of Men*\n\n*Courage Campaign*\n\n*CREDO Action*\n\n*Democracy for America*\n\n*Democratic Socialists of America*\n\n*Demos*\n\n*Disciples Justice Action Network*\n\n*Documents International*\n\n*Education Equals Making Community Connections*\n\n*Every Child Matters Education Fund *\n\n*Families USA*\n\n*Fellowship of Reconciliation*\n\n*Feminist Majority*\n\n*Franciscan Action Network*\n\n*Friends Committee on National Legislation*\n\n*Friends of the Earth*\n\n*Grassroots Global Justice Alliance*\n\n*Gray Panthers*\n\n*Greenpeace*\n\n*Historians Against War*\n\n*Independent Living, Inc.*\n\n*Jobs With Justice*\n\n*Just Foreign Policy*\n\n*Leadership Conference of Women Religious*\n\n*Leadership Council, Sinsinawa Dominican Sisters*\n\n*Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns*\n\n*Metropolitan Community Churches*\n\n*Military Families Speak Out*\n\n*MoveOn.org*\n\n*National Advocacy Center of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd*\n\n*National Alliance of HUD Tenants*\n\n*National Black Justice Coalition*\n\n*National Council of Jewish Women*\n\n*National Employment Law Project*\n\n*National Gay and Lesbian Task Force*\n\n*National Health Care for the Homeless Council*\n\n*National Immigration Law Center*\n\n*National Jobs for All Coalition*\n\n*National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty*\n\n*National Low Income Housing Coalition*\n\n*National Network of Abortion Funds*\n\n*National Organization of Legal Services Workers, UAW Local 2320*\n\n*National Priorities Project*\n\n*NETWORK, A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby*\n\n*New Priorities Network*\n\n*Office for Justice, Peace & Integrity of Creation Franciscan Friars (OFM)\nHoly Name Province*\n\n*Peace Action *\n\n*Peace Action West*\n\n*Pentagon Budget Campaign*\n\n*Physicians for Social Responsibility*\n\n*Progressive Democrats of America (PDA)*\n\n*Progressive USA*\n\n*Progressives United*\n\n*Promise the Children (Unitarian Universalist)*\n\n*Rebuild the Dream*\n\n*RootsAction.org*\n\n*School of the Americas Watch (SOA Watch)*\n\n*Service Employees International Union (SEIU)*\n\n*Sisters of Mercy of the Americas, Institute Justice Team*\n\n*Social Justice Ministry of Sacred Heart Catholic Church*\n\n*Social Security Works*\n\n*Sugar Law Center for Economic & Social Justice*\n\n*SumOfUs*\n\n*The Global Justice Institute*\n\n*The Shalom Center*\n\n*U.S. Labor Against the War (USLAW)*\n\n*United Electrical Workers (UE)*\n\n*United for a Fair Economy*\n\n*United For Peace and Justice*\n\n*United Methodist Church, General Board of Church and Society*\n\n*United States Student Association*\n\n*US Missionary Oblates, JPIC*\n\n*US Peace Council*\n\n*USAction*\n\n*Veterans For Peace*\n\n*Voices for Progress*\n\n*VOTE MOB*\n\n*Wider Opportunities for Women*\n\n*Win Without War*\n\n*Women\'s Action for New Directions (WAND)*\n\n\n**The U.S. Employment Effects of Military and Domestic Spending Priorities:\nAn Updated Analysis, University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Department of\nEconomics (December 2011)\n\n-- \n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.
