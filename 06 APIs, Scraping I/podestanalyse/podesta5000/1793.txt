john.podesta@gmail.comb'::: ProgressNow - Advancing Progressive Agendas, State by State ::: \n\n\n\nDear Friends and Colleagues,\n\nBelow are a few great examples of how we are keeping voters informed\nand ready to act against the negative tactics of conservative\npoliticians. This includes exposing a GOP power grab, protecting our\nveterans by ensuring they have access to the health care they deserve,\nand educating voters about harmful anti-voting bills. These are just 3\nof our 21 states doing what we do every day - make progress\nhappen, and happen NOW.\n\nAs always, let me know what you think, or even better, contribute to\nus here.\n\nBest,\nDenise Cardinal\nExecutive Director\nProgressNow\nProgressNow Education\n\n\xa0\nProgress North Carolina Calls on Governor McCroy to Stop the\n"Power Mad Power Grab" in the State Legislature\n\nThe NC General Assembly is now considering a bill that would fire all\nmembers of many regulatory boards and commissions, allowing the\nGovernor and legislators to appoint all new members. The board-packing\nscheme even includes the powerful NC Utilities Commission, which\nregulates our power companies and sets electricity rates.\n\n"This sweeping power grab by Gov. McCrory and a power mad group of\nstate legislators would place special interests above the interests of\nregular citizens and electricity ratepayers," said Gerrick Brenner of\nProgressNC. Community leaders will call on Gov. McCrory to speak up\nand denounce this shameless power grab by members of his own party in\nthe NC General Assembly.\xa0 The "Power Mad Power Grab" media tour\nled by ProgressNC included press conferences in four media markets\nacross NC with C(3) partners Democracy NC, NC WARN, and the NC\nConservation Network. \xa0The campaign includes the website\nwww.powermadpowergrab.com.\n\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=UjgexSQ7dwoELYBRduPW7w\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=Io9RmvOTfYhnRF2SonIUGQ\n\n\nProgress Iowa Stands Up to Protect Veterans from Governor Branstad\n\nAs many as 5,000 uninsured Iowa veterans could be denied access to the\nhealth care they need because Governor Branstad is refusing to expand\nMedicaid.\xa0When our veterans come home, there should be no\nquestion about the level of care they receive.\xa0By expanding\nMedicaid, nearly half of veterans would become eligible for coverage,\nbut the Governor is playing politics with their health.\n\nSeveral Republican Governors have already put politics aside to do\nwhat\'s right and expand Medicaid, which will benefit veterans in their\nstates. If enough of us\xa0tell\xa0Governor Branstad to follow\ntheir lead, we can build pressure to make sure he does right by the\nmen and women who fought to protect our country by giving them the\naccess to health care they deserve. Join Progress IA in protecting our\nveterans by sending Governor Branstad a message today to help ensure\nveterans receive the health care they need.\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=zycJa6Wrzp_XBD_wqeT9uQ\n\n\xa0\n\nProgress Missouri Educates Voters about GOP Anti-Voting Bills\n\nProgress MO is expecting GOP anti-voting proposals (HCS HJRs 5 &\n12, HCS HBs 48 & 216) will be debated in the MO Senate soon, after\nthe House passed the package on party line votes this week. \xa0That\nis why they are making sure that Missourians know all about these\nmisguided bills and constitutional amendments. The anti-voting\nproposals would ultimately prevent law-abiding citizens from voting.\n\nHundreds of thousands eligible Missouri voters lack an unexpired\nMissouri Driver\'s License.\xa0 African Americans, seniors,\npeople with disabilities, working poor and students are twice as\nlikely to lack such ID.\xa0 We should stop the rare cases of\nineligible people casting ballots, but it\'s wrong for Republican\npoliticians to take away the voting rights of millions of eligible\nAmericans in the process. Progress MO is working to ensure that\nAmerica has a voting system that is free, fair, and equally accessible\nto everyone.\n\n\n\n:::\n\nCopyright 2012 ProgressNow\n\nChange your e-mail preferences or unsubscribe: http://www.pnstate.org/site/CO?i=gKVzyQJf7_G-rSJRryYp0260JkBk9QbC&cid=0\n\n'
