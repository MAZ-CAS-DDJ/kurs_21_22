Many thanks.  Michael\n\nFrom: John Podesta [mailto:John.Podesta@ptt.gov]\nSent: Tuesday, November 11, 2008 10:54 AM\nTo: Michael Deich\nSubject: RE: Meeting request from Bill Gates\n\nme.

His talk will focus on US education and foreign assistance programs.\n\nBill is hoping to meet ever so briefly with the President-elect or the Vice President-elect to discuss these issues.  I recognize that this request comes late and that the demands on their time must be overwhelming, but hope against hope that such a meeting might be feasible.  (If they are in Chicago and/or Delaware on the 4th, Bill would of course be happy to leave DC early and meet there instead.)  Is there someone on your staff that I could work with on this?\n\nThanks so much for considering this request.\n\nAll my best,\n\nMichael\n\nMichael Deich\nDirector, Policy and Government Affairs\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation\nV +1.202.662.8139 | C +1.202.230.7893 | F +1.202.220.6799\n\nwww.gatesfoundation.org<http://www.gatesfoundation.org>\n\n\n'
