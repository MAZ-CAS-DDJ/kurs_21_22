The call was\njoined by the other original founders of the anti-privatization campaign\n-- including AFSCME International President Gerald McEntee; John\nSweeney, President of the AFL-CIO; Edward Coyle, Executive Director of\nthe Alliance for Retired Americans; and William McNary, President of\nUSAction. Last week, Senator McCain called Social Security as it was\noriginally conceived more than 70 years ago an "absolute disgrace."\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugN8Rn5baqM>    McCain has repeatedly\nreaffirmed his support has reaffirmed his support\n<http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-mccainsocial14-2008jul14,0,1\n786903.story>  at several recent town halls for the same disastrous Bush\nprivatization proposal overwhelming rejected by the American public in\n2005. That plan would divert trillions from the Social Security trust\nfund to pay for risky private accounts, resulting in slashed benefits\nfor millions of seniors, survivors, and people with disabilities. \n\n \n\nAUFC announced an aggressive new online petition drive (CLICK HERE\n<http://www.americansunitedforchange.org/shameonmccain> ) urging Senator\nMcCain to abandon his support for the Bush privatization plan and to\napologize for his recent statement that Social Security is "absolute\ndisgrace."  AUFC also announced plans to highlight the renewed\nBush-McCain privatization plan at the nearly 150 stops on national Bush\nLegacy Bus Tour <http://www.bushlegacytour.com/>  outside the hometown\noffices of Bush\'s enablers in Congress.  Each of the groups announced\nintentions of mobilizing seniors and Americans at events across the\ncountry to show that they still do not support the Bush-McCain plan to\nprivatize Social Security.\n\n \n\nAFSCME International President Gerald McEntee: "We\'re going to tell John\nMcCain:  Do not gamble with Social Security.  Do not play the odds with\nour country\'s retirement security.  Do not roll the dice on a program\nthat has worked for more than 70 years.  The American people need Social\nSecurity benefits they can count on - benefits that aren\'t subject to\nthe highs and lows of the stock market or the partisan proposals of\npoliticians.  At a time of market uncertainty and economic distress,\nonly a politician as out-of-touch as John McCain would suggest that now\nis the time to gamble with Social Security."\n\n \n\n AFL-CIO President John Sweeney: "This month John McCain made clear he\ndoesn\'t understand how Social Security works, and over the course of his\ncareer he has demonstrated that he would seize any opportunity to weaken\nthe program and jeopardize its benefits." \n\n \n\n Caren Benjamin, Deputy Executive Director of Americans United for\nChange: "Americans United for Change was founded in 2005 as a campaign\nto stop President Bush and his allies, including John McCain, from\nprivatizing Social Security.  We were successful then - and will be\nsuccessful again - for a pretty simple reason: Privatizing Social\nSecurity is a profoundly bad idea.  It would turn Social Security from a\nguarantee to a guaranteed gamble.  The risky Bush-McCain privatization\nscheme would slash guaranteed benefits for millions of seniors,\nsurvivors and people with disabilities and explode the national debt --\nall while not adding a day to the life of Social Security. Privatization\nwas a terrible idea in 2005 - it\'s even worse today."\n\n \n\nEdward Coyle, Executive Director of the Alliance for Retired Americans:\n"Forty Two million Americans receive Social Security benefits - these\nare our nation\'s elderly, our widows and widowers, and our young\nchildren who have seen a parent die.  Helping them is not a disgrace.\nSocial Security has kept millions out of poverty, and is one our\nnation\'s greatest success stories.  Our nation\'s retirees are suffering\nfrom skyrocketing gasoline, grocery, and health care prices.  They see\nthe turbulence of our financial markets, and worry about plans,\nadvocated by Senator McCain, to throw a privatized Social Security\nsystem on to this roulette wheel."\n\n \n\n USAction President William McNary: "In 2005 the American people spoke\nloudly and clearly against privatization. Even the Republicans in\nCongress didn\'t support privatization. Now John McCain is coming back\nwith same old song and dance - with the same plan to privatize Social\nSecurity. It was vastly unpopular in 2005 and it is vastly unpopular\nnow. It didn\'t go anywhere then and it won\'t go anywhere now."  \n\n \n\n \n\n-30-\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nJeremy J.
