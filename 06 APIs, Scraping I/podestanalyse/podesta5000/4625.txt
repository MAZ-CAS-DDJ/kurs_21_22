For two days progressives around the country\nhave been calling their Senators and Representatives to say "NO" to the\nBush-Paulson bailout plan. Now news is beginning to come out that, many\nlawmakers are having second thoughts about going along with the\nadministration\'s plan. \n\nKey Members are proposing serious changes to the Bush-Paulson bailout\nplan that would start putting Main Street first and insisting that no\nblank checks be given to corporate CEO\'s.\n\nBut we need to keep it up. The proposed bailout is still a\n$700,000,000,000 dollar check from our bank accounts to bail out Wall\nStreet. As written, it would be the largest giveaway of public money in\nAmerican history. \n\nFormer Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, said "This is the worst\nfinancial crisis since the Great Depression." We have an historic\nemergency, and it\'s on us to make our voices heard.\n\nThis Thursday, September 25th at 5 pm we need to organize Emergency\nRallies against the Bailout nationwide.\n\nSTART AN EMERGENCY RALLY AGAINST THE BAILOUT NOW:\n<http://act.truemajority.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=wrsqbmY6atc6hDyZj5WN1dL\n1ihcynus2> \n\nTo setup events:   http://www.truemajority.org/NoBailout/Event\n<http://www.truemajority.org/NoBailout/Event/> \n\nTo find an existing event in your area:\nhttp://www.truemajority.org/NoBailout/Search\n<http://www.truemajority.org/NoBailout/Search/> \n\nOnce you pick a time and place we\'ll help turnout other progressives to\nyour event and provide signs you can print out and a sample program. The\nmost important thing is for you to pick a spot where you\'ll be seen and\nstart inviting other people you know right now.\n\nTogether we\'ll send a clear message that America Says NO! to the\nBush-Paulson Bailout!\n\n<<Signoff>>\n\n \n\n \n\nAFSC 1-800# and Disclaimer\n\n \n\nPhone Number:           1-800-473-6711\n\n \n\nDisclaimer\n\n \n\nThis toll-free number is provided courtesy of the American Friends\nService Committee, a Quaker organization which works for economic\njustice and peace (www.afsc.org <http://www.afsc.org> ).
