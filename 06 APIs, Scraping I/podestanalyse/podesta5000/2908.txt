But what if I told you that the casino\nindustry\nin Colorado thinks it should get a tax cut--just because times are\ntough?\n\nYou\'d ask what makes them so special, wouldn\'t you?\n\nIt\'s hard to believe, but this is exactly what almost happened.\nA few weeks ago, the casino industry convinced the Colorado Limited\nGaming Control Commission to lower taxes on casino profits--right\nafter voters approved Amendment 50 in 2008, which allowed casinos to\ntake much bigger bets and introduce new casino games to raise\nadditional revenue for our state\'s underfunded community\ncolleges. Many organizations including ProgressNow Colorado supported\nAmendment 50; not because we wanted more gambling, but because our\ncolleges desperately need the help!\n\nFortunately, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper didn\'t stand\nfor it. Last week, Hickenlooper asked for the resignation of the\nentire\ngaming commission after they refused to reconsider their terrible\ndecision to\ncut taxes on the casino industry at the expense of community colleges.\n(Denver Post, 7/7/2011) Now, Gov.\nHickenlooper is being attacked by Republicans like House Speaker\nFrank\nMcNulty for refusing to allow casinos to receive a tax cut while our\nschools\nsuffer.\n\nClick here: tell Gov. Hickenlooper that you support our\nschools over casinos just like he does!\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=rtFwHoB4KEMm2P3e3Jx9OA..\n\nIn his statement announcing the replacement of all members of the\ngaming commission, Gov. Hickenlooper summed up the issue brilliantly:\n"Gaming should be subject to the same risks and rewards of\noperating and expanding as other industries that don\'t have the same\nability to change their tax rate based on market conditions. Colorado\ncasinos pay among the lowest tax rates in America, and to lower them\neven further in these times of unmet needs in local communities makes\nit appear they are diverting their fair and rightful obligation onto\ntheir neighbors in the rest of the state."\n\nThis was a brave show of support for our community colleges, and just\nplain sensible fiscal policy.\xa0 Gov. Hickenlooper needs to know\nthat progressives are behind him as he fights back against bad ideas\nlike this one. It\'s also not over: the new commission must still\nvote to undo the previous commission\'s vote to cut casino taxes.\nClick here to show your support for our community colleges over\ncasinos, and tell Gov. Hickenlooper that you\'ll have his back\nevery time he does the right thing.\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=JAJJq6gCzAEsvYSl2OuiAQ..\n\nThanks,\n\nAlan Franklin\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from all future email, paste the following URL into your browser:\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/CO?i=AYuNDbvp4Y1tjDHQHxv_vDURBngnsUfc&cid=1181 \n'
