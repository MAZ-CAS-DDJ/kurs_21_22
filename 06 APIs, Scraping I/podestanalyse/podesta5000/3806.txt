john.podesta@gmail.comb'What about having a link on the newsletter (or something on Make Progress) to get people to email CNN saying "why didn\'t you ask one question about the threat of climate change?!\nShame on the press for not even asking the question. (I did notice "I\'m an Energy Voter" ads ran frequently during the debate...maybe they don\'t want to offend the American Petroleum Institute.\n\nW\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n\n> From: Clean Start <cleanstart@thinkprogress.org>\n> Date: December 16, 2015 at 10:05:51 AM CST\n> To: wabrams1@me.com\n> Subject: Clean Start From CAP Action: Spending Bill Includes Sweeping Energy Deal\n> Reply-To: Clean Start <cleanstart@thinkprogress.org>\n> \n> Welcome to Clean Start from the CAP Action War Room, the exclusive energy newsletter from a progressive perspective.

Included in the bill is a massive energy deal that puts an end to the 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports. In addition to lifting the export ban for the first time since the 1970s, the deal also includes \xe2\x80\x9ca five-year extension of the production tax credit for wind energy with a phaseout to 40 percent by 2019, as well as a five-year ratcheting down of the investment tax credit and the \xe2\x80\x98commence construction\xe2\x80\x99 eligibility that solar producers craved,\xe2\x80\x9d according to PoliticoPro. The Land and Water Conservation Fund, America\xe2\x80\x99s best parks program, also got an extension in funding after its expiration in September. The deal also removed almost all major riders House Republicans had intended on attaching, including many to block EPA rules. News of the deal broke during the final Republican presidential primary debate of the year, during which the candidates did not mention climate change once, despite the fact that the debate\xe2\x80\x99s focus was national security.  [PoliticoPro]\n> \n> *FIRST READS*\n> \n> The Major National Security Issue CNN Didn\xe2\x80\x99t Raise During The GOP Debate [ClimateProgress]\n> Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s GOP debate was scheduled just three days after nearly 200 countries adopted a historic climate agreement in Paris. Though the debate focused on national security, touching on ISIS, North Korea and terrorism. But CNN failed to address climate change, which the Pentagon has deemed a major national security threat. Though the candidates would likely disparage the deal, the issue didn\xe2\x80\x99t even come up during the debate that lasted more than two hours and largely focused on the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 strategy to defeat ISIS and to block refugees and immigrants from entering the country. Few of the Republican candidates have spoken out about the agreement, with most choosing to ignore it entirely. Rubio has spoken out against it, calling the whole idea of the global negotiations \xe2\x80\x9cridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n> \n> Congress Reaches Fiscal Agreement Ending U.S. Oil Export Ban [Bloomberg]\n> Congressional leaders unveiled a broad package of spending and tax legislation that would avert a U.S. government shutdown and lift the 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports. House Speaker Paul Ryan told fellow Republicans in a closed-door meeting Tuesday night in Washington that leaders had reached a deal pairing a $1.1 trillion spending bill with a separate measure to revive a series of expired tax breaks. The spending bill would fund the government through September 2016. \xe2\x80\x9cRyan laid out a compelling case to support the deal,\xe2\x80\x9d which includes lifting the oil export ban, said Representative Reid Ribble of Wisconsin.The tax legislation was posted on the House website late Tuesday night, and the spending measure followed it early Wednesday. Senate Democrats were awaiting final language before announcing whether they agree on the plan, a party leadership aide said Tuesday.\n> \n> Record high Arctic temperatures in 2015 having \'profound effects\' on region [The Guardian]\n> The Arctic experienced record air temperatures and a new low in peak ice extent during 2015, with scientists warning that climate change is having \xe2\x80\x9cprofound effects\xe2\x80\x9d on the entire marine ecosystem and the indigenous communities that rely upon it. The latest National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) report card on the state of the Arctic revealed the annual average air temperature was 1.3C (2.3F) above the long-term average \xe2\x80\x93 the highest since modern records began in 1900. In some parts of the icy region, the temperature exceeded 3C (5.4F) above the average, taken from 1981 to 2010. This record heat has been accompanied by diminishing ice. The Arctic Ocean reached its peak ice cover on 25 February \xe2\x80\x93 a full 15  days earlier than the long-term average and the lowest extent recorded since records began in 1979.\n> \n> *QUICK LINKS* \n> \n> NASA: 2015 Will Be \xe2\x80\x98A Scorcher Relative To All Other Years\xe2\x80\x99 On Record [ClimateProgress]\n> \n> Paris agreement \xe2\x80\x98does not need Senate approval\xe2\x80\x99 say officials [Climate Home]\n> \n> Agriculture Was Left Out Of The Paris Deal, But That Won\xe2\x80\x99t Stop Countries From Taking It On [ClimateProgress]\n> \n> Report: Atlantic Drilling Would Offer $0 To States, Not $19 Billion [ClimateProgress]\n> \n> Coal lobby boss says industry \'will be hated like slave-traders\' after COP21 [The Guardian]\n> \n> Aircraft pollution a worrisome gap in Paris deal: EU climate boss [Reuters]\n> \n> Has the Paris Agreement moved markets already?
