Given the size of our teams, accommodating this request would be tough, but stepping back, generally, how do we want to accommodate labor?  Earlier we discussed outreach, particularly on personnel, but her email indicates that they assume something beyond that.\n \nMel\n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: Maria Echaveste [mailto:mechaveste@nvgllc.com]\nSent: Sun 10/26/2008 11:11 AM\nTo: lisabrown3660@gmail.com; Melody Barnes\nSubject: labor candidates for agency review\n\n\n\nHi Lisa and Melody, Change to Win finally got some names down for consideration for agency review teams and advisors, etc-which Joseph Geevarghese,a policy person over there, asked me to provide to you all-.  Some of the names are definitely worth considering-I know some of the folks on the list and can give you some thoughts (would rather not do in writing, if you know what I mean).  But given that the teams are going to be small, maybe this list is good for a couple of additions and the rest can be part of the outreach effort.  Let me know how I can help you in the days to come, Maria \n\n"
