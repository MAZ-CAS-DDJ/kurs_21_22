It's past time we took the same approach to addressing gun violence and its time to start treating mass shootings as an epidemic.\n\nToday, I introduced a bill to help stop gun violence and prevent mass shootings. The Gun Violence Research Act will allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct critical research into the causes of mass shootings and how to prevent them. The bill will also empower doctors and physicians to have thoughtful, engaging dialogue with their patients about gun violence.\n\nIt is my hope that by conducting research into the causes of gun violence, we can better identify warning signs, address any loopholes in oversight, and get people who are prone to gun violence the assistance they need.\n\nTo read more about my bill, click here. http://www.contracostatimes.com/news/ci_29071546/mike-honda-pitches--gun-violence-research-act-\n\nWe cannot continue to turn a blind eye toward this issue. The Gun Violence Research Act is a step toward preventing future gun violence and mass shootings.\n\nDemocratically yours,\n\nMike\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n|    Paid For By Mike Honda for Congress    |\n---------------------------------------------\n\nHonda for Congress\n2050 Gateway Pl\nSuite 100, PMB 218\nSan Jose CA 95110 United States\n\nIf you believe you received this message in error or wish to no longer receive email from us, please https://act.myngp.com/el/-8373034479122381056/-5565736196806539520."
