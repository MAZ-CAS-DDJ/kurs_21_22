A "personhood" measure too extreme even for voters in Mississippi and North Dakota. Not one, but two bills to end the designation of schools as gun-free zones. That\'s just some of the legislation Republicans rolled out in the first 48 hours of the new Congress.\n\nDoes this sound to you like a GOP chastened by November\'s shellacking and laser-focused on putting the country\'s fiscal house in order? Not by a long shot.\n\nThanks to you, these bills will meet brick-wall opposition from the formidable pro-choice Democratic women we just helped elect to Congress. But we\'ve got to stop these folks once and for all -- and that means re-electing our women senators and wresting the Speaker\'s gavel from John Boehner\'s hands. And we simply can\'t do it without you.\n\nHelp elect the progressive women who\'ll put the Speaker\'s gavel back in Nancy Pelosi\'s hands -- become an EMILY\'s List member for the special, limited-time rate of $10. \n\nWe sent Republicans a clear message in 2012 -- one Cantor, Ryan, and the Tea Party faithful are just plain ignoring. After taking the country to the brink of the fiscal cliff and letting the Violence Against Women Act expire, they\'re now threatening showdowns on both new common-sense gun policies and the debt ceiling.\n\nIn other words, they\'re not letting up for a minute -- and neither can we.\n\nWe\'ve got to defend Senators Kay Hagan and Jeanne Shaheen, send enough Democratic women to take back the House, and elect women governors to fight emboldened anti-choice forces in the states. That means planning and executing our proven research, recruitment, and turnout strategies, which have made the winning difference for our candidates year after year. Please lock in your EMILY\'s List membership so we can start today. \n\nDespite the polarization and dysfunction in Congress, tough and inspiring women are -- thanks to you -- holding the GOP accountable and fighting for our progressive ideals: Carolyn McCarthy and Dianne Feinstein, spearheading tough new gun safety laws; Barbara Mikulski, making history as the first woman to chair the Senate Appropriations Committee. Women matter -- and so does your support. Please join EMILY\'s List today. \n\nThanks so much for standing with EMILY\'s List and our incredible women leaders.\n\nWarmest regards,\n\nEllen R.
