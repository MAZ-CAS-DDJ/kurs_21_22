john.podesta@gmail.comb'John -- \n\nLast week, yet another horrific act of gun violence shook \nAmericans around the country.\n \nThat means there are more American families -- moms, \ndads, children -- whose lives have been changed forever.\n\nThese tragedies are heartbreaking -- yet every time they \nhappen, the conversation moves on, without any meaningful \naction to prevent another tragedy. We can\'t throw up our \nhands and accept this kind of brutality as our new normal -- \nas President Obama said last week, "Our thoughts and \nprayers are not enough."\n\nIt\'s up to organizers to demand better from Congress. We \nworked for progress at the state level, and common-sense \nlaws designed to strengthen background checks on gun \nsales passed through tough legislatures.\n\nBut Congress has done nothing, and we can\'t accept that. \nWe won\'t stop calling for action until Congress makes \nchanges at the national level. \n\nWe\'re going to keep demanding reform, especially in the \ncoming weeks. Starting today, OFA supporters are calling \ntheir representatives and your member of Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton, \nshould hear from you, too.\n \nHere\'s Rep. Holmes Norton\'s phone number -- ask her to commit \nto do something about gun violence:\n\n     (202)225-8050 \n\nAfter you get in touch, take a minute to let us know how your call \nwent -- supporters will be taking to Twitter to call out representatives \nwho refuse to do something about gun violence:\n\nhttps://my.barackobama.com/Tell-Us-How-The-Call-Went\n\nWhile no one common sense reform will prevent every tragedy, \nsitting by and doing nothing is beneath us. Americans \noverwhelmingly agree on a number of policy changes that will \nhelp keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn\'t have them. \n\nThe problem lies with a vocal minority that has prevented the \nsort of action we need from Congress. But we can\'t treat our \ngun violence epidemic as an unchangeable fact of American \nlife. And we can\'t let our representatives off the hook because \nspecial interests are lobbying against taking action.\n\nIf Congress is going to act on this issue, they need to feel the \npressure from the vast majority of Americans that want reform. \nThey need to hear it from folks like you.\n\nCall Rep. Holmes Norton at (202)225-8050 and ask her to commit to act on gun violence -- then let us know how it went:\n\nhttps://my.barackobama.com/Tell-Us-How-The-Call-Went\n\nThanks,\n\nJennifer\n\nJennifer Warner\nNational Organizing Director\nOrganizing for Action\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for Action\n\nContributions or gifts to Organizing for Action are not tax deductible.\n\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo update your address, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/change-address?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe from these messages, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscription\nOrganizing for Action, P.O.
