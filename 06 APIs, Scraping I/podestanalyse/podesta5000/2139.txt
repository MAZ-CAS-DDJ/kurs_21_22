john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dan and I suggest for the lede, which is derived from the Urban League:\n\n\n\nWhen I started my life in public service four decades ago, it was to tear\ndown the barriers that hold people back from developing their talents and\nachieving their dreams. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m still fighting for today.\n\n\n\nBut more than half a century after Rosa Parks sat and Dr. King marched and\nJohn Lewis bled, race still plays too big a part in determining who gets\nahead in America\xe2\x80\x94and who gets left behind.\n\n\n\nNew kicker taking this thread\xe2\x80\x99s feedback into account:\n\n\n\nIt really comes down to this. We need to pass laws and fund programs. But\nwe also need to do real work at our kitchen tables, in our offices, and on\nour streets. Because the way we make progress endure is by changing the\nhabits of our hearts. Seeing the humanity in everyone around us. And, above\nall, teaching our children to treat others with kindness. That empathy is\nwhat makes it possible for people from every background, race, and religion\nto come together as one nation\xe2\x80\x94the United States of America.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*From:* Karen Finney [mailto:kfinney@hillaryclinton.com]\n*Sent:* Wednesday, November 4, 2015 7:02 PM\n*To:* Jennifer Palmieri <jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Cc:* Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com>; Kristina Costa <\nkcosta@hillaryclinton.com>; Speech Drafts <speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Subject:* Re: DRAFT: Op-ed on plan for communities of color\n\n\n\nAgree.

It\xe2\x80\x99s a strength that\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s speaking out on it but without a  powerful ending or nut graph that\nsums the call to action for the soul of America, this will be OK but it\nwill largely be a litany of a policies.\n\n\n\nWe could leave out the \xe2\x80\x9cso my friends\xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d Intro and use this graph.
