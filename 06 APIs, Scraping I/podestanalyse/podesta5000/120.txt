At a minimum, this means staying informed on issues and voting during elections. This is particularly important for young people, as the policies that lawmakers put in place today will impact their wellbeing in the future.\n\nIn our district, instead of encouraging the democratic process and allowing it to thrive, elected officials have deliberately tried to marginalize the democratic process (http://www.gothamgazette.com/index.php/government/5873-candidates-allege-wright-unfairly-influences-elections) .\n\nBut we have to do better than that as a community. Last week, I had the opportunity to speak with young professionals from around New York about the importance of participating in elections. And tomorrow, I will be attending a Voter Registration Mixer (https://youngharlem.splashthat.com/) for young adults in the community. I encourage you to attend or share with your friends and family.\n\nA better future for everyone requires more civic participation from everyone. It\xe2\x80\x99s time that we reject the practices of our elected politicians and instead encourage more people to be part of the process.\n\nClyde\n\n============================================================\n** (http://www.twitter.com/)\n** (http://www.facebook.com)\n** (http://mailchimp.com)\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2016 Clyde Williams for Congress, All rights reserved.\nClyde Williams for Congress\n\nContact us at\ncontact@clyde2016.com\n\nWant to change how you receive these emails?\nYou can ** update your preferences (http://clyde2016.us11.list-manage.com/profile?u=13d0c4ee04919a2127f6c5960&id=804e337017&e=30c8959f18)\nor ** unsubscribe from this list (http://clyde2016.us11.list-manage1.com/unsubscribe?u=13d0c4ee04919a2127f6c5960&id=804e337017&e=30c8959f18&c=4479cd143d)'
