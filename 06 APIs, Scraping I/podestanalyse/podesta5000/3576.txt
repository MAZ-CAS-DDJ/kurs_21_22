He thinks that we should get a better balance in the paragraph on the wraparound of how deal should be judged in broader context.  \nSuggest this: \nAs a result, America is less competitive than we should be.

But based on what I know so far, I can\xe2\x80\x99t support this agreement.\n \nAs I have said many times, we need to be sure that new trade deals meet clear tests:  They have to create good American jobs, raise wages, and advance our national security.  The bar has to be set very high for two reasons. \n \nFirst, too often over the years we haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten the balance right on trade.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that even a strong deal, like our agreement with South Korea, which President Bush negotiated and President Obama improved, can fall short on delivering the promised benefits.  So I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we can afford to keep giving new agreements the benefit of the doubt.  The risks are too high that, despite our best efforts, they will end up doing more harm than good for hard-working American families whose paychecks have barely budged in years. \n \nSecond, we can\xe2\x80\x99t look at this in a vacuum.  Years of Republican obstruction at home have weakened U.S. competitiveness and made it harder for Americans who lose jobs and pay because of trade to get back on their feet.  Republicans have blocked the investments that we need and that President Obama has proposed in infrastructure, education, clean energy, and innovation.  They\xe2\x80\x99ve refused to raise the minimum wage or defend workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights or adequately fund job training.
