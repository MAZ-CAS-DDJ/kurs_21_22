When many in positions of power turned a blind eye, it was groups\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> like ACT UP, Gay Men\xe2\x80\x99s Health Crisis, and others that came forward to\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> shatter the silence.

For\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> starters, we should call on Republican governors to put people\xe2\x80\x99s health and\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> well-being ahead of politics and extend Medicaid, which would provide\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> health care to those living with HIV/AIDS.
