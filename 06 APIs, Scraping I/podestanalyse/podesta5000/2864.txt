Will you chip in and help us win?\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=XIbBD-IEDsxQepVvidkgwg\n\nJohn\xa0--\n\nThe FEC Deadline is this Sunday, September 30th. Eight critical Senate seats are up for grabs - New Mexico, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Arizona, Montana, Nevada, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Chip in with a donation\xa0today to help LCV Victory Fund win: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=0vESaxd4SiBLDklH8l_j5Q .\n\nOur eight priority Senate races are still up for grabs - less than six weeks from Election Day.\n\nIn addition to LCV-backed Senate candidates in Montana, Massachusetts, Arizona and Virginia, there are also four current House members - all of whom are environmental champions\xa0 - running for Senate: Rep. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Rep. Shelley Berkley of Nevada, Rep. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, and Rep. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin.\n\nAll of them are running even with their opponents or are just beginning to pull ahead. We can win all these races, but everything will come down to voter turnout.\n\nSo far, more than 1,538 supporters have donated to help expand LCV Victory Fund's field efforts and put these environmental champions ahead. If you made a gift, thank you! We're grateful that you've been able to help. LCV Victory Fund urgently needs to reach our goal of $120,000 for canvassing and get-out-the-vote efforts by this Sunday, September 30th - the FEC deadline.\xa0On Monday, October 1st, our campaign field team is expected to assess resources and prioritize races for the final weeks of this election. I don't want to leave any winnable Senate races out, so please make a gift today.\n\nDonate to LCV Victory Fund - environmental champions from coast to coast are in close, tough races. Your donation could mean the difference between victory and defeat on November 6th. Will you chip in today?\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=ThAhQqDkYL3m0IPwJ2eUQA\n\nThe four House members running for Senate all have stellar lifetime scores on LCV's National Environmental Scorecard. Rep. Baldwin has a 97 percent score, Rep. Berkley's score is 87 percent, Rep. Murphy's score is 98 percent, and Rep. Heinrich has a 95 percent score.\n\nThese four are great examples of the types of leaders we want to help move from the House to the Senate - but all four are running in TOUGH races. If we want to protect decades of sound environmental protections - and advance new environmental policies -\xa0 we must help them win on November 6th.\n\nWe really need your support right away. These environmental champions are kicking their campaigns into high gear, so now is the moment to launch LCV's game-changing tactics. Big Oil and other polluting interests have disastrous plans for our planet's future, and it's time to buckle down and defeat them - and their candidates -- at the ballot box.\n\nLet's put these four environmental champions in the Senate. We can do this. Will you chip in with a donation today?\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=hug8mws4lj7KooA6fIsUKA\n\nWhile these four races are a priority for us, we are also organizing and mobilizing in key Senate battleground races like Montana, Massachusetts, Virginia, and Arizona - races that also feature a sharp contrast between candidates who support Big Oil's agenda and candidates who support clean energy policies. Your donation will help us ensure that we've got the resources to go door-to-door, make phone calls, send hard-hitting mail and run aggressive media campaigns in all of our targeted Senate races.\n\nNow is the time to make your gift. If you've been sitting on the sidelines, now is the time to get in the game. We need your support! The next few weeks are absolutely critical and the September 30th FEC deadline is just days away.\xa0Please donate today: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=wTDgm_6LqSqmmB0QK0RMfA .\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nGene Karpinski\nPresident\nLCV Victory Fund\n\nPaid for by the LCV Victory Fund, 202.785.8683, and not authorized by\nany candidate or candidate's committee.\n\n\n\nUpdate Your Profile\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=0x8xsjEuTxwscC2wKx0v_g\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=cR5TWeDtK9b6jgb-0D21NEU9GZpsPAI7&cid=0\n\n1920 L Street, NW Suite 800\nWashington, DC 20036\n202-785-8683\n\n"
