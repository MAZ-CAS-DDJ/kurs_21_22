We do need to be careful not to bill this as our\ncollege affordability plan but we can lay seeds of what needs to be\naddressed and make clear we\'ll say more soon.\n\nBig policy speech next week is wage growth/Econ framing and we can have\nthis be more about growth + opportunity for those already in debt.\n\nBrian - Do you want to add anything to my summary?\n\nAlso, Mike V - I totally agree they O\'Malley is likely to roll something\nout that NH won\'t be able to take advantage of - and we should get friends\nin NH to point that out!!\n\n\nAnn O\xe2\x80\x99Leary\nSent from my iPhone\n(510) 717-5518 (cell)\n\nOn Jul 7, 2015, at 1:15 PM, Mike Vlacich <mvlacich@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nI am curious what O\'Malley\'s proposal would mean for NH students, will it\neven help them given our state funding challenges?  That is why there was\nsome hesitation in rolling debt free in NH rather than other places.\n\nTo Robby\'s point, I do worry about this now. I am worried that HRC will be\nasked about debt free college in the q and a phase and unless we are\nplanning to propose something in the future that is bolder than Bernie and\nO\'Malley, the story might have people saying they are "disappointed" or\nthat "it falls short".\n\nThere are ways to work around this.  Unsure if its worth having a quick\nchat or we can hash out over email.\n\n\nOn Tue, Jul 7, 2015 at 3:58 PM, Robby Mook <re47@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\n> This has always been my concern with doing re-fi first.
