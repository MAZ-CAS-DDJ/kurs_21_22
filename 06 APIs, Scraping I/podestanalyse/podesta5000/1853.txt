That may not ge true on what they\nseparately post on cbsn or cbsnews.com. The post debate release issue did\nnot come up and we can raise it just to chase this to ground\n\nOn Nov 4, 2015, at 10:44 AM, Teddy Goff <tgoff@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\nI spoke to Charlie both before and after his meeting with CBS and have to\nsay I am actually not overly concerned by the current plan. My\nunderstanding is that they acknowledge Twitter discussion is not a\nstatistically valid measure of public opinion and accordingly will not be\ndoing the thing that would have really put us at a disadvantage, which is\nrunning some sort of sentiment tracker in the chyron as if it were a dial\ntest. If they want to pull curated tweets into the video player on their\nwebsite and use Twitter to source questions, I think that is fine; the\nformer is no big deal and the latter not materially different than taking\nquestions from the audience or anyone else.\n\nCharlie, one thing I neglected to ask about yesterday, that we might want\nto follow up with them on, is their post-game plans. Are we assured that\nthey are not going to do some sort of joint release after the fact\nhighlighting Twitter reactions and positioning them as an indicator of who\nwon the debate?\n\nRegardless, we should still of course do our best to influence the Twitter\ndiscussion just as we would with any other debate. I agree with Jen that\nthere is little we can do to move the masses. Frankly, the single best\nthing we can do on that front is try to encourage WJC\'s team to tweet from\nhis account as often as they are willing to during the debate -- adding\nSara here to see if there is any room for us to do that.\n\nThe fact that this is all happening on a Saturday night is an interesting\nwild card that I would guess probably plays to our advantage, in that a lot\nof the young Bernie crowd may be out and about and not watching.\n\n\nOn Wed, Nov 4, 2015 at 8:50 AM, Jennifer Palmieri <\njpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\n> Okay.\n>\n> Podium sign will reveal to America how mysoginistc their fellow citizens\n> are.
