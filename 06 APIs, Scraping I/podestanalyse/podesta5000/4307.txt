I could not have done it without you.\n\nIn 2012, I ran against two political machines - and outperformed expectations.  I earned the strong endorsements of both the New York Times (http://clydewilliams2016.us11.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=13d0c4ee04919a2127f6c5960&id=8a2a2f8e49&e=30c8959f18) and Daily News (http://clydewilliams2016.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=13d0c4ee04919a2127f6c5960&id=4e82f8a679&e=30c8959f18) . Despite very aggressive efforts to try and hold me back, I was able to remain financially competitive (http://clydewilliams2016.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=13d0c4ee04919a2127f6c5960&id=95dfd05d41&e=30c8959f18) throughout the cycle, out-raising Congressman Rangel in 2 of 3 quarters.  Most importantly, I built a racially and socio-economically diverse base of support (http://clydewilliams2016.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=13d0c4ee04919a2127f6c5960&id=a658ab319e&e=30c8959f18) across every neighborhood in the District.\n\nNow, for the first time in nearly 50 years, NY-13 will be an open seat \xe2\x80\x93 and I believe 2016 may offer the best opportunity for me to run - and to win.\n\nIt will be a crowded field.  But my likely challengers will be tied to the corrupt politics of Albany (http://clydewilliams2016.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=13d0c4ee04919a2127f6c5960&id=d57520f5ba&e=30c8959f18) and the politics of yesterday.  And the winning candidate will need to attract even more multi-racial support (http://clydewilliams2016.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=13d0c4ee04919a2127f6c5960&id=765610dc4b&e=30c8959f18) than Congressman Rangel has over his 40+ years in Congress.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I am going to be meeting with groups across the District with an eye toward running in the 2016 Democratic primary.  I will be talking about my track record of bringing job training, expanded healthcare and improved public safety (http://clydewilliams2016.us11.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=13d0c4ee04919a2127f6c5960&id=1e534a6036&e=30c8959f18) to tackle the needs in the community.  And I will be gauging support for my vision for the future.\n\nIt is time to turn the page on the same old ideas and same old politics that can\xe2\x80\x99t meet the challenges we face in our community and in our country.\n\nAs I embark upon this journey, I hope you will consider supporting me again.  Your financial support will be crucial.
