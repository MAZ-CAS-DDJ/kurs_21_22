Bernie\nSanders (I-VT) hadposed as hotel workers\n<https://www.ralstonreports.com/blog/sanders-workers-are-masquerading-culinary-members-campaign-inside-hotels>\non\nthe Las Vegas Strip in order to preach to members of the Culinary Union \xe2\x80\x94\none of the biggest and most politically influential unions in the key early\ncaucus state.\n\nThe Culinary Union confirmed the reports, telling ThinkProgress in a\nstatement that the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s actions left them \xe2\x80\x9cdisappointed and offended.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s completely inappropriate for any campaign to attempt to mislead\nCulinary Union members, especially at their place of work,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nunion\xe2\x80\x99s Secretary-Treasurer Geoconda Arguello-Kline. \xe2\x80\x9cWe strongly condemn\nanyone falsifying their affiliation with the Culinary Union in order to\ngain access to properties and we will cooperate with casinos and hotels so\nthat this matter is fully resolved.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSanders campaign workers visited four unionized hotels, The Rio, Paris, The\nMirage and Planet Hollywood, and by wearing the union\xe2\x80\x99s iconic yellow\nbutton, accessed employee dining rooms to speak with and give Sanders\nliterature to workers.\n\nThe Sanders campaign did not respond to inquires from ThinkProgress about\nthe incident.\n\nIn 2008, the Culinary Union endorsed Barack Obama\n<http://www.nbcnews.com/id/22575934/#.VqpxDvkrIdW> over Hillary Clinton,\nthough Clinton went on to win the popular vote in the state.\n\nThis year, the union says it will not make an endorsement\n<http://vegasinc.com/business/gaming/2016/jan/27/even-without-endorsing-culinary-union-seeks-to-be/?_ga=1.176306413.937458356.1438887894>\nin\nthe primaries. Instead, they will focus on making sure as many of their\n57,000 members as possible are registered to vote and trained the caucus\nprocess. Many members are naturalized U.S. citizens who will be voting for\nthe first time this year.\n\nIn this election cycle, both Sanders and Clinton have sought endorsements\nfrom unions on the national and local level. Some, including National\nNurses United\n<http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/08/11/3690105/nurses-for-bernie/>,\nAmerican Postal Workers Union, and Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s Steelworkers Union\n<http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/26/bernie-sanders-local-union-endorse-iowa-united-steelworkers>\ncame\nout for Sanders, while the massive Service Employees International Union\n(SEIU) and American Federation of Teachers were among several endorsing\nClinton so far.\n\nUntil now, Nevada\xe2\x80\x99s Culinary Union has maintained a good relationship with\nall three Democratic candidates, who have all traveled to the state to speak\n<http://lasvegassun.com/news/2015/oct/12/clinton-joins-union-protest-at-trump-hotel-in-las/?_ga=1.128515468.1817243056.1453915208>,\nand in some cases march, with hotel workers.\n\nInstead of choosing and stumping for one candidate, the union says it is\nputting its energy into fighting organizing battles at several Vegas\nestablishments, including at the hotel run by Republican frontrunner Donald\nTrump\n<http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/12/17/3732935/trump-hotel-worker-union-fight/>\n.\n'
