Hillary. \xe2\x80\x94 we need to determine if there is a similar technique that addresses the inevitability that comes with the period. What everyone lights to is the design asset that the period provides and can be applied to other words with and without Hillary. However what does not work is the implied emphasis of a period itself. There is no debate on what the core mark would be on this route if there\xe2\x80\x99s another option for the period.\n>>>> \n>>>> 2. H Window \xe2\x80\x94 while there\xe2\x80\x99s lots of positive reaction for this direction there\xe2\x80\x99s also more to do in terms of getting the team and the Secretary comfortable to go on this.  In her feedback on our call her language of \xe2\x80\x9cembracing people, embracing our problems and embracing our future\xe2\x80\x9d was really helpful along with \xe2\x80\x9creaching outwards to inspire upwards."  How do we imbue this approach with an even stronger sense of her passion and motivation behind doing the job? She leans away from Hillary type or Hillary signature, she\xe2\x80\x99s unwilling for this to be so focused on her. While we will maintain this as something to consider, per Mandy and Jim\xe2\x80\x99s input on the Friday call, we are seeking other solutions. So the core mark has to work harder to her mission and/or attributes. The other thing we need to add to this is the contextual relevance of a tagline and/or words as was displayed on the Hillary. approach.  That combination of words and design consistency really compels everyone.  How would we introduce words and/or a tagline within the design route of the H Window?  \n>>>> \n>>>> 3. Something else \xe2\x80\x94 the ideas that have been surfaced on H+You, &, + sign, Together, Us, the President\xe2\x80\x99s # idea and the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s language outlined above need to be explored outside the constraints of the two existing directions. I think the watch out here is to not get too clever or too cutesy with symbols.\n>>>> \n>>>> You will see options within all three routes on our call tomorrow.\n>>>> \n>>>> On the design brief, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working against the version we all emailed and socialized 3 weeks ago and a distillation of the core idea and qualities/attributes was finalized on a call you, Mandy and I had.\n>>>> I recognize there\xe2\x80\x99s new insight since then, if there are core attributes that the design should represent beyond the current brief that would be important to agree on. In the meeting last week the Secretary seemed to associate with what we had identified: fresh yet familiar, tenacity, resilience, empathy, creativity, action-oriented, future focused.\n>>>> \n>>>> As to the Obama parallel, we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed in the presentations that Obama\xe2\x80\x99s campaign execution truly represented a turning point for political branding in presidential campaigns \xe2\x80\x94 they in fact used what many would say were widely accepted brand techniques that companies outside politics historically use \xe2\x80\x94 contemporary colors and iconography, dynamic composition in the mark, the mark to represent truths of the brand, etc.  We all observed in the political campaigns before Obama it was largely typesetting with use of flag imagery, stars and photograph identity as the core design assets used.\n>>>> \n>>>> And this use of branding has a lot to do with why I believe I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\n>>>> And why Pentagram and Michael Beirut are here.\n>>>> \n>>>> As you point out on Michael\xe2\x80\x99s quote below, the Obama visual identity changed how the design and branding community considered political brands.\n>>>> \n>>>> This benchmark sets the stage for a much more branded execution for Secretary Clinton, and quite frankly a fairly high expectation of a branded execution.\n>>>> But at its core, great branding must always reflect the unassailable truths of the brand.\n>>>> And the best, most compelling brands in the world are singular and relentless in their quest to do just this.\n>>>> \n>>>> We have a gift in the Hillary Rodham Clinton brand because of massive recognition/awareness. Obama did not start with this.\n>>>> At the same time we must create a new, fresh view of that familiar brand in a truly authentic and compelling way. \n>>>> \n>>>> To be clear, a logo can communicate and aid attribution of qualities, but it is not a proxy for the messaging of the campaign until they are relentlessly connected and delivered, repeatedly and consistently.\n>>>> That\xe2\x80\x99s when brands take on meaning.\n>>>> \n>>>> As Michael has used previously, no one would look at a red Target logo and think: design for all \xe2\x80\x94 fashionable yet affordable choices for my home and family \xe2\x80\x94 expect more, pay less. But their relentless, contemporary, fashion-forward products and aligned messaging has imbued that logo with meaning just that.\n>>>> \n>>>> Similarly, Apple, the world\xe2\x80\x99s most valuable brand, launched with their rainbow apple mark in 1976. It simply stood for creativity, thinking differently. Their repeated, consistent use of the mark along with some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most creative advertising has imbued that bitten apple logo with meaning but no one would look at that mark standalone and say it means Apple is the leader in human-centered designed, electronic devices with a vision for the future. \n>>>> \n>>>> And non-corporate examples are similarly rich in learnings. The Human Rights Campaign simply uses the equality sign. It\xe2\x80\x99s compelling, simple and speaks to their core \xe2\x80\x94 being a relentless champion of equal rights for humanity. There are plenty of other attributes that are associated with HRC, but equality is their unassailable brand truth.\n>>>> \n>>>> So, here\xe2\x80\x99s the point.  We want to create a visual representation for Secretary Clinton that is equally as compelling, interesting, exciting and inviting as Obama\xe2\x80\x99s mark was eight years ago. And to use techniques that some of the best brands have done and continue to do around the world.  And again, the mark is simply one aspect of a bevy of connection points (messaging, speeches, PR, advertising, web, etc.)\n>>>> \n>>>> And this leads me to explain, if I\xe2\x80\x99ve failed to so far, why the H window approach is so compelling to us.\n>>>> \n>>>> This approach will represent in 2015 what the Obama approach represented in 2007.\n>>>> It literally resets the benchmark for political branding, if not all branding.\n>>>> It is of and for the times leveraging the massive and important shift to customization, personalization and co-creation.\n>>>> And, more importantly, while meeting this marketplace shift the mark is, at the same time, anchored on the unassailable truth of Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s life and career \xe2\x80\x94 being in service of others. It\xe2\x80\x99s not about her, it\xe2\x80\x99s about you. It also meets our brief of fresh yet familiar, it shows creativity and empathy.\n>>>> \n>>>> Now, we have work to do.\n>>>> While this direction is immediately compelling and will fuel advocacy from her fans and drive conversation and content around and for the campaign, we have yet to effectively land its core manifestation.\n>>>> And while we\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it in numerous variations and iterations as it is so flexible to do, we have to have an anchoring point.\n>>>> And in honesty we\xe2\x80\x99ve struggled to land that core mark to everyone\xe2\x80\x99s confidence and liking.\n>>>> \n>>>> We\xe2\x80\x99ll share some more iterations tomorrow.\n>>>> One in particular introduces another attribute \xe2\x80\x94 future-focus \xe2\x80\x94 and a design asset like the period from option 1 that is interesting.\n>>>> \n>>>> But for this conversation, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want our relentless efforts to make the core mark work construed as being obstinate. \n>>>> It\xe2\x80\x99s simply that we believe this approach would be level-setting for the candidate and campaign and are determined to land the core mark so we can reap the benefits of this approach.\n>>>> \n>>>> Some final assurance, you will also see completely new exploration to get a sense of other approaches tomorrow and Michael/Pentagram has added two other senior partners into their effort to engage in the work, the limitation until now was set by us for confidentiality purposes.\n>>>> \n>>>> If you\xe2\x80\x99ve read this far, I appreciate the chance to frame the opportunity, underscore our continued confidence and provide any clarity.\n>>>> \n>>>> A revised deck will be coming shortly.  \n>>>> \n>>>> Thanks. Wendy\n>>>> \n>>>> \n>>>> \n>>>>> On Feb 14, 2015, at 12:33 PM, Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com> wrote:\n>>>>> \n>>>>> All, \n>>>>> I have a nagging concern that was reinforced at the meeting on Wednesday and while it\xe2\x80\x99s not keeping me up at night I just want to share it with the three of you to address however you see fit.\n>>>>>  \n>>>>> From the time the broader group was brought into the meeting at Pentagram there has been a concern about the static nature of the mark, the lack of action or anything suggesting forward movement etc.  Each time we were told there would some exploration in a new direction. We have had several calls along the way and the meeting this week where we thought we would see something in a new direction and we really haven\xe2\x80\x99t.  To me, a new direction means a new concept something different from the idea of the \xe2\x80\x9cwindow,\xe2\x80\x9d which is one concept but we really haven\xe2\x80\x99t been shown anything else. \n>>>>>  \n>>>>> I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to compare things repeatedly to the Obama mark but I think the process \xe2\x80\x93 or at least what\xe2\x80\x99s been written and said about its development, might be worth looking at again.  The \xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x9d because linked to an identify that was not only positive and suggestive, it was also reflective who Obama was and what he represented.  There was a rising sun, a path or road  both of which suggest movement.  Apart from the design issues have raised, conceptually a window is two dimensional object and the core quality Pentagram is affixing to it (transparent, open) only get us to the use cases as Teddy says and not to the core qualities about H that we are trying drive and communicate.\n>>>>>  \n>>>>> I would also like to press Michael to match what he said himself about Obama\xe2\x80\x99s mark/brand.\n>>>>>  \n>>>>> Designer Michael Bierut called Obama\'s branding "just as good or better" as the best commercial brand designs. "Every time you look, all those signs are perfect," Beirut said. "Graphic designers like me don\'t understand how it\'s happening. It\'s unprecedented and inconceivable to us. The people in the know are flabbergasted."\n>>>>>  \n>>>>> At this point, I tihnk it would be wise to do one or both of the following:\n>>>>>  \n>>>>> \xc2\xb7         Review the brief to assess whether we are or not asking them to execute against the right things (we now have research getting us closer to our core rationale, attributes etc.)\n>>>>> \xc2\xb7         Ask Pentagram to develop something,  perhaps with a different team,  that is truly different from the territory we have already seen and possibly get 1 or 2 small firms  to take a crack at this so we generate some healthy competition.  \n>>>>>  \n>>>>> This is not a knock on Michael or Pentagram, who are terrific in the world of corporate branding.  But I think we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for something in the mark can present the discipline of a corporate brand while creating the truly dynamic potential we want in a political mark. \n>>>>>  \n>>>>> Thanks, \n>>>>>  \n>>>>> Joel  \n>>>> \n>>> \n'
