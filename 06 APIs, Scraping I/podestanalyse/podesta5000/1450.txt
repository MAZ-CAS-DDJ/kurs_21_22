Marc is bursting with pride. Charlotte\'s life\nis off to a good start."\n\n\n\nThe baby was born at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, where the\nMezvinskys live. No other details of her birth were released by the family.\n\n\n\nThe news comes as Hillary Clinton deliberates whether to run for the White\nHouse in 2016. She is the leading Democratic contender to succeed President\nBarack Obama, her 2008 campaign rival, and has said she expects to make a\ndecision around the beginning of next year.\n\n\n\nThe baby has been eagerly anticipated. Hillary Clinton has called the\nprospect of becoming a grandmother her "most exciting title yet." She even\nhas picked out the first book she intends to read to her grandchild, the\nclassic "Goodnight Moon."\n\n\n\nShe has said she didn\'t want to make any decisions about another campaign\nuntil the baby\'s arrival, pointing to her interest in enjoying becoming a\ngrandmother for the first time.\n\n\n\nBill Clinton canceled a fundraising visit Saturday to Denver for Democrats\nrunning for the Senate and governor, but he called in to an event for\nembattled Democratic Sen. Mark Udall to deliver his 11-minute speech by\nspeakerphone.\n\n\n\n"I hope I get an excused absence," he told the crowd. "You all know my\nfamily just got a little bigger, and I figured I should stay home where I\'m\nreally needed."\n\n\n\nClinton has been eager to become a grandfather. During an event with former\nPresident George W. Bush in September, Clinton\'s cellphone rang on stage\nand he joked that only two people had the number "and they are related to\nme," musing that he hoped he wasn\'t becoming "a premature grandfather."\n\n\n\n"Every day I get up and I say, \'You have to remember whose child this is.\nDo not interfere. Be there when you are welcome. Be loving but not\njudgmental," Clinton said to laughs in an interview with CNN at his annual\nClinton Global Initiative, only days before the baby\'s arrival.\n\n\n\nThe 34-year-old Chelsea Clinton said in an interview with Glamour magazine\nlast year that she and her husband had hoped to make 2014 "the year of the\nbaby." She announced her pregnancy in April at the end of a forum in New\nYork on female empowerment.\n\n\n\n"I just hope I will be as good a mom to my child and, hopefully, children\nas my mom was to me," she said at the time.\n\n\n\nEven in her late stage of pregnancy, the younger Clinton helped preside\nover the family\'s annual conference last week, conducting interviews on\nstage and announcing efforts to promote community service and stop the\nkilling of elephants and trafficking of ivory. An advocate for elephants,\nshe warned her child "could grow up in a planet without elephants."\n\n\n\nChelsea Clinton grew up in the public eye as a teenager in the White House,\nlater graduating from Stanford and Columbia universities. She worked in\nfinance in New York and in public health, earning a doctorate from Oxford\nUniversity.\n\n\n\nShe serves as vice chair of her family\'s foundation, which was renamed the\nBill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, and helps direct the\norganization\'s humanitarian and philanthropic efforts around the globe. She\nrecently departed NBC News, where she served as a special correspondent.\n\n\n\nThe new parents, who married in 2010, were friends as teenagers in\nWashington and both attended Stanford. Mezvinsky is a hedge fund manager\nand the son of former Reps. Majorie Margolies of Pennsylvania and Edward\nMezvinsky of Iowa, longtime friends of the Clintons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*New York Daily News: \xe2\x80\x9cBill, Hillary Clinton beam while leaving Lenox\nHospital after birth of new granddaughter\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bill-hillary-clinton-beam-leaving-lenox-hospital-birth-new-granddaughter-article-1.1955473>*\n\n\n\nBy Celeste Katz, Corinne Lestch, and Ginger Adams Otis\n\nSeptember 27, 2014, 11:12 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] In a statement released Saturday, President Bill Clinton and\nHillary Clinton said they are \'blessed, grateful and so happy to be the\ngrandparents of a beautiful girl,\' named Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky.\n\n\n\nThe grandparents of former First Daughter Chelsea Clinton\'s newborn girl\nare bursting with pride.\n\n\n\nIn a statement released Saturday, President Bill Clinton and Hillary\nClinton said they are "blessed, grateful and so happy to be the\ngrandparents of a beautiful girl," named Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky.\n\n\n\n"We are thrilled to be with our daughter and her husband as they welcome\ntheir daughter into the world," the statement read.

It\xe2\x80\x99s not about Mark Penn writing a policy memo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nInternal memos leaked to The Atlantic after the 2008 campaign show Penn\nwanted to portray Clinton in the mold of Margaret Thatcher, the \xe2\x80\x9cIron Lady\xe2\x80\x9d\nand former prime minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\nHe wanted to cast her as a strong leader regardless of gender, and sought\nto play down the fact that she was a woman.\n\n\n\nOf voters, he wrote in one memo: \xe2\x80\x9cThey do not want someone who would be the\nfirst mama, especially in this kind of world. But there is a yearning for a\nkind of tough single parent \xe2\x80\x94 someone who can combine the toughness they\nare used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring\nto the office.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are open to the first father being a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote.\n\n\n\nClinton allies argue the strategy came unnaturally to Clinton, who has long\nchampioned women and children issues.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton believes that equal opportunity and success for women and\ngirls builds a better future for all, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why she led efforts to\nstudy and improve education opportunities for girls so they have a chance\nfor a brighter future,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrienne Elrod, the communications director\nfor Correct the Record, the pro-Hillary super-PAC.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to 2016, there are a number of reasons to think Clinton\nshould embrace running as the possible first woman president if she makes\nanother White House bid.\n\n\n\nDemocrats have spent much of the last eight years solidifying their\nstanding with women voters. Obama benefitted from a gender gap in voting in\nboth of his general election victories, and Democrats was able to keep\ntheir Senate majority in 2010 and 2012 in large part because of support\nfrom female voters.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemocrats are banking, as they did in 2012, on the gender gap,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nKatherine Jellison, a professor of history at Ohio University.\n\n\n\nShe argued that Clinton is seizing on issues that Democrats in general have\nrealized \xe2\x80\x9care winners for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese women\xe2\x80\x99s issues are great fundraising talking points for Democrats in\nterms of getting women\xe2\x80\x99s groups and individual women to donate to\ncampaigns," Jellison said.\n\n\n\nIt could also be easier for Clinton to embrace running as the first woman\npresident when she will not be running against someone set to become the\nfirst black president. The historic nature of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s run for the White\nHouse in 2008 shadowed the entire campaign.\n\n\n\nThis time around, Republicans say Clinton is simply looking for a base of\nsupport with her embrace of women. And they don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will work.\n\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThe problem is that, while women do feel that there is some inequality\nthat needs to be addressed they are not necessarily a group that feels in\nneed of a "champion" in the same way that the black community rallied\naround President Obama or that the anti-Wall Street crowd has rallied\naround [Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth] Warren,\xe2\x80\x9d said Katie Packer\nGage, the former deputy campaign manager on the 2012 Mitt Romney\npresidential campaign who now works at Burning Glass Consulting, a\npolitical consulting firm that focuses on messaging to women. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd women\nhave not shown a history of rallying to a candidate based on gender.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand their strategy,\xe2\x80\x9d Packer Gage added. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there isn\xe2\x80\x99t really\nan alternative path for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nJellison, however, says that Clinton undoubtedly realizes that one of the\nmost powerful moments in her 2008 campaign was her concession speech to\nObama.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough we weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling\nthis time, thanks to you, it\xe2\x80\x99s got about 18 million cracks in it,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton\nsaid at the time, bringing tears to the eyes of many supporters who\ngathered at the storied National Building Museum.\n\n\n\nJellison and close Clinton allies predict that the line could resurface in\nother forms during a 2016 race. Even the super-PAC Ready for Hillary is\nalready running with the cracks in the glass ceiling theme, releasing a\nlogo of sorts ahead of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s much-anticipated appearance earlier this\nmonth in Iowa.\n\n\n\nAsked how Clinton would address her historic role this time around, one\nformer aide said,  \xe2\x80\x9cI hope the answer is, \xe2\x80\x98directly.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has to,\xe2\x80\x9d the former aide said. \xe2\x80\x9cLook what she did at the building\nmuseum. What was so striking about that was her whole riff. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\nhow you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a direct, strong message about women going forward after\nthat moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd Clinton allies argue that embracing women\xe2\x80\x99s issues comes naturally to\nClinton.\n\n\n\nTracy Sefl, a senior adviser to Ready for Hillary who worked on the 2008\ncampaign, said that, \xe2\x80\x9cat every turn Hillary Clinton demonstrates that the\nadvancement of the rights and opportunities for women and girls is central\nto who she is.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\'t a side issue, this isn\'t a one-off,\xe2\x80\x9d Sefl said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs she says,\nthis is \'our great unfinished business.\'\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Associated Press: \xe2\x80\x9cReligious Conservatives Opposed To Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ad0ff73a334740149032053e8131968f/hillary-clinton-uniting-religious-conservatives>*\n\n\n\nBy Ken Thomas and Steve Peoples\n\nSeptember 27, 2014, 10:36 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Hillary Rodham Clinton is the one figure uniting\nreligious conservatives frustrated by a leaderless Republican Party that\'s\ndivided over foreign policy, immigration and social issues.\n\n\n\nThe prospect of another Clinton White House stirred anguish at the Values\nVoter Summit this weekend where hundreds of conservative activists debated\nthe GOP\'s future and warned that the acknowledged but unannounced 2016\nDemocratic front-runner would cement what they see as President Barack\nObama\'s attack on religious freedom.\n\n\n\n"Never forget she will be Barack Obama\'s third and fourth term as\npresident," Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, an unsuccessful GOP\npresidential candidate in 2012, said Friday night.\n\n\n\nShe was among the high-profile Republicans, including past and prospective\nWhite House contenders, at the annual conference attended by some of the\nmost prominent social conservatives and hosted by the Family Research\nCouncil, well known for its opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\nThis year\'s gathering expanded its focus to religious freedom \xe2\x80\x94 or the\npersecution of Christians and their values at home and abroad. It was a\nmessage that GOP officials hope will help unify a fractured party and\nappeal to new voters ahead of November\'s elections and the next\npresidential contest.\n\n\n\nBut it was Clinton\'s name that was as much a rallying cry as the theme of\nreligious liberty.\n\n\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz, a prospective presidential candidate, challenged\nClinton to "come and debate" Denver nuns who run nursing homes for the\npoor, called the Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged. The nuns\nhave challenged the Obama health law\'s requirement that some\nreligious-affiliated organizations provide insurance that includes birth\ncontrol.\n\n\n\n"She can do that and she can explain why we should be fighting nuns," Cruz\ntold 750 social conservatives at a banquet in Des Moines on Saturday night,\nafter saying much the same at the Washington gathering. Many in the Iowa\ncrowd burst into laughter at Cruz\'s comment.\n\n\n\nIn Washington, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a once and perhaps\nfuture contender, described Clinton as "tenacious."\n\n\n\n"She\'s got all the skills and would be an incredibly formidable candidate,"\nHuckabee told reporters, suggesting that Clinton is politically vulnerable.\n"She\'s got to go out and defend Barack Obama and her record in the first\nfour years she was secretary of state."\n\n\n\nClinton would be the overwhelming favorite to win the Democratic\npresidential nomination, while the GOP\'s field is large and lacks a clear\nfront-runner. Two GOP establishment favorites, New Jersey Gov. Chris\nChristie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, were not invited to the Values\nVoter meeting.\n\n\n\nAs he did last year, Cruz won the meeting\'s symbolic presidential\npreference straw poll with 25 percent of the vote, followed by conservative\nfirebrand Ben Carson and Huckabee. Clinton earned one vote among more than\n900 cast, although Family Research Council president Tony Perkins joked\nthat even Mickey Mouse would have gotten a vote if listed on the ballot.\n\n\n\nHe said religious liberty "slipped as a priority" under Clinton\'s\nleadership at the State Department as she pursued a liberal agenda "in\ncomplete contrast to what values voters care about."\n\n\n\n"She\'s going to have a more difficult time this go around than she did last\ntime," Perkins said.\n\n\n\nA CNN poll this summer found that four different would-be Republican\ncandidates earned between 10 percent and 15 percent of support from\nself-identified conservatives: Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Kentucky Sen. Rand\nPaul, Cruz and Huckabee. The same poll found that 73 percent of\nconservatives said Clinton doesn\'t generally agree with them on issues they\ncare about.\n\n\n\n"I think the hype will be, \'Let\'s elect the first woman president,\'" said\nTina Henold, who was at the conference and has home-schooled her three\nchildren in Toledo, Ohio, for 24 years. "We need to get away from hype and\nget more substance."\n\n\n\nLike many others at the gathering, Henold said Clinton\'s history and her\nhandling of the 2012 attack on the U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya, in\nwhich four Americans were killed, would hurt her chances.\n\n\n\nRepublicans contend that Obama and Clinton, as secretary of state, misled\nthe public about the nature of the attack and could have saved lives if\nthey had quickly mobilized the U.S. military.\n\n\n\n"Mrs. Clinton, you\'re not going to get a free ride on this," said Gary\nBauer, founder of the Campaign for Working Families and a presidential\ncandidate in 2000. "You can\'t implement the policies and then run as if you\nwere opposed to the policies. We\'re going to call you out."\n\n\n\nDemocrats have branded a special House panel investigating Benghazi as a\nright-wing effort to harm a potential Clinton presidential campaign. They\nreject notions that U.S. forces were ordered to "stand down" during the\nattack or that Clinton played a direct role in security decisions.\n\n\n\nLillian Kjellman, a freshman at Liberty University who attended the\nconference, said there was too much controversy surrounding Clinton and\nquestioned whether she could to present a fresh message to the public after\nmore than two decades in the public eye.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t think she could win," she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Salon: \xe2\x80\x9cThe 1 percent\xe2\x80\x99s twisted new scheme: The Kochs and other\nbillionaires are determined to buy the White House in 2016\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.salon.com/2014/09/28/the_1_percents_twisted_new_scheme_the_kochs_and_other_billionaires_are_determined_to_buy_the_white_house_in_2016/>*\n\n\n\nBy Darrell M.

Mitt Romney lacked the personal skills to\nconnect with voters and persuade them that he cared about the middle class.\n\n\n\nClearly, then, money is not the only thing that decides election campaigns.\nPublic opinion, media coverage, campaign strategies, and policy positions\nmatter as well. During a time of rising campaign costs and limited public\nengagement in the political process, money sets the agenda, affects how the\ncampaign develops, and shapes how particular people and policy problems get\ndefined. It takes skilled candidates, considerable media coverage, and\nstrong organizational efforts to offset the power of great wealth.\n\n\n\nThere are no guarantees that future Democratic candidates will replicate\nObama\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 electoral success. The conservative financiers involved then\nregard the money that they spent that year as the initial down payment on a\nlong-term investment, even if it did not immediately pay off. After the\ngeneral election, Sheldon Adelson announced that he planned to \xe2\x80\x9cdouble\xe2\x80\x9d his\ninvestment in future races. \xe2\x80\x9cI happen to be in a unique business where\nwinning and losing is the basis of the entire business. So I don\xe2\x80\x99t cry when\nI lose. There\xe2\x80\x99s always a new hand coming up. I know in the long run we\xe2\x80\x99re\ngoing to win.\xe2\x80\x9d Marc Short, one of the strategists behind the political\nactivities of Charles and David Koch, echoed that thought: \xe2\x80\x9cOur members are\ncommitted to the long term, not to one individual cycle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn preparation for the long-term battle, these billionaires already have\naltered their campaign approach to maximize the odds of winning. After\nstudying what went wrong with the 2012 campaign, individuals such as\nAdelson are aiming for a different kind of GOP nominee. According to\nAdelson\xe2\x80\x99s friend Victor Chaltiel, \xe2\x80\x9che doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want a crazy extremist to be\nthe nominee. He wants someone who has the chance to win the election, who\nis reasonable in his positions, who has convictions but is not totally\ncrazy.\xe2\x80\x9d Meanwhile, Republican National Committee member Shawl Steel said\nthat Adelson has learned from the 2012 defeat: \xe2\x80\x9cThe candidate will have to\nhave a strong resume\xe2\x80\x94no sudden lightning-new guy\xe2\x80\x94will have to build a\nformidable fundraising apparatus and really be emotionally tethered to\nbringing in middle-class Latinos, Asian Pacifics, Jews and blacks like\nnever before.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the importance of the top conservative billionaires, GOP\nstrategist and former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said that\none of the most important elements in the 2016 presidential campaign would\nbe who would win the \xe2\x80\x9cSheldon Primary.\xe2\x80\x9d Referring to the super-wealthy\nbenefactor, Fleischer noted that \xe2\x80\x9canybody running for the Republican\nnomination would want to have Sheldon at his side.\xe2\x80\x9d The same is true for\nCharles and David Koch. With their abundant resources, grassroots network,\nand willingness to spend to influence elections, their role in the GOP is\nof utmost importance. And like Adelson, they have sought to learn from 2012\nand develop new electoral strategies. From their perspective, it is crucial\nto adapt to the political environment and alter public outreach strategies.\nJames Davis of Freedom Partners, a Koch-financed group, said donors must\ntest and refine their message: \xe2\x80\x9cBeing in the field and testing during the\nslower periods, and in smaller areas, allows you to refine strategy and\ntactics so that you can make the larger investments with confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFor the 2014 midterm elections, Americans for Prosperity (AFP) is focusing\non field operations and broadcasting ads that employ moving personal\nstories to deliver policy messages. Central to their approach is the idea\nthat Obamacare is a failure and is hurting ordinary patients. \xe2\x80\x9cToo often,\nwe did kind of broader statistical ads or messages, and we decided that we\nneeded to start telling the story of how the liberals\xe2\x80\x99 policies, whether\nit\xe2\x80\x99s the administration or Congress, are practically impacting the lives of\nAmericans every day,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Tim Phillips, the president of AFP. Media\nexpert Elizabeth Wilner of Kantar Media/CMAG noted that those kinds of ads\nhave a greater likelihood of electoral success. \xe2\x80\x9cAds that tell stories are\nmore compelling than ads that don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd ads that use\nsympathetic figures are more compelling, generally, than those that don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWith ads that have greater impact, a stronger field operation, and better\ncandidates, conservative billionaires are likely to have greater success in\nthe future. Worried about that possibility, Democrats have countered with a\n\xe2\x80\x9crunning against the billionaires\xe2\x80\x9d strategy. This is a tactic that was used\nsuccessfully by Barack Obama in his re-election bid. He tied his GOP\nopponent Mitt Romney to billionaires such as Sheldon Adelson and the Koch\nbrothers, who were spending hundreds of millions against him. Obama\nappealed to basic fairness and argued that a candidate backed by the mega\nrich would not fight for the middle class and help ordinary people.\n\n\n\nSenate majority leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) has copied this approach for\nthe 2014 elections. In a series of speeches on the Senate floor, he\nbemoaned the unfairness of tycoons and the millions that they are spending\nto defeat vulnerable Democrats in key swing states. Reid decried the\nradical agenda \xe2\x80\x9cthat benefits billionaires at the expense of the middle\nclass.\xe2\x80\x9d Continuing, he said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe oil baron Koch brothers are very good\nat protecting and growing their prodigious future and fortune. There\xe2\x80\x99s\nnothing un-American about that. But what is un-American is when shadowy\nbillionaires pour unlimited money into our democracy to rig the system to\nbenefit themselves and the wealthiest one percent.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDemocratic senators under attack by Americans for Prosperity ads costing\nmillions of dollars responded with their own ads directly targeting the\nKoch brothers. One spot broadcast by Alaska\n\n\n\nDemocratic senator Mark Begich complained about a local oil refinery shut\ndown by Koch Industries: \xe2\x80\x9cThey come into town, buy our refinery, and just\nrun it into the ground, leaving a mess. A lot of Alaskans are losing jobs,\nand I\xe2\x80\x99m definitely concerned about the drinking water. I don\xe2\x80\x99t go down and\ntell them what to do; I expect them not to come up to Alaska and tell us\nwhat to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nUpset with these personal attacks, Charles Koch penned an article in the\nWall Street Journal entitled \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Fighting to Restore a Free Society,\xe2\x80\x9d in\nwhich he decried \xe2\x80\x9ccollectivists [who] engage character assassination.\xe2\x80\x9d He\nsaid that his companies employ 60,000 Americans and that his workers have\nwon \xe2\x80\x9cover 700 awards for environmental, health, and safety excellence.\xe2\x80\x9d\nContinuing his self-defense, he said that \xe2\x80\x9cfar from trying to rig the\nsystem, I have spent decades opposing cronyism and all political favors,\nincluding mandates, subsidies, and protective tariffs\xe2\x80\x94even when we benefit\nfrom them. I believe that cronyism is nothing more than welfare for the\nrich and powerful and should be abolished.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIrritated that Reid was focusing on the Kochs, Senate minority leader Mitch\nMcConnell (R-Kentucky) said that he \xe2\x80\x9cwondered why he left out billionaire\nTom Steyer, who plans to spend as much as $100 million pushing the issue of\nclimate change in the 2014 election and appears positioned to rival the\ndeep-pocketed Koch brothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDemocrats face interesting strategic decisions with respect to\nbillionaires. For more populist-leaning candidates, the preferred approach\nis to attack billionaires, complain about unfairness, and criticize the\nlack of transparency in their electioneering activities. Other Democrats,\nthough, have chosen a different tack. They have embraced liberal\nbillionaires rather than running against billionaires as a general class.\nTheir thinking is that \xe2\x80\x9cif you can\xe2\x80\x99t beat them, you should join them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAn example of that alternative comes from Democrats loosely aligned with\nHillary Clinton. Thinking ahead to a possible presidential campaign in\n2016, her super PAC, Ready for Hillary, has signed up George Soros as\nco-chair of its national finance council. In contrast to his aloofness from\nObama in 2012, Soros agreed to assist the group laying the groundwork for\nher campaign three full years before the election. Michael Vachon, the\npolitical director for\\ the billionaire, explained Soros\xe2\x80\x99s early action by\nsaying that \xe2\x80\x9chis support for Ready for Hillary is an extension of his\nlong-held belief in the power of grass-roots organizing.\xe2\x80\x9d The Clinton super\nPAC also has received contributions from billionaire Alice Walton, one of\nthe heirs to the Wal-Mart fortune, and Marc Benioff, the billionaire CEO of\nSalesforce, along with a number of other wealthy individuals. Mrs.\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s family foundation is working with billionaire Tom Steyer on an\nearly childhood development project.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s accommodationist approach clearly reflects the pragmatic\nconclusion that Democrats need abundant resources to fight the conservative\nbillionaires aligned with the Republican Party. In light of recent Supreme\nCourt decisions opening up the big money spigot, Democrats appear to\nbelieve that they must join the arms race that now characterizes U.S.\ncampaign finance. However, that approach comes with some pitfalls. In\ncozying up to billionaires, Clinton and her supporters risk alienating the\npopulist wing of her own party and turning off voters still stewing over\nthe Wall Street interests that they think brought down the American economy\nduring the financial collapse. If she goes too far with this strategy, she\nrisks facing a progressive backlash during the nominating process.\n\n\n\nThe unresolved political question is how this party division over\nbillionaires plays out. Dividing billionaires into warring factions may be\nthe best hope for Democrats. But that choice means that Democrats should\ndownplay the populist rhetoric and embrace pro-growth policies. They would\nhave to quit talking about raising taxes on the rich and endorse actions\nthat broaden social and economic opportunity.\n\n\n\nEven if Democrats run against conservative billionaires, they are likely to\nembrace moderate and liberal ones in both 2014 and 2016. The 2016 election\nwill be a multibillion dollar battle for the future of America, and\nDemocrats cannot compete without having ultrarich supporters willing to\nspend tens of millions on their behalf. It matters considerably to\ndemocracy as a whole how Democrats resolve this strategic and policy issue.\nThe outcome of future elections depends in good part on whether 2016\nbecomes the year of conservative billionaires, liberal ones, libertarian\ntycoons, or a diverse set of billionaires across the political spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sec.
