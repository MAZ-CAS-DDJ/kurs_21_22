Beneath contempt. Treason?\n\n   Those are the words being used to describe a letter sent by 47 Republican\n   U.S. Senators to the government of Iran in an attempt to undermine\n   negotiations over its nuclear program.\n\n   Our junior senator, Rob Portman, signed this letter. [1]Tell Rob Portman\n   right now to remove his name from the GOP\'s Iran letter.\n\n   We all know Washington is regularly mired in partisan gridlock, but this\n   is different. By interfering with the diplomatic efforts of the United\n   States and our allies to dismantle Iran\'s nuclear weapons program, Rob\n   Portman is risking both American lives and the lives of millions of people\n   in the Middle East--and all to score political points."\n\n   Send a message to Portman now: let our President do his job. Stop putting\n   lives at risk. Stop embarrassing our country before the eyes of the entire\n   world. [2]Sign on now--and then ask your friends to do the same. We\'ll\n   make sure Rob Portman gets the message loud and clear.\n\n   Sincerely,\n\n   Sandy Theis\n   Executive Director\n\n   [3]PS - Tell Rob Portman that he\'s gone too far. Ohio won\'t stand for his\n   dangerous grandstanding.\n\nReferences\n\n   Visible links\n   1. http://act.progressohio.org/sign/portman_iran/?t=1001&akid=692.522478.tqbyd2\n   2. http://act.progressohio.org/sign/portman_iran/?t=1002&akid=692.522478.tqbyd2\n   3. http://act.progressohio.org/sign/portman_iran/?t=1003&akid=692.522478.tqbyd2\n\n\n             [2]you_tube[3]facebook[4]twitter[5]google+[6]dribbble\n                                    [7][IMG]\n\n             Copyright \xc2\xa9 *2014 ProgressOhio, All rights reserved.\n                            Our Mailing Address is:\n               172 East State St | Suite 600 | Columbus, OH 43215\n                    This email was sent to: podesta@law.georgetown.edu\n            [8]unsubscribe from this list    [9]Update Your Profile\n\n   \n\nYou can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time:\nhttp://act.progressohio.org/cms/unsubscribe/unsubscribe/?akid=692.522478.tqbyd2\n\n\nReferences\n\n   Visible links\n   1. http://www.progressohio.org/?akid=692.522478.tqbyd2\n   2. https://www.youtube.com/user/ProgressOhio\n   3. https://www.facebook.com/ProgressOhio\n   4. https://twitter.com/progressohio\n   5. https://plus.google.com/109684301570409925514/\n   6. http://www.progressohio.org/?akid=692.522478.tqbyd2\n   7. https://progressohio.actionkit.com/donate/donate?akid=692.522478.tqbyd2\n   8. http://act.progressohio.org/unsubscribe/unsubscribe/?akid=692.522478.tqbyd2\n   9. https://progressohio.actionkit.com/me/?akid=692.522478.tqbyd2\n\n'
