john.podesta@gmail.comb'...but it seems to me the idea in this story that Bill Clinton ran broad centrist "50-state" campaign and Obama ran narrow "liberal" campaign is ridiculous on its face: http://nyti.ms/1AVmBTS\r\n\r\nYes, Bill Clinton of Arkansas won some Southern states and Colorado and Montana with help from Ross Perot on way to 370 EVs in 1992.\r\n\r\nBut was his campaign really more expansive than that of the black guy who won VA and NC and IN, 50%+ of popular vote (twice) and 365 EVs in 2008?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Harwood\r\nCNBC/NYT\r\n202 669 0751\r\n'
