Barack Hussein Obama called the AmNews office on Tuesday to make some of his case to the people and to promote his appearance at the Apollo on November 29.\n\nTouting his vibrant campaign\'s "Change we can believe in," the young man from Hawaii, exudes a re-enforced "I can do" spirit, which is either an impressive belief in self, observers state, or a mechanism to speak a wish into existence.\nThe junior senator from Illinois, who is trouncing rival Hillary Clinton right now in the Iowa polls, has been accused of not tackling issues of racism as the presidential campaign heats up.\n\nThe Amsterdam News asked, how important is race in this race?\n"Race is always a factor in American life and American politics," Obama replied. "But, I think the most important issue that people are concerned about is who is going to fight for them to deal with the challenges that they are facing. They are working harder for less-the cost of everything from health care to college education, gas prices, keep on going up. And so what they want to know is who can get the country moving-and that\'s true for white voters and Black voters, and I think our message of change is one that is resonating across the board."\n\nAsked if Black and white voters have different questions when he meets with them, the 45-year-old Honolulu native said, "They are generally talking about the same issues. They are concerned about Iraq, health care...I do think that obviously the African-American community is legitimately concerned about the criminal justice system, particularly after episodes like [the] Jena 6. They are more likely to talk about civil rights issues and criminal rights issues, and when they learn that these are issues that I\'ve battled as a civil rights lawyer as a state senator when I passed significant reforms to the criminal justice system and passed the first racial profiling legislation in the state, they know that this is something that I\'m committed to."\n\nWhat with the wave of "hate crimes," and cases like those of the Jena 6 and Megan Williams and the rash of nooses being strung up, the paper inquired what the senator thought was the solution to the ignored problem.\n\n"We\'ve got a short-term problem and a long-term problem," he said. "The short-term problem is one, when people are engaging in intimidating and threatening behavior like leaving nooses, then you prosecute, and we have to investigate. And we have to have a civil rights division of the Justice Department that takes these issues seriously, something that we haven\'t always seen by the Bush administration. They have to be investigated immediately, and we should be prosecuting people who are engaging in this kind of hateful behavior. That\'s the short-term issue.\n\nThe long-term issue is how do we restore a sense of tolerance and unity in the country, and one of the things I intend to do as president is talk about these issues; talk about some of the long-standing divisions along racial lies in this country; to talk about how we need to rededicate ourselves to investing in inner-city communities that are languishing; how we have rescue to many Black and brown children from failing schools. Those are the long-term ways that we can really make a difference in race relations in this country."\n\nBuoyed by a seemingly largely white grassroots mobilization of a virtual army of excited of flag-waving, poster-hoisting, button-brandishing supporters, Obama-ites, from debates to a mostly mainstream press campaign, the father of two daughters and his wife are regulars on the news circuit.\n\nHe claims that he is not taking the Black vote for granted and that he will work to secure that constituency.\n\nAmerica seems both fascinated and uncertain of this element called Obama.\nTo hear him tell it, though, he\'s proven, clear and assured.\n\nMaking strides toward yanking the keys of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue from current president George W. Bush is not a task, the only African-American currently serving in the U.S. Senate, deems impossible.\n\nBorn to a Kenyan father, Barack Obama, Sr., and Ann Dunham, a white woman from a small Kansas town, the junior Barack seemingly ignored obstacles and decided that he would be something of a fire starter. After stints in Hawaii, where he was raised, and Indonesia, he graduated from New York\'s Columbia University in 1983. He moved to Chicago in 1985, becoming a community activist. Earning a Harvard law degree in 1991, Obama took himself back to Chicago, where he worked as a civil rights lawyer and taught constitutional law. After two terms in the Illinois State Senate, in 2004, he was elected to the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe rest is perhaps scripted history-after delivering the much-touted keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, opinion ranged between his being a media darling, a burst of fresh air and new ideology and something of a Manchurian candidate.\n\nSome of the rumblings on the street are that the candidate and the campaign is disconnected from the inner city, that the Sheraton or the Marriot is where you\'ll find an Obama.\n"That\'s not accurate," the senator responded. "I\'m just not in New York as much as I\'d like because New York is not an early state, and as soon as we get through Iowa and New Hampshire and we\'re going into the February 5 states, then we\'ll be doing more events there. We\'ve had big events in Brooklyn, my wife has been in Harlem, I will be in Harlem next week."\n\nObama was speaking to the AmNews from New Hampshire, where he had been delivering his education policy at Manchester Central High School.\n\nHe continued, "In South Carolina, we\'re in inner city and rural communities all the time. By the way, I live in one. I live on the Southside of Chicago. I\'ve worked on these issues all my life, not just during campaign time."\n\nIn last week\'s Amsterdam News, Brooklyn Councilman Charles Barron wrote a commentary "My brother Obama: A winning strategy for NYC," in which he proposed surefire methods to win the Black vote, beginning with reaching out to the Black community where they live.\n\n"We\'ve seen it, and I appreciate the advice," said Obama. "We will be and we are actively engaging these communities. It\'s just that New York is not one of the earlier states-and there\'s only one of me."\n\nAt AmNews\' Tuesday press time, according to the November 14-18 Washington Post/ABC News poll, Obama held 30 percent of Iowa Democrats, compared to Clinton at 26 percent and John Edwards at 22 percent. In July, Obama had held just a 1 point lead over Clinton.\n\n"I think it is a sign that our strategy is working," Obama told the AmNews. "The primary is a sequential process, and so what we try to do is to start with the first caucus. February, we\'ll start with the second primary, which is New Hampshire, then Nevada, next South Carolina. We\'ve really got to focus on those four early states because if we get our message out successfully about how we want to provide health care to all Americans, how we want to restore retirement security, how we want to bring jobs back and take tax breaks away from companies who are shipping jobs overseas-if we deliver those messages effectively in the early stages-then when we get to New York, people will have confidence that we\'re in a position to win this race."\n\nNever knowing what will be picked up as the latest, greatest sound bite or headline, Obama-like most prepared candidates-is always on.\n\n"Ultimately, a lot of folks that I talk to in the African-American communities around the country, one of their biggest concerns is whether or not we can get votes outside of the African-American community," Obama noted. "That is why it is very helpful for us to show that once we deliver our message, we can get votes anywhere."\n\nThe AmNews asked if he is he concerned that white/middle America would not vote for this relatively young Black man?\n\nWithout missing a beat, displaying perhaps the second-nature response of a man who\'s oft been asked this particular question, Obama said, "If I had those concerns, I wouldn\'t be running. Obviously, there are going to be some people who don\'t vote for me for a variety of reasons. I have no doubt that there are some people who will not vote for an African-American candidate, but there are also people who will not vote for me because they think I am too young or too progressive. But the overwhelming majority of Americans I believe are going to be looking at this campaign to see who is going to fight for them, and I think that I am going to be the best person that will do the most in improving their lives."\n\nSince he is so certain of victory, as his handlers rushed him off the phone, the AmNews ventured to ask who his vice president would be.\n\n"That\'s not something I\'m spending time thinking about right now," the candidate declared, easing off deftly onto another campaign appointment.\n\nhttp://www.amsterdamnews.org/news/Article/Article.asp?NewsID=84118&sID=4\n\n* * *\n\nObama: Live at the Apollo!!\nby CYRIL \'\'JOSH\'\' BARKER - Amsterdam News Staff\nOriginally posted 11/26/2007 \n <<Picture (Metafile)>> \nSen. Barack Obama\'s stop in Harlem next week has local political figures pumped up about him visiting an area some say is already secured for votes. Especially Sen. Bill Perkins, who says that the Black presidential candidate\'s visit is an "immeasurable historic moment."\n\nObama will be making a stop at the Apollo Theater November 29 and Perkins said that Obama is going to be welcomed with open arms. Perkins said he\'s always been behind the presidential hopeful, citing that he was the first elected official to announce his endorsement of the Democratic candidate.\n\n"Here we have a leading Black candidate coming to the Mecca of the Black community," Perkins said. "Everybody knows that the way to the White House is through Harlem. We know that his vision of change is not just the right one for the country, but the world."\nPerkins added that while many people have criticized Obama for not reaching out to the Harlem community sooner, he feels that his presence in Iowa during the primaries is more important. But Perkins doesn\'t shy away from the fact that Obama\'s visit is one that will make an impression on the Black vote.\n\nAnd with those votes, comes the possibility for change for all Black Americans, according to Perkins. He sides with Obama\'s views on providing universal health care, improvements to the criminal justice system and less money spent on war and more for things like affordable housing.\n\n"We love Obama, but we love even more the message and the movement," Perkins said. "He\'s the continuation of a movement that followed Jessie Jackson and Shirley Chisholm."\n\nhttp://www.amsterdamnews.org/news/Article/Article.asp?NewsID=84117&sID=4\n\n* * *\nSouth Carolina Monday news roundup <http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/11/26/south-carolina-monday-news-roundup-8/> \nCOLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN) - Here\'s a quick look at what\'s making political news in South Carolina this morning:\n\nOn Dec. 8 and 9, Barack Obama will put to the ultimate test the theory that a celebrity can influence voters. Oprah Winfrey will campaign with Obama for those two days, making a stop in Columbia on Sunday, Dec. 9. Details here <http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/scoprah> .\n\nOprah\'s influence among women - African-American and working class women in particular - could help Obama appeal that vital subset of voters, who are still deciding between Obama and Hillary Clinton in South Carolina.\n\nMike Huckabee impressed congregations at two Baptist churches on Sunday while lapsing into his former role as minister. Read about it here <http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/11/26/huckabee-talks-jesus-not-politics/> . It\'s worth noting that there were a good number of national political reporters and TV cameras in tow.\nDan Hoover says <http://greenvillenews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071126/NEWS01/711260307>  Huckabee is "trying to ignite a surge like the one in first-voting Iowa."\nSen. John McCain, back from his Thanksgiving visit to Iraq, will visit Hudson\'s Smokehouse in Lexington this afternoon for a "Hometown Heroes Support the Troops BBQ."\n\nAfter a six-week absence, Sen. Hillary Clinton will campaign in South Carolina tomorrow, hitting Spartanburg, Aiken and Bennettsville. Find the events here <http://hillaryclinton.com/actioncenter/event/> .\nDr. Ron Paul, who may be winning the South Carolina sign wars, will campaign <http://schotlinepress.wordpress.com/2007/11/26/ron-paul-returns-to-south-carolina/>  in Myrtle Beach today and Charleston on Tuesday.\n\n- CNN South Carolina Producer Peter Hamby \n\nhttp://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/11/26/south-carolina-monday-news-roundup-8/\n\n* * *\n\nHillary to visit Spartanburg, announce endorsement on Tuesday\nBy Jason Spencer <mailto:jason.spencer@shj.com> \n\nPublished: Monday, November 26, 2007 | Updated: 6:39 am \n\nMaking her first visit to Spartanburg this campaign cycle, Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton will be in town Tuesday morning to announce a new South Carolina endorsement.\n\nHer campaign has refused to say whom the endorsement would be coming from, or even hint at what sector that person was affiliated with - political, religious, business or something else.\n\nThe New York senator will speak at the Marriott at Renaissance Park at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday before heading to Aiken and Bennettsville later in the day. The event is free. Doors open at 9 a.m.\n\nSpartanburg "is an area in the state that is very important to the campaign, and is relevant to the endorsement Tuesday," said Zac Wright, a spokesman for Clinton\'s campaign in South Carolina.\n\n\'See the senator personally\'\n"This is a unique opportunity to get to see the senator personally, to be a part of the campaign and to learn more about it. This is a campaign about change and experience - who has the experience to implement real change in this country. This is an opportunity to measure that experience for oneself - that experience, and that vision."\n\nClinton has sent several surrogates to the Hub City to speak on her behalf, including her husband, the former president. Bill Clinton\'s October visit to Spartanburg was perhaps the closest this city has seen to true retail politicking. He spoke at a local college, toured a public housing unit and dropped into two local eateries - stopping to shake hands, pose for pictures and talk with everyone who managed to push their way close enough to him. It ate up the bulk of the day.\n\nHillary Clinton\'s visit will be more in line with what other candidates have been doing, slipping in and out before heading to the next stop on the itinerary. As of Sunday, no question-and-answer session was slated to be a part of her visit.\n\nRepublican Fred Thompson took that route when he first came to town this month, and left some of his potential supporters with a bad taste in their mouth.\nSpartanburg County Democratic Party Chairwoman Liz Patterson - who, while still in Congress, endorsed Bill Clinton\'s presidential bid - said that the New York senator\'s timing was fine.\n"We\'ve been inundated by so many candidates on the other side, it\'s wise to wait until they go through town and we can have our turn," Patterson said. "She\'s right on target. Her campaign is very well organized."\n\nMost of the latest South Carolina polls have Clinton with a double-digit lead over rivals Barack Obama and John Edwards. In terms of fundraising, Obama and Edwards have raised more in this state, mostly from smaller donors.\n\nAdvance America co-founder Billy Webster and his wife, Lindsay, are among Clinton\'s financial supporters in the Upstate.\n\nhttp://www.goupstate.com/article/20071126/NEWS/711260323/1051/NEWS01\n\n* * *\nAnalyst: Thompson\'s conservatism a plus\nUnion University professor talks about the candidates for the presidential race\n\nBy STANLEY DUNLAP\nsdunlap@jacksonsun.com\n\nWhile Tennessee voters may choose Hillary Clinton and Fred Thompson, by the time Super Tuesday rolls around, the party nominations may be essentially set, according to a local political analyst. \n\nThompson\'s conservative views and Tennessee roots make him the obvious front-runner for the state, said Union University political science professor Sean Evans. \n\n"Tennessee has a generic Republican advantage, so the more conservative candidate will have the inside track," he said. \nIn the state\'s Democratic primary, Obama and Clinton will likely get the most votes, according to Evans. Obama\'s appeal is to the more socially liberal voters while Clinton attracts more of populist wing and the working person, he said. Clinton will probably have the advantage in Tennessee because of the established support she and Bill have built with the new and Southern Democrats, Evans said. \n"If she wins Iowa and New Hampshire, I think the press will say the race is over" before the Feb. 5 Tennessee primary, Evans said. Thompson\'s campaign could be hurt if Mitt Romney sees early success in Iowa and New Hampshire. \nClinton and Obama appeal to Jackson resident Phillip Wilson, who said he\'s attracted to the two Democrats because of their focus on Social Security. \n"By the time I\'m ready to retire, there might not be (Social Security) anymore," Wilson said. \n\nCarlos Kennedy of Jackson said he\'s undecided who he\'d vote for but that he\'s looking for the Republican candidate who best fits his values. \n"America was founded on Christian principles, and we\'ve gotten further and further away from that," said the 28-year old. \nT.J. Tipps of Dyersburg said he\'s leaning towards Ron Paul, who he thinks has an outside shot at winning the Republican primaries. \n\n"I\'m looking for a candidate that has a plan and is not just talk," Tipps said. "He has a lot of good ideas and seems to make the most sense." \n\nIn a race where many candidates could be a "first" - the first woman, the first African American, the first Hispanic or first Mormon - Nina Tidwell of Millington, 45, is leaning toward Hillary Clinton. \n\n"She\'s the best candidate because she knows the inside of politics," Tidwell says, though she wondered how other male leaders would react to her. \nOne Jackson resident said he\'s been observing how the candidates try to form their identity. \n\n"It\'s interesting to see the dynamics of the parties and see how they try to differentiate themselves from the frontrunner," said Kendall McCarter. \nMcCarter said he\'s most interested in Thompson, although he thinks he might not carry enough votes to win nationally. \n\n"For me it\'s about the person who has the best vision and who will follow through with what they promised," said the 37-year-old. \n\nVisit jacksonsun.com and share your thoughts. \n- Stanley Dunlap, 425-9668 \t\n\n\nhttp://www.jacksonsun.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071126/NEWS01/711260308\n\n* * *\nFROM THE BLOGS:\n\nBET.com [ Posted November 26, 2007] \nMichelle Obama says voting for her hubby is a power move\nMichelle Obama says it\'s time for Black folks to stop saying that America isn\'t ready for a Black president every time they talk about her husband\'s chances of moving into the White House. "I know folks talk in barbershops and beauty salons, and I\'ve heard some folks say, \'That Barack, he seems like a nice guy, but I\'m not sure America\'s ready for a Black president,\'" she told a crowd at historically Black South Carolina State University last week. "We\'ve heard those voices before, voices that say, \'Maybe you should wait,\' you know? \'You can\'t do it.\' It\'s the bitter legacy of racism and discrimination and oppression in this country." The 43-year-old wife of the Illinois Democratic senator said that Black women - who polls show are overwhelmingly supporting Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) for president - are the ones who can make the difference on Election Day. In South Carolina, which is considered a pivotal early primary state, the 670,000 registered African-American voters comprise roughly a quarter of the state\'s voters. Three-fifths of those Black voters are women. Does Michelle Obama have a point?\n\nhttp://blogs.bet.com/news/newsyoushouldknow/?p=1146/&cid=idnb\n\n* * *\n\nSweet column: Obama hits Harlem Thursday; first time in presidential run. Live at the Apollo.\nHIGHLAND PARK, ILL.-White House hopeful Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) headlines the famed Apollo Theater in Harlem Thursday for a fund-raiser four blocks west of President Clinton\'s foundation offices in a community with one of the nation\'s largest African American populations.\nConceding no ground to chief rival Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), Obama has a series of New York fund-raising events on Thursday, with the most political drama playing out potentially at the 1,500-seat Apollo, "Where the stars are born and legends are made." This will be Obama\'s first Harlem visit in his presidential run.\nObama has been wooing New York\'s Democratic elite before and since declaring for president last February. New York City-especially Manhattan-is one of the biggest sources of Democratic cash in the nation. The Obama campaign has a fund-raising office on the fifth floor at 500 Park Ave. Michelle Obama hosted a womens event in Harlem last June.\nThe campaign is calling the low-dollar $50-per-person funder at the theater where Bessie Smith and Billie Holiday once performed "A Night at the Apollo." \nThe divisions on the Apollo board may mirror divisions in the wealthy African-American community over Obama and Clinton. \nOne of the members of the Apollo Theater Foundation board, Nadja Fidelia, a managing director of Lehman Brothers, is an Obama bundler, raising between $50,000 and $100,000 for Obama. Other board members are in the Clinton camp, including entertainer Quincy Jones and former New York comptroller H. Carl McCall.\n\nHarlem is also the home of the William J. Clinton Foundation, the base of operations for the former president who has been on the stump for his wife. \nHarlem also plays an important role in Hillary Clinton\'s political biography. Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), the congressman whose district includes Harlem, was one of the first to push in public for Clinton, while first lady, to consider running for the Senate from New York. \nEarlier this month, on NBC\'s "Meet the Press," host Tim Russert asked Obama about an interview where Rangel said "I don\'t think on-the-job training is going to be a great asset for the next president of the United States." Question: "That\'s what we would have to have with Obama?" Rangel: "Of course."\nObama replied, "Well, look, the only real training for the presidency is the presidency."\nIowa and New Hampshire host the first two Democrat presidential contests on Jan. 3 and Jan. 8 and the African-American vote is very small in these states. In contrast, in the South Carolina primary, at the end of January, African-American Democrats could make-up the majority of primary voters.\nThe Obama campaign will often acknowledge low dollar fund-raisers, such as the Apollo event; it is secretive about high end fund-raising. On Thursday morning, Obama will collect checks ranging from $1,000 to $2,300 from people attending a 9 a.m. fund-raising breakfast at the Upper West Side home of Susan Waterfall of the investment firm Mougens Waterfall Vintiaois & Co. Obama has other fund-raisers throughout the day.\nWhat\'s not known is whether Obama will use the Apollo stage to show off his own set of pipes. He\'s not done much singing in public but he has a voice; he sang at the 2006 Gridiron dinner.\nhttp://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2007/11/sweet_column_obama_hits_harlem.html\n\n* * *\n\nhttp://www.nomoreincumbents.org/blog/2007/11/26/will-obama-trump-hillary-with-an-oprah-vp/\n\n* * *\nhttp://thebutterflysings.wordpress.com/2007/11/26/presidential-election-2008-how-are-you-voting/\n\n* * *\n\nWASHINGTON POST\nObama and Iowa\'s Urban Issues\n\nSen. Barack Obama speaking in Des Moines Sunday. (AP).\n\nIt was a rare scene in Iowa: an audience that included a large percentage of minorities.\n\nAfter a two-day swing through western Iowa, Sen. Barack Obama held a forum on urban issues at a Des Moines high school, packing the gymnasium with 500 Iowans of every variety. He fielded a series of questions that touched on race - not a common topic in this overwhelmingly white state, and one that Obama, by his own measure, views from a rare perspective. \n\nIn one exchange, the Illinois senator tackled the steep obstacles faced by inner city youth. He said he would dispatch nurses or social workers visit "at-risk parents," to "meet with them and talk to them about you\'ve got to read to your child...Here\'s how you talk to your child. Don\'t tell them to shut up. Let them ask questions, that\'s what children do."\n\nWhen Obama was asked how he would use the bully pulpit as president, he returned to the subject of parenting, and noted that his father wasn\'t present during his childhood - a challenge that many single mothers face today. "I will tell them, look I know what this is about," he said. "I know how hard it is for a lot of young men, who basically don\'t see a role model and don\'t have direction. But you know what, that\'s no excuse."\n\nOne woman lamented how some inner-city kids don\'t know how to dress for a job interview. "Pull up your pants!" Obama interjected, as the crowd laughed. "Pull up your pants!"\n\nAppearance is key to urban youth succeeding, he stressed. "You\'ve got people coming in, heads hanging down, hat cocked. They\'re mumbling. [Obama mutters a few nonsensical words.] You can\'t understand what they\'re saying. The employer asks them to do something and they\'ve got an attitude. Why do I got to do it? Why didn\'t you ask Pookie to do it? They come in late. The employer says, why are you late? I don\'t know."\nThe crowd laughed and cheered as Obama spoke. But people turned silent when Annette Brown, an African-American woman, told Obama of her struggle to integrate into the community, after moving to Des Moines from Chicago. \n\n"I come from a diverse background. I have people of every race in my family," Obama responded. "When we were at Thanksgiving, you looked around and everybody tried to figure out, how do all these people fit together? I see a lot of different perspectives. And one of the things that I truly believe is that the vast majority of Americans want to do the right thing. They want to live together. They believe in diversity...They believe everyone is American. I truly believe that is where America wants to be."\n\nHe continued, "But here\'s the thing that I\'ve said before and I\'ll say it again. We do have a legacy of racism in this country, and we see it in our daily lives. There\'s a reason why African Americans are more likely to be incarcerated. There\'s a reason why Hispanic Americans are more likely to be without health care and in low-wage jobs. It has to do with the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and discrimination. And even if people aren\'t discriminated against now...that legacy still persists. And one of the things that we have to do is finally acknowledge that legacy and go ahead and try to make it right. Not by calling each other by names, not by acting suspicious towards each other, but rather simply saying, let\'s go ahead and solve this problem in this generation, so it doesn\'t persist for the next generation."\n\n--Shailagh Murray\nhttp://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2007/11/25/post_212.html\n\n\n\nTraci Otey Blunt\nHillary Clinton for President \nPress Office -- African American Media\n4420 N.
