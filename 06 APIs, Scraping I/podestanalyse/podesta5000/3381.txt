By the end of this quarter, I'll probably be dreaming about them. \n\nHere's the spreadsheet I'm concerned with at the moment:\n\nFEC Goal: \t\t$60,000\nRaised since 12/1: \t$50,911\nAmount Remaining: \t$9,089\n\nThese FEC goals are important -- they're the difference between affording all the things we need to help Ann win and coming up short. Can you make a contribution to get us to the goal?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ake151223?refcode=ake151223_M&recurring=true&amount=25.00\n\nCampaigns are expensive. There's really no other way to put it. Offices, travel, ads, training volunteers -- it's all necessary and it all costs money. \n\nIt's also worth it. John McCain is so out-of-touch, he thinks some jobs aren't worth saving. It's time that Arizona families had a senator who understands their concerns. \n\nAnn belongs in the Senate -- and it's up to us to get her there. All we have to do is keep up our strength. And we do that by hitting one goal at a time. \n\nThe deadline is just about a week away. Let's not miss this -- give $5 or more. \n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ake151223?refcode=ake151223_M&recurring=true&amount=25.00\n\nI'll keep you updated as time goes on. But for now, thank you for helping us reach this goal. \n\nDanny\n\nDanny Carroll\nFinance Director\nKirkpatrick for Senate\n----\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.\n\nTo unsubscribe, go to: \nhttp://kirkpatrickforsenate.com/subscriptions\n\n\nPaid for by Kirkpatrick for Senate\n\n"
