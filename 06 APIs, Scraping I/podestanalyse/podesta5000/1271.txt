This election is still on a knife-edge; the overall vote remains unchanged and many states are within a couple of points. But the underlying dynamics and key metrics have all moved away from the Republicans and some of these changes are dramatic. The context remains a battleground that Romney won by 8 points, though, Democrats are poised to hold on.\n\nThis is a unique and large scale survey for Women\xe2\x80\x99s Voices Women Vote Action Fund. It includes a core battleground survey of 1,000 interviews and an additional 1,200 interviews conducted in the battleground states of North Carolina, Iowa, Georgia and Colorado. These surveys were completed on October 1 and were incorporated into the battleground.\n\nThe big story is that the Democratic campaigns have succeeded in making the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 positions on women\xe2\x80\x99s issues the second biggest reason voters are voting for the Democrat \xe2\x80\x93 after the economy, of course. At the same time, minority voters\xe2\x80\x99 support for the Affordable Care Act has risen dramatically \xe2\x80\x93 and for them, the health care law has become the second largest factor in their vote.\nThe result is that those voting Democratic are as consolidated and as intent on voting as those voting for Republicans. That Republican advantage is now gone in the battleground.\n\nA Democratic \xe2\x80\x9cin-your shoes\xe2\x80\x9d agenda for working women and men and strong populist message is beginning to become the dominant narrative, even in this very Republican battleground. But when Republicans are attacked on their opposition to equal pay and to women not being charged more for insurance, and when they are attacked on their use of unlimited secret money to keep taxes down for billionaires and CEOs, the race shifts from Republicans ahead by 2 points to Democrats ahead by 2. That gain is produced by even more gains among the Rising American Electorate, including unmarried women.\n\nThe reason why the battle has become less uphill is the improved position of the Democratic Party and Democratic incumbents, and the worsening standing of Republican candidates and Mitch McConnell. At the same time, the President\xe2\x80\x99s approval rating has risen, and support for his handling of ISIS is strong. Support has risen for the Affordable Care Act. But perhaps as important, Republicans and conservative Republicans are not as strongly opposed to the President.\n\nIt all adds up to a final month where Democrats have the chance to take these gains a step further and hold on to their Senate majority.\n____________________\n\nDemocracy Corps is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to making the government of the United States more responsive to the American people.
