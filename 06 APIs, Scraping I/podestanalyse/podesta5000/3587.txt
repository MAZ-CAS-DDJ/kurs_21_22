john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi, everyone.  I want to let you know about an event sponsored by our Center on National Security and the Law next Wednesday, March 2, at 12:45 pm in Hotung 5021.  I will be interviewing and leading a discussion with Professor Bill Banks and Steve Dycus on their new book Soldiers on the Home Front: The Domestic Role of the American Military.  I have attached a flyer for the event.\n\nAs the description of the book below indicates, this is an especially timely and important work:\n\n"When crisis requires American troops to deploy on American soil, the country depends on a rich and evolving body of law to establish clear lines of authority, safeguard civil liberties, and protect its democratic institutions and traditions. Since the attacks of 9/11, the governing law has changed rapidly even as domestic threats\xaffrom terror attacks, extreme weather, and pandemics\xafmount. Soldiers on the Home Front is the first book to systematically analyze the domestic role of the military as it is shaped by law, surveying America\'s history of judicial decisions, constitutional provisions, statutes, regulations, military orders, and martial law to ask what we must learn and do before the next crisis.\n\nAmerica\'s military is uniquely able to save lives and restore order in situations that overwhelm civilian institutions. Yet the U.S. military has also been called in for more coercive duties at home: breaking strikes, quelling riots, and enforcing federal laws in the face of state resistance. It has spied on and overseen the imprisonment of American citizens during wars, Red scares, and other emergencies. And while the fears of the Republic\'s founders that a strong army could undermine democracy have not been realized, history is replete with reasons for concern.\n\nAt a time when the military\'s domestic footprint is expanding, Banks and Dycus offer a thorough analysis of the relevant law and history to challenge all the stakeholders\xafwithin and outside the military\xafto critically assess the past in order to establish best practices for the crises to come."\n\nWe hope that you can join us for what should be a fascinating and important discussion.\n\nBest,\nMitt\n\nMitt Regan\nMcDevitt Professor of Jurisprudence\nCo-Director, Center for the Study of the Legal Profession\nGeorgetown University Law Center\n600 New Jersey Avenue, NW\nWashington, DC  20001-2075\nPhone: 202-662-9414\n\nDistinguished Chair in Ethics, 2015-2016\nStockdale Center for Ethical Leadership\nU.S. Naval Academy\n\n'
