It's just been a while and I miss you.\n\nFrom: Ambassador Kounalakis [mailto:kounalakiset@gmail.com]\nSent: Thursday, May 29, 2014 11:32 AM\nTo: Sandler, Herbert; Sandler, Susan; Steve Phillips\nCc: Demesmin-Rodrigues, Jeannette\nSubject: Message from Eleni\n\nDear Herb, Susan and Steve -\n\nI know that you've met Craig Smith, and have already heard about what Ready for Hillary is doing.  But I'm checking in to see if you would consider co-hosting this event with me on June 12th.\n\nRFH has a very simple formula:  Sign up everyone today who's ready to support Hillary when and if she decides to run.  In my view, it's an efficient, high value use of our money that ultimately is about energizing and organizing grass roots support.\n\nIf she doesn't run, whoever our democratic nominee is will benefit from the work of RFH.  If she does, she won't be starting from zero in terms of a campaign.\n\nIt would be a great honor for me if your family would do this with me.  So if you are 'ready', please let me know!  Very best, Eleni\n\nAmbassador Eleni Kounalakis\nReady for Hillary Co-Chair\n\n\n\n\n"
