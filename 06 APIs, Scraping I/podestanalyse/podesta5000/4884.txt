Before then,at 7 pm, we will  for the Roast, MC\'d by the infamous and formidable Roaster, Lanny Breuer, at the offices of Levick, next door, 1900 M Street, 4th floor.\n\nI need 1) RSVPS from all on this list and 2) please send me names and email addresses of everyone you can think of - whenever they served. Our focus is on the 95-00 era but all alumni are welcome. (For example, Bernie Nusbaum and I have stayed in touch and I will certainly invite him. Friends who served in press and political offices at WH, such as McCurry, Sosnick, Rahm, et al. --whom we attorneys often tormented -- will be welcome, as well as friends then at DoJ, including our friend who is the current AG.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you and getting your lists/ema addresses.\n\nContact point and coordinator for this event is Maddie Melendez, 202-973-5346 (copied above), who has managed to survive working with me (or me for her) since I left WH, or 15 years!\n\nRegards,\n\nLanny\n\n\nFrom: Cheryl Mills\nSent: Sunday, October 12, 2014 9:15 AM\nTo: Lanny J.

Less likely since close to Christmas but another option\nwould be Sat Dec 20 or Sun Dec 21 brunch or both.\n\nAll: please vote.\n\nThe idea: the WH Counsels roast the deputies, the deputies roast back, and the rest of us roast everyone -- and Lanny Breuer - with the odd title of "Special Counsel (not that Lannythinks he is "special"), and with the odd first name that is not a nickname - as the MC.\n\nPlease respond if either of these weekends work and which one in order of preference.\n\nMaybe even our former client can be found back in the USA this time of year to make it too, or could send a recorded message reminding us how much he loves lawyers!\n\nSpecial note to Bruce Lindsey: please come! We need you for special roast material!\n\nMay ask all on this list to:\n\n1) tell me "yes" you can make it on the 13th/14th or 20th/21st. I will circulate the consensus choice.  And\n2) send me names and email addresses of all you can think of who should be invited.\n\nI will then let all know whether the 13th/14th or 20th/21st works for the most people.\n\nHere\'s hoping we can pull this off.\n\nBest to all,\n\nLanny\nNote both new contact info:\nO--202-973-5346\nCell-202-770-5431\n\n  Original Message\nFrom: Cheryl Mills\nSent: Tuesday, October 7, 2014 8:59 AM\nTo: Lanny J.
