john.podesta@gmail.comb'===============================\nLeague of Conservation Voters\nhttp://action.lcv.org/ct/Q7zLkNK16mYw/\n===============================\n\nDear John,\n\nIn less than two weeks, the Senate will vote on a piece of\nlegislation that will finally address the global warming crisis.\n\nWe\'re working hard to strengthen the bill to ensure that it\'s\nstrong enough to address the gravity of the global warming\ncrisis. Will you help us lobby your Senators to strengthen and\npass a bill that does what\'s necessary to avoid the worst\nimpacts of global warming?\n\nClick below to ask your Senators to strengthen the Climate\nSecurity Act.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/campaign/ClimateSecurity/6kk3b59r7wjdmem?\n\nLCV supporters like you have been voicing your concerns to\nCongress about the threat of global warming for some time now,\nand the Senate has responded. But, we must ensure that the bill\nfully addresses the global warming crisis by:\n\n** Increasing the reduction in global warming pollution, to 80%\nreductions by 2050.\n** Requiring polluters to pay for pollution permits, and using\nthat money to promote clean energy, including helping consumers\nwith rising energy bills.\n** Minimizing handouts to Dirty Coal and maximizing the amount\nof program proceeds going to the public benefit.\n\nPlease tell your Senators that the Climate Security Act must be\nstrengthened with these changes.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/campaign/ClimateSecurity/6kk3b59r7wjdmem?\n\nWe\'ve waited a long time for legislation addressing global\nwarming to arrive. Let\'s make sure we get it right!\n\nThank you,\n\nGene Karpinski\nPresident\nLeague of Conservation Voters\n\nP.S.- Take one step further today and click below to make an\nemergency donation to strengthen our campaign to secure the\nstrongest global warming bill possible!\nhttps://secure.ga4.org/01/globalwarming_c4/nJpzLkNKq0A29?\n\n*******************************\nTell A Friend!\nTell your friends to sign up for LCV updates today.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/lcv/join-forward.html?domain=lcvorg&r=JpzLkNKq0A29&\n\nSign up for LCV Updates\nIf you received this message from a friend, you can sign up for\nLeague of Conservation Voters updates.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/lcv/join.html?r=JpzLkNKq0A29E&\n\nQuestions?\nIf you have any questions about this message or any other League\nof Conservation Voters issue, please click here or call\n202-785-8683.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/ct/QdzLkNK16mY2/\n\nPolicy\nYou, or someone on your behalf, has subscribed to receive this\ninformation from the League of Conservation Voters.
