john.podesta@gmail.comb'Great, thank you.  \n\nRobby to your point about letting her speak for herself, I\xb9ve been\nreminding people that they should be careful to acknowledge that this is\npart of a process.  She laid out challenges that we face in the midterms,\nand now she\xb9s thinking through how we would address them should she run.\nWill reinforce that when I circle back with these guys today.\n\nHere\xb9s the quote again incorporating peoples\xb9 thoughts.  John Anzalone, I\nthink Joel addressed what you were trying to get at so I left his edits as\nis, but let me know if you think we\xb9re missing anything.  Otherwise will\npush this in the next little while.  Thanks all.\n\n"Expanding opportunities for average hardworking Americans so that they\nand their families can get ahead has been a constant fight she has waged\nin every job she\'s held.   You heard it from her last fall when she was\ncampaigning for Democrats all over the country and repeatedly laid out the\nchallenges many Americans still face as our economy makes gains.  She\'s\ncasting a wide net, talking to a wide range of people on a range of\nspecific topics.  There\'s no red X on a calendar somewhere, but make no\nmistake, if she runs, she will present solutions to our toughest\nchallenges, she will take nothing for granted,  and she will fight for\nevery vote."\n\n\n\n\nOn 2/1/15, 4:05 PM, "Joel Benenson" <jbenenson@bsgco.com> wrote:\n\n>Yes. \n>\n>-----Original Message-----\n>From: Mandy Grunwald [mailto:gruncom@aol.com]\n>Sent: Sunday, February 01, 2015 4:05 PM\n>To: Robby Mook\n>Cc: Joel Benenson; Nick Merrill; John Podesta; Jake Sullivan; Philippe\n>Reines; Cheryl Mills; Huma Abedin; Dan Schwerin; Jim Margolis; John\n>Anzalone; Cheryl Mills; Jennifer Palmieri; Kristina Schake\n>Subject: Re: NYT & WSJ | Econ Stories\n>\n>I like it too.\n>\n>There\'s a word missing toward the end.
