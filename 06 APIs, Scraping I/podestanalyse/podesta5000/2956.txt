john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear Colleagues,\n\n\n\nWith a heavy heart, I write to share the very sad news that first year JD student Max Iascone passed away yesterday in his apartment in the Gewirz Student Center. Based on an initial investigation by the DC Metropolitan Police Department, there is no evidence of foul play or reason to believe that there was or is a safety risk to our community.\n\n\n\nMax was in Section 4 this year. His friends in the section remember him as enthusiastic and witty, quick to laugh or share a favorite movie quote. He hailed from Georgetown, Massachusetts and graduated with high honors from Brandeis University this past May. He was passionate about history, close with his family, and excited about a career path in public policy law. I and other deans have been in close contact with Max\x92s family in Massachusetts and we are supporting them in this tragic time. I know you join me in keeping them, and all who hold Max dear, in your thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n\nWe are all troubled by this tragic loss.  We are making additional professional and spiritual counseling resources available to students today and beyond. I know that some of you knew Max and are touched personally by his death.  If you would like to talk confidentially with a counselor, please consider reaching out to the Faculty Staff Assistance Program at (202) 687-2409 or fsap@georgetown.edu<mailto:fsap@georgetown.edu<mailto:fsap@georgetown.edu%3cmailto:fsap@georgetown.edu>>.  More information is available at https://hr.georgetown.edu/fsap\n\n\n\nWe will share more information about memorial services for Max as they become available. For now, I know you join me in mourning the loss of a valued member of the Gewirz and Georgetown community.\n\n\n\nWith sadness,\n\n\nBill\n\n\n'
