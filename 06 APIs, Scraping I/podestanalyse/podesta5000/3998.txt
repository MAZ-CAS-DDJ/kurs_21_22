john.podesta@gmail.comb'Andrew --\n\nThanks for the help.  I took almost all your changes -- and they were very good, particularly on how to end the piece. \n\nI did leave in the call for President Obama to make the speech.  There is a method to my madness.  I had already talked with Ben Rhodes (please protect) on the need for the President to be more public.  So I did not want to let him off the hook.  The White House does not need a suggestion from us if it wants to pass the buck down to John Kerry.\n\nI decided to go ahead and submit it to the Post.  I have reason to believe time is of the essence, and therefore did not want to take the time to sort out the USIP/CAP relationship and who should replace John.  \n\nSo we will see if they take it.\n\nThanks to everyone for all the help.\n\nSteve\n  \n\nStephen J.
