john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\n\nYou may have been right in your judgement about how Obama makes decisions and gets to the right choice.  Impressive period.  And your timing is not bad.\n\nDo you want to catch up? Lot to talk about.  Are you in DC this week?\n\nMaybe, NY.\n\nI\x92m close to wanting to share a book with you that I\x92m just turning into the publisher this week \x97 American Renewal.\n\nHow is Mary?  Stan\n'
