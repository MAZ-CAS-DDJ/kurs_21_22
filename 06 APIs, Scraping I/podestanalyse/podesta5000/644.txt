john.podesta@gmail.comb'Pa, Thank you! Sending a note of thanks hardly seems like enough, your\ntweets had an immensely positive impact on Camille, her family, and the\ndublin community and beyond. Retweeted, reposted, liked, loved, and shared\nby many many hundreds of people, perhaps a thousand. Many adding their own\nwords of encouragement and support for Camille.\nIt means a lot to Camille and Kerrie (mom) and to me. Thanks so much. Xo\n'
