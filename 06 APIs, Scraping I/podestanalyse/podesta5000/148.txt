I sugest that we make the payment and have amy set up a mettng with him to lay out strtegy.\nAnna\n\nAnna Burger\n 202-730-7303\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tJStocks@nea.org [mailto:JStocks@nea.org]\nSent:\tWednesday, January 23, 2008 06:08 PM Eastern Standard Time\nTo:\tamy@fundforamerica.net; john.podesta@gmail.com; Anna Burger; rmckay@mckayfund.org; fes33@aol.com\nSubject:\tRE: Messaging Requests\n\nI think we will set a bad precedent if we respond to each and every\nurgent request without the benefit of an overall plan/strategy for\ninfusing issue, character and values messaging into the current\npolitical context. How do these requests fit into the overall paid and\nearned media plan? It would be helpful for us to have an articulation of\nthe desired outcomes, targeted audiences, messengers, messages, mediums,\ngeography (if appropriate) in the context of a ranking of states in\npriority order based upon a set of strategic objectives. If I am off\nbase, please let me know.\n\n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: Amy Dacey [mailto:amy@fundforamerica.net] \nSent: Wednesday, January 23, 2008 5:57 PM\nTo: John Podesta; Anna.Burger@seiu.org; Stocks, John [NEA]; Rob McKay;\nFES33@aol.com\nSubject: Messaging Requests\n\n \n\nTom is asking for a fast turn around for some requests \n\n \n\nAmerican United (Around the State of the Union) $60,000\n\n \n\nCampaign Money Watch as part of the 2008 messaging work $250,000\n\n \n\nHe is requesting expediency, I have asked for additional information\nabout what his monthly basline needs.\n\n \n\nCan I please have a reaction to this by tommorrow morning.\n\nThank you\n\n \n\n\n*******************************************************************\nOnly the individual sender is responsible for the content of the\nmessage, and the message does not necessarily reflect the position\nor policy of the National Education Association or its affiliates.\n"
