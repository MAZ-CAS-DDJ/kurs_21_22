john.podesta@gmail.comb'Friends,\n\nIt is an honor to announce that Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) has endorsed my candidacy for U.S. Congress.\xc2\xa0\n\nIn announcing his endorsement, Senator Durbin noted, \xe2\x80\x9cNancy, a working mom and skilled attorney, has the courage, leadership and determination to return the 10th Congressional District to the Democratic fold.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n"Nancy brings to this race an extraordinary record for a first-time Congressional candidate. As Mayor of Highland Park she successfully confronted ComEd when local families were suffering from unreliable service, balanced the City budget five consecutive years and enacted real reforms,\xe2\x80\x9d stated Senator Durbin. "Her most noteworthy achievement gained national attention when she passed one of the nation\'s first local assault weapons bans and successfully defended the ordinance against an onslaught of gun lobby attacks all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. While the Republican-led Congress refused to respond to the nation\'s gun violence, Nancy Rotering and her City of Highland Park showed real leadership. Nancy combines fiscal responsibility with true progressive values."\n\nI am proud to have the support of Senator Durbin in my race for U.S. Congress. Even as he challenges the status quo, working to protect average Americans, Senator Durbin always strives to promote a constructive dialogue with his colleagues to encourage common sense solutions. He has been the epitome of a public servant for over 30 years, fighting for the values so cherished by all of us, and has been a role model for me in my years of public service.\xc2\xa0\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m ready to put a lifetime of advocacy and achievement to work for our communities in the U.S. Congress, moving forward with the courage to do what\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0\n\nJoin Sen.
