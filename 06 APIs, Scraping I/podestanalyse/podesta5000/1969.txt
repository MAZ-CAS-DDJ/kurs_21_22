john.podesta@gmail.comb'John --\n\nAs the "fiscal cliff" debate raged on, supporters like you\nwere right there with President Obama, making sure your\nvoices were heard from all over the country. When we work\ntogether like that, we\'re a powerful force.\n\nIssues like immigration, climate change, and gun violence\nwill be debated over these next four years, and President\nObama is ready to take them on -- but he needs us by his\nside. Our goal is to help him get things done, but also to\nhelp change how things get done in Washington in the first\nplace.\n\nOver inauguration weekend, you\'ll have a chance to\nparticipate in a discussion about how we\'ll work together\nto support our president and address the issues we all care\nabout. Some volunteers and staff will be gathering in\nWashington, D.C., and will be joined online by thousands more\nsupporters nationwide for the Obama Campaign Legacy \nConference, where we\'ll firm up the structure and leadership \nof the new organization. \n\nWant to be part of the conversation as our next chapter\nbegins?\n\nSay you\'re in and we\'ll follow up with ways to participate:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Obama-Campaign-Legacy-Conference\n\nThe impetus for this conference comes from you. In\nNovember, we sent a survey asking you about your campaign\nexperience and where you\'d like our movement to go from here.\n\nMore than a million people responded. In fact, four out of\nfive survey respondents said they\'d like to continue to be\ninvolved and volunteer over the next four years.\n\nThat\'s an advantage that no previous president has enjoyed,\nand one that has the potential to reshape our politics for\nyears to come.\n\nThis is an important opportunity to shape the future of\nthis movement, and I hope you\'ll take part:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Obama-Campaign-Legacy-Conference\n\nThanks. Can\'t wait to see what we do next.\n\nMessina\n\nJim Messina\nCampaign Manager\nObama for America\n\nP.S. -- Watch this short video to see how your work backing\nthe President during the "fiscal cliff" talks allowed us to\nrestore fairness to our tax code by asking the wealthiest\nAmericans to pay a little more. It\'s just one example of\nwhat we can accomplish when we\'re in it together:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Keeping-His-Word-Tax-Fairness\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Obama Victory Fund 2012, a joint fundraising committee authorized by Obama for America, the Democratic National Committee, and the Florida, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Virginia State Democratic Parties. \n\nContributions or gifts to Obama Victory Fund 2012 are not tax deductible.  \n\nThe first $2,500 from a contributor to Obama Victory Fund 2012 will be allocated to Obama for America, designated for general election debt retirement.  The next $30,800 from a contributor will be allocated to the Democratic National Committee.  Any additional amount(s) from a contributor will be divided equally among the Florida, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Virginia State Democratic Party Committees, up to $10,000 per committee and subject to the biennial aggregate limits.  A contributor may designate a contribution for a particular participant. This allocation formula may change if following it would result in an excessive contribution or if Obama for America receives sufficient funds to pay its outstanding debts. Contributions will be used in connection with a Federal election, may be spent on any activities of the participants as each committee determines in its sole discretion, and will not be earmarked for any particular candidate.\n\n\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo update your address, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/change-address?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe from these messages, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscription\nTo contact the campaign with any questions or concerns, go to: http://www.barackobama.com/contact-us\n\n'
