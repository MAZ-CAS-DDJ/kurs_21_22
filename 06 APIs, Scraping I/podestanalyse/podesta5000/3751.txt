john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\nSome good stuff here and I know  you\'re digging deeper.  Thanks for sending your initial thought.\n\nOn your first point about Excellent/Good - I would advise some caution.  These #s were lower than this during Obama\'s election - and I suspect that when you look at people who say "Only Fair" you will see that they are heavily D and D leaning and I suspect among those folks HRC is leading in the horserace.  This is one of the commonly used conventional metrics like right track, wrong track (which was 2 to 1 wrong track on election day 2012) that can be misleading in the post-crisis era.\n\nI also assume that you think the GOP message on spending is simpler - which it may be and this confirms what we called out in the landscape poll about HRC having to demonstrate she will a responsible steward of budget/fiscal issues.  - We got a lot of mileage in the last few years talking about cutting waste and spending we don\'t need to make the investments we do i.e education, rebuilding our roads and bridge.  So we\'re going to have to solve for that.\n\nIt\'s really interesting in your not that they you\'re seeing the pressure of rising costs an stagnant wages and all the help they want is in the form of putting money in their pockets - That\'s because we can do something about that and can\'t do much on the cost side for them so how we communicate that is going to very important.\n\nLook forward to the tabs and looking side.\n\nJoel\n\nFrom: John Anzalone\nSent: Thursday, February 26, 2015 5:56 PM\nTo: Robby Mook; Joel Benenson; Jim Margolis; Mandy Grunwald; David Binder; Jennifer Palmieri; Teddy Goff; Kristina Schake; John Podesta\nCc: Marissa Astor; John Anzalone\nSubject: National Policy Poll Baseline with Battleground and Iowa Oversample\n\n\nTeam HRC:\n\nWe got a really rich read on voters\' priorities from the policy poll.  Below is just a taste of the results but since this is such a big poll thought it was important to outline some of what we found.\n\nThe most fundamental context for everything we see here is the pressure of rising costs and stagnant wages.  Only 30% nationally and 29% in the battlegrounds rate the national economy as excellent or good, and we saw in the framing poll that to the extent people feel like things are improving, they don\'t feel like those benefits are tangible in their own lives.  So there\'s a lot of stress not just around affording big ticket items, but around just keeping up with rising everyday household and living expenses.\n\nThe everyday pressures like paying the bills (12%) cost of living (10%) and wages (4%) show up in the open-ended question about the sources of financial stress in their lives (see Q10).  When we ask voters to choose which of the following three is the biggest challenge for their family, 43% say their biggest challenge is rising everyday expenses while 42% say it\'s big expenses like healthcare, childcare, college, and retirement.  Their financial needs are so immediate that work benefits like overtime pay, family medical leave, and paid sick days are a much lower priority at 5%.  Also worth noting is that while childcare was part of the "big expenses" list we tested, it doesn\'t really register as a source of financial stress -- just 1% volunteer childcare.\n\nVoters tend to gravitate to immediate ways of putting more money in their pocket -- 53% would rather have new policies to raise wages and salaries, like profit sharing, overtime, and raising the minimum wage, while 24% would rather have more help with the cost of childcare, paid family medical leave, and sick days.  They are also looking for a middle class tax cut.  When we ask them to choose from a longer list of things that might improve the economy for people like them, tax cuts are at 45% (1st + 2nd choice) followed by making college more affordable (33%) and helping to start and grow small businesses (25%).   The Family-friendly polices lag far behind as well here.\n\nWhen we look at things a slightly different way, and ask how important different measures are to help people like them, the top choices are improving K-12 (58% absolutely essential), equal pay (56%), reducing healthcare costs (49%), college affordability (47%), helping small businesses (49%), and middle class tax cuts for families with children (43%). College affordability is an important item on that list -- by a wide margin, voters think college affordability is a higher priority (56%) than helping families with childcare, medical leave, and sick days (20%).   Again the Family-friendly policies test much weaker compared to those above.\n\nAs Joel has noted, fixing the economy is more about helping families get more money in their pockets than it is about going after the bad guys -- people are more likely to say that the problem is that people are working harder but can\'t get ahead because costs are rising but people aren\'t getting the raises they deserve (47%) than that Wall Street and big corporations get all the breaks and pay lower taxes than middle class families (40%).  Going after the bad actors is a means not an end -- it only matters insofar as we can articulate how doing it is going to help us grow incomes for the middle class.  Wall Street in general is less of a focus of voters\' anger than CEO\'s who pay themselves millions.\n\nWhile we need a forward-looking economic message, we need to define what the jobs of the future look like in a way that is meaningful to them -- focusing more on small businesses than on tech jobs or manufacturing.  Voters strongly prefer improving wages and benefits in current jobs (49%) over creating 21st century jobs in technology, biotech, and clean energy (35%).  So those examples for 21st century jobs clearly don\'t really capture what they\'re interested in (or think they can attain).  Helping small businesses does matter a lot to voters -- 54% say it\'s more important to help small businesses grow and help people start or run small businesses versus just 33% who say it\'s more important to create 21st century jobs in technology, biotech, and clean energy.  And 60% say it\'s more important to help small business compared with 27% who say we should be helping our manufacturing economy create high-paying jobs. We do need to better understand what voters consider a small business -- is it just small businesses they come in contact with in their everyday lives or also the 50 employee light manufacturing company on the outskirts of town?\n\nHealthcare costs show up as an important source of financial stress, and that becomes even clearer when we ask who\'s taking advantage of Americans and needs more accountability -- health insurance companies (39%) and pharmaceutical companies (30%) are the top two, ahead of credit card companies (26%), oil and gas companies (25%). Taking on insurers and drug companies to help lower costs for the middle class is critical for us.   Again it is interesting that Wall Street lags behind the list above as the boogeymen in people\'s daily lives.\n\nClimate change is thorny -- 55% want it addressed within the next few years, and 75% want carbon polution limited.  But while 58% start out supporting a carbon tax / rebate system, that support falls when we test arguments pro/con, and we end up dead even (46% support / 45% oppose).\n\nFamily medical leave holds up a little better in the face of opposition than the carbon tax does.  We start with 60% support on family medical leave (this includes an explanation of the payroll tax in the question), and after the pro/con we\'re at 54% support / 38% oppose.  But our message on helping families needs to be defined more broadly than childcare, family leave, and sick days.  It really starts with income -- by a 64% to 17% margin, people think it\'s more important to raise take home pay than it is to help with childcare, family leave, and sick days.\n\nThat\'s not to say that the family issues don\'t matter, it\'s more that when we talk about them, it needs to be in the context of the broader income squeeze that people are facing.  Among the family issues, sick days do best (35%) followed by family medical leave (28%) and making preschool available for every child (24%). We will field more extensive polling on education issues, but the preliminary guidance here is that K-12 seems to matter more to voters than early childhood education -- when we ask about additional investments, K-12 tests between 15 and 25 points higher than Pre-K in the national and battleground samples.\n\nWe\'re going to run into real headwinds on fiscal issues. While voters want middle class tax cuts, they place an even higher priority on reducing spending, debt, and regulations (35% tax cuts for MC and small business / 49% cut gov\'t spending, the debt, and regulations). And they strongly prefer cutting spending, debt, and regulations (54%) over investments in education, roads and bridges, and job training (38%).  This basic anti-government dynamic both nationally and in the battlegrounds is one of our chief obstacles.  We\'re going to have to be able to talk credibly about fiscal responsibility, and need to understand going in that Republicans\' message is much simpler to articulate than ours.\n\nWe also face headwinds on trade -- voters are more likely to believe that trade agreements hurt the economy by shipping jobs overseas (51%) than that they help by opening up new markets for exports (36%).  And by a 46% to 39% margin they say that trade agreements will always hurt because other countries will cheat on labor rules, rather than help if we force other countries to compete on a level playing field with high labor and environmental standards.\nKick the tires around.
