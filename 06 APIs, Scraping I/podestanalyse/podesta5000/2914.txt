"It looks like Saturday\'s event is\ngoing to be a huge gathering, estimates ranging from hundreds of\nthousands to 2 million people," Thornell wrote in the memo, which was\nforwarded by a source.\n\nIn another sign of concern, the memo painstakingly detailed a range of\nturnout predictions from the event\'s organizers, such as this one from\ntea party leaders\n<http://teapartypatriots.ning.com/xn/detail/2978134:Event:67128?xg_sourc\ne=activity>  promising a crowd of up to 1,000,000.\n\nAdding to Dem concern is the fact that Beck recently claimed a major\nvictory in the ouster of former green jobs adviser Van Jones\n<http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Anthony_K._Jones> .\n\nThe House leadership memo predicting huge turnout could have been\nwritten in hopes that it would leak and inflate expectations for\nturnout, anticipating that it will fall far short. But Dems on the Hill\ninsist they\'re genuinely worried about what tomorrow will bring.\n\n \n\n \n\n"PERMITS ARE IN PLACE.
