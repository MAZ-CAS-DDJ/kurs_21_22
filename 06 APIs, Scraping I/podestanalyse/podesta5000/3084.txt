As Secretary of State, Hillary\nClinton certainly was in that unique role.\n\n\xc2\xb7         But as Hillary becomes more involved with domestic issues, as the\nmedia begins framing her in terms of a 2016 Presidential Election and as\nthe Republican attack machine looks for anything and everything to throw at\nher it is no surprise that her numbers are coming back to earth.\n\n\xc2\xb7         According to MSNBC, \xe2\x80\x9cClinton\xe2\x80\x99s numbers were likely destined to\nfall back to earth as she reentered domestic partisan politics. In recent\nmonths, she\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly weighed in on hot-button issues like gun\ncontrol, which is likely to blunt her support among non-Democrats who may\nhave liked her as secretary of state or as a private citizen, but would\nnever support her as a presidential candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d [MSNBC, 9/9/14\n<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clintons-poll-numbers-come-back-down-earth>\n]\n\n Despite the fact that Republicans are resorting to personal, misinformed\nand even blatantly false attacks on Hillary Clinton \xe2\x80\x93 she is still one of\nthe most popular leaders in our country.\n\n -         As Dave Weigel recently wrote\n<http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/07/21/the_poll_that_will_make_democrats_panic_about_hillary_clinton.html>\nin\nSlate, \xe2\x80\x9cfew doubt that Hillary is the most electable, most\nRepublican-infuriating candidate on the horizon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n -          Most Americans believe that Hillary Clinton can relate to and\nis in touch with average Americans.
