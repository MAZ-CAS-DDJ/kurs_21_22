John McCain and his \nsurrogates, /Media Matters Action Network/ today launched an ad campaign \nhighlighting the media\'s long-held affection for the presumptive \nRepublican presidential nominee and seeking public support to hold the \nmedia accountable.\n\n \n\n"*John McCain\'s claim that the media is out to get him couldn\'t be more \ndisingenuous.* *Most politicians would sell their soul for the type of \nmedia coverage he has received over the past decade. It\'s no wonder \nMcCain has called the media his base,*" said Paul Waldman, co-author of \n/Free Ride: John McCain and the Media/ (Anchor Books, 2008). "*This ad \nhighlights what many already know to be true -- that McCain, more than \nany other politician, has benefited from a press corps that routinely \nignores his gaffes, flip-flops, and mistakes while propping up the myth \nthat he is some sort of an anti-Washington, straight-talking maverick \nregardless of facts to the contrary."*\n\n \n\nThe ad follows on the heels of a new study from the conservative /Center \nfor Media and Public Affairs/, which reportedly \n<http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-onthemedia27-2008jul27,0,2066363,full.story> \nfound that during the initial phase of the general election, network \nevening news coverage has been more favorable toward John McCain than \nBarack Obama. Though Obama has received a greater volume of coverage at \ntimes, the tone of his coverage has been more negative, according to CMPA.\n\n \n\nCMPA reportedly examined all statements by anchors and reporters on the \nnetwork evening news broadcasts between June 8, the day after Hillary \nClinton dropped out of the Democratic race, and July 21. Though most of \nthe comments were neutral in tone, CMPA* *reportedly found that when \nthere was an opinion offered, it was more likely negative* *against \nObama. Only 28% of the opinions offered about Obama were positive, while \n72% were negative. McCain\'s numbers were clearly better: 43% positive \nopinions versus 57% negative.\n\n \n\n*_Script for Media Matters Action Network\'s "Daisy \n<http://mediamattersaction.org/theyloveme/>" Television Ad_*__\n\n* *\n\n*McCain:* They love me...they love me not.\n\n \n\n*Clip:* "He\'s widely admired by members of the media, myself \nincluded..."
