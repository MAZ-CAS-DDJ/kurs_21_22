She didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill us.  I assured her\nthis was not a competitor and it would not affect her funding.  Hopefully\nthat helped.\n\n\n\nThank you again for coming to the meeting.  Babbitt told me on the way home\nhe had planned to vote against the equitable growth grant but you persuaded\nhim otherwise.  Thank you.\n\n\n\n[image: logo]\n\n*Molly McUsic | President*\n\n*The Wyss Foundation*\n\n1601 Connecticut Ave. NW, Suite 800 |  Washington, DC 20009\n\nPhone: 202-232-4418 Ext. 12 | Fax: 202-232-4419\n\nwww.wyssfoundation.org\n'
