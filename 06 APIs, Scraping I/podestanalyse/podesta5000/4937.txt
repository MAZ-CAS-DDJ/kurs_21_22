It has always been about you.\n\nThree years ago, when we launched this campaign on a cold day in Springfield, Illinois, much of the political establishment wrote us off.\n\nBut you made a commitment to work for a future that you would shape, and we defied all the odds and expectations.\n\n>From that very first moment, the success we've achieved -- and the promises we fulfilled -- have always come about because of you.\n\nFor almost a century, presidents and lawmakers had recognized the need for a better health insurance system. It was a goal that defied them all.\nBut health insurance reform is exactly what you delivered. \n\nNo longer will a child with a pre-existing condition go uncovered. No longer will a mother have to choose between cancer treatment and a mortgage payment -- because of you.\n\nBecause of you, we reined in Wall Street. Because of you, the economy is growing again. Because of you, there are 100,000 brave young men and women who have come back from Iraq.\n\nThis movement was never just about one election. It was about building a movement for change that endures. It's about understanding that, in America, anything is possible if we are willing to work for it and fight for it -- and most of all, believe in it.\n\nOur work in the past weeks and months has been focused on that fight, and today, the country will make a choice about the direction we take in the years ahead.\n\nI need you to make sure your voice is heard. Figure out when you will vote and how you will get there. Find your polling location here:\n\nhttp://www.RaiseYourVote.com\n\nAnd once you've voted, pass this message along to others across the country.\n\nTomorrow, we will wake up ready to focus on the business of keeping this country moving forward. That is a calling which requires patience and humility. Democrats are ready for this job -- and for the good of the country, we hope the Republicans join us.\n\nAs we recommit to this work, this movement will be the vanguard of all we do.\n\nThank you for all that you have done. Thank you for all you continue to do. \n \nPresident Barack Obama\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for America, a project of the Democratic National Committee -- 430 South Capitol Street SE, Washington, D.C. 20003.
