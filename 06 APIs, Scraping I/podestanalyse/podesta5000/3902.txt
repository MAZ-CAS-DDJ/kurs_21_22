john.podesta@gmail.comb"John --\n\nSome great folks we know are looking for a friendly place\nto stay.\n\nA group of the most dedicated organizers and volunteers \nwill be coming to Northern Virginia for the remaining weeks \nof the campaign. They heard we're looking to run a fierce \nground game for President Obama this fall -- and they want \nto be a part of it.\n\nBut here's the thing: They need somewhere to stay. And I'm\nhoping you can lend them a hand with that.\n\nWhat do you say? Can you host a volunteer in the District\nfor a week or more?\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Host-a-Supporter-in-DC\n\nThe folks who are coming won't ask for much. Many of them\nwill gladly sleep on a comfy couch or an air mattress, or\nin a small spare room you might have. They'll take the\nMetro or provide their own transportation to and from\nNorthern Virginia, and they'll be out during the day, \nworking hard to move our organizing along.\n\nBut I bet they'll come back at night with some amazing\nstories about the people they've reached and the energy\nthey're sparking -- stories that you otherwise might not\nget to hear.\n\nThese volunteers and organizers are among the most\ndedicated out there -- and they're giving up their time to\ncome here and pitch in. Any hospitality you can extend to\nthem will mean a lot.\n\nLet us know if you can host one or more supporters here:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Host-a-Supporter-in-DC\n\nWe'll be in touch with more details after you sign up.\n\nThanks for your commitment,\n\nLise\n\nLise Clavel\nVirginia State Director\nObama for America\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Obama for America\n\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo update your address, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/change-address?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe from these messages, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscription\nTo contact the campaign with any questions or concerns, go to: http://www.barackobama.com/contact-us\nObama for America, P.O.
