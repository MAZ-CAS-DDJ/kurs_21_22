john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\n\nI finally met with Lisa Jackson at Apple on Friday.  \n\nApple is going to announce this week that she is heading up a new \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy\xe2\x80\x9d division that will bring together environmental initiatives with government affairs and corporate social responsibility.  She wants me to consider applying for the "Head of Policy\xe2\x80\x9d job that is going to be her first significant hire.\n\nGiven how Apple is reinventing the corporation, this could be quite the exciting place to be.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted.\n\nThanks, too, for pointing out Cathy Novelli to me. She\xe2\x80\x99s been a real resource.\n\nChris\n\n\n'
