LCV's annual  Capital Dinner is the premier gathering for the\nnational environmental  community, and we ask you to lend your support\nby serving as a sponsor of  this exciting evening.\n\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=FQRw6mDhBu69RnXd7JvMcQ\n\nLCV continues to work with our national  network of more than 30 state\nLCVs and other allies to advance strong policies  on climate change\nand clean energy at the state and federal levels. We will  grow our\nmembership base across the country and mobilize supporters to urge\nleaders to move forward on climate change, while engaging key\nconstituencies  such as Latinos and youth. We are urging the Obama\nadministration to build on  the progress from their first term by\ncutting carbon pollution from power  plants and rejecting dirty fuels,\nwhile pushing for state and local solutions  such as renewable energy\nstandards. These efforts are bolstered by our proven  track record of\nwinning elections and holding elected leaders accountable for  their\nvotes with our National  Environmental Scorecard.\n\nYour  partnership plays a decisive role in helping LCV and our state\nleague partners  seize opportunities, fight threats, and build for the\nfuture. We are counting  on your support to make this year's Capital\nDinner a success. To confirm your participation as a sponsor  with a\ncontribution of $5,000 or more and reserve your table, please click\nhere ( http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=7x5FlkOHuwDZXT4GwDWJnQ ) or contact Jonathan_Tracy@lcv.org or (202) 454-4583 by Friday, April\n12, 2013 so that we can proudly list your name on the  formal\ninvitation. This is a critical year for environmental priorities, so\nplease consider increasing your support and making as generous a\ndonation as  possible.\n\nThank  you again for your continued support of LCV's work and your\ncommitment to  environmental values. Together we will secure a better\nfuture for our planet.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGene  Karpinski\nPresident\n\n******************\n\nJoin us at the League of Conservation Voters' Capital Dinner! http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=WywprLY6A3S0V0FEK7ONnQ\n\nWednesday, June 12, 2013 \n\n** new location **\nRegan Building and International Trade Center\n1300 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Washington, DC\n\nReserve your table and sponsor the Capital Dinner with a contribution of $5,000 or more by Friday April 12, 2013 to have your name included in the dinner invitation and program. \n\nClick here to make your contribution online. http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=bMzSmiDr7At_6kvzq3Z8bg\n\nFor more information, please contact Jonathan Tracy at Jonathan_Tracy@lcv.org or (202) 454-4583.\n\n***********\n\n\nUpdate Your Profile\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=BZkRZB95sCAX8LfsxHRMMw\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=cjfAznTUQq3niOwbrqZDz1EHB1Aps1JV&cid=0\n\n1920 L Street, NW Suite 800\nWashington, DC 20036\n202-785-8683\n\n"
