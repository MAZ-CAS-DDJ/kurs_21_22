He is aiming for an\nendorsement at mid-winter meeting which is in late February so definitely\npost Iowa/NH. Wants to get to  85-90 % on ballot and move to make it\nunanimous. He thinks he can do that. Not a lot of feeling the Bern. Thought\nonly APWU likely to endorse him. He thought if we pushed hard on Larry\nHanley ATU might end up endorsing HRC. Didn't think CWA was likely to go\nwith Bernie and that Larry Cohen wasn't playing that well at his surrogate\nappearances. On the going forward basis, he was keen on convincing members\nthat they could trust her to fight for them. Thought Bernie's critique\ncould reinforce Republican meme of you can't trust her and he wanted to\ncounteract that early. I can give Nikki a little more detail when I'm back\nin the office as well as a fill on the political program.\n"
