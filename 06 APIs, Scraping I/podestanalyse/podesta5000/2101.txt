john.podesta@gmail.comb'Bruce and John,\n\nI had a discussion earlier today with Eva Gonda, who is the subject of the attached letter and Ami\'s note from last week.\n\nIn short Eva was introduced to us by mark Weiner and the President asked that we explore helping.  Basically she is trying to put together a project where SHE will be working on a study related to Education reform and will be seeking some funding from various foundations to support this study.  She wants us potentially to be the recipient of any grants that she could arrange and pay her for the study.  The note attached and below from Ami goes into more detail.\n\nIn principle we could do this, we would need some kind of agreement with Eva, spelling out what she would be the job and the deliverables, we would have to presumably enter into an agreement with the donors/grantors (if necessary), but could probably make the deliverable to them the report that she would be proposing as part of her proposal to get funding.\n\nI told her that we would consider this, but that it is highly unusual for us to engage in this kind of activity, but it\'s not a foregone conclusion that we could do so. I let her know that we would need at the minimum to know who the potential donors/grantors would be and that they would need to be acceptable to us.  I also mentioned that the project and its deliverables have to be aligned with our charitable purposes (which I don\'t believe there would be an issue with).  We would need to determine if we wish to charge an administrative fee as well.\n\nPersonally, I never recommend getting in between as a pass-through unless the project is in the realm of something we are already doing.  I told Eva we would discuss and let her know.\n\nWe can always discuss Tuesday if you think important enough.\n\nAndrew Kessel\n501-748-0473 (o)\n501-951-4461 (c)\n\nFrom: Amitabh Desai\nSent: Thursday, December 08, 2011 6:30 PM\nTo: Bruce Lindsey; Laura Graham; Doug Band - PC; Justin Cooper - PC; John Podesta (john.podesta@gmail.com)\nCc: Andrew Kessel; Hannah Richert - PC\nSubject: FW: Letter to WJC and the WJC Foundation\n\nDear Bruce, WJC called earlier today to say we should explore this and be helpful to the extent we think it makes sense within the structures of CF and CGI. In short, Eva Gonda (introduced to us by Mark Weiner) would like to undertake a research project to develop a workplan for philanthropic organizations interested in improving education (beginning in the US). The Gonda family (history below) is willing to fund it. It feels like the best way forward would be for Eva to join CGI (probably beginning with CGI America), make this research project her "Commitment to Action," and then we can have a discussion with her next year after she\'s developed "the workplan," to determine together if there is any parts of the workplan that we would want CF to operationalize (with funding from the Gonda family). Importantly, Eva is asking if CF can serve right now as a pass-through for her to carry out this research, since she doesn\'t have a 501c3. We can have her join CGI either way, but I got the impression it\'s important for her that we be the pass-through, and I\'m only raising this because of the enormous potential WJC and Mark have said this family has to be supportive of CF. I\'d welcome your guidance. We\'re probably talking about $80k that would be passed through. Thanks, Ami\n\nFrom: Mark Weiner [mailto:mweiner@fiiri.com]\nSent: Monday, December 05, 2011 4:30 PM\nTo: Amitabh Desai\nSubject: Letter to WJC and the WJC Foundation\n\nAmi:\n\nThank you for taking the time to speak with me regarding Eva\'s project.  Attached is per proposal.\n\nHere\'s a little background on the Gonda Family.\n\nThe Gonda story very interesting.  Leslie Gonda is a Holocaust survivor; his wife, Susie, who passed away 2 years ago was a Concentration Camp survivor. They moved to the United States in the early 1960\'s.  Leslie is a businessman and entrepreneur.  He and his son, Lou (Eva\'s father) started International Lease Finance in 1973. They have been named among Forbes list of riches American billionaires.\nLeslie Gonda has been a major benefactor of many medial institutions, museums, and charities.  The Leslie and Susan Gonda Foundation has created centers, laboratories, and endowments to meet the needs of vascular, diabetes, genetic and neuroscientific research at major medical institutions and universities around the globe.  Examples of the Gonda\'s philanthropy include the Gonda Vascular Centers at UCLA and the Mayo Clinic, The Gonda Center for Diabetes and Genetic Research at the City of Hope and Georgetown.\nThey believe through education and advances in medicine, generations in the future will be able to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive world and lead productive and meaningful lives.  They believe in this country that has been so great to them and want to give back.  They are willing to fund the cost of this project.\n\nLooking forward to our meeting Thursday.\n\nBest,\nMark\n'
