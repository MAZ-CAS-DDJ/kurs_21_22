john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dan, Lissa, Jon:\r\nFeel really great about the direction here.\r\n\r\nStructurally it works for me, which was your big question.\r\nI think you\xc2\xb9ve got lift now and emotion.\r\n\r\nI still  not quite sure what the one-line take away is.  I\xc2\xb9d like to talk\r\nabout that more.\r\n\r\nAnd as Jen said, I\xc2\xb9d like to get closure on whether we use \xc2\xb3it\xc2\xb9s your\r\ntime\xc2\xb2 in the speech.  I\xc2\xb9m for it, but know there may be skeptics out there.\r\n\r\nAgain, a real jump forward.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 5/26/15, 11:49 PM, "Joel Benenson" <jbenenson@bsgco.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n>Agree on all counts with Jen.
