Looking at the calendar I have to wonder where the year has gone.\n\xc2\xa0\nYour support over this last year was tremendous but the next few days are the most critical to the campaign. We've earned key endorsements from elected officials and labor unions, but our financial report in January will have a major impact on the rest of this campaign and I need your help before the end of the year. \n\nI am asking you to consider making a donation of $25, $150, $500 or anything you can to help us raise $10,000 before our New Year's Eve deadline. To make your donation please click the following link, www.iveyforcongress.com/contribute\n\nCan I count on your help to hit our fundraising goal? \n\nI sincerely thank you for your support and generosity,\n\nGlenn \n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n|    Paid for by Glenn Ivey for Congress    |\n---------------------------------------------\n\nGlenn Ivey for Congress\n410 1st Street, SE\nSuite 310\nWashington DC 20003 United States\n\nIf you believe you received this message in error or wish to no longer receive email from us, please http://iveyforcongress.ngpvanhost.com/unsubscribe?mmid=6337078782381656064&tiid=-3372777706100488192."
