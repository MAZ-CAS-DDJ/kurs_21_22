Best, David\n\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: David Halperin <davidhalperindc@gmail.com>\nDate: Thu, Mar 19, 2015 at 12:34 PM\nSubject: Letter to President Obama from 100+ groups re chemical plant\nsecurity\nTo: ywang@who.eop.gov\nCc: Rick Hind <rick.hind@greenpeace.org>\n\n\nMarch 19, 2015\n\n\n\nThe Honorable Denis McDonough\n\nAssistant to the President and Chief of Staff\n\n\nThe Honorable Valerie Jarrett\n\nSenior Advisor and Assistant\n\n\nThe Honorable Susan Rice\n\nAssistant to the President for National Security Affairs\n\n\n\nDear Mr. McDonough, Ms. Jarrett, and Ambassador Rice,\n\n\nPlease find the attached letter to the President, and supporting materials,\nfrom organizations and leaders across America, regarding the urgency of\nissuing new rules to protect Americans from the dangers of accidents or\ndeliberate attacks at U.S. chemical facilities.\n\n\n\nI participate in the Coalition to Prevent Chemical Disasters\n<http://preventchemicaldisasters.org/>, more than 100 environmental,\nenvironmental justice, labor, and community groups that have been working\nfor years to make U.S. chemical plants safer. We represent communities and\npeople who are at the greatest risk from chemical plant accidents or\nattacks.\n\n\nMembers of our coalition would be pleased to discuss these issues with you\nat any time.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nDavid Halperin\n\n\n\nDavid Halperin, Attorney & Counselor\n\n1530 P Street NW 1st floor\n\nWashington DC 20005\n\n(202) 905-3434\n\n\nThe President\nThe White House\n1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW\nWashington, DC 20500\n\nMarch 19, 2015\n\nDear Mr. President:\n\nWe write to strongly urge you to take prompt and decisive action to address\na danger you have highlighted for a decade \xe2\x80\x93 the threat to our communities\nand workers from accidents or deliberate attacks on U.S. chemical plants.\nYour Administration is running out of time to make a real difference on\nthis critical issue.\n\nWe were grateful when, after the tragic West, Texas disaster in April 2013,\nyou issued Executive Order (EO) 13650, \xe2\x80\x9cImproving Chemical Facility Safety\nand Security,\xe2\x80\x9d that directed federal agencies to modernize safety\nregulations. As a result, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is\nconsidering revisions to its Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, but\nhas postponed proposing changes until September. We believe that this\nschedule will jeopardize finalizing a rule before you leave office and\ntherefore needs to be accelerated.\n\nYour past leadership on preventing chemical disasters has been\nunparalleled. The millions of men, woman and children living, studying,\nplaying and working within high risk zones near hundreds of chemical\nfacilities are counting on you to prevent future tragedies. To ensure that\nnew rules do take effect, they must be finalized well in advance of the end\nof your administration\xe2\x80\x99s term in office.\n\nEPA\xe2\x80\x99s RMP data, first reported in 1999, exposed the overwhelming danger of\nthese hazards to workers, first responders, children, and surrounding\ncommunities. In 2006, as a U.S. Senator, you stated emphatically that\n\xe2\x80\x9cthese plants are stationary weapons of mass destruction spread all across\nthe country.\xe2\x80\x9d According to a December 2014 Congressional Research Service\nanalysis, 466 of these facilities each put 100,000 or more people at risk\nof a catastrophic disaster.\n\nFortunately, safer cost-effective chemical processes are widely available.\nSince 2001, hundreds of chemical facilities have switched to safer chemical\nprocesses and eliminated these risks to 40 million people in 47 states. For\nexample, in 2012, the Clorox Company completed conversion of all of its\nU.S. facilities to a safer manufacturing process. While this is\nencouraging, reliance solely on voluntary efforts has left more than 100\nmillion people in the U.S. at risk of death or injury because they live and\nwork inside \xe2\x80\x9cvulnerability zones\xe2\x80\x9d surrounding the high-risk chemical\nfacilities.\n\nSection 112(r)(7)(A) of the Clean Air Act provides the EPA with rule-making\nauthority to prevent future tragedies by requiring chemical facility owners\nand operators to use, where feasible, safer processes that will reduce or\neliminate the potential for a catastrophic chemical incident. Safer\nprocesses are the only foolproof way to eliminate or dramatically reduce\nthe loss of human life in such an event, whether it is triggered by an\naccident, natural disaster, or terrorism.\n\nThese catastrophic hazards became obvious following the 9/11 attacks and\nafter every attack since. In 2002, the EPA under then-Administrator\nChristine Todd Whitman proposed using the Clean Air Act\xe2\x80\x99s disaster\nprevention authority to make chemical facilities \xe2\x80\x9cinherently safer by\nreducing quantities of hazardous chemicals handled or stored, substituting\nless hazardous chemicals for extremely hazardous ones, or otherwise\nmodifying the design of processes to reduce or eliminate chemical hazards.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTragically, the Bush administration, under pressure from special interest\nlobbyists, scuttled this proposal.\n\nIn your 2008 book Change We Can Believe In you promised, \xe2\x80\x9cAn Obama\nAdministration will\xe2\x80\xa6[s]ecure our chemical plants by setting a clear set of\nfederal regulations that all plants must follow, including improving\nbarriers, containment, mitigation and safety training, and wherever\npossible, using safer technology, such as less toxic chemicals.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn April 3, 2012, Governor Whitman wrote EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson\nurging the use of \xe2\x80\x9cauthorities you can apply to reduce these hazards before\na tragedy of historic proportions occurs.\xe2\x80\x9d And following the West, Texas,\ndisaster, then-EPA Administrator Jackson told MSNBC, "We need to use the\nauthority we have now."\n\nDue to the billions of dollars of potential liability, the Association of\nAmerican Railroads issued a statement in 2008 saying: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time for the\nbig chemical companies to do their part to help protect America. They\nshould stop manufacturing dangerous chemicals when safer substitutes are\navailable...\xe2\x80\x9d More recently, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board recommended in\nits May 1, 2014 final report on the 2010 Tesoro refinery disaster that the\nEPA issue new rules under the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s Clean Air Act authority\n\nWe respectfully urge you to use your authority to expedite finalizing a\nrule that will eliminate these potentially catastrophic hazards wherever\nfeasible. As organizations committed to this objective, we look to your\noffice to ensure that this critical rule is finalized as soon as possible.\n\nThank you for your leadership on this important issue.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n\nKristen Breitweiser\n9/11 Widow\n\nMonique Harden\nAdvocates for Environmental Human Rights\n\nAdrian Shelley\nAir Alliance Houston\n\nPamela K.
