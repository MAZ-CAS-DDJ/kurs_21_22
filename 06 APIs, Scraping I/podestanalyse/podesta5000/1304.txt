john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John and Mary,\n\nNancy and I realized that this is a milestone month for us.  Exactly 40 years ago, we moved to Washington so I could work for Senator Gaylord Nelson.  We\'d like to celebrate the occasion by bringing together the friends who have meant to most to us over these many years.  We hope that you\'ll join us on Sunday, November 1, from 4:00-6:00 pm.\n\nSince this is a political season, we thought we would mark our personal anniversary with an exciting political event.  One of our friends, Karyn Strickler, a superb public interest advocate, has founded Vote Climate PAC, a Super PAC focused on supporting Congressional candidate who favor bold action to combat climate change, and opposing those candidates who persist in climate change denial.  We have invited Karyn as a guest speaker, and we think you\'ll admire the work she\'s doing on what is an existential issue.  This is a fundraiser for Vote Climate PAC---no advance commitments required, but please bring your checkbooks in case you\'re impressed!\n\nAs an added attraction, Allan Lichtman, the noted political historian (who doubles as Karyn\'s husband), will share his unsurpassed insights into the presidential election.  As you may know, Allan is the author of "The 13 Keys to the Presidency," and he has unfailingly predicted the winner of the popular vote in every presidential election since 1984.  \n\nNancy and I would love to see you on November 1.
