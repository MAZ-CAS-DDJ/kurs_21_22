john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi John-- Carole King called me up to relay to you something she\'s already\nbeen in conversations with Nick Merril about: TPP, and separately, .  Here\nare my notes from the call.\n\nTPP\n\nCarole Wants to volunteer answer on TPP -- more specific than politispeak\nthat\'s out there currently.  She relayed this to Nick Merril but wanted to\nsend to you as well.\n\nHRC should say something like:\n"Enormous amount of respect for Pres. Obama.\nHe\'s very smart, he thinks things through, and\nMy biggest concern is even though there is enviro\nHow do we enforce it?  What happens if it\'s violated?\nIf you can give me an answer to my satisfaction, I\'d be happy to support it.\nI\'m listening to people and I\'m thinking about it, too."\n\nCarole says HRC can\'t be seen hedging on this.  By posing her position back\nas a question seeking a valid answer, she seems strong.  She doesn\'t have\nto say what she would do--just ask the right questions.\n\nSeparately, when she met with Brian Deese on NREPA.  Said there\'s a fragile\ncoalition of dems -- Carole understood this to mean that POTUS can\'t piss\noff Tester or Wyden.  "Not sure how you get around that, but I said to\nBrian--understood this can\'t get done because of that coalition, but I\nwould like them (CEQ, Brian, everyone) to proceed as though they could get\nthis done next summer.  I finally feel like I\'m not being held at arms\nlength, which is good, but I do believe in windows.  Sometimes they open\nand you can do something sooner than you think.  Just wanted you to know\nthat\'s how I\'m asking them to proceed."\n'
