I think there are some nuances that are important as well some big things --- like their aspiration for a sense of \x93financial freedom\x94 that ladders up a bit to bigger goals i.e. getting ahead along is not enough \x96 they want to get ahead and stay ahead.  I know Jim hates \x93last prosperity\x94 but after years of feeling that their gains were impermanent and there was no solid footing they seem to be reaching for more. .\n\nMost important things to look at are Q 5 ,6 on optimism/pessimism and more confidence than anxiety.\n\n\nBattery on factors for M.C. life that is on p. 15-16 with summary table on 17. \x96 Focus on p. 15 and top 5 items \x96 all are over 49% on 7s and 71+ on 6+7; then next tier down which are at 43+ and 60+.\n\nEcon attitudes on page 21 \x96 Not that top 6 items have a focus on the future for most part and may steer towards sounding a little bigger and less incremental \x96 there is an aspiration here for \x93financial freedom\x94 that lets them look ahead a little more.  \x96 Not the last item in battery on p. 57 is that they have low optimism for next generation but batter on page 15 makes clear that being able to give your child choices about their future is an extremely important factor in middle class life.\n\nSee you shortly.\nJoel\n\n\n<3449 HRC Economic Values Poll Topline FIN.docx>\n'
