john.podesta@gmail.comb"Lee Satterfield and I are hosting a little cocktail party for Nancy Hernreich who is in from Hong Kong because she is a new grandmother.  It's a sip and see for Luke, son of Ashley.  I sent you a paperless post invite but I know you are super busy!\n\nIt's Thursday night at Steele's house 6-7:30.  We would love it if you and Mary could stop by...\n\nI can resend all the details.\n\nHope you are well!\nFondly,\nKelly\n650-387-0042\n\nSent from my iPhone"
