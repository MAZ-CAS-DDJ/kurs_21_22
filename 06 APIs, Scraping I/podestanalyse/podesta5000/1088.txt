On behalf of Americans United,\nAnzalone Liszt Research conducted n=801 live telephone interviews\nnationwide with likely 2010 general election voters between September\n10-11.  Among the key findings:\n\n \n\n*      60% of likely 2010 voters say they watched at least part of the\nPresident\'s speech, and a majority of those who did (54%) are now more\nlikely to support his plan\n\n*      By a 10-point margin, voters are more likely to re-elect a Member\nof Congress who votes for healthcare reform\n\n*      By a 62% to 28% margin, voters support a public option regardless\nof whether they watched the speech\n\n \n\nComplementing the poll, AUFC also unveiled a new television ad today\ncalled "Bad Politics" that warns members of Congress of the political\nprice they could pay if they stand with the big insurance companies and\nvote against health insurance reform.  The spot began airing this week\non cable in the Washington D.C. market, aimed at lawmakers.\n\n \n\nTom McMahon, Acting Executive Director, Americans United for Change: "As\ndemonstrated in our new polling and others\', the more people learn about\nthe President\'s health insurance reform proposal, the more they like it.\nThe surge in support for the President\'s plan, including a public\noption, should reassure members of Congress who support reform that they\nhave the high political ground.  It should also alarm those who don\'t\nthat standing with the big insurance companies could result in their own\npolitical peril.  Support for reform will only continue to grow as more\nand more Americans tune out the misinformation campaign from the forces\nof \'status quo\' and learn about the specifics of the President\'s plan."\n\n \n\nAmericans United for Change is a progressive, 501c4 issue-advocacy\norganization, founded in 2005 to help defeat President Bush\'s effort to\nprivatize Social Security.  Since then, Americans United has waged\nnumerous media campaigns to move forward a progressive agenda in\nCongress, from expanding children\'s health care to millions of kids in\nneed, to ending the war in Iraq, to investing in the clean energy jobs\nof the future, to passing major health insurance reform.\n\n-30-\n\n \n\nScript: "Bad Politics"\n\nOn Screen: November 2, 2010, 11:03 PM, Election Day\n\n \n\nPolitical Consultant: "Congressman as your political consultant...I\'m\nsorry you lost... I was wrong.\n\nTurned out the voters hated the strangle hold the insurance companies\nhave on health care.. raising premiums...cutting off people with\npre-existing conditions... making health care decisions instead of\ndoctors.\n\nAnd they didn\'t much like the millionaire insurance CEO\'s you were\nhanging with either.\n\nGuess your vote against health insurance reform turned out to be bad\npolitics."\n\n \n\n \n\n________________________________________\nJeremy J.
