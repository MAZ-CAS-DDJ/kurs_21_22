It\xe2\x80\x99s just plain wrong,\n> and it\xe2\x80\x99s unworthy of our great country. Those who insist on politicizing\n> the tragedy will have to do so without me.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n>\n>\n>\n> The 34-page chapter is Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s most complete account to date of the\n> attack and its aftermath. Her tone is less defensive than defiant: Clinton\n> takes responsibility for the *\xe2\x80\x9chorror"* of the loss of life in Benghazi,\n> but puts it in the context of *\xe2\x80\x9cthe heartbreaking human stakes of every\n> decision we make\xe2\x80\x9d *\xe2\x80\x94 and she accuses adversaries of manipulating a\n> tragedy for partisan gain.\n>\n>\n>\n> There has been, she writes, a *\xe2\x80\x9cregrettable amount of misinformation,\n> speculation, and flat-out deceit by some in politics and the media,\xe2\x80\x9d *but\n> new information from *\xe2\x80\x9ca number of reputable sources continues to expand\n> our understanding of these events.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n>\n>\n>\n> The chapter appears intended, in part, to give Democrats a clear framework\n> to respond to Republicans who have raised questions about Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s role\n> and what the Obama administration has said about the Sept. 2012 killing of\n> four Americans. The section was obtained and reviewed by POLITICO on the\n> eve of a meeting in which members of Democratic-leaning groups will be\n> briefed by Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team about how she addresses the attacks in the book.\n>\n>\n>\n> And in a sign of the concerted effort to rebut the ongoing controversy in\n> a cohesive way, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s camp has brought on former National Security\n> Council spokesman and longtime President Barack Obama hand Tommy Vietor to\n> assist in the response to the book, a source familiar with the plan said.\n>\n>\n>\n> The book\xe2\x80\x99s arrival comes as Clinton is considering a second presidential\n> campaign in 2016. Pieces that have emerged ahead of the June 10 release\n> include a section about Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s late mother, the author\xe2\x80\x99s note and a\n> four-minute video featuring the former first lady talking about the book.\n> On Thursday, conservative-leaning Fox News - which has heavily covered the\n> Benghazi story \xe2\x80\x94 announced Clinton will sit down with two of its anchors\n> for an interview during her book rollout media blitz.\n>\n>\n>\n> Asked to comment on what Clinton hoped to achieve with the Benghazi\n> chapter, among the most anticipated sections of her State Department\n> retrospective, her spokesman Nick Merrill responded, \xe2\x80\x9cUntil the book is\n> released, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to say. And once it\xe2\x80\x99s released, it will speak for\n> itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>\n>\n>\n> The chapter is a mostly chronological retrospective of the attack\n> interspersed with Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s views. She points out that she ordered an\n> investigation into what happened nine days after the attacks, and that she\n> agreed with and implemented all 29 of the recommendations made by a review\n> board.\n>\n>\n>\n> While saying that as a former senator she respects the *\xe2\x80\x9coversight role\n> that Congress is meant to play,\xe2\x80\x9d *Clinton later adds, *\xe2\x80\x9cMany of these\n> same people are a broken record about unanswered questions. But there is a\n> difference between unanswered questions and unlistened to answers.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n>\n>\n>\n> Clinton defends the intelligence at the time preceding the attack on the\n> American compound in Libya. An anti-Islamic video that had sparked a\n> protest at an embassy in Cairo was proven in *\xe2\x80\x9clater investigation and\n> reporting,\xe2\x80\x9d* including by the New York Times, to have been *\xe2\x80\x9cindeed a\n> factor\xe2\x80\x9d* in what happened in Benghazi, Clinton writes.\n>\n>\n>\n> That point is among those that has been debated during hearings into the\n> attacks.\n>\n>\n>\n> *\xe2\x80\x9cThere were scores of attackers that night, almost certainly with\n> differing motives,\xe2\x80\x9d *she writes. *\xe2\x80\x9cIt is inaccurate to state that every\n> single one of them was influenced by this hateful video. It is equally\n> inaccurate to state that none of them were. Both assertions defy not only\n> the evidence but logic as well.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n>\n>\n>\n> Clinton addresses lingering questions about how military assets were\n> deployed to try to rescue personnel at the under-siege compound, writing\n> that Obama *\xe2\x80\x9cgave the order to do whatever was necessary to support our\n> people in Libya. It was imperative that all possible resources be mobilized\n> immediately. \xe2\x80\xa6 When Americans are under fire, that is not an order the\n> Commander in Chief has to give twice. Our military does everything humanly\n> possible to save American lives \xe2\x80\x94 and would do more if they could. That\n> anyone has ever suggested otherwise is something I will never understand.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n>\n>\n>  Clinton also highlights some of the findings of an Accountability Review\n> Board investigation into the attacks, including that there had been\n> security upgrades to the Benghazi compound but that they were *\xe2\x80\x9csimply\n> inadequate in an increasingly dangerous city.\xe2\x80\x9d* She notes that Benghazi\n> compound personnel told the Review Board that they felt their requests for\n> additional security were not given adequate weight by the embassy in\n> Tripoli, a point Republicans have in the past argued does not absolve\n> Clinton since those officials report to the Secretary.\n>\n>\n>  Clinton reiterates a point she made during congressional testimony last\n> year: that she never saw cables requesting additional security. The cables\n> were addressed to her as a *\xe2\x80\x9cprocedural quirk\xe2\x80\x9d* given her position, but\n> didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually land on her desk, she writes: *\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not how it works.\n> It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. And it didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n>\n>\n>  Clinton addresses claims that the investigation of the attack was rigged\n> since she appointed some of the Accountability Review Board members and she\n> was not interviewed. The board, she writes, *\xe2\x80\x9chad unfettered access to\n> anyone and anything they thought relevant to their investigation, including\n> me if they had chosen to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n>\n>\n>  She defends then-United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice for describing the\n> Benghazi attack as a *\xe2\x80\x9ccopycat" *of the video-spurred Cairo protests when\n> she appeared on Sunday TV shows days later. Rice, Clinton writes, was\n> relying on existing intelligence. And the talking points she used were\n> written to help members of Congress address the attacks, and that the\n> information began with and was signed off on by CIA officials. Intelligence\n> officials didn\xe2\x80\x99t know Rice would use them, Clinton writes.\n>\n>\n>  The talking points have been a focus of Republican critics, who insist\n> they stemmed from the White House as an effort to control a politically\n> sensitive issue \xe2\x80\x94 a terrorist attack on the eve of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s reelection.\n>\n>\n>  *\xe2\x80\x9cSusan stated what the intelligence community believed, rightly or\n> wrongly, at the time,\xe2\x80\x9d* Clinton writes. *\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the best she or anyone\n> could do. Every step of the way, whenever something new was learned, it was\n> quickly shared with Congress and the American people. There is a difference\n> between getting something wrong, and committing wrong. A big difference\n> that some have blurred to the point of casting those who made a mistake as\n> intentionally deceitful.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n>\n>\n>  Clinton takes aim at people who *\xe2\x80\x9cfixate on the question of why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\n> go on TV that morning, as if appearing on a talk show is the equivalent of\n> jury duty, where one has to have a compelling reason to get out of it. I\n> don\xe2\x80\x99t see appearing on Sunday-morning television as any more of a\n> responsibility than appearing on late-night TV. Only in Washington is the\n> definition of talking to Americans confined to 9 A.M. on Sunday mornings.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n>\n>\n>  Early on in the chapter, she describes her grief over losing American\n> ambassador Chris Stevens and three of his diplomatic colleagues \xe2\x80\x93 *\xe2\x80\x9ca\n> punch in the gut,\xe2\x80\x9d* she writes \xe2\x80\x94 and says she takes responsibility.\n>\n>\n>  The deaths of *\xe2\x80\x9cfearless public servants in the line of duty was a\n> crushing blow,\xe2\x80\x9d *Clinton writes. *\xe2\x80\x9cAs Secretary I was the one ultimately\n> responsible for my people\xe2\x80\x99s safety, and I never felt that responsibility\n> more deeply than I did that day.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n>\n>\n>  Clinton also addresses her much-seized-upon remark before a\n> congressional committee in Jan. 2013, when she used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\n> difference at this point does it make.\xe2\x80\x9d Republicans have claimed it\n> betrayed Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s lack of interest in getting to the bottom of the attack.\n> Clinton writes that her words were blatantly twisted.\n>\n>\n>  *\xe2\x80\x9cIn yet another example of the terrible politicization of this tragedy,\n> many have conveniently chosen to interpret\xe2\x80\x9d *that phrase* \xe2\x80\x9cto mean that I\n> was somehow minimizing the tragedy of Benghazi. Of course that\xe2\x80\x99s not what I\n> said,\xe2\x80\x9d* she writes. *\xe2\x80\x9cNothing could be further from the truth. And many\n> of those trying to make hay of it know that, but don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n>\n>\n>  She adds, *\xe2\x80\x9cMy point was simple: If someone breaks into your home and\n> takes your family hostage, how much time are you going to spend focused on\n> how the intruder spent his day as opposed to how best to rescue your loved\n> ones and then prevent it from happening again?\xe2\x80\x9d*\n>\n>\n>  Clinton describes how important it was to communicate with the public\n> and to lead her agency during and after the violence.\n>\n>\n>  But she also says the details of the Benghazi attacks have been clouded *\xe2\x80\x9cin\n> part because of continuing turmoil in Libya. And despite the best efforts\n> of officials from across our government. \xe2\x80\xa6there will never be perfect\n> clarity on everything that happened. \xe2\x80\xa6But that should not be confused with\n> a lack of effort to discover the truth or to share it with the American\n> people.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n'
