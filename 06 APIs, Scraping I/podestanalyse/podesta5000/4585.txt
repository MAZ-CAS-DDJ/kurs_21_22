I was talking about \xe2\x80\x98given\nwhat people knew then, would you have done it,\xe2\x80\x99 rather than knowing what we\nknow now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHANNITY: \xe2\x80\x9cSo in other words, in 20/20 hindsight, you would make a different\ndecision?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBUSH: \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that decision would have been. That\xe2\x80\x99s a\nhypothetical. But the simple fact is that mistakes were made.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBush was \xe2\x80\x9cblasted by Democrats and some fellow Republicans.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nCHRISTIE: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can honestly say that if we knew then that\nthere was no WMD, that the country should have gone to war.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat he said was just rubbish. You can\xe2\x80\x99t still think that\ngoing into Iraq now, as a sane human being, was the right thing to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMost Americans now say the Iraq War wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth it, and Bush has\n\xe2\x80\x9cpreviously tried to distance himself from his brother. But that\xe2\x80\x99s\ncomplicated.\xe2\x80\x9d Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s last name is a \xe2\x80\x9cdouble-edged sword.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n-- \nThanks,\n\nVas\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "HRCRapid" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n'
