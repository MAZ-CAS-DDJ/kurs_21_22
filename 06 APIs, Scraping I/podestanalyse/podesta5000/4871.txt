john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\n\nAs you know rarely in modern life do the decision makers who sit at the top\nof the power pyramid ever listen to those at the very bottom -- despite the\nfact that the people at the bottom are expected to carry out the mission of\nthe organization or institution.  *This idea will demonstrate that  HRC is\none of those rare leaders who is willing to listen to people on the\nfrontlines of life.*\n\nA few years ago I began to think about this. How could we easily capture\nthe valuable insights, ideas, observations and wisdom from the frontline,\nhands-on, experience of peer groups that reside at the bottom of the power\npyramid? What could they tell the leaders about issues that are plaguing\nthe system? How could we make it comfortable for them to come forward and\nshare what they know in a way that could be used to inform policy making\nand priority-setting?\n\nThus was born WikiWisdom. This process harnesses the power of technology,\npeer collaboration, and networks to unearth front-line wisdom and connect\nit to people in power.\n\nIn traditional organizational structures, insights, ideas, and\nrecommendations must overcome the impediments created by layers of\nbureaucracy before they can rise to the top.  The bright ideas that start\non this journey often arrive in a very different form, having been\nrearticulated, rewritten, and reformatted until they have lost their\nessential truth.\n\nWikiWisdom is the solution to this problem.\n\nThis process uses the Internet to offer people a chance to do more than\ngripe about their situation. It gives them the opportunity to use their\nknowledge to tell the powers that be how to do things better. It\'s a rare\ngift to people at both ends of the power structure.\n\nHRC could conduct three WikiWisdom conversations in NH, IO and SC with\nDemocratic Primary voters to learn what their ideas are for building a\nbetter America.  The campaign could also have a conversation with all the\nfollowers of Black Lives Matter as a new gesture by HRC following the\n"youtube Black Lives Matter moment."\n\nThere are six steps to a WikiWisdom Idea project with all six capable of\nbeing accomplished in a month.\n\nHere they are:\n\n1. Start at the top.  The leader of the organization agrees to listen and\nlearn from the frontline workers about a specific problem facing the\norganization. This can be a risky proposition for leaders because there are\nno guarantees they will like what they hear.\n\n2.  Guarantee access.  Participants are drawn to the online conversation by\nthe promise that their ideas will be presented directly to someone who has\nthe desire to listen to them and the power to effect change.\n\n3.  Generate ideas.  A targeted group of peers -- those frontline experts\n-- are invited to an online, moderated conversation. They register under\ntheir real names -- no anonymity here -- and share ideas on how to solve a\nspecific problem using their everyday experience in the workplace or in\ntheir community. The moderation ensures everyone is heard and that gripes\nare turned into actionable ideas.\n\n4.  Sort the data.  An algorithm identifies the most engaged thought\nleaders in the idea generation phase. Once the online discussion ends,\nthese individuals are invited to join a small group that will take the\nideas to the next step.\n\n5.  Mine the "cognitive surplus."  The small group of thought leaders work\nwith the moderator to distill and expand the ideas generated by the large\ngroup into a written report filled with actionable ideas and solutions.\n\n6.  Back up to the top.  The thought leader group meets in person with the\nleader of the organization to present the group\'s ideas and get direct\nfeedback.\nCall me at any time to discuss or with any questions.\n\nAll the best,\n\nTom C.\n617-529-1170\n'
