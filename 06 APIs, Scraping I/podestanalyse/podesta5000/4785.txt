As a matter of fact, The Washington Post recently reported that CEOs of big business are looking for ways to have the greatest influence on the 2010 midterms-while deceptively hiding their tracks\n\nDon't let polluting special interests drown out your voice. Support pro-environment candidates who will fight for a clean energy future.\n\nClick here to donate through GiveGreen now! \nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=VrP2ZwVlmkdnnhmf5tcTjA..\n\nYour support of pro-environment candidates can really make a difference. Consider that in 2008 LCV and our state LCV partners helped elect 28 new pro-environment leaders to the House of Representatives. In 2009, the historic American Clean Energy and Security Act passed in the House by just seven votes.\n\nWith critical environmental legislation passing by just a few votes, you can see how important it is to elect leaders who won't side with Big Oil at the expense of our environment. And, when you contribute to candidates through\nLCV Action Fund's GiveGreen program, you help increase our collective\nenvironmental strength in Congress by demonstrating your support for clean energy and the environment.\n\nPlease, support GiveGreen candidates today for a cleaner, healthier planet tomorrow. Thank you.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=Z9FmLmVszPnQCPMeE3l6iA..\n\nSincerely,\n\nGene Karpinski\nPresident\nLeague of Conservation Voters Action Fund\n\n\nPaid for by League of Conservation Voters Action Fund, www.lcv.org, and not authorized by any candidate's or candidate's committee.\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nTo review our Privacy Policy,  click here .\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=s8aHTv3b43roEfUCScpTGw..\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=VbGHLCZOz-HFifiRTVcMQwTArZ5jiAUf&cid=0\n\n"
