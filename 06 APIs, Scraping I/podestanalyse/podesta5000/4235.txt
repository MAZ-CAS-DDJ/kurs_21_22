john.podesta@gmail.comb'A two assumptions:\n\n1. That we will run draft framework and message by others. \n\n2. That we will put ourselves on timeline to discuss this with her this week. \n\nOn draft - My comments below are in text in caps in relevant sections (cut where i agreed to reduce length) - sorry on iPhone so no track changes or separate document:\n\n.Introduction\n \n[AGREE WITH OBSERVATIONS AND AUDIENCE TARGET OF THE INTRODUCTION]\n \n.Talking points\n \nNOTE: These are written in HRC\xe2\x80\x99s voice but once agreed upon can be adapted for the communications team, surrogates, etc.\n \nQ: \xe2\x80\x8bAre you running for President?\n \n\xe2\x80\xa2I have not made a final decision.  Ultimately though, I am hoping to get to \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d\n \n\xe2\x80\xa2But this is a very personal decision for me, as I IMAGINE IT IS FOR OTHERS weighing something like this.  HAVING WALKED THIS PATH  UNSUCCESSFULLY BEFORE, HOW HARD YOU MUST WORK TO EARN THE TRUST OF AMERICANS WHO [WANT|NEED FILL IN]. THAT\'S WHY I WANT to make THIS DECISION on my own schedule, with as much thought AND INFORMATION as possible to GUIDE ME.\n \n\xe2\x80\xa2I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a wonderful year and a half since stepping down as Secretary.  I launched my Foundation programs, wrote a book about my TIME as Secretary of State, I gave speeches to organizations and causes. ONLY IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS, HAVE I GONE out and fought for THE values I WANT FOR OUR COUNTRY IN OUR ELECTED LEADERS in the midterms.\n \n\xe2\x80\xa2[TKTK language based on the outcome of the election]\n \n\xe2\x80\xa2So the next few months are going to be invaluable as I turn my attention to this decision in earnest.  I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be talking to all kinds of people around the country about how to keep moving this country forward, about how we can do better. And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be talking to people who have insight into how a presidential campaign needs to look in 2015 & 2016 to have the best chance of success. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to LEARN as much as possible so I can make an informed a decision about what\xe2\x80\x99s best for me and what\xe2\x80\x99s best for our country.\n \n.Managing the Message\n \n[AGREE WITH SURROGACY FRAMEWORK]\n \n.Transparency\n \nWe should view this period as a pre-cursor to what would give way to a larger strategy should she decide to run. Central to that will be communicating to the press how HRC is approaching this next phase. \n\n[AGREE]\n \nOur message, put simply, is this:\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cHRC is talking to a wide swath of people about all of the issues that will affect the future of this country, how she can impact that debate, and how a campaign TODAY SHOULD WORK. SHE WANTS TO FIND AND UNDERSTAND the best, forward-looking ideas. SO SHE WILL cast a wide net. She may not agree with everyone, and they may not agree with her; but she wants to hear from people. \n \n.Execution\n \n1.After Election Day, we work with a reporter to write about what the coming months will look like. We convey that while HRC has not decided whether to run, we expand on her public answers by explaining that she plans to spend time talking to people who have new ideas. Elements of such a story should include:\n \n\xe2\x80\xa2A sampling of people she will be reaching out to, with a heavy does on new faces and previously unsupportive faces;\n\xe2\x80\xa2Her reaching out to several key power centers, such as Elizabeth Warren;\n\nTHE LIST BELOW WORRIES ME - IT IS CLOSE TO THE SAME LIST YOU COULD HAVE PUT IN 2008 (WHICH YOU FLAG AS IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS FURTHER DOWN IN THIS SECTION).  I WOULD SHORTEN AND/OR CATEGORIZE DIFFERENTLY AND I WOULD CONSIDER INTRODUCING NEW NAMES - REALIZE THIS IS HARD AS IT ALSO GOES TO WHO YOU WANT PRESS REACHING OUT TO AS AN AUTHORITATIVE VOICE BUT I WANT TO FLAG THIS AS AN AREA I WOULD WELCOME DISCUSSION ON OUR CALL\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2A basic list of those who legitimately have insight into the process and her thinking \xe2\x80\x93 including:\noMaggie\noCDM\noJohn\noHuma\noJake\noPhilippe\noCapricia\noMinyon\noHRC Personal Staff\n\xe2\x80\xa2Similar thought needs to be given to who \xe2\x80\x93 if anyone \xe2\x80\x93 around WJC & CVC should be named \xe2\x80\x93 or if the point should be conveyed that they are holding their advice close to the vest. Obviously this is not as much of an issue with CVC, but the extended WJC network remains the most difficult to stay synced up with; [WE NEED TO TRY WITH "THE CLOSE TO THE VEST" APPROACH YOU OFFER FOR WJC BECAUSE HE TOO NEEDS A NARRATIVE CHANGE FROM HOW HE IS PERCEIVED TO HAVE ENGAGED LAST TIME AND WE SHOULD BE SMART ABOUT HOW SHE, HE AND THOSE TALKING CONVEY THAT BEGINNING NOW]\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2State clearly and strongly that no personnel decisions have been made of any kind, and any assumptions of such are only that \xe2\x80\x93 assumptions, unfounded at that;\n\n\n2.Once the story runs, we determine a natural time and place for HRC to convey her evolution of thought to a public audience. We will work with the schedule to determine what timing and setting works best.\n\n [AGREE WITH REST]\n\n.Conclusion\n \nThe goal of the next 8 weeks should be to practice discipline by conveying a simple message to a wide audience to preserve HRC\xe2\x80\x99s ability to be thoughtful and make decisions on her own terms, with an increasing eye toward how such a strategy would evolve if/when she \xe2\x80\x9cGets to yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n \nAnd as stated at top, she and we need to do so as genuinely and as authentically as possible.\n \n[TOTALLY AGREE]\n\ncdm\n\ncdm\n\n> On Oct 25, 2014, at 11:12 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com> wrote:\n> \n> Hi everyone,\n> \n> Attached please find a memo that Philippe and I put together that we think\n> captures our conversation last weekend on a beginning frame for how to\n> position HRC, ourselves, and our surrogates following Election Day, along\n> with some of our ideas on how to execute.\n> \n> Talk to you all in the morning.\n> \n> Nick\n> \n> \n> \n> On 10/22/14, 11:19 AM, "Joanne Laszczych" <jlaszczych@cdmillsGroup.com>\n> wrote:\n> \n>> Call is confirmed for 9:30am EDT on Sunday, 10/26.\n>> \n>> Please use:\n>> \n>> Dial i:    1-530-881-1000\n>> Code:      742374#\n>> \n>> -----Original Message-----\n>> From: Cheryl Mills [mailto:cheryl.mills@gmail.com]\n>> Sent: Wednesday, October 22, 2014 3:24 AM\n>> To: Jake Sullivan\n>> Cc: Philippe Reines; Nicholas S Merrill; John Podesta; Robby Mook; Joanne\n>> Laszczych\n>> Subject: Re: Follow - up Call\n>> \n>> Does 930am work better for folks then?\n>> \n>> cdm\n>> \n>>> On Oct 21, 2014, at 11:45 PM, Jake Sullivan <jake.sullivan@gmail.com>\n>>> wrote:\n>>> \n>>> I\'ll be on a flight and could do 930 (Robby and I were skedded to speak\n>>> then)\n>>> \n>>>> On Oct 21, 2014, at 8:17 PM, Cheryl Mills <cheryl.mills@gmail.com>\n>>>> wrote:\n>>>> \n>>>> Dear all\n>>>> \n>>>> Can you advise Joanne if a call at 9am Sunday will work for a follow\n>>>> up call?\n>>>> \n>>>> Best. \n>>>> \n>>>> cdm\n> \n> <Memo 11.5.docx>\n'
