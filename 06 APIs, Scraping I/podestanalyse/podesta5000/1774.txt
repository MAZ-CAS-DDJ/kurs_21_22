The piece highlights the work of President Clinton and CGI members to build back New Orleans following the storm. Retweet Mayor Landrieu\xe2\x80\x99s op-ed here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI had the opportunity to meet with [President Clinton] when he came down to New Orleans on behalf of the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund following the hurricane and subsequent levee failures. He had recognized this moment as a global challenge rather than just a local disaster. It was then that we heard about his plans for the Clinton Global Initiative\xe2\x80\x93a cross-sector platform that eventually transformed philanthropy and informed our efforts to put New Orleans back together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShare this article on TWITTER here: https://twitter.com/ClintonGlobal/status/637023612877324288\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnouncing CGI Annual Meeting Participants and Program\r\n\r\nYesterday, we announced initial speakers and program information for this year\xe2\x80\x99s CGI Annual Meeting.

In an article about Sen. Rand Paul\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Haiti, the AP portrayed Paul\xe2\x80\x99s claim that \xe2\x80\x9calmost none\xe2\x80\x9d of Foundation funding went to charity as an open question instead of debunked falsehood<http://mediamatters.org/research/2015/08/20/ap-presents-blatant-falsehood-about-clinton-cha/205059>.\r\n\r\nThe Associated Press presented Sen. Rand Paul\'s false attack that "almost none" of the Clinton Foundation\'s spending goes to charity as an unresolved, open question. But experts say the Clinton Foundation\'s charitable spending is "very good" by industry standards, and attacks like Paul\'s are "simply wrong" and amount "to a misunderstanding of how public charities work."\r\n\r\n\r\nShare the fact check on TWITTER here: https://twitter.com/mmfa/status/634409641754013696\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#ActionIsGreater in Haiti\r\nVirgin Unite, the entrepreneurial foundation of the Virgin Group, profiled the Clinton Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s lifesaving work in Haiti<http://www.virgin.com/unite/our-community/staffreads-rebuilding-haiti-with-arts-and-crafts> and our recent #ActionIsGreater campaign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Clinton Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s #ActionIsGreater campaign is an important reminder that although circumstances may appear insurmountable, when smart brains, big hearts and genuine commitment come together, life changing progress can be made.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nShare this article on TWITTER here: https://twitter.com/ClintonFdn/status/634454869361958912\r\n\r\n\r\nCGI Commitment-Makers are \xe2\x80\x9cdoing well by doing good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nYesterday, Fortune Magazine launched their \xe2\x80\x9cChange the World List: Companies that are doing well by doing good.\xe2\x80\x9d<http://fortune.com/2015/08/20/introducing-change-the-world-list/?xid=nl_daily> CGI worked with Fortune to develop the list, and a whopping 36 companies<http://fortune.com/change-the-world/> out of the 50 listed are CGI commitment-makers.\r\n\r\nShare this article on TWITTER here: https://twitter.com/ClintonGlobal/status/634465305067040768\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#Commit2Ten with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation\r\nChelsea Clinton talked to Yahoo Parenting<https://www.yahoo.com/parenting/chelsea-clinton-how-life-changed-the-moment-127483154557.html> about how to keep you family healthy and the Alliance for a Healthier Generation\xe2\x80\x99s #Commit2Ten<http://commit2ten.org/> campaign, which encourages us all to add ten more minutes of physical activity every day.\r\n\r\n\r\nShare this article on TWITTER here: https://twitter.com/ChelseaClinton/status/636548499719360512\r\n\r\n\r\nCGEPartnership Connects Indian Farmers to Markets\r\nThe Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership is working with CropConnect Enterprises to streamline the farming process in India.
