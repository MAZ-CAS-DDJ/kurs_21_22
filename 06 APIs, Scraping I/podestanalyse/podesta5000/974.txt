That\'s the core belief at the center of\nMcCainomics. Or maybe we should call it "maverick economics," since John\nMcCain\'s approach toward taxes and government spending has the potential to\nchange the rules of the Washington budget game. Actually, it has the\npotential to change the game itself and perhaps create a long-term solution\nto America\'s fiscal problem\x97with trillions left over. See, that\'s what the\nWall Street Journal didn\'t seem to understand when one of its reporters\nwrote the following last week:\nhttp://www.usnews.com/blogs/capital-commerce/2008/4/29/maverick-mccainomics-could-alter-our-fiscal-future.html\n\n*McCain the Anti-War Warrior? (OutsideTheBeltway 4/29/08)*\nJames Joyner\nIn the cover story of the new American Prospect, Matt Yglesias describes\nJohn McCain ... But this is wrong in almost every sense imaginable.

Jeffrey\nOne of the most surprising things about the presidential election four years\nago is that the already unpopular war in Iraq was not the top issue in\nvoter\'s minds. Nor was it the top national security issue. To get elected,\nSen. John McCain needs something similar to happen this year.

John McCain\'s ideas\nabout America and the world have gotten too little coverage. In an obvious\neffort to distinguish himself from President Bush, Mr. McCain describes\nhimself as "realistic idealist." Yet his speeches and comments reveal a\ndisturbing lack of realism about the world, especially the Middle East. Mr.\nMcCain\'s global outlook is that of a man still living in the 1990s, when\nAmerica\'s power and the dollar reigned supreme.\nhttp://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/viewpoints/stories/DN-rubin_30edi.ART.State.Edition1.4687ed4.html\n\n*BUSH NEWS*\n*Bush Blames Democrats for Sliding Economy (Washington Post 4/29/08)*\nBy William Branigin\nPresident Bush today blamed Congress for many of the nation\'s economic woes,\ncharging that lawmakers have blocked his proposals for dealing with problems\nranging from soaring gasoline prices to the increasing cost of food.\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/29/AR2008042900698.html?hpid=topnews\n*Link to video*:\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/video/2008/04/29/VI2008042901048.html\n\n*Bush Prods Lawmakers on Economy, Energy Prices (WSJ 4/30/08)*\nBy MICHAEL M.
