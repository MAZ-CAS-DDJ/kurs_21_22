And LCV's  potent ads are airing one last time nationally and\nin close races in Colorado and Wisconsin.\n\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=erEeTG7E-KN0g85QkymGFw\n\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=S2uBDQ33b9IajCr_WGCM7w\n\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=lR7xsNxKmyRzhnvZK_HAfw\n\nJohn, as you watch the results come in tonight, I want you\nto know how much it has meant to have you as a partner in this work.\nAs I wrote in Politico this morning, Big Polluters have spent\nunimaginable sums this cycle to wipe clean energy champions off the\nmap. In a few hours we will know whether, together, we were able to\nstop them.\n\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=V4jYlbwbehjU8hF78gZRLQ\n\nWhatever  the final outcome, know that we have waged one of the most\ntargeted,  powerful and hard-hitting campaigns in the history of the\nenvironmental  movement. Thank you for being a part of it.\n\nForward!\n\nGene\n\nP.S. I hope you will join LCV's political team on Thursday for a  post\nelection report, analysis and discussion. The call will be held on at\n2  p.m. EST.\xa0 To receive the call-in number, please contact Josh\nHicks at  (202) 454-4565 or Josh_Hicks@lcv.org.\xa0\n\xa0\n\nPaid  for by League of Conservation Voters, www.lcv.org, and not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.\n\n\n\nUpdate Your Profile\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=CSk9CJcJFD5Zzjc1gcOTNQ\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=IHxzxvQZ-WeGdrLiwQTF9LaVN2n3Wv3v&cid=0\n\n1920 L Street, NW Suite 800 \nWashington, DC 20036\n202-785-8683"
