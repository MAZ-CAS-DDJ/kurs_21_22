There isn't an easy way to say this, so I will say it as simply as possible: We can't afford to miss raising the additional $40,129 before the FEC deadline at midnight. If we do, it could cost us incumbent seats across the country -- and they'd be replaced with some of the most extreme Tea Party radicals around.\n\nThe deadline is midnight. Can you step up now?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/suit_bo?refcode=em101514_2&amp;amount=25.00&amp;recur_weekly=true&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;zip=20016&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=&amp;phone=&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=\n\nThanks,\n\nTara \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContributions or gifts to House Majority PAC are not tax deductible\n\nPaid for by House Majority PAC. www.thehousemajoritypac.com.
