For decades, Big Oil and other dirty polluters have spent millions lobbying Congress against clean energy in order to protect their bottom line. And now, with the Gulf Coast oil disaster, we're witnessing the economic and environmental damage caused by our continued addiction to oil.\n\nIt's long past time for Congress to stand up to Big Oil and pass responsible legislation that creates jobs, limits carbon pollution, and protects our coastal economies and ecosystems.\n\nPlease, don't wait a moment longer to tell your leaders that you support a clean energy future.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=YMSQ5eeuhcOCE26FR1n94w..\n\nWe may not have Big Oil's millions, but we do have hundreds of thousands of dedicated supporters who can affect real reform through grassroots advocacy. Thank you for all that you do for the environment.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGene Karpinski\nPresident\nLeague of Conservation Voters\n\n\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here:\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=WciLS8iJ7DLjOaO4hqSs6VDolINqM0iS&cid=0\n\n"
