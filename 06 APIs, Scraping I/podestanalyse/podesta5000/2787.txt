john.podesta@gmail.comb'I would prefer an ally (congressman polis and/or LCV) Who have strong bone\nfides on the environment to whack sander\'s for taking an irresponsible\nposition and in doing so, threatening real progress on frack fluid\ndisclosure and air quality regulations. This is yet another promise he\ncan\'t keep.\n\nI think we will be forced to weigh in by sanders and of course we have to\nstate our position: it\'s a transitional energy--and we need to go green.\nBut that is a very soft response that sounds better if Bernie is being hit\nby the left.\n\nI would watch our tone and not sound too pro-fracking. A reluctant tone is\na better fit for dem caucus goers (it\'s a transition energy. It\'s not great\nbut it allows us to get to where we want to be)\n\nOn Tuesday, February 23, 2016, Trevor Houser <tghouser.hrc@gmail.com\n<javascript:_e(%7B%7D,\'cvml\',\'tghouser.hrc@gmail.com\');>> wrote:\n\n> ++ John and Sara on this chain.\n>\n>\n>\n> Brad and I just chatted.
