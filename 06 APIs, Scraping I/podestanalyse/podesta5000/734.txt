(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The State Department has been unable to find in its\nrecords all or part of 15 work-related emails from Hillary Rodham Clinton\'s\nprivate server that were released this week by a House panel investigating\nthe 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, officials said Thursday.\n\nThe emails all predate the Sept. 11 <x-apple-data-detectors://6> assault on\nthe U.S. diplomatic facility and include scant words written by Clinton\nherself, the officials said. They consist of more in a series of would-be\nintelligence reports passed to her by longtime political confidant Sidney\nBlumenthal, the officials said.\n\nNevertheless, the fact that the State Department says it can\'t find them\namong emails she provided surely will raise new questions about Clinton\'s\nuse of a personal email account and server while secretary of state and\nwhether she has provided the agency all of her work-related correspondence,\nas she claims.\n\n"She has turned over 55,000 pages of materials to the State Department,\nincluding all emails in her possession from Mr. Blumenthal," said Nick\nMerrill, a Clinton campaign spokesman, when asked about the discrepancy.\n\nClinton is running for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nClinton\'s use of the non-government email while in office was kept hidden\nfrom all but a small circle of aides, outside advisers, family members and\nfriends. She says the single account for personal and professional purposes\nwas a matter of convenience, and says all her work emails were included in\nthe 55,000 pages of documents she later handed over to the State\nDepartment. Emails of a personal nature were destroyed, she says.\n\nThe State Department informed the Select Benghazi Committee on Thursday\nthat they are no longer certain that\'s the case, according to officials who\nspoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\'t authorized to speak\npublicly on the matter. The officials said Julia Frifield, the assistant\nsecretary of state for legislative affairs, confirmed that 10 emails and\nparts of five others that the committee made public Monday couldn\'t be\nlocated in the department\'s records.\n\nAs for 46 other, previously unreleased Libya-related Blumenthal emails\npublished by the committee, officials said all are in the department\'s\nrecords. They weren\'t handed over to congressional investigators because\nthey had no relevance to events in Benghazi and did not correspond to the\ncommittee\'s request, the officials said. The officials added that they are\nwilling to provide emails outside the committee\'s initial request, but\nwarned that doing so would require more time.\n\nThe emails missing from the State Department\'s records include missives\nfrom Blumenthal in which he sends media accounts about the killing of one\nof Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi\'s sons, various reports on internal\npolitics among Libya\'s rebels and news of the assassination of a former\nGadhafi minister in Vienna. The last email was sent Aug. 28, 2012, two\nweeks before the Benghazi attack, and none focus particularly on the\neastern Libyan city.\n\nClinton\'s responses are brief. In one from August 2011, she tells\nBlumenthal she will be in Paris the next day to meet rebel leaders and says\nshe had "to resort to new iPad" because she didn\'t have electricity or\nBlackberry coverage after Hurricane Irene.\n\nIn another from March 2012, she passes on an adviser\'s skepticism regarding\none of Blumenthal\'s reports about political intrigue in post-Gadhafi Libya,\nsaying: "This strain credulity based on what I know. Any other info about\nit?"\n\nAnd after a long August 2012 note from Blumenthal about Libya\'s new interim\nPresident Mohamed Yousef el-Magariaf, Clinton writes: "Another keeper -\nthanks and please keep \'em coming." Four days later, she responds to a\nfollow-up reports about el-Magariaf, saying: "Fascinating. I had a very\ngood call w him."\n\nClinton\'s critics are likely to focus less on the substance of the emails\nthan on the fact that they weren\'t shared with the State Department.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, the Benghazi panel\'s Republican\nchairman, has pressed for an explanation of why Blumenthal gave the\ncommittee emails not previously shared by the State Department. The\nsuggestion has been that either the department or Clinton was hiding\nsomething.\n\nClinton aides say her submission to the department included all emails from\nBlumenthal and a dozen more exchanges that weren\'t in the records he\nprovided the House committee. They said some from Blumenthal\'s record,\nwhich was provided as a Microsoft Word document, couldn\'t be confirmed as\nhaving been sent as emails.\n\nState Department officials also questioned the provenance of some exchanges\nbecause they weren\'t formatted as emails.\n\n\n\nOn Jun 24, 2015, at 10:40 PM, Brian Fallon <bfallon@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nBased on conversations today, below is the finalized version of the\nresponse plan:\n\n*Q: The State Department says that at least 16 of the emails\nthat Sid Blumenthal turned over to the Benghazi Select Committee were not\nincluded in the 55,000 pages of materials produced by Hillary Clinton.\nDoesn\'t this prove that Hillary Clinton deleted certain emails at some\npoint before producing them to the Department?*\n\n*ON-THE-RECORD RESPONSE FROM SPOKESMAN NICK MERRILL:*\n\n"Hillary Clinton has turned over 55,000 pages of materials to the State\nDepartment, including all emails in her possession from Mr. Blumenthal."\n\n*ADDITIONAL POINTS ON BACKGROUND FROM CLINTON AIDE:*\n\nNot only did Clinton turn over all emails that she has from Blumenthal, she\nactually turned over more than a dozen emails that were not included in\nwhat Mr. Blumenthal handed over to the House committee.\n\nWe do not have a record of other correspondence between Mrs. Clinton and\nMr. Blumenthal beyond that which was turned over to the State Department.\nIn terms of the documents provided by Mr. Blumenthal to the House\ncommittee, we do not recognize many of those materials and cannot speak to\ntheir origin.\n\n*OFF RECORD, if pressed on whether we are essentially admitting the\npossibility that she deleted some emails:*\n\nLook, we do not know what these materials are, or where they came from.\nJust take a look at them: many of the documents are not even formatted as\nemails.\n\nBut even if Sid is right and some of these documents were at some point\nsent to Clinton, there is nothing in any of these emails that is remotely\nnew or interesting. Indeed, none of these 16 emails are qualitatively\ndifferent than the dozens of others that Hillary already produced to the\nState Department. So it is completely ridiculous to suggest that there\nmight have been any nefarious basis for her to want to delete any of Sid\'s\ncorrespondence.\n\nOn Wed, Jun 24, 2015 at 4:07 PM, Heather Samuelson <\nhsamuelson@cdmillsgroup.com> wrote:\n\n>   Thanks for update Nick\n>\n>  Brian -- I will call you on this.
