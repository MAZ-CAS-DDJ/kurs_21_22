I will update my Dad when he lands. I think\nit would be good if some of you or at least Cheryl talks to my Dad tonight\nand if we could all talk to him tonight or later that week, that would be\nhelpful and good for him I think and our process. \n\nTerry - I will also call you back. \n\nI am sorry if this is a bit chaotic, I cannot believe we are dealing with\nthis right now when we are grieving. Thank you all for your help. \n\nOn Tue, Nov 1, 2011 at 8:23 PM, Anna James <aj66@nyu.edu> wrote:\n\nHello all - I apologize for the urgent email though this is all coming to a\nhead more quickly than we all had hoped. My father is on a flight back to DC\nfrom Westchester right now and we spoke right before he took off 20 min ago.\nI think if possible it would be good if he talks to all of you tonight\n(though Bruce this is only of course if you can and are able, otherwise\nplease please do not worry). He should be at Whitehaven around 9 I think. I\ndo not know what happened with Victoria and Jennifer today when they spoke\nto Doug, after having talked to, I think, Terry and John earlier today, in\naddition to having spoken previously with my Dad, me, Cheryl and Bruce. Doug\ncalled and yelled and screamed at my Dad about how could he do this to\nJustin and him, he would be nothing without him, etc. My Dad responded that\nhe could not have this conversation with Doug and that he was trying to do\nthe right thing by all. I cannot believe Doug did this on the day my\ngrandmother died. My mother is exhausted, we are all heartbroken but we need\na strategy and my father needs advice/ counsel. I left a message for\nVictoria but have not heard back. I will also send her an email now.\n\nI have signed the document Scott sent to appt John and am sending it back\nnow I hope that will grant John the requisite privilege.\n\nThank you.\n\nChelsea\n\n \n\n"
