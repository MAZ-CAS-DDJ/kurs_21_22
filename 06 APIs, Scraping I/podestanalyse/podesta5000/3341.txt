Vernon (601 Massachusetts Avenue NW) has invited the Georgetown Law staff to try out its classes for free, between now and January 9, 2016.\n\nThis promotion is only available at the Mt. Vernon location and only covers the cost of a regular SoulCycle class (SoulSurvivor classes are excluded).  Please remember to bring your own spin shoes or you may rent a pair on site for $3. More information for first time cyclist can be found online at: https://www.soul-cycle.com/about/how-it-works/\n\nTo take advantage of this treat, please read the attached form carefully and click on the icon to set-up your SC account. You must show your Georgetown Law staff/faculty/fellow ID. Please email me with any questions. Hope to see you on a bike soon!\n\nBest,\nLeslie\n\n[cid:image003.jpg@01D13C13.77C4B3C0]<https://www.soul-cycle.com/>\n\nLeslie de Leon\nDirector, Business Services\nGeorgetown Law\n600 New Jersey Avenue NW Suite 517\nWashington, DC 20001\nTel: 202-661-6553\nEmail: ld333@law.georgetown.edu<https://mail.law.georgetown.edu/owa/redir.aspx?C=BE9Nu7YtN0i316uhp3NzY47iTPB-rNEIpmgXkrRxshLAvkKBs60pROEFZbEwaxPB9H5W8CklufA.&URL=mailto%3ald333%40law.georgetown.edu>\n\n\n"
