It will be 100 percent focused on middle class economic growth in New Jersey where we have lagged badly. \nWe will not have made our political decision by then but continue to lean strongly in that direction. \nThe launch will be a big deal, mixing the great and the good. \nDo you think there is any way we could get POTUS, FLOTUS or VPOTUS to join us. Clearly, we would build it around their availability. \nMany thanks and look forward to speaking soon. Can't thank you enough. \nPM\nSent via BlackBerry by AT&T\n"
