And the more people who vote early, the more we can focus on the ones who haven\xe2\x80\x99t voted yet.\n\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be prouder to have the President at my side again today, and we were both blown away by the energy of the crowd.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the kind of energy we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need for these last 16 days.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s time to show our opponent, and the country, the power of people -- and tomorrow is our first chance to do it.\n\nThanks so much,\n\nGovernor Quinn\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nContributions are not tax deductible.
