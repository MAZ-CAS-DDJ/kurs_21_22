Based on his distinguished career, philanthropy, and work on behalf of progressive causes, I believe he would be an excellent addition to our Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan is a longtime donor to CAP, but is interested in becoming a substantial investor.  He has also supported Media Matters and other progressive organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan is the Managing Partner, Chief Investment Officer, and a Managing Director at Sankaty Advisors, which he founded in 1997.  He is chair of the Firm's Credit Committee  and Risk & Oversight Committee, with overall responsibility for the Firm\xe2\x80\x99s investment strategy, management and risk. Before the formation of Sankaty, Jonathan worked in Bain Capital\xe2\x80\x99s private equity business, as a consultant at McKinsey & Company, and at Drexel Burnham Lambert.  Jonathan graduated Columbia College, Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude, and holds an M.B.A. with Distinction from Harvard Business School.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan, together with his wife Jeannie, participate in and support a wide array of philanthropic endeavors as well.  In 2007, they founded the Crimson Lion Foundation, which provides financial support to several organizations that include Boston Children\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Cradles to Crayons, Be The Change, Best Buddies, uAspire, LIFT Communities, Horizons for Homeless Children, and Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Boston.  They also helped establish the Lavine Family Humanitarian Studies Initiative in 2011, which supports training and education of humanitarian aid workers.  Jonathan serves on the Boards of City Year, Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism at Brandeis University, Children\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital Trust, Horizons for Homeless Children, and Opportunity Nation.  You can read more about Jonathan here<https://www.sankaty.com/team/jonathan-lavine>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am confident that Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s perspective and commitment would be an important part of advancing our work, and I therefore recommend that we appoint him to the Board.  Resolutions to this effect are below and also attached.  If you agree to these resolutions, please respond affirmatively to this email, or email our Corporate Secretary, Alex DeMots, at ademots@americanprogress.org<mailto:ademots@americanprogress.org>.  If we achieve unanimous consent to these resolutions, Jonathan will be able to join our Board call on February 24.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s appointment, or have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for all you do for CAP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nNeera Tanden\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResolutions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNANIMOUS WRITTEN CONSENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                We, the directors of Center for American Progress, a District of Columbia nonprofit corporation (the \xe2\x80\x9cCorporation\xe2\x80\x9d), hereby adopt the following resolutions by unanimous written consent (this \xe2\x80\x9cConsent\xe2\x80\x9d), in accordance with the provisions of section 29-406.21 of the District of Columbia Official Code:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber of Directors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                RESOLVED: that in accordance with Section 3.2(A) of the Bylaws, the authorized number of directors of the Corporation is set at twelve; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppointment of New Director\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLVED, FURTHER: that, in accordance with Section 3.5 of the Bylaws, the following individual is appointed as a director of the Corporation, to hold office until the next election of directors and until his successor has been elected and qualified:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan Lavine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Authority\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                RESOLVED, FURTHER: that the officers of the Corporation are authorized and directed to execute such other documents and take such further actions as is necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of the foregoing resolutions, including the filing of this Consent with the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCounterparts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLVED, FURTHER: that this Consent may be executed electronically, including by email, and in counterparts, each of which is deemed an original, but all of which together, upon delivery, constitute one and the same document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
