There is simply no\ncomparison.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*TALKING POINTS: HILLARY CLINTON AND SYRIA*\n\n\n\n*BACKGROUND:** In a panel discussion with CNN\xe2\x80\x99s Sanjay Gupta at the Clinton\nGlobal Initiative recently, Hillary Clinton discussed the situation in\nSyria and the current steps being taken to address the threat of terrorist\ngroups in the region. *\n\n\n\n*KEY POINTS:*\n\n\xc2\xb7         As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was an early advocate of\narming the moderate Syrian opposition. She "believed, at the time, they\nwould be overwhelmed by Assad\xe2\x80\x99s military force and that they would open up\nthe door to extremists coming in."\n\n\n\n   - Clinton has said there is no way to predict if arming the rebels early\n   on would have worked, but she believed it was the best of the options\n   available at the time, a point she reiterated this week when she stated, \xe2\x80\x9cI\n   can\xe2\x80\x99t sit here today and tell you if we had done what I had recommended we\n   would be in a very different position.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xc2\xb7         Recently, Hillary Clinton emphasized the importance of the\ncurrent steps being taken to address the threat of ISIL and other terrorist\ngroups in the region, stating: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something the president is right to\nbring the world\xe2\x80\x99s attention to and say, whatever the debates might have\nbeen before, this is a threat to the region and beyond.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nELEVEN THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT HILLARY\n\n\n\n*Secretary Clinton helped restore America\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and standing in the\nworld during a time of global challenges and changes.* Secretary Clinton\nworked tirelessly to revitalize American diplomacy and strengthen alliances\nby traveling nearly a million miles for hundreds of meetings with foreign\nleaders in 112 countries. As America\xe2\x80\x99s lead diplomat, Secretary Clinton\nunderstood the importance of engaging the public and took diplomacy\ndirectly to people around the world. Just as she was as a senator,\nSecretary Clinton was a workhorse, often taking on difficult challenges and\naddressing them directly around the world.\n\n\n\n*Secretary Clinton built and maintained a coalition to enact the toughest\nsanctions in Iran\xe2\x80\x99s history. *Secretary Clinton helped impose the toughest\nsanctions in Iran\xe2\x80\x99s history by getting Russia and China on board. Even the Wall\nStreet Journal\n<http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703957904575252600443502256?KEYWORDS=HILLARY+clinton>\neditorial\nboard noted that, \xe2\x80\x9cClinton surely pulled out every stop to get Russia and\nparticularly China\xe2\x80\xa6on board.\xe2\x80\x9d And as Howard Dean recently told CNN\n<http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1311/25/cg.02.html>, \xe2\x80\x9cHillary\nClinton cranked up the sanctions for the first time under President Obama\nthat actually made the Iranians come to the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Secretary Clinton played an integral role in the New START Treaty with\nRussia. *Secretary Clinton played an active role in reaching a missile\nreduction agreement with Russia, working to push it through the Senate\n<http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/08/11/clinton.start.treaty/> and securing\nmore than the necessary two-thirds majority. She entered the treaty into\nforce <http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/02/156037.htm> in Munich with\nher Russian counterpart. As a result of the treaty\xe2\x80\x99s passage, there\nwill be fewer\nnuclear missile launchers\n<http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/02/156037.htm>. Simply put, the\nworld is safer.\n\n\n\n*Secretary Clinton supported the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to\njustice.* As NBC\xe2\x80\x99s Brian Williams reported\n<http://rockcenter.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/05/02/11493919-president-obama-bin-laden-raid-is-most-important-single-day-of-my-presidency>\non\nhis website, \xe2\x80\x9cSecretary of Defense Robert Gates recommended an air strike\nwith no forces on the ground.  CIA Director Panetta supported a raid by\nSpecial Forces and so did Secretary of State Clinton.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Secretary Clinton helped avert all-out war in Gaza by negotiating a\ncease-fire between Israelis and Palestinians. *In November 2012, after\neight days of violence, Secretary Clinton negotiated a Gaza cease-fire with\nEgyptian president Mohamed Morsi. In an article titled \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton\nscores Gaza cease fire success,\xe2\x80\x9d Politico noted\n<http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/84145.html> that, \xe2\x80\x9cSecretary of\nState Hillary Clinton got a Gaza cease-fire right at the moment hope seemed\ndead for a rapid end to the violence\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Secretary Clinton played a role in bringing one war to an end and planning\nfor the end of another. *Working closely with Department of Defense\ncolleagues and as part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team, Secretary\nClinton played a role in the end of war in Iraq and in beginning a\ntransition in Afghanistan, with all NATO allies having agreed to stand-up a\npost withdrawal support plan. As President Obama told 60 Minutes\n<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-and-clinton-the-60-minutes-interview/3/>,\nit was \xe2\x80\x9call a consequence of the great work that Hillary did and her team\ndid and the State Department did in conjunction with our national security\nteam.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Secretary Clinton was critical in America\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpivot to Asia\xe2\x80\x9d strategy.* As\nMartin Indyk of the Brookings Institute wrote in Foreign Policy\n<http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/06/20/debating_hillary#sthash.tKnaZMYq.dpbs>,\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98pivot\xe2\x80\x99 to East Asia will probably be Obama\xe2\x80\x99s most lasting strategic\nachievement\xe2\x80\xa6 [but] it is Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s too. She laid the groundwork, built the\nrelationships, and developed the complex architecture of the new strategy \xe2\x80\x94\nand she turned up at that pivotal moment in Vietnam in July 2010 to declare\nthe U.S. commitment to the region.\xe2\x80\x9d Secretary Clinton earned praise\n<http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/hard-diplomatic-work-pays-off-in-myanmar/1262961>\nfor\nher work in opening up Burma, a place that had not been visited by a\nSecretary of State in 50 years.\n\n\n\n*Secretary Clinton worked to build the coalition to oust Qadhafi and stop\nmassacres in Libya. *As the Washington Post reported\n<http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-10-30/world/35277483_1_brega-misurata-benghazi>\nupon\nthe end of NATO operations in Libya, \xe2\x80\x9cU.S. officials and key allies are\noffering a detailed new defense of the approach and Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s pivotal role\n\xe2\x80\x93 both within a divided Cabinet and a fragile, assembled-on-the-fly\ninternational alliance. What emerges from these accounts is a picture of\nClinton using her mixture of political pragmatism and tenacity to referee\nspats among NATO partners, secure crucial backing from Arab countries and\ntutor rebels on the fine points of message management.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Secretary Clinton engaged in economic statecraft.* Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nfocus on economic engagement resulted inincreased investment\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-10/how-hillary-clinton-created-a-u-s-business-promotion-machine.html>\nthrough\nthree new free trade agreements\n<http://www.state.gov/e/eb/tpp/bta/fta/c26474.htm> (Colombia\n<http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2011/01/155566.htm>, Panama\n<http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2011/10/175348.htm> and South Korea\n<http://translations.state.gov/st/english/texttrans/2011/04/20110417130630tegdirb5.767465e-02.html#axzz2nwkRuZel>)\nand 15 Open Skies agreements\n<http://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ata/114805.htm> including with Japan,\nBrazil, Saudi Arabia and Israel.\n\n\n\n*Secretary Clinton brought the State Department into the 21st Century.\n*Secretary\nClinton helped the State Department adapt to emerging issues such as cyber\nsecurity by creating the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism\nCommunications <http://www.state.gov/r/cscc/> to combat Al-Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s growing\ninfluence online. She recognized the important role of energy in U.S.\nforeign policy and helped create the Bureau of Energy Resources\n<http://blogs.state.gov/stories/2011/11/18/us-department-state-establishes-new-bureau-energy-resources>\nto\nprotect our energy infrastructure and influence how nations move to cleaner\nfuel.\n\n\n\n*Secretary Clinton elevated the cause of women\xe2\x80\x99s rights to new heights*.\nSecretary Clinton recognized women\xe2\x80\x99s rights as a major foreign policy\nissue. It is, according to Newsweek, the area of \xe2\x80\x9chardships faced by women\nand girls across the world\xe2\x80\x93that her impact has been most profound.\xe2\x80\x9d Hillary\nconvinced the White House to allow her to create a new position at the\nState Department: Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women\xe2\x80\x99s Issues. Newsweek\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cAcross the world, in diverse and deeply reactionary cultures,\nClinton and [Ambassador-at-Large] Verveer have spoken and fought to\nliberalize attitudes on women\xe2\x80\x99s role in the economy, girls\xe2\x80\x99 schooling,\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s health, domestic violence, issues arising from war and conflict,\nand myriad other concerns.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'
