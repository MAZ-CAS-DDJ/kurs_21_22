Corzine is the Governor of New Jersey, currently serving a four-year term ending in 2010.  He represented New Jersey in the U.S. Senate from 2001 until 2006, when he stepped down to take his seat as Governor.  Prior to his political career, Jon was Chairman and C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs, one of the world\x92s largest global investment banks.\n\nJon\x92s current net worth is unknown.  In 2004, it was estimated at roughly $400 million.  Jon has spent millions of his personal wealth for his political campaigns.  Combined expenditures for his U.S. Senate bid and the governor\x92s race exceeded $100 million.  Because he is a multi-millionaire, Jon accepts a token salary of $1 per year as governor.\n\nJon began his business career working as a portfolio analyst for the Bond Department at Continental-Illinois National Bank in Chicago in 1970 when he was still in business school.  He then went on to work for a regional bank in Columbus, Ohio, until 1975, when he moved his family to New Jersey.  There he was hired as a bond trader for Goldman Sachs and eventually worked his way up to Chairman and C.E.O. in 1994.  Under his leadership, Goldman Sachs went from a private partnership to a worldwide, publicly-traded corporation.  He received numerous awards and recognition for his time at Goldman Sachs, including being named on Time\x92s 1997 list of Top 50 Technology Executives.\n\nAfter being forced from Goldman Sachs in 1999, Jon campaigned for a Senate seat after Frank Lautenberg announced his retirement.  Jon won the seat by a 4% margin over Republican Bob Franks, and spent over $62 million of his own money on his campaign, making it the most expensive in U.S. history.  While in the Senate, Jon was a member of the Committees on Banking, Intelligence, the Budget, and Energy and Natural Resources.  He co-authored the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a piece of legislation designed to crack down on corporate malfeasance.  Jon also supported legislation reforming 401(k) plans, expanding health care coverage for children and pregnant women, providing a two-year tax break to victims of the 9/11 attacks, supporting gun control, and outlawing racial profiling.  Jon was also the chief sponsor of legislation that would apply sanctions on the Sudanese government for the genocide in Darfur, and was one of the 23 senators to vote against the Iraq War Resolution.\n\nJon has his own foundation, the Jon S. Corzine Foundation, which gives primarily for education, health care, and religious organizations.  In 2006, the Foundation reported assets of over $13.98 million and total giving of over $4.26 million.  The largest grants that year were awarded to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center ($500,000), the Pomfret School ($500,000), the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization ($250,000), the New Jersey State Firemens Mutual Benevolent Association ($250,000), and SAGE Eldercare ($250,000).\n\nSince 2000, Jon has given over $4.2 million in political donations.  So far in the 2008 cycle, he has given $185,000, including $100,000 to the DGA, $25,000 to the DNC, and $25,000 to the DSCC.  In 2006, he gave $484,300, including $231,100 to the DGA, $100,000 to the September Fund, $30,000 to EMILY\x92s List, and $25,000 to the DNC.  In 2004, he gave $554,000, including $250,000 to Grassroots Democrats, $200,000 to EMILY\x92s List, and $50,000 to the DSCC.  In 2002, he gave over $2.54 million, including $1.6 million to the DSCC, $500,000 to the DNC, and $65,000 to EMILY\x92s List.  In 2000, he gave $470,575, including $295,000 to the DNC, $100,000 to the DCCC, and $20,000 to the DSCC.\nJon attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1969.  He earned his M.B.A. from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business in 1973.  While in college, he enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve and served until 1975, eventually earning the rank of sergeant.  John was married to Joanne Dougherty, his high school sweetheart, but the couple divorced in November 2003.  John has three children.  Jon lives at Drumthwacket, the New Jersey Governor\x92s official residence in Price.  He also maintains a private residence in Hoboken.
