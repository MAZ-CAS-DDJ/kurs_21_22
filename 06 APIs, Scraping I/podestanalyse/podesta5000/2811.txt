People are calling New York a "pivot point" in the battle for the House, and Nan Hayworth and her Tea Party friends are going to pounce on the news. \n\nWe know how to win this thing -- we\'ve done it before -- but we can\'t without your help. We have less than six months until the election, and we have to act now. To be ready for the money coming in, I need to raise $6,000 by midnight tonight -- can I count on your support?\n\nClick here to donate now and help me reach this crucial goal by midnight tonight.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20140508-lapd&amp;amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\nWinning takes putting ads on the air, knocking on doors and doing everything we can to get the word out about this election. And all of that takes resources. \n\nIn 2012 you helped me raise enough to win, and I can\'t thank you enough for that. Now I need your help again. I really hope you\'ll help me reach our goal of $6,000 by midnight tonight. I know we can do it!\n\nPlease click here to donate $250 and help me reach $6,000 by midnight tonight.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20140508-lapd&amp;amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\nThank you so much,\n\nSean\n\n\n\nContribute -- https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20140508-lapd&amp;amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.\nTo unsubscribe from the Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress email list, please click here: http://action.seanmaloney.com/unsubscribe\n\n\nPAID FOR BY SEAN PATRICK MALONEY FOR CONGRESS\n\n\n'
