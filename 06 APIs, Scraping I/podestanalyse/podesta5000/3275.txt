john.podesta@gmail.comb'\nMike & Co.,\n\nThe hopes of even the most zealous advocate of tax reform must be modest this year, but brave talk is heard from some well-placed members.  Almost any reform would be seen as a crowning accomplishment for the new Speaker but the maw of election year politics militates against anything bipartisan and ambitious.\n\nBelow is a look at the state of play for the major tax legislation likely to see votes in 2016.  Tomorrow we look at the same issue from the campaign perspective in a pre-debate update.  \n\nBest,\n\nDana\n\n----------\n\nLegislative Tax Prospects for 2016 \n\nSenate Floor \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Customs Bill and Internet Moratorium\nEarly in the session, the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act conference report, to which the House added a permanent Internet Tax Moratorium, will hit the Senate floor.   Sen. Durbin thinks he has enough votes to sustain a Budget Act point of order to knock that out, preserving slim odds of moving the Marketplace Fairness Act.  Most Senate Democrats will vote against cloture and for a Budget Act point of order against the report.   Democrats cite language discouraging the inclusion of climate change provisions in future trade agreements and weakened human trafficking language.  A permanent Internet Tax Moratorium, if enacted, would kill any chance for adding the Marketplace Fairness Act to subject Internet sales to state sales and use taxes.  \n\nSen. John Thune:  \xe2\x80\x9cI think that, in the end, if the Customs conference moves\xe2\x80\x94and I think it will move soon\xe2\x80\x94then the Internet-tax moratorium will be included in it as it was reported from the House.\xe2\x80\x9d  Regarding the Budget Act point of order against the Internet Tax Moratorium, he says:  \xe2\x80\x9cRight now, I think the vote count is probably fairly close on that. There are a lot of groups who are interested in that that are whipping it, and it could be a close vote, but I think in the end there will be 60 votes for keeping that in the bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSenate Finance\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Tax Extenders:  The passage of the tax extenders package through to the end of 2016 should give Senate Finance some breathing room to pursue comprehensive tax reform legislation in the coming year.  Thirty-two more expire at the end of this year, so look for another extenders bill during next December\'s lame duck session of Congress.\n\nAs noted last week, within Senate Finance is a series of working groups organized last year to discuss potential tax reforms in a variety of areas.  The working groups are:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  International Tax Reform:   The working group proposes ending \xe2\x80\x9cthe lock-out effect\xe2\x80\x9d on international profits by adopting a dividend exemption system.  This and minimum tax proposals are expected to help end base-erosion and tax inversion activities.  The Committee will continue to hold hearings on international tax reform in 2016, but no legislation has been introduced yet.  Chair Hatch:  \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely that we could work out an international tax bill because there are a number of us that want to get rid of the inversion problem ... Both Democrats and Republicans ought to want to get rid of the inversions of our larger corporations over to other lower tax jurisdictions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Business Income Tax Reform:   This group has put forward proposals to lower business income taxes.  The group\xe2\x80\x99s report also catalogued recent legislative proposals, including the cash method of accounting, a pass-through entity business deduction, the research credit, publicly traded partnership rules, and corporate integration.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Individual Tax Reform:  The working group calls for tax simplification and the adoption of incentivizing tax policies, such as those that encourage charitable giving and saving for education. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Savings and Investment:  The group\xe2\x80\x99s report lists three goals for policymakers to pursue: (1) increasing access to tax deferred retirement savings; (2) increasing participation and levels of savings; and (3) discouraging early withdrawals from retirement accounts.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Community Development and Infrastructure: The working group has proposed creating an alternative for funding the Highway Trust Fund.  Proposed solutions are meant to increase available funds to \xe2\x80\x9c... fix America\xe2\x80\x99s roads and bridges, while also overhauling our broken tax code.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the House\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  International Business Tax -- Ways and Means Chair Kevin Brady seems determined to present an international business tax reform bill which addresses dividend repatriation.  Dividend repatriation is expected to pass House Ways and Means this year (more on this below).  Some Representatives have already begun pushing for such reforms; yesterday, Rep. Devin Nunes, with 26 cosponsors, introduced the American Business Competitiveness Act.  He wrote: "The ABC Act has four main components: it will allow 100 percent, same-year expensing for all businesses; lower the maximum business tax rate to 25 percent; eliminate all loopholes and special deals; and switch to a territorial international system."   Broad tax reform proposals don\xe2\x80\x99t have much viability in the coming year; however, such proposals are important precursors for future tax reform efforts, possibly in 2017.\n\nHouse Prospects \n\nGetting the top corporate and individual tax rates down to 30 percent would be difficult, and anything lower would be politically impossible because it would require wholesale elimination of major and very popular tax deductions.  If Brady tries to lower the top corporate rate below the top individual rate, pass-through business entities would oppose the bill, killing any chance for passage. \n\nIn any event, dividend repatriation has apparently been ruled out by a Ryan aide.  George Callas, on a Pricewaterhouse Coopers webcast, said it would cost more than $100 billion over ten years, that it would only be considered as part of a broad tax reform, and that \xe2\x80\x9cIt\'s not just a money generator.  It\'s a transition rule to deal with old earnings that were earned under the credit and worldwide system when you\'re moving to an exemption system.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHouse Ways and Means \n\nBrady inherited an odd situation when he took over the Committee in November, coming in almost halfway through a Congress.  But he also replaced now- Speaker Ryan, who took key members of the Ways and Means policy team with him. Brady had to immerse himself in tax extenders negotiations pretty soon after he got the gavel.  The passage of the permanent extenders package will now give Brady a period of relief to get his bearings for a run at other policy priorities.  \nHe must now secure new hires for his office, which lobbyists have said could offer an indication of his intentions. During Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s time on the Committee, fewer resources were committed to tax policy staff. \n\nObama Overture and the EITC\n\n\nMeanwhile, President Obama said at the SOTU address: "I\'d welcome a serious discussion about strategies that we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers without kids." It was an olive branch to Ryan, who has also made battling poverty one of his signature issues.  On that matter, note that both sides are interested in lowering the eligibility age for the EITC from 25 to 21 and doubling what those recipients can get, from $500 to $1,000.  \n\nThe stimulus-era expansions of the EITC just became permanent in the tax extenders deal, but GOP concerns about fraud in the program persist.  Ryan has said fraud savings could go toward offsetting the cost of an expansion. Obama proposed paying for the $60 billion 10-year cost of his proposal by changing the taxation of carried interest and eliminating a break self-employed professionals can use to avoid payroll taxes.\n\nBoth parties have come to see the EITC as a potent tool in fighting poverty.  In 2013, the EITC pulled about 6.2 million people out of poverty, according to Census data. SNAP benefits (aka food stamps) kept 4.8 million people out of poverty that year.\n\nWrap-up\n\nDespite the reputation of election years being bereft of significant legislative activity, it looks as if we can expect some interesting actions over the next 12 months on the tax policy side.  Going forward, look for action from Sen. Hatch and Rep. Brady on their pet projects. Speaker Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s well-deserved reputation on tax reform is also a factor in the future of this policy debate.   But there is not much to entertain the electorate in tax reform and Congress lacks for comity. \n\n--------\n\n\n\n> On Jan 13, 2016, at 12:43 PM, Dana <danachasin@gmail.com> wrote:\n> \n> Mike & Co. --\n> \n> Just so you know:  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in a primary right now.

It is not quite a tangle on a specific issue between the two leading candidates as much as a proxy struggle between the campaigns and the commentariat, both trying to put the debate into the larger perspective of broad policy questions and themes.  \n> The candidates\' recent exchanges haven\'t grappled fully with the issues at contest while allowing Sen. Sanders to continue focusing on his so-far successful populist rhetoric.   His advantage here is bound to erode if the debate becomes any more substantive for a variety of reasons. \n> Glass-Steagall\n> The US Banking Act of 1933, better known as Glass-Steagall, has been near the center of economic political discussions for decades.  The act was introduced in 1933 to separate the activities of commercial and investment banking, elemental in the New Deal effort to end one Great Depression and prevent others.    By the 1960s, the lines started blurring between commercial and investment banking activities as regulators began to allow commercial banks to undertake more securities activities.  There were so many allowances that many believe the Act was de facto dead by the time it was repealed in 1999.   I\n> The substantive policy issue most in contention is the centrality of the 1999 repeal of the Act to the recession.  This is a fine place for it if you are looking for ways to trip a candidate up on the arcane business of commercial bank functions, their relatively incidental role in the recession, and the limits of Glass-Steagall (a vulnerability of his which I will happily expand upon in an update for those interested in the policy blow-by-blow).\n> \n> Political Viability\n> \n> The Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 plan hinges on passing a new Glass-Steagall Act to permanently separate commercial and investment banking and then, importantly, breaking up the largest banks (he includes non-banks like AIG and Bear Sterns in this) within one year of taking office.  \n> \n> What\xe2\x80\x99s the professional commentary on Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 plan to use Dodd-Frank section 121 to break up banks within one year?  One neutral analyst:  \xe2\x80\x9cunrealistic ... since you would probably need to replace Janet Yellen with someone who\xe2\x80\x99s on board with this project, and her term won\xe2\x80\x99t expire until early 2018.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n> These considerations overshadow for the moment the practical political reality that most of the specific proposals being debated are unlikely to gain traction in the next Congress given the near certainty that the GOP will retain control of the House.\n> But there is plenty at stake here and HRC has won probably the most important vote in this still muted and recondite debate. Barney Frank:  "There was this inaccurate argument out there that she\'s been weak on the subject... I don\'t know what that\'s based on, other than the fact she represented New York."  Getting Barney Frank\'s support is big and should be more ballyhooed.  But getting a small and ready stable of media savvy and intellectually able validators is not always easy. \n> The majority of rank-and-file Democratic primary voters may appreciate Sen. Sanders\' obvious sincerity and passion on the issue.  He is relying on it; it is perhaps the central issue of his campaign.  But HRC\'s approach to regulation is no less thoughtful, certainly more detailed, and probably more systemically sound.  Moreover, it matters to voters who will have to work with at least half a Republican Congress.  And the Clinton plan is at least more viable than that of Sen. Sanders.  \n> \n> Neutralizing the Advantage\n> \n> Not that creating a roadmap of guaranteed legislative victories is HRC\'s plan.  The plan instead is to have a creditable rejoinder to Sen. Sanders\' financial reform  proposals and to do so with ideas that blunt the semi-informed populist rhetoric and win the support of progressives and independents.  And to do it systemically -- HRC\'s dozens of proposals focus on be priorities for improvement and reach into every corner of the sector. \n> Sen. Sanders believes that the main cause of the financial crisis was the lack of Glass-Steagall, that had Glass-Steagall still been in place, the crisis would not have occurred.  This minority perspective is subject to challenge.  Few economic crises are the result of one single factor.  Even Sen. Elizabeth Warren agrees that the crisis probably could not have been avoided if Glass-Steagall had been in place.  Prevailing opinion even within the progressive commentariat agrees.  And In any event, the view disregards the large role that \xe2\x80\x9cshadow banking\xe2\x80\x9d had in causing the crisis independent of the depository banks.  \n> Pressing the Advantage\n> The New York Fed says that \xe2\x80\x9c[shadow] banking activities consist of credit, maturity, and liquidity transformation that take place without direct and explicit access to public sources" of liquidity and credit backstops -- the Federal Reserve\xe2\x80\x99s discount window and the FDIC\xe2\x80\x99s insurance on bank deposits.  The shadow banks take greater risks than their traditional counterparts, and they\xe2\x80\x99re doing so with no public protections.  This was true during the Glass-Steagall era as well. \n> \n> Analysts of all stripes worry that that breaking up the largest banks or even passing a new Glass-Steagall Act would simply cause these activities to migrate elsewhere.  After all, shadow banking arose during the time of the first Glass-Steagall, what\xe2\x80\x99s to stop it from surviving the advent of its successor?   Meanwhile, adding or tightening margin requirements on short-term \xe2\x80\x9crepo\xe2\x80\x9d lending, leverage requirements on broker-dealers, transparency on hedge funds, and revisiting the money market fund industry are the repairs to the sector\'s critical inter-institutional links needed to secure it. \n> Voters are legitimately concerned about the security of their jobs and future taxpayer-supported bailouts.  If the debate\'s focus shifts from resurrecting a long-dead Act to finding new, innovative and systemic solutions instead, and it is connected directly with anger about Wall Street bailouts or middle-class fears about being ripped off by the system, the ideas will resonate more deeply.  The new proposed provisions of Dodd-Frank work better for modern banking and the modern economy than the ideas presented in Glass-Steagall over 80 years ago. \n> \n> \n>> On Jan 8, 2016, at 6:29 PM, Dana <danachasin@gmail.com> wrote:\n>> \n>> Mike & Co. --\n>> \n>> \n>> The economy added 292,000 jobs last month, up from 252,000 in November.

Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect a change to a cash-flow tax, look for policies against inversion deals and which favor repatriation of profits at low tax rates.\n>>  \n>> Treating Low- and Middle-Income Earners Equitably\n>>  \n>> \xe2\x80\xa2 This group lies in the gray area in which increased earning can trigger a reduction in government support payments; potential fixes for this problem include making more government assistance programs \xe2\x80\x9cwork-based,\xe2\x80\x9d expanding eligibility for the EITC, and changing the Child and Dependent Care Credit into a refundable benefit.\n>>  \n>> \xe2\x80\xa2 Republicans have long supported an increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and at least two presidential candidate (Sen. Rubio and HRC) have voiced support for increasing tax credit amounts for either the parents of children or families with students in college; it\xe2\x80\x99s possible for these proposals to gain a footing in 2016.\n>>  \n>> Appropriately Tax High-Income Households\n>>  \n>> \xe2\x80\xa2 The simple argument is that taxes against the wealthy are lower now than since the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s, while their share of the national income has risen.  Thus, any increase in incomes will disproportionately benefit the wealthy, leading to an even greater difference in effective tax rates than now exists.\n>>  \n>> \xe2\x80\xa2 This is a non-starter for Republicans, and is the least likely of any of the above categories to see any movement throughout 2016.  HRC and Sen.

A quick look here at two leading possible policy trigger areas that have been central to the discussion, Glass-Steagall and Too Big to Fail" (aka Break up the Banks).  \n>>> \xe2\x80\xa2   Reinstating Glass-Steagall -- \n>>> Asked to identify the biggest policy problems and industry practices that resulted in the financial crisis of 2008 and the deep recession that followed, few laymen would put the evisceration of Glass-Steagall at the top of the list.  Nothing akin to restoring Glass-Steagall came up for a vote in the immediate post-crisis years.  The Obama administration has come under occasional criticism for opposing its reinstatement in some form. \n>>> On Tuesday, Sanders embraced "a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, introduced by my colleague Senator Elizabeth Warren, [which] aims at the heart of the shadow banking system... In my view, Senator Warren, is right.  Dodd-Frank should have broken up Citigroup and other \xe2\x80\x98too- big-to-fail\xe2\x80\x99 banks into pieces.  And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we need to do.  And that\xe2\x80\x99s what I commit to do as president.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>>> \n>>> At the end of the day, Glass-Steagall is probably MEGO material to all but the most activist voters.  What does it matter if it doesn\'t make as a consumer better or get rid of TBTF -- which has spread much further into the lexicon than G/S while "break up the banks" is a rallying cry for some in the base.  \n>>> \n>>> The more proximate causes include some other problems identified by Sanders in his speech, such as getting a grip on systemic risk, which gets attention. \n>>> \n>>> \xe2\x80\xa2  TBTF/Break up the Banks --\n>>> A less-defined but more resonant concern is the faith of most Americans that Dodd-Frank will prevent post-2008 bailouts at their expense.  It is small solace that TARP returned a profit for taxpayers who will never see the return and whose paychecks haven\'t grown similarly.  No one wants to make another reverse transfer of wealth on that scale in the teeth of a recession again. \n>>> So it matters whether Dodd-Frank\'s Titles I and II governing systemic risk work or not.   Thankfully, they remain untested.  Opinion on their efficacy in the face of a crisis is diverse but it is admittedly a minority that believes the procedures in place should be given a chance to work in the absence of some better design.  \n>>> The most popular view in almost all quarters is that maybe Dodd-Frank\'s operations would handle a one-off, single-firm liquidity crisis but would be overwhelmed by a full-blown simultaneous sectoral contraction.  So there is probably a policy that can address this ambient but legitimate concern without undermining the essential structure of DFA Titles I and II. \n>>> Quick postscript on the discussion that got some notice.  In his speech, Sanders said:  \xe2\x80\x9cShadow banks did gamble recklessly, but where did that money come from? It came from the federally insured bank deposits of big commercial banks\xe2\x80\x94something that would have been banned under the Glass-Steagall Act."\n>>> \n>>> It is false that Glass-Steagall banned commercial banks from lending to investment banks.  Many academics and analysts agree with HRC that Glass-Steagall wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have prevented the crisis, because it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have directly addressed the activities of problem firms such as insurer AIG and the investment banks Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns.\n>>> \n>>> Two additional perspectives...\n>>> \n>>> Independent Community Bankers of America:    Glass-Steagall did not ban commercial banks from lending to investment banks, but I don\'t think that was Sander\'s point. The repeal of Glass-Steagall made lending to investment banks moot. The repeal of Glass-Steagall made commercial banks and investment banks one and the same. So all those relatively cheap insured deposits were there for the taking and for use in high risk and speculative trades.  Lending became unnecessary. \n>>> \n>>> Americans for Financial Reform:  Big commercial banks like Citibank and JP Morgan provided all kinds of support to shadow banking after the repeal of Glass-Steagall. They had massive exposures to \'toxic assets\' and to failing investment banks through the securitization, repo, and derivatives markets, not through conventional lending. Preserving the original Glass-Steagall would have prevented some of those exposures, and the modernized 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act that Sanders has endorsed would ban almost of them. \n>>> \n>>> ---------------\n>>> \n>>> Recent Updates:  \n>>> \n>>> Sanders Proposals on GS & TBTF (Jan. 7)\n>>> Sanders\' Fin Reg Proposals  (Jan. 5)\n>>> Year-End Review: Fiscal Policy (Jan. 1)  \n>>> Year-End Review: Financial Regs.

Within one year, break these institutions down to size or otherwise resolve them, using Section 121 of Dodd-Frank. Section 121 allows the FSOC to direct the Fed Board to vote to resolve a financial institution deemed a systemic risk to the national economy. This requires a two-thirds majority of the Board to vote and only applies to bank holding companies with assets exceeding $50 billion, or Fed-supervised non-bank financial companies. \n>>>> \n>>>> No explanation was provided as to how to deal with inaction or  unwillingness by the Fed to force these institutions into resolution. It\'s a little hard to see what improvement, if any, the props makes to the resolution Title 1 and 2 process provided in Dodd-Frank except by adding an option to streamline it marginally.  Note that several pieces of legislation to break up large banks have been introduced in Congress since the crisis, but none have won much support by either Democratic or GOP majorities.\n>>>> \n>>>> Reinstatement of Glass-Steagall --  This was initially proposed by Sens.

What issues were at play?

Once again, the struggle resulted in another stand off between the industry\'s efforts to ease the regulatory burden of DFA and advocates\' bid to expand its protections for workers, investors and increase resources for regulators.  Republicans blame leading Democrats in Congress and in the administration.  Financial reformers who spent all year trying to block regulatory rollbacks are crediting them.   \n>>>>> \n>>>>> The financial industry urged Congress to soften several DFA regulations and sought to do this first through Senate Banking Chair Richard Shelby\'s bill entitled The Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015.  The bill, more than 200 pages and consisting of eight wide titles, addresses wide-ranging areas of reform from changes to a key DFA threshold for enhanced prudential standards to the CFPB\'s qualified mortgage rule. \n>>>>> \n>>>>> Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on Senate Banking, said Shelby\'s bill went too far:  "Democrats are ready, willing, and able to work with Republicans to get community banks and credit unions the regulatory relief they need right now... Rather than focusing on issues that enjoy broad bipartisan support, this draft bill is a sprawling industry wish list of Dodd-Frank rollbacks.  This sweeping proposal holds Main Street financial institutions hostage to a partisan effort to dismantle Dodd-Frank\'s consumer protections and sensible rules for the large banks and nonbanks that played central roles in the financial crisis."\n>>>>> \n>>>>> The main provisions of the Shelby bill:\n>>>>> \n>>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2   Community Bank Reg. Relief --  Comprising 25 different measures loosening regulations on the country\'s smallest banks: relief from privacy disclosure requirements; permission for privately insured credit unions to become members of the Federal Home Loan Bank system; an exemption for banks under $10 billion in assets from the Volcker Rule; and a requirement that the National Credit Union Administration hold public hearings and receive comment on its budget.  \n>>>>> \n>>>>> The opening title also included several provisions criticized by Democrats, such as a change to the CFPB\'s QM rule allowing all loans held in portfolio to be eligible for the rule\'s safe harbor provisions -- a controversial measure altering how certain "points and fees" are calculated under the QM rule, it removes language regarding affiliated title companies that spurred much of the earlier criticism.  It further makes changes banning certain types of loans, such as "no-doc" loans that helped spur the financial crisis.\n>>>>> \n>>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2   SIFI Threshold -- The bill would have multiplied the DFA threshold mandating tougher capital and oversight on banks by ten times to over $500 billion in consolidated assets, though regulators would have the discretion to examine any banks over $50 billion to be considered systemic.  The Fed Board could make a recommendation to the FSOC to consider a particular bank holding company, though the FSOC would have the ability to launch its own evaluation as well.  The FSOC would be able to vote to change the list of criteria over time, and the $500 billion threshold would also be indexed for GDP growth. Shelby was willing to narrow the $50-$500 billion window for deregulation he had first proposed.  Democratic aides involved in the discussions said Shelby was willing to go as low as $250 billion.  Democrats weren\'t willing to go above $200 billion. \n>>>>> \n>>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2   FSOC Process for Non-Banks --  This title would have codified changes to the FSOC process for designating nonbanks as systemically important, to provide additional transparency to the process.  Some in Congress have criticized FSOC\'s designation process as being too opaque.  The FSOC would be required to give detailed explanations for why regulators are considering a designation; provide opportunities for companies to meet with council representatives; analyze a company\'s remedial plan for removing a SIFI designation and allow for revisions; and offer an explanation if the council moves forward with a formal designation.  Regulators would also be required to hold a hearing for designated companies at least once every five years and would have to vote to renew the decision to designate.\n>>>>> \n>>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2   Fed Governance Reforms --  The bill would have made several changes to the Federal Reserve System.  It would require the head of the New York Fed to be nominated by the White House and confirmed by the Senate.  It would also direct the formation of an independent commission to evaluate the structure of the Fed system, including looking at the number and structure of the Fed\'s 12 districts.  The Fed would be required to publish a study every two years on its regulation and oversight of non-banks, a provision that would sunset after 10 years.  The GAO would be required to publish a study looking at the agency\'s regulation of systemically important institutions, with an eye toward issues around regulatory capture.  \n>>>>> \n>>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2  Swaps/Emerging Growth Firms  --  This title addressed several measures related to SEC registration and regulation.  Most notably, it would remove indemnification requirements on swap data so that it can be shared with foreign regulators more easily and would establish a "grace period" for emerging growth companies working toward an initial public offering.\n>>>>> \n>>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2   Mortgage Finance System --  The bill included several provisions related to the mortgage finance system, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  It would prohibit Congress from using guarantee fees to offset unrelated government spending and would ban the sale of Treasury-owned preferred stock in the government-sponsored enterprises without the approval of Congress.  It would also direct the FHFA to provide Congress with updates on the establishment of a common securitization platform and would transition the platform to a non-profit available to approved issuers beyond Fannie and Freddie.  Finally, it would mandate that the GSEs\' risk-sharing levels be at least 150 percent of the previous year\'s level, with at least half of the total as front-end risk sharing.\n>>>>> \n>>>>> With such a wide variety of significant proposals, the Shelby bill was an overloaded canoe.  Senate Banking reported it out favorably in May, but only on a 12-10 party-line vote, not sufficient to be certain to clear the 60-vote filibuster hurdle to passage in the Senate.  \n>>>>> \n>>>>> Over the months that followed, members and staff met frequently to discuss which elements of the bill had bipartisan support Shelby\'s participation in these meetings was occasional at best and the discussions never really became negotiations.  \n>>>>> \n>>>>> Committee Republicans Crapo, Moran and Corker did not negotiate in place of Shelby, but they tried to find common ground with a few receptive Democrats on the Banking Committee, including Sens. Warner, Donnelly, Heitkamp, and Tester. \n>>>>> \n>>>>> By the end of September, the group came up with a rough framework that covered areas where the Democrats appeared willing to move closer to some of Shelby\'s proposals.  The Democrats were able to find some common ground with Republicans on key areas including easing regulations for community banks, creating a new carve-out for regional banks in Dodd-Frank and making changes to the way the FSOC polices big financial firms outside the banking sector. \n>>>>> \n>>>>> The ideas were presented separately to Shelby and Senate Banking Committee ranking member Sherrod Brown.  Brown, who had floated an alternative to the Shelby bill consisting only of the Shelby bill\'s title on supervisory relief for community banks, was not negotiating alongside the moderate Senate Democrats but his staff was kept in the loop.\n>>>>> \n>>>>> In early November, Brown arranged a meeting between all the banking committee Democrats so the four who had been working with Republicans could update the rest on the discussions.  One Some members showed interest and others showed strong opposition.  \n>>>>> \n>>>>> Then on November 10, Sen. Warren gave a speech on the Senate floor warning her colleagues against going down the same road that led to a controversial Dodd-Frank rollback to weaken restrictions on derivatives trading from being tucked into last year\xe2\x80\x99s spending bill.  She called out Democrats who \xe2\x80\x9cwant to get something done around here for a change... If there\'s anyone in this chamber, Republican or Democrat, who thinks they can slip goodies for Wall Street into these bills without a fight, they are very wrong," she said, referring to must-pass legislation including the upcoming appropriations bill.  In addition to the pushback from Warren and other outside groups, the compromise effort faced public and private opposition from Treasury.\n>>>>> \n>>>>> Warren and reform advocates were mindful that they lost a round last December in the Cromnibus bill, when JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup lobbyists secured a change to Dodd-Frank rules on complex financial instruments known as swaps. \n>>>>> \n>>>>> Back in July, Shelby, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, had his bill attached as a rider on the Financial Services FY 2016 appropriations bill.  But he got almost nothing in the final spending agreement.   After months of laying the groundwork, banks and their allies in Congress missed their big shot at moving a wide-ranging legislative agenda in a must-pass spending bill this year before the 2016 election cycle heats up.  \n>>>>> \n>>>>> Among the major financial provisions\xe2\x80\x8b that didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it into the spending package:\n>>>>> \n>>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2   Fiduciary Duty --  Per DFA, the Labor Department finally put forth a fiduciary rule in April, the first update of the government\xe2\x80\x99s retirement investment advice regulations in four decades.  The rule, which would take effect next year, requires brokers and financial advisers to act in the \xe2\x80\x9cbest interest\xe2\x80\x9d of retirement savers\xe2\x80\x94a higher standard than current regulations, which only require advice be \xe2\x80\x9csuitable.\xe2\x80\x9d  The new rule aims to eliminate the potential conflict of interests between people who offer investment advice and companies that sell financial products at a time when individuals are made responsible for building their own nest eggs through programs like IRAs and 401(k)s that have largely replaced traditional pension funds that guaranteed life-long benefits. The financial industry has said it would raise the compliance costs and drive many financial advisers out of business while making investment advice unaffordable for middle-class savers.  Efforts to delay that rule making were turned aside. \n>>>>> \n>>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2  Community Bank Lending Rules --  A number of regulatory changes sought by small, locally focused community lenders, such as an exemption from certain mortgage underwriting rules for mortgages held in a bank\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio.  These were not adopted. \n>>>>> \n>>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2   CFPB Governance\xe2\x80\x8b --  A provision to create a board, rather than a single director, to govern the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and subjecting the agency\xe2\x80\x99s budget to annual appropriations did not survive. \n>>>>> \n>>>>> Some financial regulatory legislation did make the cut: \n>>>>> \n>>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2   Fed Dividend --  In a surprise, the banking community lost a sizable source of revenue -- the annual Fed dividend paid to member banks, totaling $25 billion.   The highway bill passed earlier this month took some of the money that banks receive in dividends from the Fed to help pay for fixing the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s deteriorating roads.   The highway bill passed earlier this month took some of the money that banks receive in dividends from the Federal Reserve to help pay for fixing the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s deteriorating roads.  Wall Street was furious over the precedent of having financial firms pay for infrastructure projects and lobbied to get a provision in the spending bill that would have given banks more flexibility to sell their shares in the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s regional banks but the provision was rejected. \n>>>>> \n>>>>> \xe2\x80\xa2   USG\'s Stake in the GSEs --  A provision passed that prohibits Treasury from selling the government\xe2\x80\x99s stake in mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac until 2018 without future legislation.  The U.S. government bailed out Fannie and Freddie in 2008, and in return received warrants to acquire nearly 80 percent of the companies\xe2\x80\x99 stock along with a new class of preferred shares.  Congress has tried\xe2\x80\x8b unsuccessfully to pass legislation that would replace Fannie and Freddie with a new system, leading some of the companies\xe2\x80\x99 proponents to push the Obama administration to take action on its own and sell the shares, now enjoined by this provision.  \n>>>>> \n>>>>> An omnibus rider banning the SEC from requiring corporations to publicly disclose their political and lobbying expenditures managed to survive.  And negotiators included cybersecurity legislation designed to make it easier for the financial firms and others in the private sector to share threat information with the government.   \n>>>>> \n>>>>> Five years after a crisis that shook the foundations of finance, Warren has public opinion on her side.  A Washington Post/ABC News published October finding that 72 percent of Democrats, 58 percent of Republicans, and 68 percent of independents want the next president to pursue tougher regulations on banks.\n>>>>> \n>>>>> That public distrust has forced Wall Street \xe2\x80\x94 and financial services writ large \xe2\x80\x94 to make oblique arguments that don\xe2\x80\x99t tackle head-on the unpopularity of the industry across the entire electorate. Republicans, trying to avoid an explicit alliance with Wall Street, regard their legislation as \xe2\x80\x9creforms of the reforms\xe2\x80\x9d that Dodd-Frank made.\n>>>>> \n>>>>> --------\n>>>>> \n>>>>> Recent Updates:  \n>>>>> \n>>>>> Year-End Review: Financial Regs.
