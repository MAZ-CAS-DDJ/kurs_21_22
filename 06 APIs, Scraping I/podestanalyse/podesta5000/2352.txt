The\nnumbers on Cuban Americans and where they are have shifted dramatically.\n we have commissioned a bunch of polls on this.  She would be seen as\nfuture oriented, :"brave" even though she wouldn\'t be brave to do this.\n..and it would drive Rubio Cruz and other nuts.\n\nWe could help on this on many fronts.\n\nEither way, we would be thrilled if you and Mary could drop by on Tuesday.\n\nAnd the post piece is priceless. I remember you sleeping on the floor of my\nmothers living room i Wiosski at the end of the 86 campaign.  Luke\n\xe2\x80\x8b\n\n\n\nTrouble viewing this email?
