President Clinton connected with him in person last night to ensure Bruce knew that the Foundation's collective priority was his health and the opportunity for him to take time to heal.  In the interim, he has asked John Podesta to serve as a special advisor, with particular focus on providing leadership and being a resource and decision-maker for the corporate audit.\n\nI am copying John on this email so that you two can connect -- I have given him a frame of reference regarding the objectives for the corporate audit and I know Chelsea can share even more but wanted you all to a have a point of additional contact in light of Bruce's unexpected illness.\n\nbest.\n\ncdm\n"
