john.podesta@gmail.comb"John --\n\nThanks to the generosity of our grassroots supporters, we were able to exceed our May fundraising goal! I cannot express my gratitude enough.\n\nHere's more great news: In the last two weeks alone, over 1,600 people from Illinois and across the country signed our petition to stop student loan rates from doubling on July 1st. That's a big deal.\n\nBut our work isn't done yet. With less than a month to go until the rate hikes take effect, there's still no permanent plan to fix this problem. We can't leave students on the hook, so it's critical that we keep fighting for a solution until something gets done.\n\nWill you sign your name right now and help us reach 2,500 strong to stop the student loan rate hike?\nhttp://action.cheribustos.com/june3\n\nAlready signed? Forward this email to three friends right now and encourage them to add their names.\n\nYour grassroots support continues to serve as the engine of this campaign.\n\nFor that, I can't thank you enough.\n\nKindest personal regards,\nCheri\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis message was emailed to: john.podesta@gmail.com\n\nTo unsubscribe from this email list, please paste this URL into your browser: \nhttp://action.cheribustos.com/unsubscribe\n\nPaid for by the Friends of Cheri Bustos\n\n"
