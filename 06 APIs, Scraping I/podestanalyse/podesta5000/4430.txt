Geneva Reed-Veal, Sandra Bland\'s mother, did an\nincredible introduction where she read a poem she\'d written for HRC.\nWe have audio and will get it transcribed.  HRC hit her points in her\nremarks, with a strong, emotional topper.\n\nSteve Harvey went well. HRC seemed to have a very good time, really\nliked Steve\'s manner.  They did several segments that all ran long.\nWe can see if they can use the extra on the web.\n\nThey opened with an audience question about being a grandma, which\ndespite her having a lighthearted answer ready to go HRC chose to\nanswer seriously for about 3 minutes.  It was endearing I promise.\n\nThey talked about the racial divide, guns for a solid 10 minutes, did\na walk through HRC\'s life in photos, talked about her mother which\nseemed to really strike Steve, and then a weird but ultimately funny\nsegment involving a chess champion from Ukraine.\n\nWe then moved rooms and dos a sit down on Flint for a special Steve is\ndoing.  She was excellent on the subject as always.\n\nWe left NBC studios and headed to the fundraiser site, where we filmed\nBET before the event.  The conversation was tough but ultimately a\nwin.  They talked about mass incarceration, creating wealth and\nopportunity, especially among women, super delegates (a little random\nbut was ultimately a veiled question about the process being\ncorrupted, HRC did fine).  They ended on reparations.\n\nShe\'s been using a line at the fundraisers about her esteemed opponent\nwanting to "catapult us to nirvana."  Comes in the context of what was\naccomplished in the 90s, Obama bringing us back from the brink, not\nletting the GOP rip it all away...and then that.\n\nHeaded back to airport now to fly to Las Vegas.\n'
