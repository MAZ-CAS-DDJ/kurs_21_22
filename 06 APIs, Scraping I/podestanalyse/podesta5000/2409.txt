John McCain (R-AZ) will hold a women-only forum\n<http://www.wsaw.com/home/headlines/24445164.html>  in Hudson, Wisconsin\n"to bolster his support among women." But McCain\'s repudiation\n<http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/PressReleases/526cd374-5c0f-40\ne2-9b0f-d72b062d07a8.htm> of the Senate\'s recent compromise to halt the\ncut in Medicare physician reimbursement rates\n<http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&ct=us/0-0&fp=48776b54fdacf97a&ei=t\nnR3SKe_Oo6SygTO0KS9Bw&url=http%3A//www.alternet.org/healthwellness/91003\n/%3Fses%3D845680946f6bdfee7b308e518eb9db40&cid=0&usg=AFQjCNHTF6TL9uAo8uv\nxt7OXjgVCYgbE9Q>  undermines women\'s access to affordable health care.\n\nWhile the senator said he supported providing "proper reimbursements to\nMedicare physicians\n<http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/PressReleases/526cd374-5c0f-40\ne2-9b0f-d72b062d07a8.htm> ," he opposed the compromise because it tried\nto eliminate the government\'s overpayments\n<http://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/2008/07/02/medicare-physician-cuts/>\nto Medicare Advantage plans. Thus, when given the choice between\nprotecting womens\' access to physicians and continuing to subsidize\nprivate insurance companies, McCain agreed with President Bush\n<http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/bush-will-veto-medicare-bill-white-\nhouse-says-2008-07-10.html>  and chose the latter.\n\nBut low Medicare reimbursement rates have already led many OBGYNs to\nstop accepting Medicare\n<http://articles.latimes.com/2002/nov/04/nation/na-medicare4>  patients.\nIn 2002, for instance, The Los Angeles Times reported that some Medicare\npatients "had a hard time finding\n<http://articles.latimes.com/2002/nov/04/nation/na-medicare4>  a\ngynecologist and an ophthalmologist":\n\n\tThree or four OB/GYN offices told her they were not accepting\nnew Medicare patients. Finally, she persuaded a friend\'s doctor to take\nher. But now the 75-year-old is afraid her new doctors will drop her.\n"You\'ve got to be careful not to step on your doctor\'s toes," Bowers\nsaid. "They don\'t want to mess" with Medicare because of the low\npayments.\n\nSimilarly, in 2003, OB-GYN News reported that "Ob.gyn. practices are\nbeing affected as physicians nationwide are rethinking treating Medicare\npatients <http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-2780929_ITM>\n" and have "begun limiting the number of Medicare patients they take\non...or-in some cases-have stopped caring for Medicare patients\nentirely."\n\nMcCain\'s choice to side with the insurance companies would have further\nrestricted women\'s access to doctors who simply couldn\'t afford the\nlower payments:\n\n\t- "Steven Polansky, who\'s been an obstetrician and gynecologist\nin Sacramento, Calif., since 1977, said he couldn\'t afford a 10.6\npercent pay cut from Congress..."We haven\'t gotten a raise from anybody\nin centuries," Polansky said in an interview. "And it is becoming more\nand more difficult to run a private practice\n<http://www.mcclatchydc.com/257/story/43362.html> ."\n\n\t- "There\'s a threshold out there beyond which people can\'t keep\ntheir doors open\n<http://insurancenewsnet.com/article.asp?n=1&neID=200807021180.3.10_9200\n00000031b583> ," added Jerry McLaughlin, a Hobbs obstetrician and\ngynecologist who is the former president of the New Mexico Medical\nSociety."\n\n\t- "\'We can\'t compete with other cities,\' said local OB/GYN Dr.\nPaul Kocay. Some doctors already are moving towards cash-only practices\n<http://web.dailytimes.com/story.lasso?ewcd=504511142d5c54c5> . These\n\'boutique medicine\' clinics are going to increase if these cuts are\nenacted. Local doctors are between the 10th and 20th percentile in\nnational salary averages. This could become a crisis situation in\nKerrville."\n\nAs the Wonk Room has pointed out again\n<http://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/2008/06/11/mccain-women-want/>  and\nagain\n<http://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/2008/06/17/mccain-hates-condoms/> ,\nMcCain is not what women want.\n\nhttp://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/2008/07/11/mccain-women-medicare/\n\n-----\nAdam Jentleson\nCommunications and Outreach Director\nThe Hyde Park Project, Center for American Progress Action Fund\n202-247-8614\n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
