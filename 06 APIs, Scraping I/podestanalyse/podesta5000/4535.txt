Specter, Do the Right Thing: Vote "Yea" to Equal Pay\n\nPassing the Fair Pay Act Ensures Women Will Receive Equal Pay for Equal\nWork\n\n \n\n            Washington, D.C. - Americans United for Change\n<http://www.americansunitedforchange.org/>  today called on Sen. Arlen\nSpecter to vote for the Fair Pay Act\n<http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN00181:>  which would\nrepresent a significant step forward on ensuring equal pay for women who\nperform equal work on the job as their male counterparts.  After the\nHouse passed <http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll009.xml>  its version,\nthe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act\n<http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.00011:> , for the\nsecond time, last week, the Senate is expected to vote on the bill\ntomorrow.\n\n \n\n            "This is 2009.  It is well past time that we eliminate\ndiscrimination in the workforce that allows employers to pay women a\nfraction of what they pay men for the same job.  During this economic\ncrisis, workers are clinging to every dollar in their paycheck.  So now,\nmore than ever, it\'s important that women have the ability to fight\nagainst inequality in the workforce," said Lauren Weiner of Americans\nUnited for Change.  "We are imploring Sen. Specter to give women the\ntools to do just that. By passing the Fair Pay Act, Sen. Specter will\nstrike down the idea that it\'s acceptable for women to receive less pay\nfor the same job.  \n\n \n\n"But this goes beyond income.  The Fair Pay Act means women will not\nhave to stand for discrimination because of gender.  This is about basic\njustice in and outside the workplace.  Sen. Specter needs to send that\nmessage to working women."    \n\n \n\nStatistically, across the nation, women make 77 cents for every dollar a\nman makes; African American women earn just 63 cents for every dollar a\nman makes, and Hispanic American women make 52 cents for every dollar a\nman makes.  Americans United for Change, which is leading the Jobs and\nEconomic Recovery Campaign <http://www.jobsandeconomicrecovery.com/er>\nto pass President Elect Obama\'s American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan,\nhas supported passage of the House version of the bill, the Lilly\nLedbetter Fair Pay Act, and ran ads in support of the legislation\n<http://www.americansunitedforchange.org/blog/entries/new_radio_ad_quest\nions_ensign_porter_votes_against_fair_pay_act/>  during the 110th\nCongress. \n\n \n\n \n\n###\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail lori@progressiveaccountability.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
