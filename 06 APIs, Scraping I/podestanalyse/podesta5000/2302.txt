The decision is\nclosely held among just a handful of the senator\'s top advisers.\n\nSpeculation has centered on several candidates, including Minnesota Gov. Tim\nPawlenty<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Tim+Pawlenty?tid=informline>,\nformer Massachusetts governor Mitt\nRomney<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Mitt+Romney?tid=informline>and\nSen.\nJoseph I. Lieberman<http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/l000304/>(I-Conn.).\n\nChoosing Lieberman or someone else who supports abortion rights, such as\nformer Pennsylvania governor Tom\nRidge<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Tom+Ridge?tid=informline>,\nwould be risky for a candidate who has worked hard to rally conservatives to\nhis side, according to a new Washington\nPost<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/The+Washington+Post+Company?tid=informline>\n-ABC News<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/ABC+Inc.?tid=informline>poll.\nThe survey indicates that 20 percent of McCain\'s supporters would be\nless likely to vote for him if he selects a running mate who supports\nabortion rights. In a recent interview, McCain told the conservative Weekly\nStandard<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/The+Weekly+Standard+Magazine?tid=informline>that\nsupporting abortion rights would not be an immediate disqualifier in\nhis choice.\n\nMcCain, hunkered down at his ranch in Sedona, is planning to campaign with\nhis vice presidential pick in a three-day tour of contested battlegrounds in\nMissouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania. "Special Guest TBA" is how his campaign Web\nsite advertises the Friday event at Wright State\nUniversity<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Wright+State+University?tid=informline>\n.\n\nRepublicans may pass Democratic Sen. Barack\nObama<http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/o000167/>and\nhis running mate, Sen.\nJoseph R. Biden<http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/b000444/>Jr.\n(Del.), on their way to next week\'s\nGOP<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/U.S.+Republican+Party?tid=informline>convention\nin St. Paul, Minn. The Democrats have scheduled a bus trip\nthrough Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania at the same time.\n\nThe senator from Arizona dropped from public view after a fundraiser Tuesday\nnight in San Diego, not even leaving his ranch on Wednesday for his routine\ntrip to Starbucks<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Starbucks+Corporation?tid=informline>.\nHe conducted phone interviews with local reporters in Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe McCain camp\'s silence did not stop speculation, with pundits and Web\nsites throughout the day mentioning rarely mentioned possible candidates --\nincluding Sen. Kay Bailey\nHutchison<http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/h001016/>(Tex.),\nfor instance, who opposes an abortion ban but votes consistently for\nantiabortion legislation -- and debating whether recent events helped or\nhurt Romney\'s chances.\n\nBut the most controversial candidate remains Lieberman, the Democratic vice\npresidential nominee in 2000, who was reelected to the Senate as an\nindependent after losing the Democratic primary and has infuriated his\nformer party with his embrace of McCain, a longtime friend.\n\n"You keep hearing that he really wants Lieberman," said a Republican source\nwho talks frequently with McCain\'s advisers. The source added that McCain\n"can be stubborn."\n\nAnother senior GOP adviser said picking Lieberman would be a way to say that\nMcCain is a "transformational politician," but it was unlikely that the\nbenefit of that would offset the angst it would cause among party\nconservatives.\n\nRepublican antiabortion forces have made it known that the outrage that\nwould be felt at next week\'s party convention over a Lieberman selection\nwould dwarf any disunity on display at the Democratic gathering in Denver.\nAnd while some conservative activists love to hear Lieberman accuse Obama of\nbeing inexperienced, they have drawn the line at the notion that the party\'s\nvice presidential nominee could be someone who voted against the\nconfirmations of conservative Supreme Court Justices Clarence\nThomas<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Clarence+Thomas?tid=informline>and\nSamuel\nA. Alito Jr.<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Samuel+Alito?tid=informline>\n\nMcCain is solidly opposed to abortion rights, and nearly six in 10 of his\nsupporters polled said abortion should be illegal in most or all cases.\n\nIn the telephone survey of 1,108 registered voters taken Aug. 19 to Aug. 22,\nwhich tested six possible vice presidential candidates, most said the choice\nof a running mate would not change their vote for president. That was\nespecially true of lesser-known candidates: Pawlenty (86 percent); Florida\nGov. Charlie Crist<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Charlie+Crist?tid=informline>(83\npercent); Sen.\nJohn Thune <http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/t000250/>(S.D.)\n(81 percent) and Ridge (80 percent).\n\nOf the six, Romney would generate the largest following -- 20 percent say\nadding the former Massachusetts governor would make them more likely to\nsupport McCain. But nearly as many -- 16 percent -- said they would be less\napt to vote GOP with Romney on the ticket.\n\nLieberman would appear to do the most damage. Overall, about one in five\nvoters said choosing the former Democrat would make them less likely to back\nMcCain, more than the 12 percent who would be more inclined to support the\nGOP nominee. And perhaps more tellingly, among those currently supporting\nMcCain, 22 percent said they would be less apt to support the GOP nominee if\nhe picks Lieberman. Just 9 percent of those backing Obama would be more\ninterested in voting Republican with Lieberman as the No. 2.\n\nDemocrats are already gearing up to attack McCain\'s vice presidential pick,\nno matter whom it might be. Progressive Accountability, a left-leaning\nadvocacy group, has prepared a dossier on five contenders: Romney,\nLieberman, Pawlenty, former Ohio congressman Rob\nPortman<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Rob+Portman?tid=informline>and\nRep.\nEric Cantor <http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/c001046/>(Va.).\n\nEach of the opposition research documents uses the identical header, naming\nthe McCain ally in question next to the phrase "McSame as Bush."\n\n*Cillizza reported from Denver, Cohen from Washington.
