But that doesn\'t mean\nthis was ever going to be easy -- we know Cuccinelli\'s\ndeep-pocketed friends like Karl Rove are going to throw\neverything they\'ve got behind him. And with the resources\nthey have, we simply can\'t count them out.\n\nThis election will be won by the campaign that invests in a\nstrong, efficient organization -- and does it now. So we\nneed to hire more field organizers, recruit more volunteers,\nspend more time knocking on doors, and, yes, invest in TV\nads that explain the clear choice in this election.\n\nBut we just can\'t be confident about making those\ninvestments without knowing you\'re with us for the long haul.\n\nI\'m ready to fight back, but I can\'t do it alone. Will you\njoin Team Terry and donate\n$5 monthly between\nnow and November?\n\nhttp://action.terrymcauliffe.com/team-terry\n\nI\'m asking you to join Team Terry by becoming a monthly donor\nbecause it helps us plan.\n\nIf we know you\'ll be standing with us each month, we can\nallocate our resources as efficiently as possible -- building\na strong field program now, when it counts, and knowing\nyou\'ll be there to help us sustain it in the months to come.\n\nThat\'s the kind of work that will win this election, and by\nowning a piece of this campaign, you\'ll help us get there.\n\nWill you commit to a monthly donation of\n$5 through \nElection Day to sustain our campaign?\n\nhttp://action.terrymcauliffe.com/team-terry\n\nThanks for having my back,\n\nTerry\n\n\n\n\nDONATE NOW: http://action.terrymcauliffe.com/team-terry\n\n\n\n---\nPaid for by Terry McAuliffe for Governor\n---\n\nUnsubscribe: http://action.terrymcauliffe.com/page/unsubscribe?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\n\n'
