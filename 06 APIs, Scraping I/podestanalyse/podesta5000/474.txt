But I am concerned about the "head off the\ninvitation" option, both as to timing and perception of this is\npresumptuous, including the possibility that the Bush administration will\nleak it as an example of presumptuousness that we assume he would be\ninvited. I am also concerned about circulating these memos on highly\ninsecure communication channels. Finally, I think that the foreign policy\nadvisors should be identified by name (has Denis McDonough seen this?) so he\nwill know who has been consulted on our side.\n\nOn 11/1/08, Jason Furman <jfurman@barackobama.com> wrote:\n>\n>  Thanks for doing this.
