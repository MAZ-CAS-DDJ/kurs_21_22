Highlights of the findings include:  \n\n \n\n*         This selection puts Senator John McCain squarely in the realm\nof politics over principle in women voters\' eyes. \n\n \n\n*         Governor Sarah Palin\'s background and personal narrative are\nnot particularly appealing to women voters, and she matches up poorly\nagainst Senator Joe Biden in terms of the potential to establish a\ncompelling narrative. \n\n \n\n*         Governor Palin\'s inclusion on the ticket squanders Senator\nMcCain\'s previous advantage over Senator Barack Obama with regard to\nexperience and readiness to lead. \n\n \n\n*         Several of Governor Palin\'s positions on issues, including her\nposition on abortion, alienate large segments of the women\'s electorate\nand add to the perception that the GOP ticket is out of step with women\nvoters\' views and priorities. \n\n \n\n*         Even with the historic inclusion of a woman on the Republican\nticket, women voters conclude that the Obama/Biden ticket is more in\nstep with the issues and concerns that are important to women than is\nthe McCain/Palin ticket. \n\n \n\n*         Finally, as these survey findings confirm, the Democratic\npresidential ticket of Senator Barack Obama and Senator Joe Biden\ncontinues to benefit from strong support of women voters. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe complete report is available on the EMILY\'s List website at \nhttp://emilyslist.org/multimedia/palin_poll/.\n\n \n\nConducted by a variety of respected Democratic pollsters, the EMILY\'s\nList Women\'s Monitor program has focused on a range of topics and key\nvoter targets to build a comprehensive data file on the political views\nand voting behaviors of American women. In addition to survey research\nand focus groups, the Women\'s Monitor has pioneered other innovative\ntechniques to dispel myths about women voters and explain how they take\nin and digest political information.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n# # # \n\n \n\nContacts:\n\nRamona Oliver, Communications Director\n\n202-360-6258 cell\n\nroliver@emilyslist.org\n\n \n\nAllison Muehlenbeck, Communications Manager\n\n202-744-0902 cell\n\namuehlenbeck@emilyslist.org\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
