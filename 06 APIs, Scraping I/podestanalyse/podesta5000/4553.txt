Darshan Goux who worked with me on this research and I believe this\nattitude would be found in any one from across the spectrum of the latin\ndiaspora that now lives in South Florida.\n\nI believe you could produce for the Florida primary some powerful spots in\nthe\nCalle Ocho neighborhood in Miami, which routinely sees storm related\nflooding due to sea level rise, with HRC and older Cuban American women\ntalking about sea level rise, climate and their neighborhood.\n\nLet me know if you need more,\n\nTom C.\n617-529-1170\n"
