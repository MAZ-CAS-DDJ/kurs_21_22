It would be great for your WH team to watch it. \n\nAnd I'm sure that the public would be more than outraged if they knew this was the reality with data brokers and some of the leading tech cos.\n\nHow do you think we should best address this concern? And how best to deal with this as part of the Big Data effort being undertaken?\n\nI look forward to seeing you soon and discussing options.\n\nAll best as always from the Steyer fam.\n\nJim"
