have you thought about how you go about putting in place the policies that could reduce the amount of mass shootings we see?\nBERNIE SANDERS: well, i don\'t think anyone has all the answers, but i think some of the components are first of all guns should not be in the hands of people who should not have them. people who have criminal records, people who are mentally ill. and that means we need a very strong instant background check system. number two, we have a huge loophole right now in gun legislation in that unlicensed gun dealers can sell guns at these gun shows. that\'s the gun show loophole, which has to be eliminated. and in my view, which is somewhat controversial, i don\'t think in this country we should be selling or distributing weapons of mass -- weapons that are designed just to kill people, automatic weapons, military type weapons. and that\'s what i voted for. but what we need, chris, as a nation is to get beyond the shouting. some people want to ban every gun in america and some people believe in nothing at all. i think the vast majority of the american people, as the president indicated, including gun owners, and i know that\'s true here in vermont, want sensible gun control legislation and they also believe that we should have more access to mental health facilities and counselors than we presently do. the bottom line is if somebody is suicidal, somebody is homicidal, you\'ve got to make sure that person gets care and attention immediately, not two months from today.\nCHRIS HAYES: you reference that your constituents in vermont, a state of course you represent, that\'s a state that it\'s my understanding of the statistics has relatively high levels of gun ownership, relatively low levels of gun violence. compared to some other states.\nBERNIE SANDERS: yeah.\nCHRIS HAYES: you also -- you voted for some gun safety legislation and against others. you voted for the brady bill, for instant background checks, against a bill that would have allowed lawsuits against gun companies. has your thinking on this evolved over time? have you been influenced in how you think about it in discussions with your constituents who are gun owners?\nBERNIE SANDERS: well, i think we are all disgusted and horrified by these mass killings. and as the president indicated, we\'re tired of sending condolences and we know that it could happen tomorrow, it could happen again a month from now. i have voted as i said a moment ago for what i think is the most important provision, and that is strong instant background checks to make sure that people who should not have guns do not have guns. and i have voted to eliminate this gun show loophole, which is what we have got to do. and i think, chris --\nCHRIS HAYES: but the fact --\nBERNIE SANDERS: -- that at the end of the day --\nCHRIS HAYES: if i could just say, senator --\nBERNIE SANDERS: yes.\nCHRIS HAYES: there\'s two things about this. one is it strikes me it may prove to be a more difficult policy problem than we\'re prepared to admit about keeping guns out of the hands of the wrong people. and it may be that that isn\'t enough. the sort of items that you\'ve indicated, that if we need to take a more robust approach like, say, in australia or england, which the president mentioned today.\nBERNIE SANDERS: well, i don\'t -- i don\'t know that anybody knows what the magic solution is. what we do know is the current situation is not tenable. it is clearly not working. and as the president indicated we can and must do a lot better. i believe -- i\'ll tell you what else i believe. you can sit there and say i think we should do this and do that states in this country where but you\'ve got a whole lot of people want virtually no gun control at all. and if we are going to have some success we are going to have to start talking to each other. and here\'s what i think is the good news, that i think there is a consensus for serious gun control including among people who own guns. and i think that\'s what we have to bring about. and the fact we have folks in congress who don\'t even want us to get information about shootings in this country and fatalities, that\'s pretty crazy stuff. so i think the job is to bring people together and say yes, we\'ve got to move forward, we\'ve got to move forward aggressively, stop the shouting and let\'s work together to do something that\'s realistic.\nCHRIS HAYES: senator Bernie Sanders. \n\nJohn Anzalone\n\nPartner \nAnzalone Liszt Grove Research\n(o) 334.387.3121\nWebsite| Twitter| LinkedIn| Facebook\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Kate Offerdahl <kofferdahl@hillaryclinton.com>\nDate: Friday, October 2, 2015 at 6:01 AM\nTo: Amanda Renteria <arenteria@hillaryclinton.com>, Brian Fallon <bfallon@hillaryclinton.com>, "caitlin@grunwald-communications.com" <caitlin@grunwald-communications.com>, Christina Reynolds <creynolds@hillaryclinton.com>, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com>, David Binder <david@db-research.com>, Ellen Esterhay <ellen.esterhay@gmmb.com>, Huma Abedin <ha16@hillaryclinton.com>, Jake Sullivan <jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com>, Jennifer Palmieri <jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com>, Jim Margolis <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com>, Joel Beneneson <Jbenenson@bsgco.com>, John Anzalone <john@algpolling.com>, John Podesta <jp66@hillaryclinton.com>, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>, Karen Finney <kfinney@hillaryclinton.com>, Kristina Schake <kschake@hillaryclinton.com>, Mindy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com>, Marlon Marshall <mmarshall@hillaryclinton.com>, Maya Harris <mharris@hillaryclinton.com>, Mike Vlacich <mvlacich@hillaryclinton.com>, Milia Fisher <mfisher@hillaryclinton.com>, Mona Thinavongsa <Mona@algpolling.com>, Oren Shur <oshur@hillaryclinton.com>, Robby Mook <re47@hillaryclinton.com>, Sara Latham <slatham@hillaryclinton.com>, Sawsan Bay <sbay@hillaryclinton.com>, Shannon Currie <scurrie@bsgco.com>, Teddy Goff <tgoff@hillaryclinton.com>, Tony Carrk <tcarrk@hillaryclinton.com>, Varun Anand <vanand@hillaryclinton.com>, Heather Stone <hstone@hillaryclinton.com>\nSubject: Accomplishments for 8AM\n\n\n\n\nDear all,\n\n\nPlease see the below foreign policy accomplishments, for discussion on today\'s 8am call. \n\n\nThanks!\nKate\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has a long list of accomplishments, but to name 3\xe2\x80\xa6:\n \n\n\nShe built the toughest sanctions regime on Iran in history, twisting arms in China, Russia, and dozens of other countries, to force Iran to the negotiating table. And when pressure started working, she sent her closest aides to explore a deal that would cut off Iran\xe2\x80\x99s path to a nuclear weapon.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nShe personally negotiated an end to Hamas rockets raining down on Israel in 2012 and worked to build stronger defense programs for Israel, including upgrading the Iron Dome rocket defense system, which has saved the lives of so many Israelis. \n\n\n\n \n\n\nShe fought to make women\'s rights a priority in international relations. She stood up against sex trafficking of women and children, intervened in Saudi Arabia to prevent child marriage, and led the fight for a UN Security Council resolution to combat sexual violence against women and children around the world that passed unanimously.\n\n\n\n \n\xe2\x80\xa6And 3 more\xe2\x80\xa6.\n \n\n\nShe oversaw negotiation and worked to ensure ratification of the New START treaty, which will make the world safer by reducing U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals to their smallest size in 50 years.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nShe helped build the unprecedented global effort to combat climate change, joining with President Obama to stand up to the Chinese in Copenhagen and get them to take responsibility for the first time, resulting in last year\xe2\x80\x99s major climate agreement.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nShe stood up to Russia, China, and Iran on internet freedom and fought for the \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom to connect\xe2\x80\x9d around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
