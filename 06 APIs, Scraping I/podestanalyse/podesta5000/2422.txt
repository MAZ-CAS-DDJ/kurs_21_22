john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John:\n\nWe have planned for some time to hold a high-level dinner for ~80 people at the Harvard Club in New York on Friday, Sept. 25, hosted by the UN Foundation, to honor the Pope\'s leadership on climate change and his remarks that day at the UN. Our first inclination was to honor Msgr. Marcelo Sorondo, the Chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. Mark Gallogly - whom we met through your suggestion - was kind enough to agree to cover the costs. As we get closer to the date, though, we have been rethinking the potential scope of the event and the guest list - possibly featuring more of an "arc to Paris" theme that ties together the Pope\'s encyclical with the SDGs and especially the SDG on sustainable energy, such that we might involve the Secretary-General, Christiana Figueres, and/or Kandeh Yumkella and his successor.\n\nWould such an event be of interest to you? From your perspective, is there something useful that we might do - e.g., assemble influential NY Catholics on climate change? If so, we would welcome your counsel on how we might shape the event and whom we might invite - and of course we would be delighted if you could come and make a few remarks.\n\nThanks, John, as always.\n\nWith best regards,\nReid\n\n* * * * *\nReid Detchon\nVice President, Energy and Climate Strategy\nUnited Nations Foundation\n1750 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 300\nWashington, DC 20006\nUSA\nPhone: +1 202 419 3220 (direct)\nMain line: +1 202 887 9040\nFax: +1 202 887 9021\nwww.unfoundation.org<http://www.unfoundation.org/>\n\n\n'
