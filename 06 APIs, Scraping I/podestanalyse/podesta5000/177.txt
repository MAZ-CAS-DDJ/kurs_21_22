john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi, John,\n\nJust wanted you to know I had a good meeting in Manchester with Harrell\nKirstein, the communications director for Hillary\'s campaign.  You\'re in\ngood hands.  Very sharp and has a very good understanding and contacts in\nthe NH media.\n\nThere\'s nothing there for me now but he indicated he\'ll contact me when\nthings get rolling.  Thanks for the intro.\n\n- Barry\n\nP.S.  I just had a short conversation with Arnold Hiatt, a longtime friend\nand former client, who was visited by .Nancy Pelosi today.  He indicated\nthat he would be supportive of Hilllary when he becomes "comfortable" with\nher message.\n\nJust wanted to pass that on as, I expect you know, he\'s been one of the\nlargest donors to the party in past years. His primary interest now is\ncampaign finance reform.\n\n\nBarry Wanger\nWanger Associates\n40 Burdean Rd.\nNewton, MA 02459\n617-965-6469\nwww.wangerassociates.com\nLinkedin.com/in/wangerassociates\n'
