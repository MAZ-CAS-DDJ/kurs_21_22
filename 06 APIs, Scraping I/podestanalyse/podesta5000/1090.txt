Every month we will bring you news and events from here at Swan House and from across the CTLS network.\r\nSo let's give you a tour of this issue: there's an opportunity to catch up with photographs from the Annual Conference and Faculty Meeting in Washington DC, news about the Fall Global Practice Exercise, a report on new Deans and new arrivals in our partner schools, and  some recent transnational legal research and publications highlights. We also shine a light on CTLS alumnus, Luiz Donelli F'10, now working in mergers and acquisitions in Brazil, and introduce you to Shivani Sidapra, our new faculty assistant. The newsletter is only the start - anything in bold<http://georgetown.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=50d719ffbfdc236beb8f2133a&id=7857657363&e=ab7118ed33> is a link so just click through for more!\r\nIt's going to be a busy year here at Swan House - we are launching our first experiential learning course, European Human Rights Advocacy, and have a lively calendar of events. We hope to build on research initiatives of previous years and will focus our research and public engagement activities on the theme of Law in Global Economic Justice. In the face of growing concerns about economic justice at both local and global levels we ask what role does law play in economic relations - does it exacerbate or ameliorate inequalities? If you're interested in finding out more please do get in touch.\r\nWe look forward to bringing you more details about the activities in the September Bulletin. And don't forget, if you have any news about a CTLS partner school or alumnus, do let us know so we can include it in a future issue. Email cian.murphy@kcl.ac.uk<mailto:cian.murphy@kcl.ac.uk?subject=CTLS%20Bulletin> with your news and we will be sure to follow up. We look forward to hearing from you!\r\nYours in transnational legal education,\r\nCian Murphy & Alvaro Santos\r\nAcademic Co-Directors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlumnus Profile\r\nLuiz Antonio Varela Donelli\r\n[https://gallery.mailchimp.com/50d719ffbfdc236beb8f2133a/images/d4685170-5120-4571-b644-09f2f07f6879.jpeg]Luiz spent Fall 2010 semester at CTLS as part of his LL.M from ESADE Law School. Since his graduation in 2012 he has worked in mergers and acquisitions as a member of MHM Sociedade de Avogados in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Luiz remembers his time at the Center fondly: 'The experience at CTLS, dealing with different cultures and the network that arises from CTLS have given me different skills others lawyers don\xe2\x80\x99t have, and have helped me to achieve results I would not have otherwise.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[https://gallery.mailchimp.com/50d719ffbfdc236beb8f2133a/images/4e646e21-f0f0-4c3c-af04-ceae60ccd6ca.jpg]<http://georgetown.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=50d719ffbfdc236beb8f2133a&id=0a4bec5f8c&e=ab7118ed33>\r\n\r\nFaculty Meeting 2014 - Washington DC\r\nCheck out photographs on Facebook<http://georgetown.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=50d719ffbfdc236beb8f2133a&id=b1070d0682&e=ab7118ed33>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Year, Deans & Arrivals\r\nPartners across our network are welcoming new colleagues - while some also have new Deans.
