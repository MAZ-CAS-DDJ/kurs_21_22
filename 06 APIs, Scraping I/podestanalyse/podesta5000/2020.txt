john.podesta@gmail.comb'::: ProgressNow - Building the online progressive movement state by state ::: \n\n\n\nFebruary, 2011\n\nWhen I took the job at ProgressNow and ProgressNow Education to be the Executive Director, I already knew our state partners were shining examples of progressive success. But the past month has seriously impressed me - and I\'m sure you\'ll be impressed as well. While many of us have felt like spending these gray post-election days curled up on the couch, eating carbs and pretending it was 2009, the ProgressNow affiliates got back up and back in the ring without missing a beat. Our states have been hammering the right, standing up to smear campaigns and teaching new and experienced activists and allies skills for surviving and thriving in the 21st century. Trust me, after reading this you\'ll be convinced to drop the Pringles and get back to the gym to train for the next fight.\n\nHere\'s a synopsis of some of their work - and feel free to call me or email me with any questions, comments or ideas for how we can help you or your organization build for progressive success.\n\nBest,\n\nDenise Cardinal\nExecutive Director\nProgressNow and ProgressNow Education\n\n\xa0\n\nWhat we did!\n\nBeck and Limbaugh came after us in PENNSYLVANIA. Over in FLORIDA, they stole\nthe story from Ralph Reed and Dick Morris. The Washington Post\npublished a story about a NEBRASKA state effort. Think budget problems\nin a swing state like WASHINGTON might matter? How many people got\nsmarter because of FLORIDA? And in WISCONSIN they even got to SUE the\nbad guys. Read on for more ProgressNow accomplishments:\n\n\nProgressNow Colorado\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=vrDr_srNZ8NfAAqCzuZGuQ..\n\nNewly elected Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler has a history\nas an attorney representing some of the most politically controversial\nright wing attack groups and candidates in Colorado. Learning of plans\nby Gessler to "moonlight" part time for his old law firm while serving\nas Secretary of State, ProgressNow Colorado led the demand by citizens\nacross the state for Gessler to abandon this plan, fraught with\nconflicts of interest and the possibility of harm to fair elections in\nstate. The petition effort, joined by thousands of Colorado residents,\ndominated press coverage of the controversy.\n\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=aFRAEZ8d_TCGRp7UDSoSCA..\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=xuBrvHX0WDbq0M6Z_7cV-Q..\n\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=pF_0iH1pCl1UyD2wH34Ziw..\n\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=q1cjqif3BI29QNYtA3ISUg..\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=P0w0kiOp3YGfvCHzv-r3yA..\n\n\n\nProgress Florida\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=LfdalVlKFZGrWJ_zTV2hkQ..\n\nDamn, that was quick. St. Petersburg Times education reporter Ron\nMatus, upon hearing that Progress Florida\'s Stop Scott\'s Private\nVoucher Scheme petition had surpassed 10,000 signatures.\n\nProgressFlorida launched the Save Our Schools campaign with a petition\ndrive and Facebook page, targeting Gov. Rick Scott and his recently\nproposed universal private school voucher scheme. Numerous\norganizations including Public Education Matters, Floridians Against\nRick Scott, Florida New Majority, and others forwarded our alert to\ntheir own networks helping us educate more than 130,000 Floridians\nabout Gov. Scott\'s attack on public education. We also took the story\naway from rightwing foot soldiers, including Dick Morris and Ralph\nReed, by highlighting their radical agenda for Florida\'s schools.\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=GRFt8-WpbsR13mU2ShQq0Q..\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=jEq0BcVlqXoWPi4kr61Csw..\n\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=20mpRKfgwDLHqlPaDbi3Mw..\n\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=MuU2dWsDAAUwGwIxGMe94w..\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=o39YAojZf17fDqJwV2dW8g..\n\n\nProgressMichigan\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=eeFFm-kGIPZ71y5H0n-nsA..\n\n>From throwing a media spotlight on Michigan\'s Fred Upton and his\nattack on Clean Air Act enforcement as the new U.S. House Energy\nChair, to organizing labor and progressive reaction to Republican\nGovernor Rick Snyder\'s State of the State address, Progress Michigan\nworked behind the scenes developing aggressive January earned media\nand online advocacy effort for its partners, serving a vital role in a\nstate where we need to keep fighting strong on our side.\n\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=cpwnk_0T-J0R8zFNgU_K5A..\n\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=RTVKPJc133-n2RuaERtcpg..\n\n\nBold Nebraska\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=X8rbI3FC5FBg4Vt9m94STg..\n\nBold Nebraska was featured in the Washington Post for it\'s fantastic\norganizing work to stop the TransCanada tar sands pipeline. Because of\nBold Nebrask\'s work, three bills have been introduced to regulate the\nproject - a stark contrast when just months ago every state\nsenator and the Governor told the press they had "no role" in ensuring\npipeline regulation and safety. Almost half of Nebraska\'s state\nlegislature (both R and D) sent a joint letter to Sec. Clintonurging\nher to do more studies before deciding on the permit to allow the\npipeline to be built.\n\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=AbIPDq-ftxCYk7TDabOM2w..\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=dmXYHW4BXYiwbqtV40Oumg..\n\n\nGranite State Progress\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=FtQ3MtXdUKhm3INx49zcCA..\n\nGranite State Progress has been hard at work to launch Camp Courage,\ntwo weekends of an intensive training on how to talk to our\nlegislators, friends, family and community members about the\nimportance of equality through our own stories and experiences. Based\non the model developed by the Courage Campaign, these trainings across\nNew Hampshireempowered individuals to have "Courageous Conversations"\nabout their personal reasons for supporting marriage equality. Working\nin local teams, we established ways to strengthen equality in our\ncommunity and at the State House, one person at a time.\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=l_IwLL3a1u8-HfUoK79PkA..\n\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=6SsbVymyIar5SARSKiDiKQ..\n\n\nProgressNow Nevada\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=xOd2ZcG3j-LP9f97FvTtGg..\n\nProgressNow Nevada has worked to organize and mobilize the Nevada\nValues Coalition with hundreds of thousands of members and social\nservice clients seeking balanced solutions to the state\'s budget\ncrisis. The coalition has garnered significant coverage in statewide\npress. ProgressNow Nevada Action highlighted freshman U.S.\nRepresentative Joe Heck\'s vote to repeal health insurance reform and\nshowcase the hypocrisy of the congressman\'s own insurance coverage =96\nwhile too many Nevadans go without.\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=GZOyJL5bUA0QD2NIWorZPg..\n\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=4STiH0Dosbc3dErdGDX3yg..\n\n\nProgressOhio\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=WcEiaOAVxuukTtBYlypyrg..\n\nProgressOhio\'s list of work in January includes connecting and\nassisting dozens of progressive allies in the state - including\nthe Ohio AFL-CIO, Summit County Progressives, the Legislative\nProgressive Caucus, PIRG and the Buckeye Forest council. Like so many\nstates, Ohio\'s budget has taken center stage and ProgressOhio is at\nthe center of the fight. Taking on the role of communications for the\nOne Ohio Now budget coalition group led to hundreds of participants at\nthe kickoff event and great news coverage as the legislature got to\nwork.\n\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=UGgzTApz_q9WaAIVW8_yuw..\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=TV_aeDisDVEOYxjTsUgMBg..\n\n\nKeystone Progress\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=1jKlV9qoAlft3hZJxMdGaw..\n\nKeystone Progress organized the second Pennsylvania Progressive Summit\nin Pittsburgh. It was attended by over 400 people, including more than\n20 current and former elected officials. The Summit included 72\nworkshops with keynote speaker Rev. Jesse Jackson, who inspired and\nmotivated the crowd. The event has since been attacked by right wing\nmedia, including Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh who targeted Rev.\nJackson\'s remarks, and the Pittsburgh Tribune Review who editorialized\nagainst PA State Education Association\'s sponsorship of the Summit.\n(We know we\'re doing something right when Beck and Limbaugh come after\nus!)\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=runPMa5IEo6qOBsXfgICeg..\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=DCC7S2W54Jaw6YGiwhRHUg..\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=5q36wl6l63jLKj8DvcD0sA..\n\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=-xabr9KxQ1jGGU9CVrNIaA..\n\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=qhPNQl5NhAwNkmA95UA03Q..\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=ar4PO5uxK7ULyZQPQQg3eQ..\n\n\nFuse Washington\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=K_mPYjhRdw-SdeL_Enr7VQ..\n\nFuse Washington is the coalition lead for budget work framing the\nsolutions in terms that favor our side. Our work makes sure everyone\nknows what they stand for on the other side: tax loopholes for\ncorporations, cutting health care coverage for families and growing\nclass sizes for your kids. News coverage is reflecting this frame,\nchanging the debate in a big way.\n\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=AXfURGT2IIgV0NxZlpgDLw..\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=QVZgXU0sI-P7e6IGBbOCVQ..\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=1tUTJ4SDqctzD5M6yV_heg..\n\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=A9uaHp3dOIFgEoTtQo0pXA..\n\n\nOne Wisconsin Now\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=I0-usL7UBntHH7R67bN9fw..\n\nOne Wisconsin Now began 2011 hosting "Rock the Pantry," a progressive\nrally and music event attended by over 350 to counter the inaugural\nevents of the new conservative governor and legislative majorities in\nWisconsin. One Wisconsin Now\'s successful fundraiser for Wisconsin\nfood pantries contrasted with Gov. Scott Walker\'s partisan campaign\nand Republican Party fundraiser in the media, including television,\nradio and print.One Wisconsin Now was at the heart of a national news\nstory when right wing Juneau County District Attorney Scott Southworth\ntold a school that teaching age appropriate sexual education\ncoursework was a form of "sexual assault of children." After filing a\nlawsuit against Southworth when he failed to fulfill an open records\nrequest about email communications between himself and\nultra-conservative extremist organizations, he settled the case in\nJanuary, turned over the records and paid One Wisconsin Now\'s full\nlegal fees and statutory damages.\n\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=ZSs_N6l5pN4haZagxp7Law..\n\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=WtMAXNbiQW4hhD1YfI0njQ..\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=c87xYY6xD_ZpwqEog_4i6A..\n\nhttp://www.pnstate.org/site/R?i=AbPSAT0VuSLCQMZtAc-j-w..\n\n\n\n:::\n\nCopyright 2010 ProgressNow\n\nChange your e-mail preferences or unsubscribe: http://www.pnstate.org/site/CO?i=Wz5Fv0DBkhDoL9u8SRKwVa1B436Gf0WN&cid=0\n\n'
