john.podesta@gmail.comb'WaPo is writing an article-don\'t know when about "should HRC  change her economic message" -\nWill certainly try to keep the dialogue open with writer.\n\nFrom: Robert Wolf\nSent: Thursday, March 10, 2016 8:29 PM\nTo: abby.phillip@washpost.com<mailto:abby.phillip@washpost.com>\nSubject: todays discussion for your WaPo article- theme "Should Clinton change her economic message"\n\nAbby-\nI enjoyed our conversation today and sorry I had to cut out early. I thought it may be best to email you my thoughts since we discussed so many topics.\nAs stated, I  do not think the Secretary should change her economic message because it is one that will work. She is running a 50 state campaign and thus her economic plan must be wide spread and cannot be one that shifts for the benefit of  each and every state. Similar to the Obama \'08 & \'12  election and those before , the 2 bookends for voters will be the economy and foreign policy and it is very clear that the Secretary has the best plan. I will stay in my economic "sand box". If you think about her plan, she has been incredibly clear that economic growth is key to jobs and wages and highlights infrastructure as a key priority. For the Secretary infrastructure is not only road and bridges but it is also broadband, water treatment centers, ports, next generation GPS and social projects (like upgrading schools & hospitals). What many fail to realize is infrastructure  is the fastest multiplier of GDP growth; for every $1 spent it yields a 1.6 times increase and for every $1 billion spent it is the best job creator with over 25,000 new jobs. Also, the Secretary is a staunch believer in utilizing public private partnerships such as the Port Miami Tunnel in FL or Research Triangle Park in NC -both huge successes.  Just think about how critical infrastructure projects will be for Flint Michigan.\nNow with respect to our conversation about  Ohio , I think the importance of the TARP money being used for the auto bailout has been the most important aspect to the growth trajectory in this state where approximately $85 billion dollars was used  (and as you know, the Secretary supported and the Senator did not). The facts tell the story and facts do not lie:\nUS Auto sales and Ohio unemployment rate are  directly correlated (maybe more than any other state). Here is what you will see. In 2007, US auto sales were 16 million/Ohio unemployment was 5.7%, in 2009 10.4 million sales/11 % rate  in 2015 17.2 million sales/4.8% rate. (I could give you each year from 2007 tom 2015 as the correlation is very consistent). The other big difference in many many states is the importance of the ExIm Bank on manufacturing and exports but especially small & medium sized businesses. Yes it is true that a lot of the gross dollars have gone to companies like Boeing, Dow Chemical  & GE, but in 2014 (the last year it was really up & running) over 85% of all loans went SMEs and  3,400 transactions totaling over $5 billion in loans went directly to small businesses. So Sen sanders is wrong that this is crony capitalism , it is just the opposite it is critical for enhancing US jobs and making sure small businesses can compete on the global stage by having access to capital. (as an fyi -60 other countries and every developing one has an export credit agency). Now with respect to trade, I don\'t think you can build a moat around the US and stay globally competitive and I think her advisor summed it up well:\n"The answer can\'t be to shut down all trade," said Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton\'s senior policy adviser. He said the key is backing "smart and fair trade, where American workers get a level playing field with the rest of the world."\nHappy to discuss or answer any other questions. AEnjoy the crazy debate tonight -will be like an SNL skit.\nRW\n\n[cid:image001.png@01D17B06.C05F5B30]\nRobert Wolf\nCEO, 32 Advisors\nChairman, Measure\n212-607-3232 (office)\n203-550-8685 (cell)\nrwolf@32advisors.com<mailto:rwolf@32advisors.com>\nTwitter: @robertwolf32<https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=robertwolf32>\nwww.32advisors.com<http://www.32advisors.com/>\nwww.measure.aero\n\n\n________________________________\nDisclaimer: Visit www.32advisors.com/disclaimer for information about this email.\n'
