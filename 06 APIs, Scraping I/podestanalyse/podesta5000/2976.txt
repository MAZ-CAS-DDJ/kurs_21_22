The report reaffirmed the findings of\nseveral previous investigations and once again determined that "there was\nno intelligence failure, no delay in sending a CIA rescue team, no missed\nopportunity for a military rescue, and no evidence the CIA was covertly\nshipping arms from Libya to Syria."\n\n\n\nFox News remained mostly silent in the wake of the report\'s publication,\ngiving the report only cursory coverage while flagship news program Fox\nNews Sunday ignored it entirely. The network\'s lack of coverage earned\ncondemnation from CNN media critic Brian Stelter and even Fox\'s own media\nanalyst, Howard Kurtz. The absence of coverage stood in stark contrast\ntoFox\'s exhaustive focus on the formation of a select committee to\ninvestigate Benghazi in June, when the network devoted at least 225\nsegments to the select committee over a mere two-week span.\n\n\n\nWith another Benghazi Select Committee hearing scheduled for December 10,\nFox has changed its approach from silence to overt attempts to undermine\nthe GOP report\'s credibility.\n\n\n\nBret Baier, host of Fox\'s Special Report, claimed on December 3 that "many"\nbelieve the House Intelligence Committee\'s Benghazi report "went soft on\nthe Obama administration and was filled inaccuracies" and emphasized the\nfurther investigation by the Benghazi Select Committee. To bolster this\nallegation, investigative reporter Catherine Herridge noted the "eyewitness\naccounts" of Kris Paronto and John Tiegen, who, according to Herridge, "say\nthere was an intelligence failure. They were directly warned in late August\na strike was likely, yet no Defense Department assets were available on the\nSeptember 11th anniversary."\n\n\n\nSpecial Report\'s December 3 panel went to further lengths to undermine the\nIntelligence Committee report as Baier, Fox News contributor Charles\nKrauthammer, The Weekly Standard\'s Steve Hayes, and The Hill\'s A. B.\nStoddard suggested that the investigation was insufficient.\n\n\n\nBut Fox\'s latest attempts at subverting the committee report amount to\nnothing more than highlighting a smattering of Republican lawmakers who\nclaim to remember events occurring differently than they were laid out in\nthe final report. In a December 5 article for FoxNews.com, Herridge\nreported that newly declassified testimony contained the statements of\nmembers of Congress recalling that former CIA director David Petraeus\nconnected the Benghazi attack to the protests against an anti-Muslim\nYouTube video in an off-the-record coffee meeting two days after the attack:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the lawmakers\' recollection is accurate, that means Petraeus\' brief on\nSept. 14, 2012, was instead in line with the White House, and\nthen-Secretary Hillary Clinton\'s State Department. It was a State\nDepartment press release at 10:07 p.m. ET, before the attack was even over,\nthat first made the link to the obscure anti-Islam video. The newly\ndeclassified testimony says $70,000 was spent on advertising in Pakistan,\ndenouncing the anti-Muslim film.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring this testimony, GOP Rep. Jeff Miller questioned Petraeus\' original\ntestimony, stating the former CIA director \xe2\x80\x98even went so far as to say that\nit had been put into Arabic language and then was put on this TV station,\nthis cleric\'s TV station. I mean, [Petraeus] drove that in pretty hard when\nhe was in here. \xe2\x80\x98\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., added \xe2\x80\x98it was said in here a little bit\nearlier that the CIA never said Benghazi was part of a Cairo protest and of\nthe video. And we were given just the opposite message by the Director of\nthe CIA on the [September] 14th [2012.]\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRogers noted there was no transcript for the brief, only staff notes, but\nafter the Petraeus incident in September 2012, the practice was changed to\nalways run a transcript on the briefings. The Sept. 14, 2012, brief was a\ncoffee meeting with members.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nUSA Today reported that the Fox-promoted Select Committee may cost $1.5\nmillion this year, despite numerous other independent investigations\nfinding no wrongdoing with relation to the events in Benghazi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Politico: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton sticks with President Obama on Israel\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/hillary-clinton-barack-obama-israel-113360.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Katie Glueck\n\nDecember 5, 2014, 10:13 p.m. EST\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] In appearance with a pro-Israel donor, she defends the White\nHouse on Iran talks.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton had several opportunities to distance herself from the\nObama administration during an appearance Friday before a heavily\npro-Israel crowd, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t take them.\n\n\n\nInstead, she defended President Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s dealings with the Jewish\nstate at a time of tense U.S.-Israel relations, insisting the White House\nis committed to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security and supporting America\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear talks\nwith Iran.\n\n\n\nThe former secretary of state and likely 2016 Democratic presidential\ncontender was speaking at the Saban Forum, an event hosted by the Brookings\nInstitution and named for billionaire and Democratic mega-donor Haim Saban.\nShe offered her most extensive Israel-related comments since criticizing\nthe president\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy in a summer interview with The Atlantic that\ncaused a political maelstrom.\n\n\n\nAhead of her remarks, some attendees chattered over cocktails about their\ndisagreements with the White House, especially on its decision to pursue\nthe negotiations with Tehran. But, during a half-hour conversation onstage\nwith Saban, Clinton signaled little daylight with the administration.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you look at the close cooperation, and what this administration and the\nCongress over the last six years has done with respect to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s\nsecurity, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite extraordinary,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pointing to funding for\nmilitary equipment and strategic consultations. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody can argue with the\ncommitment of this administration to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security, and that has to\ncontinue, it has to deepen regardless of the political back-and-forth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton has yet to say if whether she will launch a second campaign for\npresident \xe2\x80\x94 an announcement is expected early next year \xe2\x80\x94 but Republicans\nalready have been scrutinizing her tenure at Foggy Bottom during Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\nfirst term. Many in the GOP accuse Obama of being insufficiently supportive\nof Israel, and some have tried to link Clinton to Obama\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy\nmissteps.\n\n\n\nIn the interview with The Atlantic, published in August, Clinton questioned\nthe White House\xe2\x80\x99s self-described foreign policy doctrine of \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t do\nstupid sh\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as its approach to the bloodshed in Syria, among other\ncriticisms. Her remarks prompted blowback from people close to the\nadministration. Some were unhappy with the timing of her comments, which\ncame as the president faced a slew of international crises. Clinton\neventually called the president to patch things over.\n\n\n\nHad she decided Friday to issue more criticisms, she could have risked\nanother flurry of anger, especially amid the White House\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to keep\nthe talks with Iran on track. World powers, including the United States,\nhave extended the negotiations with the Islamic Republic until the summer.\n\n\n\nIsrael views a nuclear weapon-armed Iran as an existential threat, and it\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe Iran\xe2\x80\x99s assurances that its nuclear program is peaceful.\n\n\n\nAs secretary of state, Clinton was deeply involved in laying the groundwork\nfor the negotiations (she credited sanctions as helping bring the Iranians\nto the table). On Friday, she sought to reassure the crowd that \xe2\x80\x9cno deal is\nbetter than a bad deal,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9call options\xe2\x80\x9d must remain \xe2\x80\x9con the table\xe2\x80\x9d\nin preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n\n\n\nBut, in at times hawkish language, she defended the path the White House\nhas taken with Tehran so far, even as she also painted Iran as a deeply\ndestabilizing force in the Middle East. She also indicated support for the\nextension of talks, saying it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvery important\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ctry to see if we can\nreach an agreement in line with our requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy bottom line is a deal that verifiably closes all of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s pathways to\nnuclear weapons,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe key there is \xe2\x80\x98verifiably\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98all.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton was also asked about Benjamin Netanyahu, the conservative prime\nminister of Israel, with whom Obama has a particularly fraught\nrelationship. In The Atlantic, Clinton offered sympathetic words for\nNetanyahu, but on Friday, she avoided that, instead downplaying Israel\xe2\x80\x99s\ndisagreements with the administration.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt times there are going to be differences,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\nit\xe2\x80\x99s personal. I think it is a different perspective about, sometimes what\nwe think is best for our friends may not be what our friends think is best\nfor them. When we say that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that\xe2\x80\x99s disrespectful or\nrupturing the relationship. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an honest relationship. That\xe2\x80\x99s\nthe kind of friend I want. I want people to say that to me, I want to be\nable to say that back. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a broader, more accurate way to look\nat the relationship right now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe also reiterated her support for a two-state solution to resolve the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, noting that goal was pursued when her\nhusband, Bill Clinton, was president, as well as in the Bush and Obama\nadministrations.\n\n\n\nThe absence of negotiations \xe2\x80\x9cleaves a vacuum that gets filled by\xe2\x80\xa6bad\nactors, threats\xe2\x80\xa6[that are] not good for Israel and not good for the\nPalestinians,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I think the efforts undertaken in the last\nseveral years, when I was secretary [and under] Secretary [John] Kerry are\nvery much in the interests of Israel and in the interests of the\nPalestinians.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAsked about her biggest regrets while at the State Department, Clinton\nnamed several, including the administration\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to do more to\nboost the pro-democracy protests in Iran in 2009, something she discussed\nin her recent memoir, \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe event drew lawmakers and former lawmakers, including House Minority\nLeader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), whose district\nincludes the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 Chappaqua home; Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), former\nSen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) and former Rep. Jane Harman (D-Calif.), along\nwith former Israeli Amb. Michael Oren, among others.\n\n\n\nClinton lingered after the event, hugging Lowey, greeting old colleagues\nfrom the State Department, taking pictures with Oren and huddling with\nGraham.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Wall Street Journal: \xe2\x80\x9cIran Talks Likely to Figure in Any Hillary Clinton\n2016 Bid\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://online.wsj.com/articles/iran-talks-likely-to-figure-in-any-hillary-clinton-2016-bid-1417823608>*\n\n\n\nBy Jay Solomon and Peter Nicholas\n\nDecember 5, 2014, 7:39 p.m. EST\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] Former Diplomat Remains Tied to Administration Efforts to Seal\nNuclear Deal; GOP Says Tehran Uses the Talks as Cover\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON\xe2\x80\x94 Hillary Clinton has distanced herself from the Obama\nadministration\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly unpopular handling of international issues,\nincluding Syria and Russia.\n\n\n\nThe former secretary of state is much more closely tied to current U.S.\ndiplomatic efforts toward Iran aimed at curbing Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\nMrs. Clinton has taken credit for initiating secret talks with Iran in 2012\nthat formed the foundation for negotiations that were recently extended\nanother seven months. In addition, one of her closest foreign-policy\nadvisers at the State Department, Jake Sullivan, remains one of the Obama\nadministration\xe2\x80\x99s top negotiators with the Iranian diplomats.\n\n\n\nRepublicans are already citing Iran as a likely top foreign-policy issue in\nthe 2016 campaign, when Mrs. Clinton is expected to be the front-runner for\nthe Democratic presidential nomination. They say the White House is\nallowing Tehran to use the talks as a cover to weaken Western sanctions and\nto advance its nuclear program. The White House has said its diplomacy, and\nan interim agreement reached last year, have capped key parts of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s\nnuclear program and rolled it back in some areas.\n\n\n\nIn a July CNN interview, Mrs. Clinton pushed for a U.S. negotiating line\nthat would allow Iran to maintain little to no ability to produce nuclear\nfuel in the near term. But U.S. diplomats have already conceded in talks\nthat Tehran would maintain thousands of centrifuges used to enrich uranium\nas part of any final deal.\n\n\n\nShe spoke about the Iran nuclear talks at an event Friday night hosted by\nthe Brookings Institution think tank, saying she supported the extension of\nnuclear negotiations with Iran. But she displayed distance from the White\nHouse\xe2\x80\x99s policies on Iran. She said she wished the Obama administration \xe2\x80\x9chad\nspoken out more\xe2\x80\x9d to support a pro-democracy movement that broke out in Iran\nin 2009. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never know...what you may say that gives heart to people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nInterviewed at the event by a political supporter, Haim Saban, Mrs. Clinton\nsaid the U.S. mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be overly willing to reach a deal with Iran. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nremain strongly of the view that no deal is better than a bad deal,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid.\n\n\n\nStill, she said the negotiations are an important step. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it is a\nvery important effort to continue to pursue, and to try to see if we can\nreach an agreement that is in line with our requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDespite her apparent differences with the negotiators, Republicans say she\nis locked into the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s policy because of her role in\nshaping it. Rep. Steve Chabot (R., Ohio), a member of the House Foreign\nAffairs Committee, said she was the \xe2\x80\x9cchief architect\xe2\x80\x9d of the Obama foreign\npolicy for four years and will have to answer for any failings when it\ncomes to Iran. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the most part, the current secretary of state has\ncarried on the policies that she started,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a\ntremendous difference between the two relative to Iran.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton, through her office, declined to comment for this article.\n\n\n\nDuring her 2008 presidential bid, Mrs. Clinton occasionally roiled the\nDemocratic contest with hawkish statements about Iran, at one point\nslamming then-Sen. Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s call for direct talks as \xe2\x80\x9cnaive.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn joining Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s administration, she expressed greater skepticism\nthan did Mr. Obama toward engaging Iran. Weeks after moving to the State\nDepartment, she told the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates she\nwas \xe2\x80\x9cdoubtful\xe2\x80\x9d Tehran would respond to U.S. offers to hold talks over its\nnuclear program, according to senior U.S. officials, a comment seen as a\nslap at the White House.\n\n\n\nStill, Mrs. Clinton moved aggressively to implement Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s strategy,\noffering the prospect of talks while boosting economic pressure on Tehran.\n\n\n\nHer supporters and some foreign-policy experts say she will be able to\nargue that her efforts to impose sanctions were the primary reason Tehran\nagreed to hold direct, high-level talks.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was one of the foremost Iran skeptics, and by taking a tough line\xe2\x80\xa6she\nalso teed up the kind of leverage that might lead to an agreement, should\nthere be one,\xe2\x80\x9d said the author David Rothkopf, who recently published a\nbook on the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Mrs. Clinton was intimately involved in establishing the\ndiplomatic channel that laid the groundwork for today\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear\nnegotiations, said current and former U.S. officials.\n\n\n\nIn the summer of 2012, Mrs. Clinton secretly dispatched Mr. Sullivan, then\nher deputy chief of staff, to the Omani capital, Muscat, to meet senior\nIranian diplomats. Not even Mr. Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s colleagues were told of his\nmission.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the delicate first meeting with the Iranians, Jake was not the most\nexperienced diplomat at the State Department I could have chosen, but he\nwas discreet and had my absolute confidence,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Clinton wrote in her new\nbook, \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHis presence would send a powerful message that I\nwas personally invested in this process.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Sullivan went on to become one of the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s top\nnuclear negotiators with Iran, remaining in that role after Mrs. Clinton\nleft the State Department in early 2013.\n\n\n\nThe 38-year-old is widely expected to be in line for a senior position in a\nClinton administration. Mr. Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s departure this summer as a\nforeign-policy aide to Vice President Joe Biden was seen as a prelude to\nhis transition into advising the former first lady\xe2\x80\x99s presidential bid.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnlike others in the Obama administration who will be long gone in 2017,\nhe will own this deal if Hillary Clinton becomes president,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mark\nDubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think\ntank that has criticized the U.S. negotiating strategy with Iran. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\npressure on him to do a good deal is enormous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Sullivan is currently teaching at Yale University but has continued on\nas part of the U.S. negotiating team with Iran. In meetings with Republican\nskeptics of the Iran talks, he has mirrored Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s more hawkish\nline, according to participants in some of the meetings.\n\n\n\nPeople close to Mrs. Clinton say she will likely approach Iran from two\nperspectives during a campaign.

Tom Harkin has some advice\nfor Hillary Clinton if she decides to run for the Democratic presidential\nnomination in 2016.\n\n\n\nFirst off, Clinton, who finished third in Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s first-in-the-nation\nprecinct caucuses in 2008, has to understand that she is going to have to\nwork for Iowans\xe2\x80\x99 support.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe needs to understand that she can\xe2\x80\x99t take it for granted,\xe2\x80\x9d Harkin said\nFriday during taping of Iowa Public Television\xe2\x80\x99s Iowa Press, which airs\ntonight at 7:30.\n\n\n\nThe Iowa Democrat, who believes it\xe2\x80\x99s a 50-50 proposition whether the former\nfirst lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state seeks the nomination, said\nthat if Clinton runs she won\xe2\x80\x99t have the field to herself.\n\n\n\nFormer Virginia Sen. Jim Webb is forming an exploratory committee and\nVermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders will be back in Iowa later this\nmonth giving him four visit \xe2\x80\x93 the same as outgoing Maryland Gov. Martin\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley, who spoke at the Iowa Hall of Fame Dinner honoring Harkin, who is\nretiring after 40 years in Congress.\n\n\n\nHarkin didn\xe2\x80\x99t endorse Clinton, who he hosted at his annual steak fry in\nSeptember, or any of the others, but spoke highly of O\xe2\x80\x99Malley.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like him a lot. I admire him greatly,\xe2\x80\x9d Harkin said.\n\n\n\nIf she runs, Harkin said, Clinton should take her campaign to small-town\nIowa rather than concentrate on larger media markets.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\'t just go to Des Moines or Waterloo or Cedar Rapids or Dubuque,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cGo to the rural areas. Start out in smaller communities in Iowa. Let\nthem know you care about rural America and small towns and communities.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can get the cities later on, but plant your flag in rural Iowa,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid.\n\n\n\nHarkin also said he will remain active in the Iowa Democratic Party, but\nnot in a leadership role.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a Democrat and I love my party and I want my party to be good and I\nwant them to have good policies and good candidates,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nintend to be any kind of godfather or something like that. I just want to\nbe supportive and helping in whatever way I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe was reluctant to arm-chair quarterback the unsuccessful Senate campaign\nby Bruce Braley.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been a great congressman, he has contributed a lot and I thought he\nran a good campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d Harkin said.\n\n\n\nThe Braley campaign made a couple of mistakes \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cWe all know about that,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe said, and Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst ran a \xe2\x80\x9cgreat campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d In\nthe end, however, but the four-term 1st District representative was the\nvictim of a wave election.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen waves,\xe2\x80\x9d Harkin said. \xe2\x80\x9cI came in on a wave in 1974, the Watergate\nwave. And so I\'ve seen these waves move back and forth. And this was just\none of those years.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAsked whether Braley should run again, Harkin said that will be a personal\ndecision for the Waterloo attorney to make.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he is a good public servant. He was a very, very good congressman.\nHe worked very hard,\xe2\x80\x9d Harkin said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he wants to run again, I would think\nthere would be a lot of support for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIowa Press can be seen at 7:30 p.m. tonight and noon Sunday on IPTV, at\n8:30 a.m. Saturday on IPTV World and is available beginning tonight at\nwww.IPTV.org <http://www.iptv.org/>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Washington Post blog: PostPartisan: Ed Rogers: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Insiders: Who is\nHillary kidding?\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/12/05/the-insiders-who-is-hillary-kidding/>*\n\n\n\nBy Ed Rogers\n\nDecember 5, 2014, 6:33 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nChoosing to run for president means understanding everything the job\nentails \xe2\x80\x93 both the good and the bad \xe2\x80\x93 and deciding you are up for the\nadventure. By some accounts, Hillary Clinton is \xe2\x80\x9cgenuinely undecided\xe2\x80\x9d about\nwhether to run, but while we wait for her formal decision, she seems to be\nposing a little too hard.  At the Massachusetts Conference for Women in\nBoston yesterday, she repeatedly emphasized how \xe2\x80\x9cunforgiving\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chard\xe2\x80\x9d\nbeing president was, saying in part, \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s what I worry about.  The\nstress on anybody in a leadership position, multiplied many times over to\nbe president.  The incoming never ends.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a little skeptical.  Is Clinton really trying to seem reluctant, to\nposition herself as the candidate who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really want to run but will\nsacrifice herself for the good of our country? Please. That is rich,\nespecially considering the source. It\xe2\x80\x99s not quite as tone-deaf as saying\nshe and Bill were \xe2\x80\x9cdead broke,\xe2\x80\x9d but her act certainly strains credibility\nin suggesting she is wary of the burdens of the presidency.\n\n\n\nI do think there are some leaders who have been in close proximity to the\npresidency who don\xe2\x80\x99t crave the White House the way others do.  Hillary\nClinton could be in that category (as could Jeb Bush), but nothing about\nher actions to date suggest anything other than that she is already running.\n\n\n\nNobody craves power and the presidency like the Clintons. Why pretend\notherwise? It\xe2\x80\x99s not bad to be ambitious and want to be president. Many have\nbeen angling for the job for years. Few who have ever been elected\npresident have wanted to leave the office. Stop the woe-is-me anguish and\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t give us the phony martyr routine. Anyone who runs for president must\navoid talking down to voters and acting like they are reluctantly willing\nto take on the \xe2\x80\x9ctoughest job.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nTo be fair, this is not unique to Secretary Clinton. We will hear more\nfalse modesty from preening wannabes.  I hope the handlers and 2016\ncandidates will have the discipline to spare us the theatrics.  If the\noffice really is just too much to bear, then save us the drama and do\nsomething else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*CNN opinion: Gloria Berger: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary and Jeb: How the deciders decide\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/05/opinion/borger-jeb-bush-hillary-clinton-decide/index.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Gloria Borger\n\nDecember 5, 2014, 3:45 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nLost amidst the predictable clutter of the "will-he-or won\'t-she" questions\nabout whether Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton will actually run for the\npresidency is an unexpected development: a hint of authenticity.\n\n\n\nTurns out that political purgatory\xe2\x80\x94even if temporary\xe2\x80\x94can actually spark a\ngenuine conversation with the public about what it takes to be president,\nand what goes into deciding whether you want to run.\n\n\n\nHere\'s Hillary on herself: "The job is unforgiving in many ways, so I think\nyou need people around you who will kid you, make fun of you. ... You can\nlose touch with what\'s real, what\'s authentic."\n\n\n\nHere\'s Jeb on his decision: "Can I do it where the sacrifice to my family\nis tolerable?...It\'s a pretty ugly business right now. There\'s a level\nunder which I would never subjugate my family because that\'s my organizing\nprinciple. That\'s my life."\n\n\n\nSo while Chris Christie won\'t answer questions about immigration and Ted\nCruz is threatening to block presidential nominations and Rand Paul is\nblaming the tragic Eric Garner death on cigarette taxes, there\'s another\nmore personal and revealing conversation going on about the presidency and\nhow to get there, and we ought to pay some attention.\n\n\n\nNot just because it\'s coming from Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, although\nthat is a part of it. After all, Hillary\'s outside support network is up\nand running, even if she isn\'t officially yet. And while Jeb has no\ncampaign infrastructure or organization, his closest advisers are having\nenough meetings with enough operatives to send enough signals that it\'s a\nvery live, real, even likely, possibility. Though Jeb\'s advisers tell me he\nhasn\'t made a decision, the process over the last six months sure looks\nlike it leads to a presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nSo all the cheerleaders need is the final hand signal.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us back to the Jeb and Hillary conversations. They\'re thinking\nout loud, in a way, which hardly ever happens in politics anymore because\nit usually gets you into trouble. (See: Joe Biden.)\n\n\n\nBut they\'re both doing it because their decisions about running for the\npresidency come from places of deep family experience. Hillary lived in the\nWhite House. Jeb visited his brother and his father there. They get it --\nat all levels. They understand the power and nature of the job. They also\nunderstand the "what-it-takes" component to run for it.\n\n\n\nAnd, in a way, they\'ve both got similar problems: They\'re each practiced\npoliticians, but they\'re not the best transactional pols in their families.\nThey each have problems with their party\'s activist base. And they both can\nseem like old news. It\'s that dynasty thing.\n\n\n\nBut wait. Maybe all that stuff actually prepares a candidate for the\ncampaign, and maybe even for the job itself. Clinton\'s ruminations about\ndecision-making, for instance, are refreshing.\n\n\n\n"Technology connects you around the world instantaneously, so you\'re\nconstantly being asked for opinions, to make decisions that maybe you need\nsome time to think about," she told a Boston audience on Thursday.\n\n\n\n"Maybe you need some time to sleep on it. Maybe you need to bring in some\npeople to talk about it. But the pace of demands is so intense that you\nfeel like you\'ve got to respond." It\'s the stress, she said. "Here\'s what I\nworry about. The stress on anybody in a leadership position, multiplied\nmany times over to be president. The incoming never ends."\n\n\n\nIt\'s a much more honest assessment than talking about the tug of being a\ngrandmother.\n\n\n\nAs for Jeb Bush, in addition to the personal issues, he\'s given a big hint\nhe gets that he\'s not aligned with the base of his party in some states\xe2\x80\x94and\nthat\'s fine. In a recent appearance before a Wall Street Journal CEO\nconference, he said the GOP nominee needs to be willing to "lose the\nprimary to win the general (election) without violating your principles."\n\n\n\nCould he possibly be talking about Mitt Romney circa 2012? Or his own\nproblems with the party base on immigration and school reform? My guess:\nBoth.\n\n\n\nI\'m also guessing this: What we are hearing from both of these politicians\nare part of the larger conversation they\'re having with themselves. As in:\nDo I need this? Can I do this? Is it worth it to me\xe2\x80\x94and important enough to\nthe country\xe2\x80\x94for me to spend two years on this?\n\n\n\nThese are not wannabes. They\'ve been there, in the heat, in one way or\nanother. So while the subordinates plan, organize and recruit, the actual\ndeciders continue to decide.\n\n\n\nIt\'s getting down to the wire, and they know it. You can hear it. And it\nmay be the most genuine stuff we hear for the next two years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*U.S. News & World Report blog: The Run 2016: \xe2\x80\x9cWarren Liberals Eye Webb to\nPressure Hillary\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/run-2016/2014/12/05/elizabeth-warren-liberals-eye-jim-webb-to-pressure-hillary-clinton>*\n\n\n\nBy David Catanese\n\nDecember 5, 2014, 3:37 p.m. EST\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] \xe2\x80\x9cThere\'s a movement in New Hampshire to pump the breaks on a\nClinton coronation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nEven if Elizabeth Warren isn\'t running for president, her liberal allies\nare determined to place the Massachusetts senator\'s vision at the fulcrum\nof the Democratic Party\'s 2016 primary debate.\n\n\n\nThe Progressive Change Campaign Committee has deployed one of its top\norganizers to the early primary state of New Hampshire to ask elected\nofficials and political leaders there to pressure all candidates to take\nstands on Warren\'s agenda \xe2\x80\x93 one that includes expanding Social Security\nbenefits, reforming the way Wall Street banks operate and making college\nmore affordable.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re trying to assess who is in and who is out in our strategy to exert\npressure to get all Democratic candidates for president to embrace\nElizabeth Warren-style ideas," says Adam Green, the committee\'s co-founder.\nGreen would not comment on the success so far of the project, which the\ngroup began this week.\n\n\n\nThe goal of the campaign is to slow the coalescing of support around\nHillary Clinton, who is an overwhelming front-runner for the Democratic\npresidential nomination. But the movement might only have impact if there\'s\nanother candidate willing to stake out positions to Clinton\'s left.\n\n\n\nThe only major candidate formally exploring the race with a committee to\ndate is former Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., who has been reluctant to draw any\ncontrasts with Clinton.\n\n\n\nLiberals are taking a wait-and-see approach to Webb, who is difficult to\npin down ideologically.\n\n\n\n"It seems like he may have a populist bent, but he\'s been out of the Senate\nfor a while," Green says.\n\n\n\nBut Green posits that Webb could quickly make a mark on the race if he were\nforced to be pinned down on Warren\'s pet issues.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Jim Webb went to New Hampshire and local allies asked him if he\nsupports breaking up the big banks and he says, \'Yes,\' people will want to\nknow if Hillary agrees, even people predisposed to supporting Hillary.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s part of the process," he says.\n\n\n\nWebb has made one visit to the Granite State since 2013, and it\'s unclear\nif he\'s heading back anytime soon.\n\n\n\nThe chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, Ray Buckley, tells U.S.\nNews he hasn\'t spoken to Webb or anyone connected to him since 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*New York Times: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s History as First Lady: Powerful, but\nNot Always Deft\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/us/politics/hillary-clintons-history-as-first-lady-powerful-but-not-always-deft.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0>*\n\n\n\nBy Peter Baker and Amy Chozick\n\nDecember 5, 2014\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 As a young lawyer for the Watergate committee in the 1970s,\nHillary Rodham caught a ride home one night with her boss, Bernard\nNussbaum. Sitting in the car before going inside, she told him she wanted\nto introduce him to her boyfriend. \xe2\x80\x9cBernie,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s going to be\npresident of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Nussbaum, stressed by the pressure of that tumultuous period, blew up\nat her audacious na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cHillary, that\xe2\x80\x99s the most idiotic\xe2\x80\x9d thing, he\nscreamed. She screamed back. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know a goddamn thing you\xe2\x80\x99re talking\nabout!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and then called him a curse word. \xe2\x80\x9cGod, she started\nbawling me out,\xe2\x80\x9d he recalled. \xe2\x80\x9cShe walks out and slammed the door on me,\nand she storms into the building.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt turned out she was right and he was wrong. Ms. Rodham, who later married\nthat ambitious boyfriend, Bill Clinton, believed even then that life would\ntake her to the White House and now may seek to return not as a spouse and\npartner, but on her own terms.\n\n\n\nIn recent months, as Mrs. Clinton has prepared for a likely 2016\npresidential campaign, she has often framed those White House years as a\nperiod when, like many working mothers, she juggled the demands of raising\na young daughter and having a career. She talks about championing women\xe2\x80\x99s\nrights globally, supporting her husband during years of robust economic\ngrowth, and finding inspiration in Eleanor Roosevelt to stay resolute in\nthe midst of personal attacks.\n\n\n\nWhat Mrs. Clinton leaves out about her time as first lady is her messy,\nsometimes explosive and often politically clumsy dealings with\ncongressional Republicans and White House aides. Now, the release of\nroughly 6,000 pages of extraordinarily candid interviews with more than 60\nveterans of the Clinton administration paints a more nuanced portrait of a\nfirst lady who was at once formidable and not always politically deft.\n\n\n\nHer triumphs and setbacks are laid bare in the oral histories of Mr.\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s presidency, released last month by the Miller Center at the\nUniversity of Virginia. The center has conducted oral histories of every\npresidency going back to Jimmy Carter\xe2\x80\x99s, interviewing key players and then\nsealing them for years to come. But more than any other, this set of\ninterviews bears on the future as much as the past.\n\n\n\nThese were formative years for Mrs. Clinton, a time of daring and hubris, a\ntime when she evolved from that headstrong young lawyer so impressed with\nthe man she would marry into a political figure in her own right. She\nemerged from battles over health care and Whitewater a more seasoned yet\nprofoundly scarred and cautious politician with a better grasp of how\nWashington works, but far more wary of ambitious projects that may be\nunpopular.\n\n\n\nNow carefully controlled at 67, then she was fiery and unpredictable,\nlobbing sarcastic jabs in private meetings and congressional hearings. Now\ncriticized as a centrist and challenged from the left, Mrs. Clinton then\nwas considered the liberal whispering in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s ear to resist the\nNorth American Free Trade Agreement and a welfare overhaul.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s much more politically astute now than she was in early 1993,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nAlan Blinder, who was a White House economist. \xe2\x80\x9cI think she learned. She\xe2\x80\x99s\nreally smart. She learns, and she knows she made mistakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*An Independent Force*\n\n\n\nNo president ever had a partner quite like Hillary Rodham Clinton. She\nattended campaign strategy meetings in Little Rock, Ark., and later became\nthe first (and so far only) first lady with an office in the West Wing. She\nwould bring his meandering meetings to a close. She plotted out his defense\nagainst scandal.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing he lacks is discipline, both in his personal life and his\nintellectual or decision-making life, unless he\xe2\x80\x99s rescued by somebody,\xe2\x80\x9d\nobserved Alice M. Rivlin, who served as White House budget director. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nthink for a good part of his career, he was probably rescued by Hillary by\nher being a more decisive, more disciplined kind of person who kept things\nmoving.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe was an independent force within the White House, single-handedly\npushing health care onto the agenda and intimidating into silence those who\nthought she might be mishandling it. She was prone to bouts of anger and\nnursed deep resentment toward Washington. She endured a terribly\ncomplicated relationship with her philandering husband. And yet she was the\none who often channeled his energies, steered him toward success and saved\nhim from himself.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe may have been critical from time to time with temper tantrums and\nthings like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Nussbaum, who went on to become Mr. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nfirst White House counsel. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she was very strong, and he needed her\ndesperately. He would not have been president, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think, without her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton created her own team in the White House that came to be called\nHillaryland, and \xe2\x80\x9cthey were a little island unto themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d as Betty\nCurrie, the president\xe2\x80\x99s secretary, put it. She inspired more loyalty from\nthem than the president did from his own team, said Roger Altman, who was\ndeputy treasury secretary, probably because she was not as purely\npolitical. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wears her heart on her sleeve much more than he does,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid.\n\n\n\nBut the Clintons were fiercely protective of each other, acting at times as\nif it were just them against the world. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember one time in one of\nthese meetings where she was blowing up about his staff and how we were all\nincompetent and he was having to be the mechanic and drive the car and do\neverything \xe2\x80\x94 that we weren\xe2\x80\x99t capable of anything, why did he have to do it\nall himself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joan N. Baggett, an assistant for political affairs.\n\n\n\nMr. Clinton had a similar temper when it came to the arrows hurled at her,\nand aides learned early on never to question her judgment in front of him.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe really reacts violently when people criticize Hillary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mickey\nKantor, the 1992 campaign chairman and later commerce secretary. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean he\nreally gets angry \xe2\x80\x94 you can just see it. He literally gets red in the face.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe depended on her more than any other figure in his world. It blinded him\nto trouble, some advisers concluded, most notably about her ill-fated drive\nto remake the health care system.\n\n\n\nBut he rarely overruled her, at least not in ways that staff members could\ndetect. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think of any issue of any importance at all where they\nwere in disagreement and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t win out,\xe2\x80\x9d recalled Abner Mikva, who\nserved as White House counsel.\n\n\n\n*Finding a Balance*\n\n\n\nDespite her boast to Mr. Nussbaum, Mrs. Clinton was unsentimental in her\ncalculations about whether her husband was ready to run for president. As\ngovernor of Arkansas, Mr. Clinton evaluated a candidacy in 1988, when he\nwould turn 42, and thought it might be in his interest even if he lost.\nMrs. Clinton disagreed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou run to win or you don\xe2\x80\x99t at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kantor\nremembered her saying a couple of years later.\n\n\n\nHer assessment was that 1988 was not his year. \xe2\x80\x9cI think she felt he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\nready,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frank Greer, a media strategist.\n\n\n\nThere may have been other reasons, too. Mr. Clinton complained to his\nfriend Peter Edelman that Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, who was mounting\nhis own campaign for the Democratic nomination in 1988, was \xe2\x80\x9cspreading\nrumors that he was having extramarital affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOthers had also heard reports. After meeting Mr. Clinton, Ms. Rivlin gushed\nabout him to their mutual friend, Donna Shalala. Ms. Shalala agreed that\nMr. Clinton was \xe2\x80\x9cterrific,\xe2\x80\x9d but added that \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s never going to be\npresident of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Rivlin asked why not. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got a\nwoman problem,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Rivlin remembered her answering.\n\n\n\nBy 1992, Mrs. Clinton was convinced that he was ready, and she confronted\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cwoman problem\xe2\x80\x9d directly in strategy sessions. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had one meeting that\nwas solely on this subject at which Hillary was present,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stanley B.\nGreenberg, their pollster. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was an uncomfortable meeting, I can assure\nyou, raising the issue,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember Hillary saying that,\n\xe2\x80\x98Obviously, if I could say no to this question, we would say no, and\ntherefore there is an issue.\xe2\x80\x99 She spoke about this as much as he did.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut if Mr. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s dalliances were a challenge, some of his aides worried\nthat so was his wife. Some questioned whether he would look emasculated to\nhave such a strong spouse. \xe2\x80\x9cThey pigeonholed her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Thomases, a\nclose friend of Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s who worked on the campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was so\nstrong a personality that there were people who felt that when they were\ntogether her strong personality made him seem weaker.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton struggled with that, trying to find a balance. But she was\nintegral to nearly every decision \xe2\x80\x94 from her husband\xe2\x80\x99s ideological\npositioning down to his campaign song. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery time we suggest something,\nHillary vetoes it, and we just can\xe2\x80\x99t get a song,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s longtime\nconsigliere, Bruce R. Lindsey, complained at one point, according to Al\nFrom, founder of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council. Finally, Mr.\n>From suggested Fleetwood Mac\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Stop,\xe2\x80\x9d and that passed muster.\n\n\n\nMore important, Mr. From pushed for Mr. Clinton to run to the middle, and\nultimately she signed off on that too. She approached Mr. From at a party.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought about it and you\xe2\x80\x99re right, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be a different\nkind of Democrat by the convention,\xe2\x80\x9d he remembered her saying.\n\n\n\nOnce in the White House, Mrs. Clinton was a different kind of first lady.\nPut in charge of revamping health care, she recruited a bright and\nsupremely confident adviser in Ira C. Magaziner and assembled a bold if\nelaborate plan.\n\n\n\nShe impressed Capitol Hill. \xe2\x80\x9cHillary never turns her head when she\xe2\x80\x99s\ntalking to someone,\xe2\x80\x9d noticed former Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, then\nthe No. 2 Republican. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is absolutely riveted. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look around,\nlike, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, hi there, Tilly. How are you?\xe2\x80\x99 or divert her attention from the\nperson she\xe2\x80\x99s talking to. That\xe2\x80\x99s a gift.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nCharles Robb, then a Democratic senator from Virginia, was among those who\nunderestimated her. \xe2\x80\x9cI have to confess that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the special\nqualities that she had,\xe2\x80\x9d he remembered. But \xe2\x80\x9cwhen she came over to give her\nfirst brief to a number of senators on health care, it was a tour de force.\nAnd I thought to myself, \xe2\x80\x98How did you get so attracted to this Bill Clinton\nguy that you missed Hillary Rodham Clinton?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut the health care effort and its expansion of government involvement in\nthe private sector proved politically toxic and generated deep internal\ndivision within the White House. Mr. Magaziner was seen as dismissive and\nfew were willing to confront the president\xe2\x80\x99s wife. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were a lot of\npeople who were intimidated,\xe2\x80\x9d said Leon E. Panetta, the chief of staff.\n\n\n\nMs. Shalala, who had been named secretary of health and human services, was\none of the few who tried. \xe2\x80\x9cI told Hillary that this thing is just headed\nfor disaster, and she told me I was just jealous that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in charge\nand that was why I was complaining,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Edelman, who served as Ms.\nShalala\xe2\x80\x99s assistant secretary, remembered Ms. Shalala telling him.\n\n\n\nSome of the White House economists were dubious and privately called Mrs.\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s health care team \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bolsheviks.\xe2\x80\x9d In return, according to Ms.\nRivlin, the economists were \xe2\x80\x9csometimes treated like the enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d Their\nsuggested changes were ignored. \xe2\x80\x9cWe could have beaten Ira alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\nBlinder. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t beat Hillary.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIndeed, the conflict left the president in a bind. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t fire your\nwife,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kantor observed.\n\n\n\nIn the end, the Clintons were stunned by the collapse of the effort in\nCongress, a defeat that helped lead to the Republican takeover in 1994.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey may be an irresistible force,\xe2\x80\x9d said William A. Galston, a domestic\npolicy adviser, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they met an immovable object.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Shifting Gears*\n\n\n\nAfter the health care debacle, Mrs. Clinton \xe2\x80\x9cretreated for a while and\nlicked her wounds,\xe2\x80\x9d as Mr. Galston put it. She was seen in the West Wing\nless and less, while traveling abroad more and more.\n\n\n\nShe asserted her influence in less visible ways. She persuaded her husband\nto make Madeleine Albright the first woman to serve as secretary of state.\nShe put the brutal treatment of women by the Taliban in Afghanistan on the\nadministration\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.\n\n\n\nShe overcame State Department resistance to make a trip to Beijing, where\nshe forcefully argued that women\xe2\x80\x99s rights were human rights. She exulted so\nmuch afterward that she telephoned Samuel Berger, the deputy national\nsecurity adviser, catching him at a Baltimore Orioles game, to thank him\nfor making the trip possible.\n\n\n\nBut scandal was stalking the Clinton White House. She had resisted\nreleasing files on the couple\xe2\x80\x99s investment in a failed Arkansas land deal\nknown as Whitewater and berated aides who pressed her to do so. \xe2\x80\x9cShe just\nlet everybody have it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Panetta recalled. But she and her husband\nacceded to aides who, over Mr. Nussbaum\xe2\x80\x99s objections, pushed to allow the\nappointment of an independent counsel.\n\n\n\nIt was a decision she would regret. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen is it going to end, Bernie?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\nNussbaum remembered her asking years later.\n\n\n\nThat was before the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, began\ninvestigating whether Mr. Clinton lied under oath about an affair with a\nformer intern named Monica Lewinsky. Mr. Clinton denied the affair for\nmonths, and Mrs. Clinton publicly said she believed him. But not all of\ntheir confidants were so sure.\n\n\n\nMs. Shalala recalled a meeting with Mrs. Clinton with friends from\nCalifornia buzzing around. \xe2\x80\x9cHillary said, \xe2\x80\x98Thanks for supporting the\npresident,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Shalala said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether she knew or not, but\nthat was the moment in which I thought, there\xe2\x80\x99s something here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMs. Shalala was personally offended. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was that it was an intern,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tolerate that.\xe2\x80\x9d After Mr. Clinton later admitted\nthat he had not told the truth, Ms. Shalala chastised him during a private\ncabinet meeting, a scolding that later made the newspapers. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one at the\nWhite House seemed mad at me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHillary certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMs. Thomases said Mrs. Clinton was furious with her husband but never\ncontemplated a split. \xe2\x80\x9cShe would have hit him with a frying pan if one had\nbeen handed to her, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she ever in her mind imagined leaving\nhim or divorcing him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nInstead, Mrs. Clinton went up to Capitol Hill to rally Democrats against\nimpeachment. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was absolutely great,\xe2\x80\x9d recalled Lawrence Stein, the White\nHouse lobbyist. \xe2\x80\x9cThey loved her. She called it a coup.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWithout her public support, Democrats might have abandoned the president,\nleading to pressure to resign or even a conviction in the Senate. Once\nagain, Mrs. Clinton had rescued him.\n\n\n\nAnd the Starr crisis transformed Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s public standing. With her\npoll numbers now sky high, she set her eyes on a Senate seat from New York,\nan idea that seemed so improbable that the White House press secretary, Joe\nLockhart, denied it publicly until one day she sidled up to him, noted that\nhe was from New York and started grilling him about voting patterns.\n\n\n\nFor both Clintons, the Senate race in 2000 became a way to purge the toxins\nof the scandal. Mr. Gore, now the vice president, wanted nothing to do with\nMr. Clinton as he mounted his own White House bid. So the departing\npresident focused his energy on his wife\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiven the fact that the vice president wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interested in his political\ncounsel, if he had not had Hillary running, it could have been a very\ndifficult time for him,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Lockhart said.\n\n\n\nAnd it began a new Clinton political career that, a decade and a half\nlater, now seems aimed once again at the White House. Imagine what Mr.\nNussbaum would have thought of that in the 1970s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Yahoo: \xe2\x80\x9cIs it already too late for a Democrat to derail Hillary Clinton in\n2016?\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://news.yahoo.com/is-it-already-too-late-for-a-democrat-to-derail-hillary-clinton-in-2016-181014036.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Andrew Romano\n\nDecember 5, 2014\n\n\n\nIn an interview this week with New York magazine, comedian Chris Rock was\nasked to predict which Republican candidate would face off against Hillary\nClinton in the 2016 presidential contest. He immediately rejected the\npremise of the question \xe2\x80\x94 i.e., that Clinton is a shoo-in for the\nDemocratic nomination.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s still not a done deal with Hillary,\xe2\x80\x9d Rock said. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember, she was\nahead last time. She had all the black people. And she lost to somebody she\nreally shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have lost to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nInterviewer Frank Rich agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cObama came out of nowhere, basically,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cWho in the Democratic Party could go after Hillary, though?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no Barack Obama until Barack Obama either,\xe2\x80\x9d Rock replied.\n\n\n\nVersions of this argument \xe2\x80\x94 Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, liberals: Hillary looked like a\nsure thing last time, too \xe2\x80\xa6 until a better candidate saved the day \xe2\x80\x94 have\nbeen gaining traction recently.\n\n\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s only one problem: History doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support Rock\xe2\x80\x99s thesis.\n\n\n\nAt this point in the 2008 cycle (the first week of December 2006) Barack\nObama was already Barack Obama. His official announcement may have been two\nmonths off, but even then, he had a ton of money. He had a ton of media\nattention. He was hinting \xe2\x80\x94 heavily \xe2\x80\x94 that he was going to run. And the\npolling plainly showed that he was competitive.\n\n\n\nExactly eight years later, Obama\xe2\x80\x99s would-be successors \xe2\x80\x94 the three\ncandidates who have openly expressed interest in challenging Clinton for\nthe Democratic nomination in 2016 \xe2\x80\x94 are so far behind Obama\xe2\x80\x99s December 2006\nbenchmarks on each of these metrics that it would take a miracle for any of\nthem to catch up.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the only person who comes close to measuring up to Obama circa\n2006 has repeatedly said that she will not run: Massachusetts Sen.\nElizabeth Warren.\n\nOf course, even if Clinton were to capture the Democratic nomination in\n2016, the general election would be anything but a coronation. The\npotential Republican field is full of fresh faces (Marco Rubio, Chris\nChristie) and seasoned pros (Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee), and the eventual\nnominee is likely to emerge battle-tested and ready to give Clinton a run\nfor her money.\n\n\n\nStill, a close reading of the record suggests that if Warren doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get\ninto the race, Clinton is not likely to face an Obama-caliber primary\nchallenge. Let\xe2\x80\x99s rewind to December 2006 and take a look at where things\nstood for Obama back then versus where things stand right now:\n\n\n\nMoney: In December 2006, Democrats were just coming off a stunning midterm\nvictory \xe2\x80\x94 the party won control of both houses of Congress for the first\ntime since 1994 \xe2\x80\x94 and observers were praising Obama as the cycle\xe2\x80\x99s star\nsurrogate. \xe2\x80\x9cSenator Barack Obama of Illinois has become the prize catch of\nthe midterm campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Anne Kornblut of The New York Times. \xe2\x80\x9cMore\nsought after than virtually every other Democrat, Mr. Obama was fully\nbooked, long ago, on a schedule to take him across a large swath of the\ncountry to help his party try to win control of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nObama\xe2\x80\x99s finances bore this out. Even though he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t running for office\nhimself \xe2\x80\x94 he had just become a U.S. senator two years earlier \xe2\x80\x94 Obama\nmanaged to raise a staggering $4.39 million through his leadership PAC,\nHope Fund, over the course of the cycle, plus another $1.02 million through\nhis candidate committee, according to the Federal Election Commission. And\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t just speak on behalf of his fellow Democrats; he shelled out a\ngrand total of $770,968 to help them get elected. None of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s potential\n2008 rivals \xe2\x80\x94 Clinton, John Edwards, Joe Biden, Chris Dodd \xe2\x80\x94 handed out\nnearly as much cash that year.\n\n\n\nSo how do today\xe2\x80\x99s would-be Obamas compare? It\xe2\x80\x99s not even close. Since the\nbeginning of 2013, Bernie Sanders has raised $1.4 million and funneled\n$136,000 to other candidates. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley has raked in slightly less\n($1.2 million) and spent a bit more ($296,497). And Jim Webb has barely\nregistered at all, collecting a paltry $38,121 and donating exactly $0 to\nhis fellow Democrats. In 2006, Obama spent the entire pre-presidential\nmidterm cycle collecting chits and flexing his fundraising muscle. Sanders,\nWebb and O\xe2\x80\x99Malley haveMedia: On Oct. 17, 2006, Obama published "The\nAudacity of Hope," a book that detailed his policy positions on a host of\nissues (education, health care, the war in Iraq) and served as a "thesis\nsubmission" for the U.S. presidency, as former presidential candidate Gary\nHart put it at the time. By Nov. 9, The New York Times was declaring it a\n\xe2\x80\x9csurprise\xe2\x80\x9d hit. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Audacity of Hope" seemed "primed for best-selling\nstatus,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Julie Bosman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut its rapid rise to the No. 1 spot on the\nNew York Times nonfiction list next Sunday, placing the author, the\nfreshman Democratic senator from Illinois, ahead of heavyweight authors\nlike John Grisham, Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly and even Bob Woodward, is something of a\npublishing stunner.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBosman shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been surprised. By late 2006, Obama \xe2\x80\x94 who\xe2\x80\x99d\nskyrocketed to national stardom more than two years earlier with his\nkeynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention \xe2\x80\x94 had already\nappeared on dozens of major magazine covers. One of them was the cover of\nNewsweek\xe2\x80\x99s big year-end "Who\xe2\x80\x99s Next" issue in 2004 \xe2\x80\x94 an accomplishment that\nhe would repeat two years later when he showed up alongside Hillary Clinton\non the December 2006 edition of "Who\xe2\x80\x99s Next," making him the franchise\xe2\x80\x99s\nfirst (and only) two-time cover boy. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s first book, "Dreams from My\nFather," had also been a best-seller. During the first seven days of\nDecember 2006, the Illinois senator\xe2\x80\x99s name was mentioned in more than 650\nU.S. new stories, according to a search of the Nexis archives. And when\nObama traveled to New Hampshire for the first time on Dec. 10, 150\njournalists followed him there.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he cast some kind of magic spell over the normally hard-bitten,\ncynical, run-over-your-grandmother-for-a-story press corps?\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Howard\nKurtz in a column headlined \xe2\x80\x9cThe Media\xe2\x80\x99s New Rock Star.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOr are they just\nengaged in the audacity of hope that they might get to cover a young and\nexciting African-American candidate with a shot at winning?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNeither Sanders, Webb nor O\xe2\x80\x99Malley has inspired \xe2\x80\x94 or fueled \xe2\x80\x94 this sort of\nmedia frenzy. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 last proper book was published in 2011; it currently\nranks 141,416th on Amazon.com. Webb\xe2\x80\x99s ranks 34,153rd. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley has yet to\npublish a book. None of them was mentioned in more than 80 U.S. news\nstories over the last seven days. And there\xe2\x80\x99s little chance that any of\nthem will attract 150 reporters next time they visit New Hampshire. not\nkept pace.\n\n\n\nPolling: This one is fairly straightforward. According to Real Clear\nPolitics, five major outlets released Democratic presidential primary polls\nduring the first two weeks of December 2006. They showed Clinton leading\nObama by an average of 20 percentage points; Obama\xe2\x80\x99s support averaged 15.8\npercentage points; Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s averaged 35.8.\n\nThis December is different. Right now, Sanders is averaging 3.5 percent in\nthe 2016 polls. Webb is averaging 1.4 percent. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley is averaging 1.2\npercent. And Clinton is averaging 62.7 percent.\n\n\n\nIn December 2006, Barack Obama was already the second-most-popular\npolitician in the country. He had already gained a significant amount of\nsupport among Democrats. And even though Clinton was way ahead, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\neven close to getting 50 percent of the primary vote.\n\n\n\nToday, almost two-thirds of Democrats support Clinton. Statistically\nspeaking, she\xe2\x80\x99s nearly twice as strong as she was eight years ago.\nMeanwhile, the three politicians who are explicitly considering challenging\nher \xe2\x80\x94 Sanders, Webb and O\xe2\x80\x99Malley \xe2\x80\x94 are nowhere near where Obama was in the\npolls at this point in the 2008 cycle.\n\n\n\nWhich isn\xe2\x80\x99t to say that, should they choose to compete in 2016, Sanders,\nWebb and O\xe2\x80\x99Malley would be poor candidates. Anything can happen in\npolitics; perhaps one of them will run to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s left and energize\nliberals who crave a less \xe2\x80\x9cinevitable\xe2\x80\x9d nominee.\n\n\n\nThe point is simply that by December 2006, Obama was already much, much\ncloser to becoming that candidate than any of this year\xe2\x80\x99s openly interested\nalternatives.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us back to a candidate who isn\xe2\x80\x99t openly interested yet:\nElizabeth Warren.\n\n\n\nSure, by December 2006, the real Obama was already out in the bullpen,\nwarming up for all to see. In September, he flew to Iowa for Tom Harkin\xe2\x80\x99s\nfamous steak fry. In October, he appeared on "Meet the Press" and told Tim\nRussert that \xe2\x80\x9cit is true that I have thought about [running for president]\nover the last several months.\xe2\x80\x9d And by mid-December, Obama insiders were\ntelling Newsweek that their man was "about 80 percent likely" to run.\n\n\n\nWarren, on the other hand, has insisted that she isn\xe2\x80\x99t running. But what if\nshe were to change her mind?\n\n\n\nMany liberals are urging Warren to step up because they believe her brand\nof economic populism could bedevil Clinton much in the way that Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\nanti-Iraq-War message bedeviled Clinton in 2008. And on paper, at least,\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re right: She\xe2\x80\x99s the only Democrat who even remotely resembles Obama\n(circa December 2006) in terms of fundraising skill, media appeal and\npolling prowess. Warren\xe2\x80\x99s latest book, published earlier this year, was a\nNew York Times best-seller. She was the Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s most in-demand\nsurrogate of 2014. She raised $4.59 million this cycle and disbursed nearly\n$600,000 to other Democrats. And she\xe2\x80\x99s polling as high as 17 percent in\nrecent surveys.\n\n\n\nThe bottom line is that Obama didn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9ccome out of nowhere\xe2\x80\x9d in 2008 \xe2\x80\x94 but in\n2016, Webb, Sanders and O\xe2\x80\x99Malley would have to. So far, only Warren is on\nthe map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sec. Clinton\'s upcoming appearances as reported online.
