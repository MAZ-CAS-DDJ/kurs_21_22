john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear friends, \nMy family and I are researching a family vacation for next summer. Several friends have taken their adult kids on Safari vacations to Africa. We are intrigued and are just beginning our research. If any of you have taken similar vacations in the past, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. I hope you are enjoying a great weekend. \n- Larry\n\nSent from my iPhone'
