She began her remarks with \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m baaaaaack!\xe2\x80\x9d and\nended them by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s not let another seven years go by.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s visit to retiring Sen. Tom Harkin\xe2\x80\x99s 37th and final steak fry was\nher first trip to Iowa since her demoralizing loss in the 2008 presidential\ncaucuses and one of her few partisan appearances since joining the Obama\nadministration as secretary of state. She acknowledged that she is thinking\nabout another run but urged her audience to focus squarely on the November\nmidterms, when control of the Senate is up for grabs and could be decided\nin Iowa.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn 50 days, every Iowa voter needs to know that from the president on down\nto local officials, we Democrats are for raising the minimum wage, for\nequal pay for equal work, for making college and technical training\naffordable, for growing the economy to benefit everyone,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd our opponents are not.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn a nod to the state\xe2\x80\x99s role hosting the first presidential caucuses,\nClinton added: \xe2\x80\x9cToo many people only get excited about presidential\ncampaigns. Look, I get excited about presidential campaigns, too. But . . .\nuse the enthusiasm that Iowa is so well known for every presidential year\nand channel that into these upcoming elections. Don\xe2\x80\x99t wake up the day after\nthe election and feel bad and wonder what more you could have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, drew an estimated\n10,000 Democrats and some 200 members of the press corps on a crisp,\nclear-skied Sunday to a sloping, grassy balloon field outside Indianola. As\nthe couple spoke from a stage adorned with bales of hay, pumpkins and a\ngiant American flag, the atmosphere was both festive and serious.\n\n\n\nThe Clintons paid tribute to Harkin, an unabashed prairie populist who\nthrough 40 years in elective office has become a legendary Democratic\nfigure in the state. And the senator cast the Clintons as progressive\nstandard-bearers, dubbing them \xe2\x80\x9cthe comeback couple in America,\xe2\x80\x9d a\nreference to Bill Clinton calling himself \xe2\x80\x9cthe comeback kid\xe2\x80\x9d in the 1992\ncampaign.\n\n\n\nHarkin also credited Hillary Clinton with the fight for universal health\ncare, saying that even though she was secretary of state during the passage\nof the Affordable Care Act, \xe2\x80\x9cher fingerprints are all over that\nlegislation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton has been under pressure to address growing concerns in her\nparty about income inequality, not only because of her ties to Wall Street\nand the business community but also because of the centrist economic\npolicies of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s administration. She did so here on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cToday, you know so well, American families are working harder than ever,\nbut maintaining a middle-class life feels like pushing a boulder uphill\nevery single day,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is not how it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be in\nAmerica.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton talked about her late mother, Dorothy Rodham, who was abandoned and\nmistreated by her parents but \xe2\x80\x9cchanneled her own struggles into a deep\nconviction that there is worth and dignity in every human being.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBoth Clintons urged Iowa Democrats to do all they could to elect Rep. Bruce\nBraley (D), who is locked in a tight race to replace Harkin, and referenced\nhis opponent, state Sen. Joni Ernst (R), though not by name. Hillary\nClinton mentioned Ernst\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to a federal minimum wage and noted\nthat women hold a majority of minimum-wage jobs, including those that rely\nmostly on tips, such as waiters, bartenders and hairstylists.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton was followed on stage by her husband, who delivered a more\nconversational speech that mixed partisan criticism of the Republicans with\na lengthy call for Democrats and Republicans to find more ways to work\ntogether.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have got to pull this country together to push this country forward,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe said.\n\n\n\nThe former president noted that too many politicians go to work with\nblinders over their eyes and their ears plugged up. \xe2\x80\x9cThink about America:\nWe are less racist, sexist and homophobic than we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we do have one continuing problem. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be around anyone\nwho disagrees with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFor Hillary Clinton, Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s steak-fry appearance was a chance to rebuild\nher ties to Iowa, where she finished a surprising third in the 2008\ncaucuses \xe2\x80\x94 behind Barack Obama and John Edwards. She left here feeling\nscorned, and her husband voiced criticism of the state\xe2\x80\x99s unique caucus\nsystem. To many Democratic activists, her campaign came across as aloof and\npresumptuous.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, Clinton tried to make a more personal connection in Iowa. She\nwas chummy with Harkin and some supporters as she cheerfully flipped steaks\nat a hot grill. Later, in her speech, she said she is eagerly awaiting her\nfirst grandchild \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m calling Chelsea every five minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d she quipped.\n\n\n\nIn his introduction, Harkin said: \xe2\x80\x9cOver these years, both Bill and Hillary\nhave become a part of our Iowa Democratic family. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been in our\nhomes, they\xe2\x80\x99ve broken bread with us, they\xe2\x80\x99ve become our friends and our\ninspiration.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s speech resonated with the Democrats who packed the\nballoon field, including some who backed Obama over her in 2008.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she\xe2\x80\x99s ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilyn Reese, an Obama supporter from Des\nMoines. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ready for her. She has the intelligence and already the moxie\nto make some headway.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGlenn Camp, a retired middle school principal who lives in Indianola,\ncalled her speech \xe2\x80\x9coutstanding.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing she could have done better was to announce that she was\ngoing to run, but I think she indicated that she is going to run,\xe2\x80\x9d Camp\nsaid.\n\n\n\nHarkin\xe2\x80\x99s steak fry was an excuse for a weekend of political activity and\nnetworking in anticipation of the 2016 campaign. The event drew people from\naround the country, including many strategists and operatives in the\nClinton orbit who form the backbone of the outside groups already set up to\naid her if she runs.\n\n\n\nThe steak fry began modestly back when Harkin was a young member of\nCongress. Tickets cost $2, and the first such event included a few dozen\nfriends and supporters of Harkin grilling their own steaks and sitting on\nbales of hay, talking politics.\n\n\n\nIn the intervening years, the steak fry became one of the signal political\nevents on the fall calendar for Democrats. Bill Clinton was making his\nfourth appearance as a featured speaker, the most of anyone who has\nappeared on the stage.\n\n\n\nHarkin was emotional in his remarks Sunday night \xe2\x80\x94 he thanked longtime\nstaffers, even calling one up on stage for a hug \xe2\x80\x94 but also resolute about\nthe political battles ahead. He called on his supporters to give\nRepublicans \xe2\x80\x9ca good whipping\xe2\x80\x9d in November.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince I got into politics, I always believed that an obligation of our\ngovernment is to make sure we leave the ladder down for others to climb,\ntoo,\xe2\x80\x9d Harkin said. \xe2\x80\x9cI may be retiring from the Senate, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not retiring\nfrom the fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*New York Times: \xe2\x80\x9cAt a Steak Fry in Iowa, the Clintons Sell Their Brand of\nSizzle\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/15/us/at-a-steak-fry-in-iowa-the-clintons-sell-their-brand-of-sizzle.html?_r=0>*\n\n\n\nBy Jonathan Martin and Amy Chozick\n\nSeptember 14, 2014\n\n\n\nINDIANOLA, Iowa \xe2\x80\x94 It was a preview of coming distractions.\n\n\n\nWhen Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton decided to return to the state where\nher presidential ambitions first came undone six years ago, the idea was\nthat they would remind Democratic activists about the importance of the\nmidterm elections and honor their host, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of\nIowa, who is retiring from Congress and held his final steak fry\nfund-raiser here Sunday. And that was what transpired, in part, on a\nsun-splashed day on a balloon field here, just south of Des Moines.\n\n\n\nBut as is often the case wherever Mr. Clinton goes, what amounted to the\nunofficial start of the next Iowa presidential caucuses was as much about\nthe Clinton who already served as president as the one who appears to have\ndesigns on the office.\n\n\n\nThe 37th Harkin Steak Fry began with an impromptu 15-minute\nquestion-and-answer session between Mr. Clinton and a few dozen reporters\nat what is traditionally only a brief photo-op with the V.I.P.s and the\nbeef on the grill.\n\n\n\nIt concluded with a 30-minute tour d\xe2\x80\x99horizon from the former president on\ntopics including Haiti, his soon-to-arrive grandchild, Senator Mitch\nMcConnell and the impact of the billionaires the Koch brothers on American\npolitics. In between, Mr. Harkin; his wife, Ruth; and Mrs. Clinton herself\ndid their best to focus attention on the other half of the once and perhaps\nfuture first couple.\n\n\n\nIn a speech that was her most overtly political since she left the State\nDepartment last year, Mrs. Clinton repeatedly hinted at her intentions. She\nlaced her remarks with all manner of pregnant references to the state that\nkicks off the presidential nominating process and veiled asides about her\nplans.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Iowa, I\xe2\x80\x99m back!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed upon taking the microphone,\nstretching out the \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cback\xe2\x80\x9d as she smiled in front of hay bales, an\nAmerican flag and a John Deere tractor.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to about 10,000 Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 many of whom wore stickers distributed\nby Ready for Hillary, an outside group that aims to build grass-roots\nenthusiasm for a potential Clinton candidacy \xe2\x80\x94 the former first lady all\nbut winked and raised her eyebrows.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, teasing the crowd. \xe2\x80\x9cI am thinking about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn motivating the audience to vote in November, Mrs. Clinton said, \xe2\x80\x9cToo\nmany people only get excited about presidential campaigns.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe added, after waiting a beat: \xe2\x80\x9cLook, I get excited about presidential\ncampaigns, too.\xe2\x80\x9d Just to make sure the crowd had not missed her point, she\nconcluded her first speech in Iowa since 2008 by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s not let\nanother seven years go by.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, Mrs. Clinton repeatedly said she was glad to be back in Iowa,\nbut the state holds bitter memories for her.\n\n\n\nIn the 2008 Democratic caucus, Mrs. Clinton came in third behind\nthen-Senator Barack Obama and John Edwards, a former senator from North\nCarolina. Her top campaign aides went on to criticize Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s caucus as\nundemocratic and unimportant in selecting presidents, and she had not been\nback since the late-night results came in on Jan. 3, 2008.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s first presidential campaign started here, with schmoozing at\nMr. Harkin\xe2\x80\x99s steak fry. At the event in 2007, the Clinton campaign, once\nseen as inevitable, saw firsthand the grass-roots support Mr. Obama had\ngarnered in the crucial early voting state.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt really does feel like just yesterday when I was here,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Clinton\ntold the crowd. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I recall, there was a young senator from Illinois\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton has devoted much of her time since leaving her post as\nPresident Obama\xe2\x80\x99s secretary of state to paid speeches and discussion of\nforeign policy to promote her memoir \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices.\xe2\x80\x9d But on Sunday, she\njumped aggressively back into domestic politics with a populist message\nthat praised the president, but also acknowledged that much work needed to\nbe done to stem the tide of rising inequality.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can build a growing economy of shared prosperity,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Clinton said.\n\n\n\nHer speech also touched on women\xe2\x80\x99s economic and reproductive rights \xe2\x80\x94\nhot-button issues in midterm elections that could be determined by female\nvoters.\n\n\n\nThe Harkins sought to make it clear that, while the Clintons were\nco-headliners, it was Mrs. Clinton who was to be the focal point. Mr.\nHarkin made sure to note that \xe2\x80\x9cthere are many more chapters to be written\nin the amazing life of Hillary Clinton.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet for all the effort to shine a\nrhetorical light on Mrs. Clinton, it was Mr. Clinton who seemed most happy\nto be back on the grand stage of presidential politics. As the Clintons and\nMr. Harkin stood a few feet away from the sizzling beef, Mr. Clinton\ninitially sought to deflect attention.\n\n\n\nAsked how he was feeling, Mr. Clinton, his arm around Mrs. Clinton,\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as I\xe2\x80\x99m still married to her, I\xe2\x80\x99m good.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAfter indulging a few questions, Mrs. Clinton drifted away, and the\ngrill-side session soon became the Tom and Bill Show. Mostly it was the\nlatter.\n\n\n\nIt was a vintage bit of Clinton garrulousness, and the former president had\nlittle appetite to cut it short, despite the increasingly urgent pleas from\naides behind him and Mr. Harkin. Mr. Clinton showered praise on Mr. Harkin,\nwho is retiring after 40 years in Congress and a failed presidential run\n(cut short by an up-and-coming Arkansas governor by the name of Clinton).\n\n\n\nBut as has been the case throughout his political career, once Mr. Clinton\ngot going, there was no stopping him.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton was long gone by the time her husband was dishing out some of\nhis favorite lines (the Founding Fathers were pragmatists, and the\nConstitution could be called \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s Make a Deal\xe2\x80\x9d), praising the Ready for\nHillary crew (he compared them to the Energizer Bunny) and assessing\nmidterm campaigns from Iowa to Arkansas.\n\n\n\nAbout the only topic Mr. Clinton did not broach was the one that drew many\nattendees and nearly all of the 200-plus credentialed reporters.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not be baited,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a knowing grin when he was asked\nwhether Mrs. Clinton would or would not disappoint all those activists\nworking for Ready for Hillary.\n\n\n\nThe event planners originally wanted Mrs. Clinton to follow her husband,\nbut protocol dictated that he speak last.\n\n\n\nThe former president recounted at some length his relationship and brief\nrivalry with Mr. Harkin.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Mr. Clinton used his remarks to decry dysfunction in\nWashington, and Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 inability to strike compromise.\n\n\n\nHe also lit into the billionaire conservative Kochs, who he said were\n\xe2\x80\x9crunning black-bag operations\xe2\x80\x9d in this year\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\n\n\n\nAfter the speeches, Mrs. Clinton shook hands, signed copies of her book and\nposed for selfies with supporters. The former president followed close\nbehind, also drawing a crowd of well-wishers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Associated Press: \xe2\x80\x9cClinton Embraces Iowa, Obama In Return To State\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://bigstory.ap.org/article/clinton-embraces-iowa-obama-return-state>*\n\n\n\nBy Thomas Beaumont\n\nSeptember 15, 2014, 3:36 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nINDIANOLA, Iowa (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Hillary Rodham Clinton\'s third-place finish in the\n2008 Iowa caucuses seemed but a fading memory when the former secretary of\nstate took the stage in front of roughly 10,000 loyal Democrats at outgoing\nIowa Sen. Tom Harkin\'s annual fall fundraiser south of Des Moines.\n\n\n\nThough Clinton is the favorite for the 2016 Democratic nomination should\nshe run, she advised the audience and the media on Sunday that her focus\nwas on the November midterm elections. Still, she left just enough hints\nthat a second bid for president could come, and that it might begin in Iowa.\n\n\n\n___\n\n\n\n1. IT\'S GREAT TO BE BACK IN IOWA\n\n\n\nAfter posing for photographs turning a grill full of red meat at Harkin\'s\nfarewell "steak fry," Clinton stopped to say hello to the remaining\nreporters, after many had left.\n\n\n\nAsked whether she was glad to be back in Iowa, where her 2008 campaign hit\na costly bump, she said: "It\'s great, it\'s fabulous to be back. I love\nIowa."\n\n\n\nAnd then she launched into an anecdote she often told in Iowa at the outset\nof her 2008 campaign. "I first came to Iowa when I was about, I can\'t\nremember, I was either 9 or 10," she said. "And we were with my dad, and we\nwent to Des Moines and we stayed at the Tall Corn Motel. I\'ve had a great\nimpression ever since."\n\n\n\n___\n\n\n\n1. SOME VOTERS ARE READY\n\n\n\nClinton insisted the point of speaking at Harkin\'s event was to boost 2014\ncandidates. But she dropped hints of a potential 2016 candidacy into her\nspeech to an audience packed with people wearing "Ready" stickers, symbols\nof the Ready for Hillary political action committee that is laying the\ngroundwork for a potential campaign.\n\n\n\nClinton described her personal concerns first as an expectant grandmother.\n"And then of course, there\'s that other thing," she said, fueling a slow\nbut steady rise in cheers from the crowd. "Well, it is true, I am thinking\nabout it, but for today that is not why I\'m here." The caveat prompted a\ncorresponding moan of disappointment.\n\n\n\n"Too many people only get excited about presidential campaigns," she said\nlater. "Look, I get excited about presidential campaigns too." she said.\nAgain, cheers erupted.\n\n\n\n___\n\n\n\n1. OLD ADVERSARIES, NOW FRIENDS\n\n\n\nClinton, who dueled Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination\nin 2008, joked about wondering whatever happened to that "young senator\nfrom Illinois."\n\n\n\n"It\'s been seven years and a lot has changed," she said. "We went from\nrivals to partners to friends, and sometimes we would even reminisce about\nold days."\n\n\n\nShe added, "Under President Obama\'s leadership, our country is on the road\nto recovery," before rattling off a list of improving economic indicators\nin Iowa, such as its unemployment rate of less than 5 percent.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, she cited Obama\'s signature domestic initiative, the 2010\nhealth care bill, which Republicans have aggressively opposed. "President\nObama and the rest of us will be quick to say we\'ve got a lot of work to\ndo," she said.\n\n\n\n___\n\n\n\n1. THE GENDER LINE\n\n\n\nClinton repeatedly noted during her 2008 campaign that she didn\'t want to\nbecome president simply because of her gender. But she pressed hard on\ngender issues Sunday.\n\n\n\nReferring to U.S. House candidate Staci Appel of Iowa, Clinton connected\nher pro-middle class message specifically to women. "Her experience with\nthe economic pressures facing Iowa families made her think, maybe we can do\nbetter," said Clinton, who in 2008 had bemoaned Iowa\'s failure to elect a\nwoman to Congress.\n\n\n\n"Iowans have a choice to make," she said, "a chance to elect a senator who\nknows that women should be able to make our own health care decisions." The\ncomment, a reference to Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Bruce Braley\'s\nsupport for abortion rights, prompted loud sustained cheers \xe2\x80\x94 first from\nwomen, then men \xe2\x80\x94 and a standing ovation.\n\n\n\n___\n\n\n\n1. BACK IN THE SCRUM\n\n\n\nAfter seven years off the campaign trail, Clinton\'s "I\'m back!" was not\njust a friendly hello to Iowa, but seemed to mark her return to retail\ncampaigning.\n\n\n\nAfter she and former President Clinton finished speaking, she bounded down\nthe stairs from the stage grinning, marching toward the throng of people\nstanding at the plastic partition that separated the stage and the crowd.\n\n\n\nBookended by Secret Service agents, she worked along the fence, shaking\nhands, posing for pictures and signing copies of her latest book and "Ready\nfor Hillary" signs.\n\n\n\nAsked by a reporter if she\'ll be back to Iowa again, she said, "Well, we\'ll\ndo what we can."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Politico: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton goes back to the state that haunts\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/hillary-clinton-iowa-2016-elections-110943.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Maggie Haberman\n\nSeptember 14, 2014, 8:05 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nINDIANOLA, Iowa \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cHello Iowa. I\xe2\x80\x99m baaaack.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThat was how Hillary Clinton greeted Iowans when she took the stage at the\nfinal Sen. Tom Harkin Steak Fry Sunday in her first step toward moving past\nher phobia of the state that helped shatter her 2008 presidential hopes.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about it,\xe2\x80\x9d she acknowledged to the crowd about\n2016. But that was as far as she went in her first public political speech\nin a year, since she stumped for Virgina Gov. Terry McAuliffe, her longtime\nfriend. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for today, that\xe2\x80\x99s not why I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton delivered a measured speech, focused primarily on the 2014\ncampaigns. It had no explicit message of her own but at the same time was\nunmistakably about her political future. She tried to address the question\non everyone\xe2\x80\x99s mind \xe2\x80\x94 whether she\xe2\x80\x99ll launch a second run for the White House\n\xe2\x80\x94 without being definitive or distracting completely from Harkin\xe2\x80\x99s big day.\nIt was Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s first retail politicking appearance since her summer book\ntour, during which she caught flack for gaffes about her wealth and for\nhaving difficulty pivoting from being a global figure to everyday domestic\nissues.\n\n\n\nShe seemed at-ease on the stage, and accomplished what she set out to do \xe2\x80\x94\ngetting her first trip to Iowa ahead of a likely campaign out of the way \xe2\x80\x94\nwhile also reminding people she\xe2\x80\x99s about to become a grandmother and that\nthat is likely to be her main focus through the rest of the year.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn just 50 days Iowans have a choice to make \xe2\x80\x94 a choice and a chance,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid, slamming Republicans and saying it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ca choice between the guardians\nof gridlock and the champions of shared opportunity and shared prosperity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton spoke ahead of her husband, a far superior speech giver who went\nlast as part of a tradition in which former presidents give the final\naddress. But Bill Clinton, clearly trying to be mindful of not\novershadowing his wife, nonetheless gave a speech that was less of a\nstemwinder than a potpourri of his thoughts on campaign finance issues and\nhis love of Harkin. He never mentioned the state rejecting his wife, but\nriffed on topics ranging from \xe2\x80\x9csexists\xe2\x80\x9d questioning a woman candidate in\nIowa to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell approving of what Clinton\ncalled Koch brothers\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cblack bag operations\xe2\x80\x9d in financing campaigns.\n\n\n\nNeither Clinton has a deep relationship with Iowa, despite their love of\nHarkin. Bill Clinton skipped the caucuses in his 1992 campaign, when Harkin\nwas running and didn\xe2\x80\x99t attend a steak fry until he was the party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee.\nHillary Clinton, never enamored with the type of exhaustive retail\ncampaigning Iowans demand and under fire among progressives over her vote\nauthorizing the Iraq war in 2002, knew she faced an uphill fight in the\nstate in 2008. She held it at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, assuming a loss wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\ndetrimental. But that was before then-Sen. Barack Obama caught fire, and\nher team scrambled to catch up.\n\n\n\nFor now, Clinton is well ahead in the polls in Iowa and people insist she\nhad a stronger base of support in 2008 than people give her credit for.\nStill, her allies are mindful of shoring up support. The super PAC Ready\nfor Hillary has been working there for a year in her absence.But potential\ncandidates like Maryland Gov. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley has made trips to the state,\nand Vice President Joe Biden has been here as well. Vermont Sen. Bernie\nSanders, who is considering a campaign, appeared in the state the night\nbefore the Steak Fry, drawing a crowd of over 100 people.\n\n\n\nHarkin, for his part, praised both Clintons \xe2\x80\x93 Bill Clinton on his economic\nrecord, and Hillary Clinton on her work as Secretary of State and in the\nSenate. The retiring senator credited her with playing a major role in\nhealth care reform dating back to the 1990s and, in a comment Republicans\nare likely to seize on later, said that her \xe2\x80\x9cfingerprints were all over\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe Affordable Care Act. And Harkin suggested there are more chapters to be\nwritten in the Hillary Clinton story.\n\n\n\nAs for Clinton, she insisted she was thrilled to be back in the Hawkeye\nState.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love Iowa!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed to more than 50 reporters from national\noutlets who squeezed along a barricade to watch her and Bill Clinton flip\nsteaks on a large grill with Harkin at a photo-op before the speaking\nprogram. Being in town for Harkin\xe2\x80\x99s final event was \xe2\x80\x9cjust so nostalgic,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe added.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s great. It\xe2\x80\x99s fabulous being back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clinton, who initially ignored\nreporters\xe2\x80\x99 questions before turning back and approaching the throng. She\nanswered questions and demurred on 2016, as her husband held his own\nseparate gaggle with reporters, expounding on everything from the Arkansas\nSenate race (\xe2\x80\x9cWe should win\xe2\x80\x9d) to baby names for his soon-to-arrive\ngrandchild (\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have a say\xe2\x80\x9d). He lingered well after his wife went\nback inside.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to be doing a lot,\xe2\x80\x9d Hillary Clinton told reporters about their\nplans for the fall elections. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve already started. There\xe2\x80\x99s so much\nat stake.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt was her first trip back to the state since she lost the 2008 caucuses to\nthen-Sen. Barack Obama, and the final Harkin event gave her cover to arrive\nand leave quickly so as not to overshadow him. If she runs for president\nagain \xe2\x80\x93 her speech was coy but few believe she\xe2\x80\x99ll against it \xe2\x80\x93 it remains\nto be seen whether she will campaign harder in a state that she kept at\narm\xe2\x80\x99s length, until a final scramble when it was clear a loss to Obama\nwould be devastating. (It was.)\n\n\n\nClinton began by talking about herself, acknowledging at the outset her\ncomplicated last outing in the state.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I recall there was a young senator from Illinois [in Iowa] at the same\ntime and I wonder whatever happened to him,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cWell it\xe2\x80\x99s been\nseven years and a lot has changed. Sen. Obama became President Obama and to\nmy great surprise he asked me to join his team \xe2\x80\xa6 and sometimes we would\neven reminisce a little about old days.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt was her first trip back to the state since she lost the 2008 caucuses to\nObama.

She talked about\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s health and mentioned equal pay and the federal minimum wage, an\nissue that has come up in Braley\xe2\x80\x99s race against Republican Joni Ernst.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome are even talking about eliminating it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a clear reference\nto Ernst.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you work hard and play by the rules, you deserve the \xe2\x80\xa6 same opportunity\nas anyone else,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clinton, who ticked off statistics about Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s\nstrengthened economy, including a mention of renewable energy.\n\n\n\nShe sounded standard Democratic stump themes on the economy, saying that\n\xe2\x80\x9cmaintaining a middle-class life feels like pushing a boulder up a hill\nevery single day.\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton remarked that she learned from her late mother\nthat there is \xe2\x80\x9cworth and dignity in every human being. That everyone\nmatters, everyone deserves not just a chance but a second chance and a\nthird chance to keep going and make something of themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd Clinton praised Obama on the economy, while acknowledging that\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresident Obama and the rest of us will be quick to\xe2\x80\x9d say there is more\nwork to be done.\n\n\n\nClinton ended her speech by talking about her global travel as secretary of\nstate, earlier mentioning she was just as likely to be around the world\neating yak meat as sitting at a steak fry \xe2\x80\x94 attempting to tie her work as a\nCabinet secretary to the lives of the people listening.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know we face a lot of \xe2\x80\xa6 challenges around the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clinton. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\neverything I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen convinces me that we can meet those challenges.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe added, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have the human and natural resources to do it, we have the\nknowledge to do it. \xe2\x80\xa6 We can build a growing economy of shared prosperity\nand a more equal sharing of responsibility for a secure world. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\nAmerica has always done, and it\xe2\x80\x99s time to summon that spirit again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhen she finished speaking, she gave signs that she had learned some\nlessons from last time, when she was criticized after the 2007 steak fry,\nher first, for skipping the rope line. This time, she and her husband\nworked the crowd for well over 20 minutes after the speeches ended at the\nBalloon Field here.\n\n\n\nHer supporters from the super PAC Ready for Hillary sought to boost her by\nbusing in college students, whose support eluded her last time around. They\nwaved signs, though in keeping with efforts not to crowd out Harkin\xe2\x80\x99s\nmoment, they did not break into chants of \xe2\x80\x9cRun Hillary Run!\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c2016!\xe2\x80\x9d as\nshe spoke.\n\n\n\nBut a number of people wore stickers reading, \xe2\x80\x9cReady.\xe2\x80\x9d Steak fry organizers\nsaid there were 10,000 meals sold \xe2\x80\x94 outpacing the number they had hoped\nwould turn out on the sun-dappled day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Bloomberg: \xe2\x80\x9cClinton Hints at 2016 Run as Super-PAC Packs Iowa Steak Fry\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-09-14/clinton-hints-at-2016-run-as-super-pac-packs-steak-fry#p1>*\n\n\n\nBy Jonathan Allen and John McCormick\n\nSeptember 15, 2014\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton, an unofficial candidate with a juggernaut shadow campaign,\nstepped into the light of a potential 2016 presidential race on a sunny\nSunday in Iowa, signaling with her appearance -- and repeated teases --\nthat she\xe2\x80\x99s ready to run.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s great to be back, but let\xe2\x80\x99s not let another seven years go by,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nClinton, who was last in Iowa after finishing third in the January 2008\nstate caucuses.\n\n\n\nClinton drew the loudest cheers yesterday at Senator Tom Harkin\xe2\x80\x99s 37th and\nfinal Steak Fry in Indianola, the most overt political event she\xe2\x80\x99s\nparticipated in since becoming President Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s secretary of state\nin 2009.\n\n\n\nAppearing on stage with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, she\nsaid Democrats must focus on the 2014 midterm election -- even as she\nflirted with her own presidential ambitions.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a few things on my mind these days,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, before pausing for\nsome audience applause.\n\n\n\nThe real tell is that Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s political machine was already humming in\nthe background, and many Iowa Democrats say she\xe2\x80\x99s a prohibitive favorite to\nwin both their caucuses and the party\xe2\x80\x99s nomination. That\xe2\x80\x99s a remarkable\nturnaround for a candidate who finished third in Iowa in 2008, one that\nreflects a change in her approach to campaigning and a tectonic shift in\nthe way Obama Democrats perceive her.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of people, myself included, have become disillusioned with a lot of\nwhat Obama\xe2\x80\x99s done versus what he ran on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Iowan Charlie Brinkerhoff,\n71, who backed Obama over Clinton in 2008. \xe2\x80\x9cThey think they might have made\na mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWith Iowa Democrats moving toward her, a network of pro-Clinton operatives\nspent the weekend organizing supporters and schmoozing with national\npolitical reporters in the bars, hotel lobbies and steak joints of Des\nMoines. In 2008, Obama out-hustled Clinton, building a grassroots\norganization that carried him to victory. Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s Clinton who has the\norganizational jump on the Democratic field, without having formed a\ncampaign.\n\n\n\nReady for Hillary, a pro-Clinton super-political action committee,\norganized college students from across Iowa, supplying tickets and\nT-shirts, and then bused them to the steak fry. Even though Clinton says\nshe won\xe2\x80\x99t announce whether she\xe2\x80\x99s running until next year, Ready for Hillary\nhas collected contributions from almost 800 Iowans, according to Seth\nBringman, its communications director.\n\n\n\nThe Iowa caucuses have never been a field of dreams for the Clintons. In\ntheir previous campaigns, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton have skipped the\nstate, been encouraged to skip the state and most recently recorded the\nthird-place finish.\n\n\n\nIf all goes well for Hillary Clinton, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to look back at\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s steak fry as a turning point.\n\n\n\nOrganizers said 10,000 meals were served and about 6,200 people purchased\ntickets, the biggest attendance since 2007, when Clinton and Obama, then\nthe junior senators from New York and Illinois, shared the stage with other\nprospective 2008 presidential candidates.\n\n\n\nMaryland Governor Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, who has signaled interest in a 2016 bid,\nappeared at the steak fry in 2012. Vice President Joe Biden, who will be in\nIowa later next week, headlined the event a year ago.\n\n\n\nIt was the first of several political appearances the Clintons will be\nmaking in the next seven weeks ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n\n\nMore than half of registered Iowa Democratic (0575837D:US) voters -- 53\npercent -- say they\xe2\x80\x99d vote for her in 2016, according to a CNN/ORC\nInternational poll released Sept. 12. She dominates others in the potential\nfield, including Biden, whose support was 15 percent, U.S. Senator\nElizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 7 percent and independent U.S. Senator\nBernie Sanders of Vermont at 5 percent.\n\n\n\nSanders held three town halls in Iowa this weekend while drawing little if\nany attention away from Clinton. Some Democrats said they worry that\nSanders might run as a third-party candidate and drain votes from the\nDemocratic nominee. Sanders, during an appearance yesterday on NBC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMeet\nthe Press,\xe2\x80\x9d said he could run as a Democrat or independent.\n\n\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprofound anger at both political parties\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmore and more\npeople are becoming independent,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nAlthough Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s more than six-year absence may have left some Iowa\nDemocrats feeling jilted, prominent Iowa Democrats say all could be\nforgiven should she campaign in the state in 2015.\n\n\n\nIowa Visits\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople understand that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come here in a political context when\nshe was the secretary of state,\xe2\x80\x9d said Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who\nwas one of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s earliest top supporters in the state in 2007. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a\ncumulative thing. She and her husband have spent their time in Iowa.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ve also had their share of hesitancy over the years about campaigning\nin the quirky and unpredictable Iowa caucuses.\n\n\n\nIn 1992, Bill Clinton basically skipped the caucus campaign, ceding Iowa to\nHarkin, who was also running for the Democratic nomination that year. In\n1996, as the incumbent president, Clinton had no competition and didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nhave to build a grassroots organization in the state.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, Clinton arrived without much of an existing network and Obama\nout-worked and out-organized her. He won the caucuses and knocked the\nfront-runner off her stride.\n\n\n\nIn retrospect, Clinton should have taken the advice of her then-campaign\nmanager, Mike Henry, who wrote a May 2007 memo that later leaked to the\nmedia suggesting that she skip Iowa and spend her campaign money elsewhere.\n\n\n\nOld Advice\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she walks away from Iowa she will devalue Iowa \xe2\x80\x94 our consistently\nweakest state,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. Henry\xe2\x80\x99s advice was never accepted and the Clinton\ncampaign publicly repudiated it.\n\n\n\nGordon Fischer, a former chairman of the Democratic Party of Iowa\n(0178366D:US) who endorsed Obama in 2007, said he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see a scenario\nwhere someone could overtake Clinton.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure there would be enough time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to\nimagine because she is so well known and well respected by Iowa Democrats\nand will have so much money.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThat said, Fischer predicts retail campaigning will be awkward for Clinton\nbecause she\xe2\x80\x99s even more of a celebrity than in 2007 and 2008.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s tough to walk into a diner or the basement of a church and have small\ngroup meetings with her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut as challenges go, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty\ngood one to have.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Des Moines Register: \xe2\x80\x9c\'Ready for Hillary\' supporters busy at Harkin Steak\nFry\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-politics-insider/2014/09/14/harkin-steak-fry-ready-for-hillary-supporters/15628501/>*\n\n\n\nBy William Petroski\n\nSeptember 14, 2014, 1:46 p.m. CDT\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\'s supporters for president were out in force Sunday at the\nHarkin Steak Fry in Indianola, greeting people as soon as they arrived.\n\n\n\nReady for Hillary volunteers Clarke Conner and Aya Kantorovich, both of\nWashington, D.C., were handing out bumper stickers as prospective 2016 Iowa\ncaucus goers pulled into the parking area.\n\n\n\nSigns boosting her candidacy were also on display, and lots of people\nattending the event were wearing "READY" t-shirts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Time: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton Flips a Steak in Iowa\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://time.com/3373772/hillary-clinton-iowa-steak-fry/>*\n\n\n\nBy Jay Newton-Small\n\nSeptember 14, 2014\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] As speculation about 2016 reaches fever pitch, former Secretary\nof State teases crowd: "Well it is true, I am thinking about it"\n\n\n\nSitting under one of three huge white tents set up in a hot-air balloon\nfield outside of Indianola, Iowa, Bethany Moriarty was digging into a plate\nof steak. The attraction of a \xe2\x80\x9csteak fry\xe2\x80\x9d should ostensibly be the meat,\nbut Moriarty, 30, who has \xe2\x80\x9cReady for Hillary\xe2\x80\x9d buttons festooned across her\nchest, is hopping with excitement to see former Secretary of State Hillary\nClinton.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m by far the most political person of my family, so I kinda dragged them\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, gesturing across the table to her mother, Rosemary, 65,\nand her sister, Amanda, 35.\n\n\n\nLike many other of the 7,000 Iowans who\xe2\x80\x99ve gathered for Iowa Senator Tom\nHarkin\xe2\x80\x99s 37th annual Steak Fry, a Democratic fundraiser that has become\nknown as a presidential launchpad, their main topic of conversation is\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s potential candidacy in 2016. \xe2\x80\x9cI caucused for Barack Obama in\n2008,\xe2\x80\x9d Bethany says. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot was the hype and the hope we felt behind him\nand I still feel it. But I feel he\xe2\x80\x99s been pushed aside.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAll three came to the Steak Fry this year to see Clinton speak on her first\ntrip back to Iowa since her 2008 caucus loss. Bethany says she\xe2\x80\x99ll caucus\nfor Clinton in 2016, if she runs. But Rosemary is dubious. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think\nAmerica is ready,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of people who won\xe2\x80\x99t vote for\nher because she\xe2\x80\x99s a woman. Like Barack Obama, the first African American,\nwhen he got elected, but Congress wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAmanda, twirling her fork pensively in her potato salad, chimes in: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if\nyou think that, than there are 100,000 people who think it,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you say that it becomes true,\xe2\x80\x9d Bethany counters. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to\nbelieve and work to make that not true.\xe2\x80\x9d Her mother and sister shrug,\nclearly not moved to action.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy is still a figment of Bethany\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 and most of the\nnational media\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 imagination. But that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped widespread\nspeculation that Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the Harkin event represents the\nunofficial kickoff of her 2016 run. Her shadow campaign, \xe2\x80\x9cReady for\nHillary,\xe2\x80\x9d has parked a bus emblazoned with its logo outside the Steak Fry\nand volunteers are waiting five deep to sign up.\n\n\n\nThe Steak Fry has a carnival-like atmosphere. Iowans in droves wear\nT-shirts colored for their favorite state and local candidates. By far the\nmost T-shirts are light blue with a simply stated, \xe2\x80\x9cReady\xe2\x80\x9d on them \xe2\x80\x94\nshorthand for \xe2\x80\x9cReady for Hillary.\xe2\x80\x9d Attendees carry coolers of beer and\nlemonade and lay out blankets on the slightly damp ground. They sing along\nto Bruce Springsteen\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBorn in the U.S.A.,\xe2\x80\x9d as they wait for the show to\nbegin.\n\n\n\nAs is his prerogative on his big day, Harkin is keeping his own schedule.\nHe is retiring and this will be his final Steak Fry. The event is a far cry\nfrom the 52 people who attended the first one in 1972. The largest year\nyet, 2007, saw more than 10,000 people arrive to watch Clinton and then\nrivals Barack Obama and John Edwards. This year, Harkin and the Clintons\narrive from a morning event in Des Moines with 450 Harkin donors 20 minutes\nafter the speaking schedule was due to begin. But they take their time,\neating lunch, as Harkin always does, before greeting the press and flipping\nthe traditional steak for the assembled cameras. More than 200 reporters\nfrom around the world are present to witness potential history.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you running?\xe2\x80\x9d reporters repeatedly shout at Hillary. She demurs. She\neven pretends not to notice when, the event having finally started down the\nhill, a speaker starts asking the crowd: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you fired up? Are you ready\nto go? Are you ready for Hillary? ARE YOU READY FOR HILLARY?\xe2\x80\x9d he screams as\nthe crowd roars.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ready, Hillary?\xe2\x80\x9d a reporter yells. She ignores all this and chats\naway with Harkin and his wife Ruth. Her husband can be heard saying: \xe2\x80\x9cAs\nlong as I\xe2\x80\x99m still married to her, I\xe2\x80\x99m doing good.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAfter Harkin introduces the Clintons as the \xe2\x80\x9ccomeback couple,\xe2\x80\x9d Hillary\ntakes the stage to chants of her name. \xe2\x80\x9cWow!\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cHello Iowa. I\xe2\x80\x99m\nbaaaaack!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a line made famous by the movie Independence Day.\n\n\n\nAs the crowd cheers and whistles, Clinton says she has a lot to look\nforward to these days. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst, Bill and I are on constant grandchild watch\n\xe2\x80\xa6 So don\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if we suddenly go sprinting off the stage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then of course there\xe2\x80\x99s that other thing,\xe2\x80\x9d she adds, to a standing\novation. \xe2\x80\x9cWell it is true, I am thinking about it. But for today, that is\nnot why I\xe2\x80\x99m here,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\n\n\n\nThe crowd expresses disapproval at this. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m here for the steak!\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsays, which gets them cheering again. \xe2\x80\x9cFor years I was more likely to be\neating yak meat in Mongolia, and enjoying it, but thinking a lot of being\nback home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s all red meat for the \xe2\x80\x9cReady for Hillary\xe2\x80\x9d crowd, of course. But others\nsay her election to the presidency isn\xe2\x80\x99t a sure thing. Carter Bell, 20,\npresident of the University of Iowa Democrats, says she likes what she\xe2\x80\x99s\nhearing from Clinton, but she\xe2\x80\x99s keeping an open mind for the 2016 caucuses.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like [Vice President] Joe Biden a lot too. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve met [Maryland\nGovernor] Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley a bunch of times as he\xe2\x80\x99s been out here a lot,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe says. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I love Elizabeth Warren, she\xe2\x80\x99s great, but she may not run.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBell says Clinton will have to do some work to earn her support.\n\n\n\nSitting on a beach chair nearby, Judy Keller, 66, Des Moines\nconsumer-affairs representative, is convinced. She says she regrets\nsupporting John Edwards in 2008. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that she\xe2\x80\x99d have a chance in\n\xe2\x80\x9908,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9c I thought a man would win. But now it\xe2\x80\x99s time. It\xe2\x80\x99s time\nfor a woman. I won\xe2\x80\x99t make the same mistake twice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Wall Street Journal: \xe2\x80\x9cAs Hillary Clinton Returns to Iowa, a Debate Stirs\nin Her Party\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://online.wsj.com/articles/as-hillary-clinton-returns-to-iowa-a-debate-stirs-in-her-party-1410738217>*\n\n\n\nBy Peter Nicholas and Elizabeth  Williamson\n\nSeptember 14, 2014, 7:43 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] Whether to Use Contest to Hash Out Policy Differences\xe2\x80\x94or to\nUnite Against Republicans\n\n\n\nINDIANOLA, Iowa\xe2\x80\x94With a teasing statement, "It\'s true I\'m thinking about\nit," Hillary Clinton marked the unofficial start to the 2016 campaign\nSunday with the clearest message to date that, while not yet in the race,\nshe will try once more to win the presidency.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton\'s appearance at the Harkin Steak Fry, an annual party\nfundraiser hosted by longtime Sen. Tom Harkin (D., Iowa), marked her first\nvisit to Iowa since finishing third in the state\'s caucuses nearly seven\nyears ago\xe2\x80\x94and showed that the next presidential race has, in essence,\nbegun. Her opening words drew a laugh: "Hello, Iowa! I\'m baaack."\n\n\n\nBut her appearance also fanned a debate among Democrats in Iowa over\nwhether they should use their first-in-the-nation nominating contest\xe2\x80\x94and\nthe rapt attention that draws from candidates\xe2\x80\x94to hash out differences on\nmajor issues, or unite behind Mrs. Clinton to give her a running start\nagainst Republicans. Some Iowans said that on several issues, they want to\npush party policy to the left of what they expect to be Mrs. Clinton\'s\nstances.\n\n\n\nThe former first lady, senator and secretary of state made no announcement\nabout her political ambitions but acknowledged her unusual status as a\nnot-yet-candidate who is widely expected to enter, and dominate, the\nDemocratic field.\n\n\n\n"I\'ve got a few things on my mind these days," Mrs. Clinton noted to about\n7,000 Democrats, as well as 200 reporters, on hand for the Harkin Steak\nFry, in remarks carried live on cable television.\n\n\n\nWhat might those be? She mentioned her daughter Chelsea\'s pregnancy: "Bill\nand I are on constant grandchild watch," she said. She added: "And then\nthere\'s that other thing."\n\n\n\nThe other thing, of course, is the White House. Mrs. Clinton in 2008 lost\nthe party nomination to then-Sen. Barack Obama in a prolonged primary fight\nthat bitterly divided the party.\n\n\n\nTrying to build a connection with Iowa Democrats, Mrs. Clinton used her\ntime at the podium Sunday to praise Mr. Harkin, a party icon in the state,\nand Democratic candidate slate for the fall.\n\n\n\nShe included a few partisan jabs\xe2\x80\x94blaming Republicans for gridlock in\nWashington\xe2\x80\x94and offered a subtle reminder of her husband\'s time in the White\nHouse.\n\n\n\nEchoing Bill Clinton\'s language from the early 1990s, Mrs. Clinton said the\n"basic bargain of America" is that "if you work hard, you play by the\nrules, you deserve the opportunity, the same opportunity as everyone else,\nto build a good life for yourself and your family."\n\n\n\nShe closed her speech with another hint at her plans: "It\'s really great to\nbe back. Let\'s not let another seven years go by."\n\n\n\nIf Mrs. Clinton runs this time, she would be the overwhelming favorite to\nwin the nomination, polls show. A recent CNN survey showed that 53% of\nIowa\'s registered Democrats favored her for the nomination. Vice President\nJoe Biden was a distant second, at 15%.\n\n\n\nStill, other Democrats are giving signals that they may not step aside, and\nmany voters in Iowa say they would like the nominating process to produce a\ndebate over Democratic policy, rather than a coronation.\n\n\n\nMr. Biden, who appeared at the Harkin Steak Fry last year, will speak at an\nevent in Iowa on Wednesday aimed at promoting social justice. Democratic\nGov. Martin O\'Malley of Maryland has visited the state three times and\nrecently sent about a dozen campaign aides to help in the midterm\nelections\xe2\x80\x94the sort of gesture that earns goodwill among party activists.\n\n\n\nIn a bit of counterprogramming, liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an\nindependent who aligns with Democrats in the Senate, was also in Iowa over\nthe weekend for appearances at three town meetings.\n\n\n\n"Regardless of how people may feel about Hillary Clinton or anyone else,\nthey understand it\'s not in the best interests of this country\xe2\x80\xa6when we\nanoint our candidate," Mr. Sanders said in an interview. "There should be\ndebate."\n\n\n\nDemocrats seem divided about whether they want one.\n\n\n\n"I would like to see the Democrats get behind Hillary rather than spreading\ntheir energy out," said Joan Hennigan of Eldridge, as she arrived for a\nfootball game on the University of Iowa campus in Iowa City on Saturday.\n"One big energy behind Hillary. If Iowa can get behind Hillary, that would\nbenefit her very much."\n\n\n\nOthers insist the party must define itself when it comes to pressing\nissues: the extremist threat in the Middle East, job creation, stagnant\nwages, health-care costs and student-loan debt, among them.\n\n\n\nCharles Crawley of Cedar Rapids said he is leaning toward Mrs. Clinton but\nhopes to hear answers from her on a trio of issues of great importance to\nhim: climate change, income inequality and the Middle East turmoil.\n\n\n\nHe described himself as "not completely convinced" that the former first\nlady, senator and secretary of state is his choice and that the door\nremains "open," depending on the substantive positions she takes.\n\n\n\nAs she walked in the steak fry Sunday, Teresa Lawler, a 52-year-old\nteacher, said that Democrats need to return to their "liberal roots,"\nadding that she would welcome a campaign debate between Mrs. Clinton and\nSen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has been a fierce critic of\nWall Street.\n\n\n\nIf Mrs. Clinton moved left on various economic issues as a result of a\nchallenge from Ms. Warren, Ms. Lawler said she would welcome that\ndevelopment.\n\n\n\n"I would like to see her be a little more left," she added. Ms. Warren has\nsaid she isn\'t running.\n\n\n\nThat scenario worries another Clinton supporter, 72-year-old Russ Lett.\nWearing a "Hillary Fan Club" T-shirt to the steak fry, Mr. Lett said the\nsavviest course for Democrats is to enable Mrs. Clinton to avoid the sorts\nof fights that would pull her to the left.\n\n\n\n"If she\'s too far to the left, she\'s not going to be electable in the\nfall," he said.\n\n\n\nThe debate mirrors one that Republicans had during and after the 2012\npresidential campaign, in which the party\'s eventual nominee, Mitt Romney,\ntacked to the right to win the nomination. Statements he made in various\nGOP debates, including his call for "self-deportation" by illegal\nimmigrants, were widely seen as limiting his appeal in the general election.\n\n\n\nRepublican Party leaders have since taken steps to curb the number of\ndebates in the run-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\n\nIowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican, praised that move. In an interview\nSaturday as he greeted voters before the football game, he said: "I\'ve\nalways focused on winning the general election\xe2\x80\x94not cutting up other\nRepublicans," he said. "I believe in Ronald Reagan\'s 11th commandment:\nSpeak no ill of other Republicans."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*MSNBC: \xe2\x80\x9cHIllary Clinton in Iowa: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m ba-ack!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-returns-iowa-im-ba-ack>*\n\n\n\nBy Alex Seitz-Wald\n\nSeptember 14, 2014, 8:10 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nINDIANOLA, IOWA \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ba-ack!\xe2\x80\x9d With those words, Hillary Clinton announced\nSunday her return to Iowa, the state that derailed her last presidential\nrun and will be critical to a second one, if she decides to take the\nplunge. And almost all of the 7,000 die-hard Democrats here at the Iowa\nSteak Fry \xe2\x80\x94 2,000 more than expected \xe2\x80\x94 seemed ready to welcome her.\n\n\n\nMany came for Tom Harkin, the venerated senator who has organized the Steak\nFry for the past 37 years and is retiring this year. But even Harkin, who\ngot choked up while thanking his supporters, acknowledged why this year\xe2\x80\x99s\nevent was the largest since 2007. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd to think you all came here to see\nme. Ah, who am I kidding\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d he joked before introducing Bill and Hillary\nClinton.\n\n\n\nStepping up to the stage amid chants of \xe2\x80\x9cHillary! Hillary!,\xe2\x80\x9d the former\nsecretary of state got 2016 right out of the way.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a few things on my mind these days,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to whoops of\nanticipation. First, there\xe2\x80\x99s the grandchild that is due any day, she said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s that other thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe crowd, fired up and hoping for some big news, grew anxious. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\ntrue, I am thinking about it. But that is not why I\xe2\x80\x99m here today,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\nto audible disappointment.  She then got down to the task at hand and spent\nthe bulk of her speech praising Iowa, it\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic candidates, and\nHarkin.\n\n\n\nThe Iowa senator heaped praise on the Clintons in turn, vouching for them\n\xe2\x80\x9ca part of our Iowa Democratic family\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9ccomeback couple,\xe2\x80\x9d a\nreference to Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 1992 presidential campaign \xe2\x80\x94 and perhaps\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s return to the state where she came in an embarrassing third place\nin 2008.\n\n\n\nEven on his own special day, the senator couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but hint at Hillary\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s unkown future. Noting that her book, \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices,\xe2\x80\x9d has 25\nchapters, Harkin continued there are \xe2\x80\x9cmany more chapters to be written.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd he joked that the former president has recently been so overshadowed by\nhis wife that he was little more than the \xe2\x80\x9cman who accompanied Hillary back\nto Iowa.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNo one expected her to spend much time talking about a potential\npresidential bid, let alone announce one. But her reference to the\nfuture-that-shall-not-be-named was a perfect encapsulation of the big\nquestion hanging over the event, which attracted unusually large crowds and\nhundreds of reporters. Despite the coy allusions, the question was never\naddressed outright.\n\n\n\nStill, there were hints about Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s difficult past everywhere in the\nstate for those inclined to look. Clinton, who jokingly wondered about what\nhappened to a young senator named Barack Obama with whom she shared the\nstage at the 2007 Steak Fry, at one point said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you get knocked down,\nget right back up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRuth Harkin, Tom\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and a pioneering female politician in her own\nright, said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s great to look back, but don\xe2\x80\x99t stare.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut mostly, Clinton lauded Harkin and encouraged Iowans to vote down the\nparty line: Bruce Braley for Senate, Jack Hatch for governor, and the rest\nof the Democratic ticket.\n\n\n\nAfterwards, she worked a lengthy rope line, shaking hands, taking selfies,\nand signing books \xe2\x80\x94 a rare sight for a women who has lived largely\ninsulated by Secret Service and private airplanes since becoming secretary\nof state in 2009.\n\n\n\nThanks to the work of Ready for Hillary, the super PAC formed early last\nyear to boost the former secretary of state, it was easy to mistake the\nevent for a Clinton campaign rally.\n\n\n\nThe group bused in students from eight colleges and universities, had 60\nvolunteers handing out bumper stickers \xe2\x80\x94 many of which were quickly affixed\nto cars \xe2\x80\x94 and spent Saturday planting hundreds of yard signs around the\nNational Balloon fields were the event was held. Organizers even hung giant\nsigns from cherry pickers rented by the group. Every other attendee seemed\nto be wearing one of the group\xe2\x80\x99s t-shirts.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust like Energizer Bunnies. They\xe2\x80\x99re everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill Clinton said\napprovingly when asked at the event about the group\xe2\x80\x99s efforts.\n\n\n\nEager to respect Harkin, most of the group\xe2\x80\x99s signs said only \xe2\x80\x9cReady,\xe2\x80\x9d while\nothers thanked \xe2\x80\x9cTom\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 but it was clear who the signs were meant to support.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, while difficult, it was not impossible to find people who\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t quite ready yet to sign on dotted line for Clinton. Caucus night is\nstill more than a year away, after all.\n\n\n\nBert Stole, a retiree from Atalissa, was a holding an \xe2\x80\x9cElizabeth Warren for\nPresident\xe2\x80\x9d sign, which was passed out by the super PAC Ready for Warren. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nwould like to see a run off. I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel there should be a coronation,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there is a runoff, and if Hilary wins, which probably she will, I\nthink she will be a better candidate. The worst strategy, probably the\nreason why she lost to Obama, was that she walked in thinking that she\nowned the nomination. And that turned a lot of people off.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nErica Sagrans, Ready for Warren\xe2\x80\x99s founder, stood by the group\xe2\x80\x99s small table\n\xe2\x80\x94 a far cry from Ready for Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s massive infrastructure. She said her\ngroup handed out a few hundred signs and signed up about \xe2\x80\x9chalf that\xe2\x80\x9d on\ntheir mailing list.\n\n\n\nPeople just like Warren, Sagrans said, even if they like other candidates\nor are not sure if Warren should run. \xe2\x80\x9cIn Iowa, the Caucus process isn\xe2\x80\x99t as\nrelevant if there\xe2\x80\x99s only one candidate. People here take that process\nreally seriously, and it\xe2\x80\x99s still very early, so people still want to have\nthat process and debate before they decide anything,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nClinton is hugely popular in the state, and much stronger than she was in\n2008, as evidenced by the sea of Clinton supporters here Sunday and a\nrecent CNN/ORC poll, which showed that more than 50% of Iowa Democrats\nsupport her.\n\n\n\nAt the close of her remarks, Clinton concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s great to be back,\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s not let another seven years go by.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe may be back very soon indeed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*CBS News: \xe2\x80\x9cHas Hillary Clinton\'s road to Iowa redemption begun?\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/has-hillary-clintons-road-to-iowa-redemption-begun/>*\n\n\n\nBy Rebecca Kaplan\n\nSeptember 15, 2014, 5:35 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nIf Hillary Clinton decides a few months from now that she does, indeed,\nwant another shot at the White House, her speech to 6,000 Democrats at the\nannual Harkin Steak Fry Sunday will be revisited as the unofficial kickoff\nto her 2016 campaign.\n\n\n\nWhether it was a successful kickoff will be determined by how the\nDemocratic field shapes up - and just how big a challenge the former first\nlady and secretary of state will face in the state that forever changed the\ncourse of her 2008 campaign.\n\n\n\nAt the final of 37 steak fry fundraisers held by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa,\nwho is retiring, Clinton checked many of the\npotential-presidential-candidate boxes as she took the stage and announced,\n"I\'m baaaaack!"\n\n\n\nShe had a nod to the grandchild watch underway for daughter Chelsea, who is\nexpecting a baby, a coy answer on whether she is running in 2016 ("I\'m here\nfor the steak," Clinton said), and effusive praise for both Harkin and the\nhandful of statewide and national Democratic candidates gathered at the\nevent.\n\n\n\n"If you were a candidate trying to reenter the state where you had had such\na bumpy ride last time there\'s no better way to do it than this," CBS News\nPolitical Director John Dickerson said after her speech. "She comes to pay\ntribute to an icon of the Democratic Party, to cherish its ideals in a\npublic way, while maintaining the patina of not running."\n\n\n\nThe X factor is just how steep a challenge Clinton will face if she runs\nagain.\n\n\n\nIn 2008, Iowa was the state that demolished her front-runner status,\ndelivering a decisive win to then-Sen. Barack Obama that propelled him to\nthe Democratic nomination, and eventually, the White House.\n\n\n\nClinton, who came in third place behind Mr. Obama and John Edwards,\nstruggled to win over voters in a state that cherishes its face time with\ncandidates. She often faced accusations of being in a bubble voters could\nnot penetrate, of being unexcited about mastering the complicated art of\nwinning an Iowa caucus - which takes extensive ground organization - and\nlacking a rationale for her candidacy.\n\n\n\nBut Mr. Obama also challenged her by presenting a fresh and compelling\nalternative, and a superior ground game to boot.\n\n\n\n"It depends on whether she really needs to be redeemed," Dickerson said.\n"She has no challenger, really. If Maryland Gov. Martin O\'Malley and\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders run they\'re not going to provide her with the\nkind of close contest that\'s going to require her to need to have redeemed\nherself."\n\n\n\nRight now, there is no other potential candidate that presents a challenge\nlike Mr. Obama did. A CNN/Opinion Research poll released last week showed\nClinton with a commanding 38 point lead in the 2016 Iowa caucuses, securing\n53 percent support to 15 percent for Vice President Joe Biden, who is\nvisiting Iowa on Wednesday. National polls similarly show Clinton all but\nrunning away with the Democratic nomination.\n\n\n\nTimothy Hagle, a political science professor at the University of Iowa said\nthat Clinton "does need to be aware" of her deficiencies as a campaigner,\nbut "if she doesn\'t have any serious competition, then not so much and\nthat\'s the question at this point."\n\n\n\n Can Hillary Clinton and Obama still connect to everyday Americans?\n\n\n\nClinton certainly had an eye toward the task of reintroducing herself to\nvoters Sunday with the personal anecdotes about becoming a grandmother and\nrecalling her experience growing up in a middle-class family outside of\nChicago. And she attempted to plant herself firmly in Harkin\'s legacy,\nhailing what she said were tireless efforts to improve the lives of those\naround him.\n\n\n\nHarkin, for his part, irreversibly tied Clinton to the Affordable Care Act\nby saying that the work she did as a senator means her "fingerprints are\nall over that legislation." And Clinton did not attempt to distance herself\nfrom Mr. Obama, who\'s approval numbers have lagged for months, praising his\nwork during four years in office.\n\n\n\n"In this type of event she\'s probably not going to want to distance herself\ntoo much from President Obama even if the lines regarding him aren\'t\ngetting the greatest amount of applause," Hagle said.\n\n\n\nIt\'s a tricky road to navigate: Mr. Obama\'s approval rating has sunk in\nIowa to just 38 percent, according to a recent Gallup poll.\n\n\n\nClinton fully embraced the Democrats\' midterm platform, detailing her\nsupport for the minimum wage and equal pay for women, for instance, but she\nsaid little beyond the basics of the party platform that might show why she\nwould be best to lead the nation going forward.\n\n\n\nWill Hillary Clinton\'s awkward answers about wealth hurt her?\n\n\n\nDennis Goldford, a political scientist at Drake University in Iowa, said\nthat it "helped" that Clinton talked about an agenda, even if it was\nHarkin\'s agenda. But, he cautioned, "she still is in the position so far\nthat she was in \'07 and \'08 - she\'s got a resume but not a rationale."\n\n\n\n"Hillary in \'07 and \'08 never gave people a convincing reason why she\nshould be the nominee, let alone president," he added. "That\'s always a\nrecipe for political disaster."\n\n\n\nBut a lack of a real agenda will pose less of a problem in the 2016 Iowa\ncaucuses if no other candidate presents a serious challenge or offers a\ncompelling fresh face to entice voters the way Mr. Obama did in 2008.\n\n\n\nThat\'s why many people doubt that Biden, whose distant fifth place finish\nin Iowa in 2008 marked the end of his campaign and who is considering 2016\nrun himself, presents much of a challenge.\n\n\n\n"Anyone you talk to in Democratic politics in Iowa says there\'s not room"\nfor Biden, Dickerson said.\n\n\n\n"Clearly [Clinton] is of the past, in a sense, but because she\'s the first\nwoman or would be the first woman nominee of a major party that is future,\nthat sort of speaks to the future in a way. That\'s obviously never happened\nbefore and Joe Biden has nothing like that going for him. He\'s the past."\n\n\n\nGoldford said that "right now, there\'s room for everybody," and argued that\nClinton will need an opponent to sharpen her campaign for the general\nelection.\n\n\n\n"But I don\'t know that Biden would have a lot of support here," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*BuzzFeed: \xe2\x80\x9cHarkin: Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Fingerprints Are All Over\xe2\x80\x99\nObamacare\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/harkin-hillary-clintons-fingerprints-are-all-over-obamacare#2wk3999>*\n\n\n\nBy Andrew Kaczynski\n\nSeptember 14, 2014, 6:02 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] \xe2\x80\x9cI want you all to know that her fingerprints are all over that\nlegislation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIowa Democratic Sen.

Tom Harkin (D) said Sunday he expects Hillary Clinton to face a\nprimary challenge if she runs for president, but it will be \xe2\x80\x9ctough\xe2\x80\x9d for\nanother candidate to gain traction against her.\n\n\n\nHis comments, made on CNN\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cState of the Union,\xe2\x80\x9d come as Clinton is set to\nheadline his annual steak fry fundraiser on Sunday.\n\n\n\nAsked by host Candy Crowley to name the \xe2\x80\x9cnew face\xe2\x80\x9d of the Democratic Party\nwho could \xe2\x80\x9ctake her on,\xe2\x80\x9d Harkin said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut he added: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure that different people will come to the forefront.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHarkin named Maryland Gov. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley (D), who he called a \xe2\x80\x9cgreat\ngovernor\xe2\x80\x9d who\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdone great things\xe2\x80\x9d and is \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly out there as a viable\nperson.\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Malley has publicly acknowledged his interest in a presidential\nbid and is reportedly building a campaign infrastructure in Iowa, but\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet made an official decision.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may see one or two senators come up that might want to do something,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe said.\n\n\n\nAs an example, Harkin named Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who is up for\nreelection this year and has been talked about more as a potential\nvice-presidential pick than a serious contender for the White House.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\'s be honest about this. If Hillary decides to run, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going\nto be very tough for anyone else," he said. "That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say they won\xe2\x80\x99t\ndo it. They might. Some other Democrats might pop up."\n\nHe said some people may "come to the forefront that maybe want to stress\ncertain issues in a campaign." Harkin noted Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has\nexpressed interest in running as an independent to try to shape the\ndiscussion surrounding issues significant to him and his supporters.\nSanders is barnstorming Iowa this weekend as well, bracketing Clinton\'s\nstops in the state.\n\n\n\nHe cautioned, however: "If Hillary decides to run, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be\nvery tough for any Democrat to  try to get ahead of her. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be done. it\xe2\x80\x99ll be very tough though."\n\n\n\nBut his belief that Clinton, should she run, may face a challenge is not\none caused by lack of esteem for the former secretary of State. He said she\nand her husband have been providing \xe2\x80\x9cinspiring leadership to our country\nfor a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d and called her performance as secretary of State\n\xe2\x80\x9camazing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHarkin had no read, however, on whether a good friend of his, Vice\nPresident Joe Biden, would run.\n\n\n\nBut he offered his most effusive praise for the vice president: \xe2\x80\x9cI love Joe\nBiden,\xe2\x80\x9d Harkin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Politico column: Roger Simon: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Hillary hates Iowa\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/2016-elections-hillary-clinton-110942.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Roger Simon\n\nSeptember 14, 2014, 7:58 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nINDIANOLA Iowa \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cHello, Iowa!\xe2\x80\x9d says Hillary Clinton, who has not set foot\nin Iowa for six years and eight months, and in fact, until quite recently\nhas loathed the place.\n\n\n\nShe cautiously enunciates each word from her prepared text, even the jokes.\nShe is careful, modulated, meticulous. She is Hillary.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt feels like just yesterday that I was here,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, and the crowd\nlaughs. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I recall, there was a young senator from Illinois here, and I\nwonder whatever became of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThere is more laughter at the reference to Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nPerfect, rolling green pastures provide the background. There is a red\ntractor and a green hay wagon. A crowd of 10,000 is arrayed on lawn chairs.\nA large American flag is the backdrop on a low stage where the honored\nguests, men and women, sit in their shirt sleeves under a sunny sky.\n\n\n\nCorrection. Everyone is in shirt sleeves except Hillary Clinton, who keeps\nthe green jacket of her green pantsuit on. She can make a steak fry seem\nformal. Her husband, Bill, is in a red gingham shirt. \xe2\x80\x9cI always thought I\nlook like a tablecloth,\xe2\x80\x9d he will say later, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am told it is\nappropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThis is Sen. Tom Harkin\xe2\x80\x99s 37th and last steak fry. The liberal Democratic\nfirebrand is retiring. But not before Hillary and Bill Clinton headline his\nlast event.\n\n\n\nHillary was supposed to speak last, but that would have violated protocol.\nBill is a former president, and Hillary is merely someone who wants to be a\nformer president.\n\n\n\nSo she speaks before him. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course there\xe2\x80\x99s that other thing,\xe2\x80\x9d she says of\nher possible presidential pursuit. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is true I am thinking about it. But\nfor today that is not why I am here. I am here for the steak.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMore laughter. Iowa is a nice place for presidential campaign talk. It is\nnot representative of America \xe2\x80\x94 it is made up largely of small towns and\nfarms \xe2\x80\x94 but it goes first in the presidential selection process and thus it\ncan make or break campaigns.\n\n\n\nIn 2008, it broke Hillary Clinton. She had been ballyhooed as the\n\xe2\x80\x9cinevitable\xe2\x80\x9d Democratic nominee, but her third-place finish made her look a\nlot less inevitable. She won in the next contest, New Hampshire, but Barack\nObama ran a nearly flawless campaign and easily outmaneuvered her for the\nnomination.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI grew up in a middle-class family in the middle of America,\xe2\x80\x9d she likes to\nsay. But her middle of America was an affluent suburb of Chicago. The\nmiddle of America here are farm fields like the one she is apparently\nstanding on.\n\n\n\nThough, in reality, this is a hot air balloon field. Insert your own joke\nabout politicians and hot air here.\n\n\n\nShe carefully checks off the boxes in her 20-minute speech:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEqual pay for equal work.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you work hard and play by the rules, you deserve the possibility of a\ngood life for you and your family.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you get knocked down, get right back up!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, our economy is on the road to\nrecovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd one last joke. \xe2\x80\x9cLook, I get excited by presidential campaigns, too,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe says but reminds those in the audience that they must elect Democrats\nto the House and Senate in November.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Vice President Joe Biden will be in Des Moines for an\nofficial visit to a group called \xe2\x80\x9cNuns on the Bus,\xe2\x80\x9d who are, as it turns\nout, nuns on a bus. The real purpose of Biden\xe2\x80\x99s visit, however, may be to\ndrive Hillary crazy. And it appears he may have succeeded.\n\n\n\nDoes she really need this? She makes a number of references in her speech\nto the impending birth of her first grandchild, and some believe she will\npass up a run for the presidency to be a grandmother.\n\n\n\nI doubt it. This is the woman who said to her supporters in June 2008:\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough we weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling\nthis time, thanks to you, it\xe2\x80\x99s got about 18 million cracks in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd it feels like she is quite prepared to multitask: be a grandmother and\nrun the nation, too.\n\n\n\nAnd there was one very good sign here: Bill is playing along this time.\nWhen he got up to speak after Hillary was done, he was very careful not to\novershadow her. He even started with a shopworn joke.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank kyew! Thank kyew!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the applause as he began. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody\nhas said everything that needs to be said, but not everybody has said it\nyet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThis was his fourth steak fry. \xe2\x80\x9cIn 2003 it rained like crazy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nfelt like a 20-something at Woodstock.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut then he spoke about Haiti and the economy and the state of the America\nand his only really memorable line was: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are less racist, sexist and\nhomophobic than we have ever been, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to spend time around\nanyone who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with us.\xe2\x80\x9d Which is what he said, virtually word\nfor word, at the Newseum in Washington on Sept. 8.\n\n\n\nSo he did what was required of him, which was to fade into the background.\n\n\n\nAfter the speeches were over, Hillary worked the rope line, autographing\nsigns and posing for pictures.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBill Clinton and Hillary Clinton are now the comeback couple!\xe2\x80\x9d Tom Harkin\nhad said of them in his speech.\n\n\n\nBut he was careful not to endorse Hillary. Hillary Clinton spent all eight\nyears of her Senate term working with Harkin. But Harkin told The\nWashington Post this weekend: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not terribly close [to her], but we\xe2\x80\x99ve\nknown each other for a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nTranslation: Nobody gets close to Hillary.\n\n\n\nShe is going to have to change that impression for Iowans this time around,\nhowever. And she has work to do.\n\n\n\nShe has gone out of her way to avoid the state. Forget about her years as\nsecretary of state. Iowa is not a foreign country (though it appeared to be\none to Hillary), and she had no obligation to come here.\n\n\n\nBut if you examine her speaking schedule since leaving office and her\nbook-signing schedule, you can see that she has flown over Iowa several\ntimes in search of friendlier locales such as Connecticut, Florida, Nevada,\nCalifornia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Texas, Colorado, even Canada, and the\nlist goes on.\n\n\n\nThe closest she came to Iowa was a June book-signing in Kansas City,\nMissouri, which is only three hours from Des Moines by car and 52 minutes\nby plane. There are bookstores in Des Moines. But Hillary was not\ninterested in going to them.\n\n\n\nFor a simple reason: She hated the place. It is where her dream of being\nthe first woman president was trumped by Obama\xe2\x80\x99s dream of becoming the\nfirst black president. (And considering Iowa is only 2.9 percent black,\nObama\xe2\x80\x99s achievement was considerable.)\n\n\n\nHow did she rationalize her loss in Iowa? Iowa hates women. \xe2\x80\x9cI was shocked\nwhen I learned Iowa and Mississippi have never elected a woman governor,\nsenator or member of Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d Hillary told the Des Moines Register in\nOctober 2007. \xe2\x80\x9cThere has got to be something at work here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMaybe there is something at work. Maybe there is something in the air or\nwater that causes Iowans to spurn female candidates. But was this a good\nthing to accuse Iowans of just three months before they voted on your\nfuture?\n\n\n\nAnd then there was the whole caucus process, of which Iowa is very proud.\nHillary hates that, too. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a limited period of time on one day to\nhave your voices heard,\xe2\x80\x9d Hillary said after she lost Iowa. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is\ntroubling to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t like Obama much, either.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a big difference between our courage and our convictions, what we\nbelieve and what we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to fight for,\xe2\x80\x9d Hillary told reporters as she\ncampaigned in 2007.\n\n\n\nAsked whether she was raising questions about Obama\xe2\x80\x99s character, she said:\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s beginning to look a lot like that. You know, it really is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe said the Obama campaign had been attacking her and she was tired of it\nand she was going to respond. \xe2\x80\x9cNow the fun part starts,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nBut the fun part never started for her. Iowa was a body blow to Hillary. It\nestablished Obama as a serious candidate and, though he would lose some\nstates to her, he never really looked back.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have absolutely no interest in running for president again,\xe2\x80\x9d Hillary\ntold ABC News on Oct. 14, 2009.\n\n\n\nBut that was then, and this is now. And now she has to face Iowans once\nmore.\n\n\n\nBonnie Campbell, Iowa co-chair of Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 campaign, told CNN\nrecently: \xe2\x80\x9cShe knows Iowa now.

I\'m back!" Hillary Clinton announced to a\ncrowd of thousands of cheering Democratic supporters here on Sunday.\n\n\n\nThe pageantry was alive for the expected 2016 presidential candidate at the\nIowa Steak Fry, a fundraiser hosted by retiring Sen. Tom Harkin. As she\njoined with her husband, President Clinton (now a vegan), to flip steaks\nover a grill fenced off from dozens of out-of-town reporters, congressional\ncandidate Pat Murphy riled up the crowd, most of whom don Ready for Hillary\nstickers and posters. "Are you fired up? Are you ready to go? Are you ready\nfor Hillary?" he yells to the elated crowd.\n\n\n\nBut while the scene painted a picture of redemption in the pivotal\npresidential state, the memories of her last time in Iowa are still on the\nminds of people who came out for the 37th and final steak fry\xe2\x80\x94the crushing\nthird-place finish behind President Obama and John Edwards in the 2008 Iowa\ncaucuses.\n\n\n\nMany factors went into Clinton\'s loss: she didn\'t spend much time\ncampaigning here, she didn\'t connect with the activists, and many Democrats\ndisagreed with her vote to support the Iraq War.\n\n\n\nIraq is a sensitive topic in Iowa Democratic circles, especially among the\npassionate grassroots activists of the Hawkeye State. With the threat of\nISIS growing, and the possibility of American engagement in yet another\nconflict in the region, could the newfound talk about another war in Iraq\nhaunt Clinton in Iowa? Iowans still haven\'t forgotten her vote supporting\nthe war.\n\n\n\n"I think it\'ll keep coming up," said Sue Dinsdale, the executive director\nof Iowa Citizen Action Network. "I don\'t think anybody forgets that."\n\n\n\nJames Marren, an organizer for Beds for Peace, still recalls her original\nsupport for that war. "I think that she may be a little too hawkish," he\nsaid.\n\n\n\nIowa Democrats\' dovish tendencies are in contrast with Clinton\'s foreign\npolicy positions. Last week, Harkin told the Huffington Post that the push\nto war by Obama and lawmakers was "fear-mongering." He continued, "It\'s\nwhat happened after 9/11. \'Oh my god, they\'ve got these planes crashing.\nNow they\'re going to take over America.\' That\'s nonsense."\n\n\n\nThis stands in stark contrast to Clinton\'s positioning. She distanced\nherself from President Obama\'s foreign policy vision last month in a\nmuch-discussed interview with The Atlantic\'s Jeffrey Goldberg. Her aides\nlast week told The Hill that she would have been tougher than Obama on this\nissue and been less "passive." Harkin even acknowledged to ABC News that he\nhas real questions about some of her positions.\n\n\n\nActivists in Iowa are tired of war. The road into the Steak Fry was adorned\nwith large signs protesting air strikes in the Middle East. But Iowans\naren\'t rushing to judgment on Clinton.\n\n\n\n"I think Iowans in general are very conscience voters," state Rep. Chris\nHall says. "Hillary has served admirably in the role of secretary of state.\nShe has done important work on national security matters."\n\n\n\nMatt Sinovic, the executive director of Progress Iowa, thinks it\'s too\nearly to make any decisions about Clinton as a candidate. "Iowans will take\ntheir time and learn everything there is to know about every potential\ncandidate and every potential issue before making up their mind," he says.\n"I think that\'s what\'s happening right now with Hillary."\n\n\n\nAnd while the cheers from the crowd may have looked like unified support\nfor a presidential run, many in the crowd threw around names of other\ncandidates they\'re looking at: Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie\nSanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Maryland Gov. Martin O\'Malley. Outside\nof Biden, all have ample space to run to Clinton\'s left on foreign policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Fox News: \xe2\x80\x9cBenghazi panel begins hearings with questions on US diplomats\'\nsafety\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/09/14/special-benghazi-panel-starts-hearings-with-questions-on-us-diplomats-safety/>*\n\n\n\n[No Writer Mentioned]\n\nSeptember 14, 2014\n\n\n\nThe select Benghazi Committee holds its first open hearing Wednesday,\nemploying broad congressional powers to try to answer lingering questions\nranging from what led to the fatal 2012 terror strikes on a U.S. outpost in\nLibya to what is being done to better protect U.S. diplomats worldwide.\n\n\n\nThe hearing by the Republican-led House committee will focus on the extent\nto which the State Department has implemented post\xe2\x80\x93attack recommendations\nmade by the Accountability Review Board.\n\n\n\nThe department created the five-member, independent board just weeks after\nthe Sept. 11, 2012, attacks in which four Americans -- Ambassador Chris\nStevens, information specialist Sean Smith and Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and\nGlen Doherty -- were killed.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are still facts to learn about Benghazi and information that needs\nto be explained in greater detail to the American people,\xe2\x80\x9d Rep. Trey Gowdy,\nR-S.C., the committee chairman and a former federal prosecutor, said\nearlier this month. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd this committee will do just that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn a December 2012 report, the board issued 29 recommendations to fix what\nit called \xe2\x80\x9csystemic\xe2\x80\x9d leadership and senior management failures that led to\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cgrossly\xe2\x80\x9d inadequate security at the U.S. outpost.\n\n\n\nCongressional Republicans were immediately critical of the report and its\nauthors, saying they downplayed key decisions by top department officials,\ninstead putting too much blame on their subordinates.\n\n\n\nScheduled to testify Wednesday are Greg Starr, the department\xe2\x80\x99s assistant\nsecretary for Diplomatic Security, and Mark Sullivan and Todd Keil, members\nof the Independent Panel on Best Practices, created to review the\naccountability board\xe2\x80\x99s efforts.\n\n\n\nSullivan is the panel chairman and a former Secret Service director. Keil\nis a former Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary.\n\n\n\nThe board was led by Ambassador Thomas Pickering and Adm. Michael Mullin,\nwho have already testified before Congress and are expected to be called\nbefore the select committee.\n\n\n\nThe fatal attacks, which the White House said in the immediate aftermath\nwere sparked by an anti-Islamic video, have been the subject of roughly 12\ncongressional hearings.\n\n\n\nHowever, the House created the select committee in May 2014 with the\nexpectation that its subpoena powers and other tools would bring forth new\nwitnesses and resolve unanswered questions.\n\n\n\nThe committee is expected to address several other key issues, including to\nwhat extend the U.S. attempted to stop the attacks and rescue U.S.\npersonnel and whether the White House response, weeks before voters decided\nwhether to re-elect President Obama, was politically motivated.\n\n\n\nU.S. Special Forces captured and arrested Libyan Ahmed Abu Khattala in June\nin connection with the attacks on the two U.S. facilities, and he is\nawaiting trial in the United States.\n\n\n\nThe committee\xe2\x80\x99s 12 members -- seven Republicans and five Democrats -- have\nbeen working since being appointed by hiring staff, gathering information\nand meeting with family members of the four men killed.\n\n\n\nHouse Democrats were reluctant at first to join the committee.\n\n\n\nThey argued the issue has been full investigated and that further efforts\nare just politically-motivated attempts to keep Benghazi in Americans\xe2\x80\x99\nminds through the 2014 midterms and the 2016 presidential elections, in\nwhich Hillary Clinton, secretary of state at the time of the attacks, is\nthe presumptive Democratic front-runner.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe a select committee is called for after eight reports,\ndozens of witness interviews and a review of more than 25,000 pages of\ndocuments,\xe2\x80\x9d Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the select\ncommittee, said this spring. But \xe2\x80\x9cI believe we need someone in that room to\ndefend the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sec. Clinton\'s upcoming appearances as reported online.
