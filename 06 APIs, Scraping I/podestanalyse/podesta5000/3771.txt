Will you?*\n \n*Show Speaker John Boehner and House Republicans that you stand for women's health -- by signing our petition right now. [ http://stophr3.com?source=keg ]*\n \nWhen we talk to people back home in California and New York, they always ask us about the most important challenge facing America--creating jobs.\n \nBut Speaker Boehner and the Republicans don't have a plan for creating jobs, so instead they're trying to cozy up to extremists by taking away health care from women all across America.\n \n*The good news is, people all over the country are standing up and speaking out against these attacks. Thousands of men and women have joined us already \xe2\x80\x93 and we need you, too.*\n\n*To stop these extreme attacks on women's health, we need even more people like you to join with us.
