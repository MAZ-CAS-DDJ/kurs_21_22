I\xe2\x80\x99m Cecile Richards, President of Planned Parenthood Federation\n>> of America.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>> Planned Parenthood provides a full range of health care services to\n>> millions of women, men, and young people every year, including cancer\n>> screenings, birth control, STD testing and treatment, and abortion. And we\n>> provide much more than health services \xe2\x80\x93 we support millions of people as\n>> they build their futures and pursue their goals.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>> Recently, an organization that opposes safe and legal abortion used\n>> secretly recorded, heavily edited videos to make outrageous claims about\n>> programs that help women donate fetal tissue for medical research.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>> I want to be really clear: The allegation that Planned Parenthood profits\n>> in any way from tissue donation is not true. Our donation programs \xe2\x80\x93 like\n>> any other high-quality health care providers \xe2\x80\x93 follow all laws and ethical\n>> guidelines. Over our 100-year history, we have continually engaged leading\n>> medical experts to shape our practices, policies, and high standards \xe2\x80\x93 and\n>> always will.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>> Our top priority is the compassionate care that we provide. In the video,\n>> one of our staff members speaks in a way that does not reflect that\n>> compassion. This is unacceptable, and I personally apologize for the staff\n>> member's tone and statements.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>> As always, if there is any aspect of our work that can be strengthened,\n>> we want to know about it, and we take swift action to address it.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>> Planned Parenthood stands behind our work to help women and families\n>> donate tissue for medical research when they wish to. It is always their\n>> decision.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>> I thank those women and families who have chosen tissue donation at some\n>> point in their lives.  Your commitment to lifesaving research, developing\n>> treatments for diseases like Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s and Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s, is important and\n>> compassionate, and it should be respected \xe2\x80\x93 not attacked.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>> We know the real agenda of organizations behind videos like this, and\n>> they have never been concerned with protecting the health and safety of\n>> women. Their mission is to ban abortion completely and cut women off from\n>> care at Planned Parenthood and other health centers.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>> We will never let that happen.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>> ###\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>> *Planned Parenthood is the nation's leading provider and advocate of\n>> high-quality, affordable health care for women, men, and young people, as\n>> well as the nation's largest provider of sex education. With approximately\n>> 700 health centers across the country, Planned Parenthood organizations\n>> serve all patients with care and compassion, with respect and without\n>> judgment. Through health centers, programs in schools and communities, and\n>> online resources, Planned Parenthood is a trusted source of reliable health\n>> information that allows people to make informed health decisions. We do all\n>> this because we care passionately about helping people lead healthier\n>> lives. *\n>>\n>\n"
