Lingan, the rector, glad to have seen the sky for the first time in 8 days.  He has been moved to Sibley Hospital for rehab/PT.  If you would like to call or visit him, here are the details:\n\nLocation: Sibley Renaissance Building*, Room 320\nLes' Phone #:  202-243-5120<tel:202-243-5120>\nHis PT Sessions: 9:30 & 1:30\nHis OT Session:  11:00\n\nIf planning a visit, best to think of after 3 p.m.  When visiting, they ask that you inform someone at the nurse's station that you are leaving so they know the patient is alone.\n\n*The Renaissance Building is located on the Southside of the hospital and has its own entrance.  That entrance is closed at 5:00 pm on Saturday and all day on Sunday.  You can access the Renaissance Building through the Main Hospital as well.  If you enter through the Main Hospital (1st Floor) you cross into the Renaissance Building on the 4th Floor.  Les' room in on the 3rd Floor of the Renaissance Building.\n\n\nBest,\n\nFr. Paul Rourke, S.J.\n\n"
