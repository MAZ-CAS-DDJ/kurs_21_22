At CDF, we took census figures of\nschool-age children and compared those numbers to school enrollments. We\noften found significant discrepancies, and we wanted to determine where\nthese unaccounted-for children were. Knocking on doors was revelatory and\nheartbreaking. I found children who weren\xe2\x80\x99t in school because of physical\ndisabilities like blindness and deafness. I also found school-age siblings\nat home, babysitting their younger brothers and sisters while their parents\nworked. On the small back porch off her family\xe2\x80\x99s home in a neighborhood of\nPortuguese-American fishermen, I met a girl in a wheelchair, who told me\nhow much she wanted to go to school. She knew she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go because she\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t walk.\xe2\x80\x9d [*Living History, *pg. 79]\n\n\n\n*Children Out Of School In America Was The First In A Series Of Reports\n>From The Children\xe2\x80\x99s Defense Fund, Followed By A Report On Children In Adult\nJails.* \xe2\x80\x9cChildren Out of School in America" is the first in a series of\nreports we will issue during the next several months on conditions of\nchildren which urgently require recognition and correction. These include\nproblems of (1) children in adult jails; (2) children of women prisoners;\nand (3) school and other children\'s record keeping practices.\xe2\x80\x9d [Children\nOut Of School In America, CDF, October 1974\n<http://diglib.lib.utk.edu/cdf/data/0116_000050_000207/0116_000050_000207.pdf>]\n\n\n\n\n*Children Out Of School In America Included Reporting On Children In Adult\nJails.* \xe2\x80\x9cThere are other children who have tried to enroll at some time but\nwho were not accepted by the school system. They want to be in school, but\nare told by school officials that it is not the place they should be. These\nare excluded children, such as: --children who register too late in the\nschool year -incontinent children or those with spina bifida1. --children\nwhom school officials deem "immature" -older children who try to enroll for\nthe first time in a new school district --children on waiting lists for\nspecial programs -special needs children for whom there are no appropriate\nprograms, particularly the physically, mentally, and emotionally\nhandicapped, and non-English-speaking or bilingual children -children who\nare beyond normal transportation routes in remote rural areas -children in\njails2.\xe2\x80\x9d [Children Out Of School In America, CDF, October 1974\n<http://diglib.lib.utk.edu/cdf/data/0116_000050_000207/0116_000050_000207.pdf>\n]\n\n\n\n*Children Out Of School In America Found 38,000 Children Under 16 Are In\nJail On Any Given Day.* \xe2\x80\x9cThese children are, in fact, totally out of school\nduring the period of their jail detention. About 38,000 children under age\n16 are in jail on a given day. This figure does not include city jails and\nlock-ups. A subsequent CDP study of children in adult jails will show that\nthe figures used do not tell the whole story: it is likely that between\n250,000 and 400,000 children are jailed annually. There is no education\nprovided in jail.\xe2\x80\x9d [Children Out Of School In America, CDF, October 1974\n<http://diglib.lib.utk.edu/cdf/data/0116_000050_000207/0116_000050_000207.pdf>\n]\n\n\n\n*In South Carolina, Hillary Wrote She Helped Investigate The Living\nConditions Of Juvenile Offenders Held In Adult Jails. *\xe2\x80\x9cBill was coming\nhome to Arkansas and taking a teaching job in Fayetteville, at the\nUniversity of Arkansas School of Law. I was moving to Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, to work for Marian Wright Edelman at the newly created\nChildren\xe2\x80\x99s Defense Fund (CDF). I rented the top floor of an old house,\nwhere I lived alone for the first time. I loved the work, which involved a\nlot of travel and exposure to problems affecting children and teenagers\naround the country. In South Carolina I helped investigate the conditions\nunder which juveniles were incarcerated in adult jails. Some of the\nfourteen- and fifteen-year-olds I interviewed were in jail for minor\ntransgressions. Others were already serious offenders. Either way, none of\nthem should have been sharing cells with hard-core adult criminals, who\ncould prey on them or further educate them in criminality. CDF led an\neffort to separate out juveniles and provide them with more protection and\nfaster adjudication.\xe2\x80\x9d [*Living History, *pg. 79]\n\n\n\n*Children\xe2\x80\x99s Defense Fund Report On Children In Adult Jails Not Released\nUntil 1976, Hillary Not Listed As Staff.* [Children In Adult Jails,\nCDF, December\n1976\n<http://diglib.lib.utk.edu/cdf/data/0116_000050_000245/0116_000050_000245.pdf>]\n'
