Her policy differences\nwith the president are well-documented: She favored supplying arms to\nmoderate Syrian rebels, leaving behind a larger residual force in Iraq, and\nwaiting longer before pulling American support for Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s former President\nHosni Mubarak during the historic protests in Cairo.\n\n\n\nWhat has changed is her readiness to surface those differences and put them\nin the context of a different worldview. Even her memoir, \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices,\xe2\x80\x9d\nwhich she was promoting in her interview with Mr. Goldberg, soft-pedaled\nthe gaps and painted a portrait of her and Mr. Obama in lock step in\nrebuilding America\xe2\x80\x99s tattered image abroad.\n\n\n\nNow, though, Mrs. Clinton is suggesting that she and the president hold\nfundamentally different views of American power: his view cautious,\ninward-looking, suffused with a sense of limits; hers muscular, optimistic,\nunabashedly old-fashioned.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, when you\xe2\x80\x99re down on yourself, and when you are hunkering down\nand pulling back, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to make any better decisions than when\nyou were aggressively, belligerently putting yourself forward,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\nClinton said to Mr. Goldberg. \xe2\x80\x9cOne issue is that we don\xe2\x80\x99t even tell our own\nstory very well these days.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMuch of the interview\xe2\x80\x99s resonance is in its timing, coming two days after\nMr. Obama authorized airstrikes against Sunni militants in Iraq. Mrs.\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s aides say this was a coincidence; the session was scheduled long\nbefore anyone knew about military action.\n\n\n\nStill, when Mrs. Clinton says \xe2\x80\x9cthe failure to help build up a credible\nfighting force\xe2\x80\x9d against President Bashar al-Assad in Syria \xe2\x80\x9cleft a big\nvacuum, which the jihadists have now filled,\xe2\x80\x9d it suggests Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\nrefusal to arm the rebels might end up being a singular misjudgment.\n\n\n\nAt the time of the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s internal debate over that\ndecision, several officials said, Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s advocacy was far less\nthunderous: the United States had tried every diplomatic channel with\nSyria, she said, and nothing else had worked, so why not try funneling\nweapons to the moderate rebels.\n\n\n\nAs Mrs. Clinton stakes out her own foreign policy positions in advance of a\npossible campaign for the White House, there are likely to be other cases\nwhere her statements do not seem entirely in sync with her record as\nsecretary of state.\n\n\n\nAt the end of her tenure, for example, Mrs. Clinton wrote a memo to Mr.\nObama recommending that the United States lift its half-century-old trade\nembargo against Cuba. It was not a position that she seriously advocated\nwhile at the State Department, officials said.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton also dashed off an exit memo warning about President Vladimir\nV. Putin of Russia, which White House aides said was redundant, since his\nbehavior was already clear by then. At the beginning of the administration,\nshe was an enthusiastic proponent of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to reset\nrelations with Russia.\n\n\n\nIn the interview with The Atlantic, Mrs. Clinton said she had always been\nin the camp of those who believed that Iran had no right to enrich uranium.\nYet in December 2010, she was one of the first American officials to\nacknowledge publicly, in an interview with the BBC, that Iran could emerge\nfrom nuclear negotiations with the right to enrich.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton is not the only former cabinet member to part company with Mr.\nObama on foreign policy. Robert M. Gates, the former defense secretary,\nwrote a memoir laced with scathing criticism of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s\napproach to Afghanistan and other crises.\n\n\n\nIn a New York Times article in April about Mrs. Clinton, Leon E. Panetta,\nthe former defense secretary and C.I.A. director, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe president has\nmade some tough decisions. But it\xe2\x80\x99s been a mixed record, and the concern\nis, the president defining what America\xe2\x80\x99s role in the world is in the 21st\ncentury hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut because of their long history and Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s political future,\nadvisers to her and Mr. Obama have worked especially hard to head off any\ndiscord. Her staff gave parts of her memoir to Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy\nnational security adviser, for vetting before publication.\n\n\n\nAnd interlocking staffs has been a big factor in that effort. Jake\nSullivan, Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s top policy adviser at the State Department, went\nto work as national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.,\na post that allowed him to convey the White House\xe2\x80\x99s sensitivities to her\naides.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton hired Tommy Vietor, a longtime Obama aide who was the\nspokesman for the National Security Council, to help with the rollout of\nher book. Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s aides worried that some in the news media might\nuse the book to try to drive a wedge between her and the president; Mr.\nVietor\xe2\x80\x99s job was to push back on that effort.\n\n\n\nWhile Mr. Obama still speaks periodically with Mrs. Clinton, their staffs\ncommunicate more regularly. During the Crimea crisis, the White House chief\nof staff, Denis R. McDonough, invited in several Clinton aides, including\nPhilippe Reines and Huma Abedin, for consultations. Mrs. Clinton also\nchecks in by email with senior aides like Mr. Rhodes on issues like\nMyanmar, in which both have a special interest.\n\n\n\nWhether that communication will weather Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s latest statements\nremains to be seen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Washington Post: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton criticizes President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s foreign\npolicy in interview with the Atlantic\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hillary-clinton-criticizes-president-obamas-foreign-policy-in-interview-with-the-atlantic/2014/08/11/46d30564-2170-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Juliet Eilperin\n\nAugust 11, 2014, 8:44 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nFormer secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton has not yet said whether\nshe will pursue the presidency. But for a candidate-in-waiting, she is\nclearly carving out a foreign policy distinct from the man she used to\nserve.\n\n\n\nIn the spring, President Obama articulated a philosophy for avoiding\ndangerous entanglements overseas that was modest in its ambitions and\nfocused on avoiding mistakes. Don\xe2\x80\x99t do stupid things, he said.\n\n\n\nNow Clinton is offering a blunt retort to that approach, telling an\ninterviewer, \xe2\x80\x9cGreat nations need organizing principles \xe2\x80\x94 and \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t do\nstupid stuff\xe2\x80\x99 is not an organizing principle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe surprisingly direct critique, coming in an interview with the Atlantic,\nrepresents Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s most forceful effort yet to distance herself from an\nunpopular administration ahead of her expected 2016 campaign. It also\nforeshadows the unusual political challenges facing Clinton as she\naccentuates her foreign policy credentials while trying to avoid blame for\nthe nation\xe2\x80\x99s defensive posture in an increasingly unstable world.\n\n\n\nThe White House declined to comment on Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, which came as\nIraq has plunged into political turmoil and the United States has launched\nairstrikes to aid Kurdish forces under siege by the Islamic State militant\ngroup.\n\n\n\nThe administration is now grappling with multiple armed conflicts in the\nMiddle East and Ukraine, making Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s record as the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top\ndiplomat more fraught.\n\n\n\nClinton, who has already used her recent memoir, \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices ,\xe2\x80\x9d to\napologize for her decision to support the invasion of Iraq in 2002 and to\ndraw some careful distinctions between herself and the administration,\nprovided a more direct assessment in the interview published Sunday.\n\n\n\nShe drew special attention to Obama\xe2\x80\x99s determination to sidestep costly\nforeign interventions. The president and his aides have referred privately\nto that strategy in recent months as, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t do stupid s---.\xe2\x80\x9d That approach\nhas come under fire from some now that Islamist militants have gained\nground overseas.\n\n\n\nClinton said the phrase was \xe2\x80\x9ca political message\xe2\x80\x9d rather than Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\n\xe2\x80\x9cworldview.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nEven so, she argued that the United States has to strike a better balance\nbetween overreaching in foreign affairs and being so restrained that\nconflicts can spiral out of hand.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, when you\xe2\x80\x99re down on yourself, and when you are hunkering down\nand pulling back, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to make any better decisions than when\nyou were aggressively, belligerently putting yourself forward,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton\nsaid.\n\n\n\nDifferences on Syria\n\nAs secretary of state, Clinton backed arming the rebels in Syria\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing\ncivil war. In the new interview, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe failure to help build up a\ncredible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the\nprotests against [Bashar al-Assad] \xe2\x80\x94 there were Islamists, there were\nsecularists, there was everything in the middle \xe2\x80\x94 the failure to do that\nleft a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton added that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be sure whether her preferred course of\naction would have changed the direction of the war. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t sit here today\nand say that if we had done what I recommended, and what [former U.S.\nambassador to Syria] Robert Ford recommended, that we\xe2\x80\x99d be in a\ndemonstrably different place,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nWhile Clinton and Obama have taken steps since her departure from the\nadministration to present themselves as friends, the two engaged over the\nweekend in a sort of indirect foreign policy debate \xe2\x80\x94 with each sitting for\nseparate interviews with journalists known for their Middle East expertise.\n\n\n\nClinton made her comments to the Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s Jeffrey Goldberg. Obama,\nspeaking with New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman, dismissed the\nidea that arming the Syrian rebels would have made a difference, saying it\nhas \xe2\x80\x9calways been a fantasy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis idea that we could provide some light arms or even more sophisticated\narms to what was essentially an opposition made up of former doctors,\nfarmers, pharmacists and so forth, and that they were going to be able to\nbattle not only a well-armed state but also a well-armed state backed by\nRussia, backed by Iran, a battle-hardened Hezbollah, that was never in the\ncards,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\n\n*Benefits in distance*\n\n\n\nIn an e-mail Monday, an aide to Clinton wrote that the interview was\n\xe2\x80\x9cintended to promote her memoir, and Goldberg was a long-planned-for target\non a list of interviews around the book \xe2\x80\x94 and not part of an overarching\npolitical strategy related to 2016.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSeveral experts said there is little precedent for a secretary of state\npreparing a presidential campaign in part by criticizing the foreign policy\nbeing carried out by the administration she helped lead. Yet the benefits\nto Clinton are clear.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in her political interest to begin to distance herself from an\nunpopular president and to drive home the fact that she\xe2\x80\x99s risk-ready while\nObama\xe2\x80\x99s risk-averse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aaron David Miller, vice president for new\ninitiatives at the Wilson Center.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s comments cheered some Democrats who have become anxious about the\nthreat Islamist militants pose to both stability in the Middle East and\nU.S. national security.\n\n\n\nJosh Block, president of the Israel Project, said it is \xe2\x80\x9cimportant\xe2\x80\x9d to see\na Democratic leader laying out a worldview \xe2\x80\x9cthat recognizes the role of our\nvalues and very real threats and trends facing the U.S. and our allies\ntoday.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt struck me as the reemergence of common sense in Democratic foreign\npolicy after a period of drift and indecision,\xe2\x80\x9d Block added.\n\n\n\nRepublican National Committee press secretary Kirsten Kukowski seized on\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s remarks Monday, e-mailing reporters, \xe2\x80\x9cgood luck to you, Hillary\xe2\x80\x9d\nas she tries to refashion her record.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s going to try, because that\xe2\x80\x99s what the ever-calculating,\never-political Clintons do best, but let\xe2\x80\x99s be real, she was the Obama\nforeign policy for four years,\xe2\x80\x9d Kukowski wrote.\n\n\n\nShawn Brimley, who served as the National Security Council\xe2\x80\x99s director for\nstrategic planning during Obama\xe2\x80\x99s first term, said he did not see \xe2\x80\x9cmuch of\na chasm between where Secretary Clinton is and where the president\xe2\x80\x99s been\nat some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBrimley said it is always easier for those who have left the administration\nto reflect upon world affairs and articulate an overarching vision than\nthose who are \xe2\x80\x9crunning on a treadmill at 20 to 30 miles an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nStill, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s remarks appear to be carefully calibrated, the latest\nexample of a deliberate distancing from her former colleagues.\n\n\n\nSyria, for example, was not the only issue in which Clinton had a more\ninterventionist view than Obama. Along with then-Defense Secretary Robert\nM. Gates, she advocated sending more troops to Afghanistan. Clinton also\nwrote in the book that when it came to the Arab Spring, she and other\nsenior advisers \xe2\x80\x94 including Gates and Vice President Biden \xe2\x80\x94 were not\n\xe2\x80\x9cswept up in the drama and idealism of the moment\xe2\x80\x9d like other, younger\nWhite House aides when it came to ousting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Politico Magazine: \xe2\x80\x9cSaving Syria Is No \xe2\x80\x98Fantasy\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/08/mr-president-saving-syria-is-no-fantasy-109923_Page2.html#.U-nt5_ldV8E>*\n\n\n\nBy Frederic Hof, former special advisor for transition in Syria at the U.S.\nDepartment of State\n\nAugust 11, 2014\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s former adviser says Obama stood alone against\ncalls to arm the rebels.\n\n\n\nIn June 2014, the Obama administration asked Congress for $500 million to\ntrain and equip nationalist Syrian rebels battling both the Islamic State\nin Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the Assad regime. Questions were posed\nthen about the genuineness of the gesture: The request was emailed to\nCapitol Hill rather than made in person; it was unaccompanied by visits or\ntelephone calls; there were no follow-up consultations; there was no order\nto the Department of Defense to reprogram funds to initiate activity\nquickly; and there was no evidence of an existing plan or overall strategy.\nTwo months later, those questions seem to have been answered by the\npresident of the United States. He says that arming nationalist Syrian\nrebels was never going to work anyway.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times on Aug. 8, President Obama said the\nnotion that ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s rise could have been stopped or hindered if he had armed\nthe secular, more Western-friendly Syrian rebels at the start of the civil\nwar\xe2\x80\x94a view recently endorsed by his former secretary of state, Hillary\nClinton\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chas always been a fantasy. This idea that we could provide some\nlight arms or even more sophisticated arms to what was essentially an\nopposition made up of former doctors, farmers, pharmacists and so forth,\nand that they were going to be able to battle not only a well-armed state\nbut also a well-armed state backed by Russia, backed by Iran, a\nbattle-hardened Hezbollah, that was never in the cards.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIronically, in the same interview the president also defended the\nU.S.-supported NATO military intervention in Libya on the grounds that\nwithout it, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s likely that Libya would be Syria.\xe2\x80\x9d One wonders if Syria\nitself would \xe2\x80\x9cbe Syria\xe2\x80\x9d had its armed nationalists been adequately\nsupported since 2012 and had the Assad regime\xe2\x80\x99s mass terror-delivery\nsystems been neutralized in the summer of 2013 following the\nchemical-weapons atrocity, when more than 1,400 people were killed in an\nattack outside Damascus.\n\n\n\nNo doubt the president is sensitive to the charge that his rejection of the\n2012 recommendation by his national security team to arm and equip\nnationalist Syrian rebels robustly has contributed significantly, if\ninadvertently, to ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s growth in both Syria and Iraq. His comments to\nFriedman implicitly dismiss the 2012 recommendation itself as a fantasy,\nbut as Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Syria adviser I was a member of the\nadministration at that time. The recommendation, in one form or another,\nwas offered not only by Clinton, but by Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta,\nCIA Director David Petraeus and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Martin\nDempsey. Yet the president, ignoring decades of universal conscription and\nmandatory military service in Syria, persists in characterizing the Assad\nregime\xe2\x80\x99s armed opponents as a hopeless collection of former butchers,\nbakers and candlestick makers.\n\n\n\nWhat is truly curious, however, is the request to Congress for $500 million\nto finance what the president deems a fantasy. Indeed, if press reports are\ntrue that the United States is already involved in some low-level arming,\nequipping and training of Syrian rebels, one wonders how many taxpayer\ndollars have already been spent on something the commander-in-chief deems\nillusory. What is Congress now to make of this $500 million request? What\nare military planners at the U.S. Central Command to make of the midnight\noil they have been burning trying to give shape to something they thought\nwas real? What exactly was the purpose of whatever interagency process\nproduced the $500 million initiative in the first place?\n\n\n\nPerhaps the president misspoke or was inaccurately quoted. Perhaps he meant\nto argue that his 2012 decision was correct, but that the rise of ISIL has\nbeen a game-changer, and this is why he is seeking $500 million from\nCongress: to accelerate, despite all of the difficulties, the development\nof an alternative to Assad and the jihadis. Perhaps he really meant only to\nrepeat his customary straw-man argument: Those who claim Assad would be\ngone today if only a different decision had been made in 2012 are wrong.\nOne prays this is the case.\n\n\n\nCongress, mercifully in recess, now has a choice: Take the president\nliterally and summarily reject the $500 million request; or give the\npresident the benefit of the doubt as to his choice of words and deliver\nthe kind of serious consideration the request merits. It should choose the\nlatter. When it returns to session it should invite senior administration\nofficials to testify about the national security objectives and strategy\nmotivating the request. Obama, for his part, should move quickly to clarify\nhis remarks to convey that he is not asking Congress to throw money at a\npolicy he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in.\n\n\n\nAmerican pilots are now engaging ISIL targets in northern Iraq to support\nKurdish peshmerga warriors. Syrian nationalists battling ISIL next door\nhave long since given up on getting that kind of direct combat support from\nthe United States. In the past, President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s words about a dictator\nwho should step aside and red lines that are not to be crossed encouraged\nthe Syrian opposition to believe that the United States would not permit\nIranian and Russian support for mass homicide to go unanswered. They have\ngrown deeply disappointed, disillusioned and embittered. Yet they have held\nout against steep odds.\n\n\n\nEvidently, they never got the memo about successful resistance not being in\nthe cards.\n\n\n\nThese people do not, in their dire straits, need a presidential\nback-of-the-hand, even one that may not have been meant as such. They need\nhelp in their two-way fight: help in downing regime helicopters bearing\nbarrel bombs dropped indiscriminately on civilians, and help in repulsing\nand expelling the jihadis\xe2\x80\x99 terror squads. Had the requisite assistance\nstarted flowing two years ago, both Syria and Iraq would be in better\nplaces now.\n\n\n\nFantasy? Few in the administration\xe2\x80\x94including at very senior levels\xe2\x80\x94think\nso. But the president has the only vote that counts. And what he does\nnow\xe2\x80\x94not what he did or failed to do two years ago\xe2\x80\x94is what truly matters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*New York Times column: David Brooks: \xe2\x80\x9cClinton, Obama and Iraq\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/opinion/david-brooks-clinton-obama-and-iraq.html>*\n\n\n\nBy David Brooks\n\nAugust 11, 2014\n\n\n\nLast week, Hillary Clinton had a fascinating interview with Jeffrey\nGoldberg of The Atlantic. The interview got immediate attention because of\nthe way she discussed her differences with President Obama.\n\n\n\nWhile admitting that no one will ever know who was right, Clinton argues\nthat Obama might have done more to help the moderate opposition in Syria\nfight the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. \xe2\x80\x9cThe failure to help build\nup a credible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the\nprotests against Assad ... left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now\nfilled,\xe2\x80\x9d she told Goldberg.\n\n\n\nWhile showing lavish respect for the president\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence and judgment,\nClinton also made it clear that she\xe2\x80\x99d be a more aggressive foreign policy\nleader. \xe2\x80\x9cGreat nations need organizing principles, and \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t do stupid\nstuff\xe2\x80\x99 is not an organizing principle,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, citing Obama\xe2\x80\x99s famous\nphrase.\n\n\n\nBut the interview also illuminates the different flavors of Democratic\nthinking on foreign policy. We are now living in what we might as well\nadmit is the Age of Iraq. The last four presidents have found themselves\ndrawn into that nation because it epitomizes the core problem at the center\nof so many crises: the interaction between failing secular governance and\nradical Islam.\n\n\n\nIn her interview with Goldberg, Clinton likens the current moment to the\nCold War. The U.S. confronts a diverse global movement, motivated by a\nhostile ideology: jihadism.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJihadist groups are governing territory. They will never stay there,\nthough. They are driven to expand.\xe2\x80\x9d This jihadism shows up in many\ncontexts, but whether in Gaza or Syria or Iraq, she says, \xe2\x80\x9cit is all one\nbig threat.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton speaks as a Truman-Kennedy Democrat. She\xe2\x80\x99s obviously much, much\nmore multilateral than Republicans, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a certain muscular tone, a\ncertain assumption that there will be hostile ideologies that threaten\nAmerica. There is also a grand strategic cast to her mind. The U.S. has to\ncome up with an \xe2\x80\x9coverarching\xe2\x80\x9d strategy, she told Goldberg, to contain,\ndeter and defeat anti-democratic foes.\n\n\n\nShe argues that harsh action is sometimes necessary. \xe2\x80\x9cI think Israel did\nwhat it had to do to respond to the rockets, \xe2\x80\x9c she declared, embracing\nrecent Israeli policy. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt in my mind that Hamas initiated\nthis conflict. ... So the ultimate responsibility has to rest on Hamas.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThis tone sometimes stands in tension with the approach President Obama\narticulated in his West Point speech in the spring, or in his interview\nwith my colleague Thomas Friedman on Friday.\n\n\n\nObama has carefully not organized a large part of his foreign policy around\na war against jihadism. The foreign policy vision he describes is, as you\xe2\x80\x99d\nexpect from a former law professor, built around reverence for certain\nprocedures: compromise, inclusiveness, rules and norms. The threat he\ndescribed in his West Point speech was a tactic, terrorism, not an\nideology, jihadism. His main argument was against a means not an end: the\nefficacy of military action.\n\n\n\nObama is notably cautious, arguing that the U.S. errs when it tries to do\ntoo much. The cast of his mind is against intervention. Sometimes, when the\nsituation demands it, he goes against his natural temperament (he told\nFriedman that he regrets not getting more involved in Libya), but it takes\na mighty shove, and he is resistant all the way. In his West Point speech,\nhe erected barriers to action. He argued, for example, that the U.S. could\ntake direct action only when \xe2\x80\x9cthere is near certainty of no civilian\ncasualties.\xe2\x80\x9d (This is not a standard Franklin Roosevelt would have applied.)\n\n\n\nObama and Clinton represent different Democratic tendencies. In their\ndescriptions of the current situation in Iraq, Clinton emphasizes that\nthere cannot be inclusive politics unless the caliphate is seriously pushed\nback, while Obama argues that we will be unable to push back the caliphate\nunless the Iraqis themselves create inclusive politics. The Clinton\nlanguage points toward some sort of intervention. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s points away from\nit, though he may be forced by events into being more involved.\n\n\n\nIt will be fascinating to see how Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s approach plays in Democratic\nprimaries. (I\xe2\x80\x99d bet she is going to get a more serious challenge than\npeople now expect.) In practice, the Clinton approach strikes me as more\nsound, for the same reason that early intervention against cancer is safer\nthan late-term surgery. In the Middle East, malevolent groups like the\nIslamic State in Iraq and Syria grow unless checked. Even in situations\nwhere our \xe2\x80\x9cfriends\xe2\x80\x9d are dysfunctional, the world has to somehow check them,\nusing a multitude of levers. Having done so little in Syria and Iraq for\nthe past year, we can end the caliphate or we can stay out of Iraq, but we\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t do both.\n\n\n\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t take steady, aggressive preventive action, of the sort that\nClinton leans toward, then you end up compelled to take the sort of large\nrisky action that Obama abhors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Politico: \xe2\x80\x9cJeffrey Goldberg: Hillary Clinton line seemed like \xe2\x80\x98shot\xe2\x80\x99 at\nPresident Obama\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/jeffrey-goldberg-hillary-clinton-interview-109915.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Jonathan Topaz\n\nAugust 11, 2014, 2:02 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nJeffrey Goldberg on Monday dissected his interview with Hillary Clinton,\nsaying she took \xe2\x80\x9ca bit of a shot\xe2\x80\x9d at President Barack Obama and his foreign\npolicy.\n\n\n\nAppearing on MSNBC, the Atlantic journalist who interviewed Clinton was\nasked about the former secretary of State\xe2\x80\x99s comments that an Obama foreign\npolicy quip \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t do stupid stuff\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 was not an adequate \xe2\x80\x9corganizing\nprinciple.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen she says, that\xe2\x80\x99s not an organizing principle \xe2\x80\x94 and people\nunderstand that to be one of Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s organizing principles \xe2\x80\x94 it does\nseem like a bit of a shot,\xe2\x80\x9d Goldberg said.\n\n\n\nHe added that her comments on the issue underscore a significant stylistic\ndifference between Obama and Clinton, who served in the administration\nduring the president\xe2\x80\x99s first term.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat she\xe2\x80\x99s saying is that, \xe2\x80\x98My organizing principle is, we defeated\nCommunism and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to defeat jihadism,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGoldberg said of Clinton. \xe2\x80\x9cBarack Obama, as you well know, is allergic to\nthat kind of sweeping language.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe interview, conducted last week and published over the weekend, was\nperhaps Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s largest break from Obama, whom she has strongly supported\nsince leaving the State Department. On Syria \xe2\x80\x94 in what Goldberg called the\n\xe2\x80\x9csingle sharpest point of disagreement\xe2\x80\x9d between Clinton and Obama expressed\nin the interview \xe2\x80\x94 she suggested that the president\xe2\x80\x99s failure to arm the\nSyrian rebels earlier in the conflict helped created a security \xe2\x80\x9cvacuum\xe2\x80\x9d\nnow filled by jihadists. Goldberg said that Clinton, who advocated a more\nhawkish foreign policy on several issues during her time in the Cabinet,\nmight feel \xe2\x80\x9cvindicated in her position\xe2\x80\x9d that the U.S. should have\nintervened in Syria earlier.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillary hedged in this interview,\xe2\x80\x9d Goldberg told Andrea Mitchell. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s not attacking the president, but I think she felt like, \xe2\x80\x98You know\nwhat, I thought this, and I think events are bearing out the truth of what\nI advocated for.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMitchell asked Goldberg about Clinton and Obama\xe2\x80\x99s differences on Israel,\nnoting that Clinton seemed to be more resolutely siding with Israeli Prime\nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu. \xe2\x80\x9cHillary doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that differently [from\nObama],\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think she\xe2\x80\x99s running for president and he\xe2\x80\x99s not and she\nknows that Israel remains, according to polls, a popular cause in America.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGoldberg added that Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s more unequivocal answer supporting Israel\nlacked some \xe2\x80\x9cnuance,\xe2\x80\x9d adding that her message to the U.S. public and\nNetanyahu was: \xe2\x80\x9c[Obama] had a tough relationship with Israel; I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\nhave a smoother relationship with Israel.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Talking Points Memo blog: TPM Editor\xe2\x80\x99s Blog: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary\'s Delicate,\nDangerous Game\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/hillarys-delicate-dangerous-game>*\n\n\n\nBy Josh Marshall\n\nAugust 11, 2014, 10:56 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nLet\'s start by affirming a few points. After a bruising and devastating\ndefeat to Barack Obama in 2008, Hillary Clinton went on to serve his\nadministration ably, loyally and well for four years. It\'s also true that\nit\'s entirely natural for a future presidential aspirant to find ways to\nseparate herself from the current president, especially one with flagging\npopularity. Indeed, it is incumbent on a would-be president to make clear\nwhat she would have done differently and what she would do if she were\nelected. As President Clinton has said many times, elections are always\nabout the future.\n\n\n\nBut there\'s an element of Hillary\'s strategic distancing I\'ve not seen\nwidely mentioned. President Obama is not popular at the moment. His\npopularity is at best in the low 40s. But among the people who choose\nDemocratic nominees - that is, partisan Democrats - he remains quite\npopular. And even for many Democrats who feel disappointed, let down or\njust worn out by the whole six year journey, President Obama represents\nsomething that transcends how they may feel about him at just this moment.\n\n\n\nQuite apart from the pros and cons of particular foreign policy strategies,\nI believe the great majority of partisan Democrats feel protective of the\nPresident. So it\'s a delicate, perilous thing to criticize him so publicly,\nparticularly at a politically vulnerable moment, especially when the nature\nof the criticism mirrors that of many of the President\'s most dogged and\naggrieved foes.\n\n\n\nThe particular nature of the supposed disagreement adds to the equation.\n\n\n\nRemember that Sen. Clinton\'s hawkishness - summed up by her Iraq War vote\nbut expressed on various fronts during her six years in the Senate - was a\nsignificant reason she lost her primary fight against Obama in 2008. And\nthat\'s matched by what seems to be an effort on Hillary\'s part today to\nposition herself as the candidate of what might be termed the moderate wing\nof the neoconservative foreign policy intelligentsia.\n\n\n\nBoth the positioning and the substance of the positioning hearken back to\nwhat undid Hillary in 2007-08. Indeed, there\'s one more thread: the sense,\ncritical in 2007-08, that Hillary had become a creature of Washington, its\nfactions, its consultants, its conventional wisdoms so impervious to\noutside influence.\n\n\n\nI don\'t pretend any of this is likely to derail her. She\'s phenomenally\npopular and for good reason among Democrats and beats all comers in the\ngeneral. But it all threatens to crystallize a mix of traits many Democrats\ngrew suspicious of in 2008 and could led to a catalyzing if not successful\nprimary challenge to her in 2016.\n\n\n\nPerhaps more than anything, as a political matter, once you loose these\nmemes and mini-controversies, you don\'t necessarily control them. The\nMurdoch press, aggrieved frenemies, Fox News, MSNBC, the Sunday Show crowd\ndo with them what they will. Which is half the point, of course. But not\nnecessarily as you planned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Hill: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary shows her hawkish side\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://thehill.com/policy/international/214900-hillary-shows-her-hawkish-side>*\n\n\n\nBy Peter Sullivan\n\nAugust 12, 2014, 6:00 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton is staking out a more hawkish foreign policy stance than\nPresident Obama as she moves toward a run for the presidency in 2016.\n\n\n\n>From Syria to Israel to Iran, Clinton is beginning to draw contrasts with\nthe man she served under as secretary of State.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a decision on her part to remind people of where she\xe2\x80\x99s coming from\nand how that\xe2\x80\x99s different,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jon Alterman, senior vice president at the\nCenter for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy differs from Obama\xe2\x80\x99s in that it is \xe2\x80\x9ca little more\nmuscular, a little more deliberate and less deliberative,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\n\nThe strongest break came over the weekend, when in an interview Clinton\ncriticized Obama\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to help build up a credible fighting force\xe2\x80\x9d in\nSyria while faulting his foreign policy approach in broad strokes.\n\n\n\n"Great nations need organizing principles, and \'Don\'t do stupid stuff\' is\nnot an organizing principle," she told The Atlantic.\n\n\n\nClinton aides said the interview was part of her book tour, and not about\nthe 2016 campaign or any political strategy.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, the remark could be the start of a more aggressive effort by\nClinton to distance herself from Obama\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy, which scored an\napproval rating of just 36 percent in the most recent NBC/Wall Street\nJournal poll.\n\n\n\nBut shaking off her association with the president could be a tall order,\ngiven that she helped shape major policy decisions from within his Cabinet.\n\n\n\nRepublicans eyeing a presidential run in 2016 have begun to make the link\nbetween Obama and Clinton a point of attack.\n\n\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) over the weekend blamed the \xe2\x80\x9cfailures of the\nObama-Clinton foreign policies\xe2\x80\x9d for the rise of Sunni militants in Iraq.\n\n\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), another rising GOP star, criticized Clinton for\nbacking the U.S. intervention in Libya in 2011.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are some who call Libya \xe2\x80\x98Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s war.\xe2\x80\x99 She was all for it. . \xe2\x80\xa6 And\nif you look objectively at Libya now, it\xe2\x80\x99s a jihadist wonderland there,\xe2\x80\x9d he\ntold The Washington Post earlier this month.\n\n\n\nAnd Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told CNBC that under the Obama administration\nthere has been \xe2\x80\x9cchaos all over the world,\xe2\x80\x9d with Clinton \xe2\x80\x9cat the State\nDepartment while all this was happening.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton has stressed that she often disagreed with the president\xe2\x80\x99s policy\nmoves, most notably on Syria, where she failed to persuade him of the need\nto arm rebel fighters.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe pushed very hard,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton told CNN in June. \xe2\x80\x9cBut as I say in my book,\nI believe that Harry Truman was right, the buck stops with the president.\nAnd the president had very legitimate concerns.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nObama, by contrast, told Thomas Friedman of The New York Times last week\nthe idea that arming the Syrian rebels would have made a difference in the\nconflict is a \xe2\x80\x9cfantasy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton has also begun to diverge on the conflict in Gaza.\n\n\n\nThe administration has repeatedly criticized Israel for not doing enough to\nprevent civilian casualties, earlier this month stating that the United\nStates was \xe2\x80\x9cappalled\xe2\x80\x9d by the shelling of a United Nations school in Gaza.\n\n\n\nClinton took a different tack. Asked by The Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s Jeffrey Goldberg,\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think Israel did enough to limit civilian casualties?\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton\nresponded, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s unclear.

But the president fumed at lawmakers in a private\nmeeting for suggesting he should\xe2\x80\x99ve done more.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama got angry at lawmakers who suggested in a private meeting\nthat he should have armed the Syrian rebels, calling the criticism\n\xe2\x80\x9chorseshit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe argument that America should have done more in Syria, made for years by\nforeign policy leaders in both parties and several members of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\nsenior national security team, was brought back to the fore this past\nweekend. Obama and Hillary Clinton gave dueling interviews in which they\npublicly split on whether the security and humanitarian catastrophe in\nSyria could have been avoided if the United States had played a larger\nrole. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s outburst on July 31, one week prior, reveals the criticism\nwas already getting to him, even before the White House tried to deflect\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s remarks as pre-presidential political posturing.\n\n\n\nJust before the Congressional recess, President Obama invited over a dozen\nSenate and House leaders from both parties to the White House to talk about\nforeign policy. According to two lawmakers inside the meeting, Obama became\nvisibly agitated when confronted by bipartisan criticism of the White\nHouse\xe2\x80\x99s policy of slow-rolling moderate Syrian rebels\xe2\x80\x99 repeated requests\nfor arms to fight the Assad regime and ISIS.\n\n\n\nAccording to one of the lawmakers, Sen. Bob Corker asked the President a\nlong question that included sharp criticisms of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s handling\nof a number of foreign policy issues\xe2\x80\x94including Syria, ISIS, Russia, and\nUkraine. Obama answered Corker at length. Then, the president defended his\nadministration\xe2\x80\x99s actions on Syria, saying that the notion that many have\nput forth regarding arming the rebels earlier would have led to better\noutcomes in Syria was \xe2\x80\x9chorseshit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhite House officials confirmed the charged exchange between Obama and\nCorker but declined to confirm that Obama used the expletive. The\ninteraction between Obama and Corker was a tense moment in the otherwise\nuneventful meeting.\n\n\n\nCorker\xe2\x80\x99s office declined to comment for this story. But days after the\nWhite House meeting, he wrote a blistering op-ed for the Washington Post\ncriticizing Obama\xe2\x80\x99s handling of foreign policy. \xe2\x80\x9cToday, after three years\nof bold rhetoric divorced from reality, 170,000 Syrians are dead, and we\nare not innocent bystanders. The president encouraged the opposition to\nswallow deadly risks, then left them mostly hanging,\xe2\x80\x9d the senator wrote.\n\xe2\x80\x9cExtremist groups from Syria have surged into Iraq, seizing key territory\nand resources, and are threatening to completely undo the progress of years\nof U.S. sacrifice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nTop Democratic lawmakers agreed with Corker and Clinton that doing more to\nsupport the moderate rebels would have at least had a chance of averting or\nmitigating the current crisis, which has now spread to large parts of Iraq\nas ISIS expands its newly declared Caliphate.\n\n\n\nRep. Elliot Engel, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs\nCommittee, arrived at the White House meeting after the Obama-Corker\nexchange. But the congressman also heard Obama defend his Syria policy,\nalthough using more polite language.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe president still feels very strongly that we are deluding ourselves if\nwe think American intervention in Syria early on by assisting these rebels\nwould have made a difference,\xe2\x80\x9d Engel told The Daily Beast in an interview.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe still believes that. I disagree, respectfully. They were not looking\nfor U.S. troops, they were looking for help and the Syria civil war started\nwith the most noblest of causes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn a New York Times interview published Aug. 8, Obama said that the idea\narming the rebels would have made a difference had \xe2\x80\x9calways been a fantasy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis idea that we could provide some light arms or even more sophisticated\narms to what was essentially an opposition made up of former doctors,\nfarmers, pharmacists and so forth, and that they were going to be able to\nbattle not only a well-armed state but also a well-armed state backed by\nRussia, backed by Iran, a battle-hardened Hezbollah, that was never in the\ncards,\xe2\x80\x9d Obama said.\n\n\n\nClinton told The Atlantic in an interview published Aug. 10 that Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\n\xe2\x80\x9cfailure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who were\nthe originators of the protests against Assad\xe2\x80\x94there were Islamists, there\nwere secularists, there was everything in the middle\xe2\x80\x94the failure to do that\nleft a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Clinton revealed that she and then-CIA Director David Petraeus had\npushed a plan earlier that year to arm the Syrian rebels that was rejected\nby the White House. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Joint Chiefs\nChairman Gen. Martin Dempsey later said they supported the plan at that\ntime. Many lawmakers, including Corker and Engel, still support that plan\nand they agree with Clinton that Obama\xe2\x80\x99s policy left a vacuum that ISIS\nrushed to fill.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[ISIS\xe2\x80\x99s threat in Iraq] is definitely tied to Syria because when the\nuprising started against Bashar al Assad, it was a movement of people\nwanting freedom and democracy in Syria, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a war involving jihadism\nat all,\xe2\x80\x9d Engel said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey desperately needed our help, which we didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nsupply, and as a result ISIS got the upper hand. We are now paying the\nprice of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNot all lawmakers support arming the rebels; Sen. Rand Paul, for example,\nis on the record opposing the use of U.S. military resources to fight ISIS\nin Iraq or Syria. Also, Clinton and many lawmakers acknowledge that arming\nthe rebels was risky and might not have worked. The weapons could\'ve fallen\ninto the extremists\' hands, and Syria might have remained a jihadist\nfree-for-all.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I did believe, which is why I advocated this, that if we were to\ncarefully vet, train, and equip early on a core group of the developing\nFree Syrian Army, we would, number one, have some better insight into what\nwas going on on the ground,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n\n\n\nBut experts say Obama still sees Syria as one place where more American\naction will not make things better. Despite an uptick in American action\nacross the border in Iraq\xe2\x80\x94and despite an announcement of a half-billion\ndollars in military aid for the rebels\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely Obama will drastically\nchange his policy.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may never know for sure if ISIS\xe2\x80\x99s decisions were encouraged by Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\nchoices in Syria. What we know for sure is that ISIS metastasized in Syria\nand was not deterred because of anything Obama said or did so far,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nAndrew Tabler, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East\nPolicy. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes standing by and doing relatively nothing in the face of\nsuch a threat implicates you. The question now is, what do we do about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Capital New York: \xe2\x80\x9cSchumer: Hillary would be \xe2\x80\x98so happy\xe2\x80\x99 with D.N.C. in\nBrooklyn\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2014/08/8550538/schumer-hillary-would-be-so-happy-dnc-brooklyn>*\n\n\n\nBy Azi Paybarah\n\nAugust 11, 2014, 3:29 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nAmong the reasons New York\'s senior senator sees that Brooklyn should get\nthe 2016 Democratic National Convention: The location would suit the\nparty\'s most likely nominee.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton, it\xe2\x80\x99s been in the newspaper, wants it in Brooklyn, and she\nwalked the streets of Brooklyn with me when she first campaigned, and I\nthink she would be so so happy if we had the convention in Brooklyn,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nSenator Charles Schumer, standing outside the Barclays Center, where\nDemocratic National Committee officials kicked off their 36-hour tour of\nthe prospective host city.\n\n\n\nClinton did not attend Monday event but prefers the prospective Brooklyn\nsite to other possible host cities, including Philadelphia and Columbus,\nOhio, according to unnamed sources cited by the Times.\n\n\n\nAsked how much his erstwhile junior colleague\'s preference should factor\ninto the selection process, Schumer said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask the\ndelegates. We\xe2\x80\x99re just selling them on Brooklyn. They\xe2\x80\x99ll have to weigh\neverything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA Clinton spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\nOn Monday morning, D.N.C. officials traveled from midtown Manhattan to the\nBarclays Center in \xe2\x80\x9cunder 14 minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter Ragone, a top City Hall aide,\ntold reporters.\n\n\n\nThat\'s important, because Brooklyn doesn\'t have enough hotel rooms to\naccommodate all the delegates who would come to town for the convention.\n\n\n\nRagone acknowledged that the short trip was made possible because committee\nmembers utilized "dedicated lanes" which, he said, are used \xe2\x80\x9cfrequently in\nNew York."\n\n\n\nWhen NBC\'s Melissa Russo noted that most people traveling the same route\nhave much longer commutes, Ragone replied, "We have world leaders visiting\nall the time, including the president, very frequently."\n\n\n\nNew York is bidding against Birmingham, Alabama, in addition to Phoenix and\nPhiladelphia, which is considered early on to be the leading contender.\n\n\n\nThe tour continues Tuesday with breakfast at Rockefeller Center, featuring\nan array of elected officials, \xe2\x80\x9cto demonstrate consensus among the\nDemocratic Party to have this here,\xe2\x80\x9d Ragone said.\n\n\n\nLunch will at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and \xe2\x80\x9cthat will have all the\ncultural leaders of New York City there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThough it would billed as a \xe2\x80\x9cfive-borough\xe2\x80\x9d convention, the heart of it\nwould be in Brooklyn.\n\n\n\nBorough President Eric Adams said Brooklyn is a micrcosm of the United\nStates. City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, of Manhattan, said that\n"Brooklyn\'s story is America\'s story."\n\n\n\nFor Mayor Bill de Blasio, who managed Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2000 Senate campaign in New\nYork, hosting the 2016 convention helps underscore an economic message,\nRagone said: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a concept here that goes beyond just the political\nconvention, which is 54 or 55 million visitors here to New York City every\nyear. ... But we want people to know it\xe2\x80\x99s not just about Manhattan anymore."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*CBS News: \xe2\x80\x9cAs Hillary Clinton criticizes Obama, conservatives balk\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/as-hillary-clinton-criticizes-obama-conservatives-balk/>*\n\n\n\nBy Stephanie Condon\n\nAugust 12, 2014, 6:00 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\'s recent critique of the Obama\nadministration\'s foreign policy, seemingly in preparation for a 2016\npresidential run, has some pundits on the right crying foul.\n\n\n\nBy criticizing President Obama\'s handling of foreign affairs, Clinton is\nattempting to distinguish Mr. Obama\'s view of America\'s role in the world\nfrom her own. Conservatives, however, are questioning how much Mr. Obama\'s\nformer top diplomat can truly distance herself from the administration.\nSome liberals, meanwhile, have revived the argument that Clinton may be too\nhawkish -- a judgment some on the left leveled against her in the 2008\ncampaign.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s harshest criticisms targeted Mr. Obama\'s response to the crisis\nin Syria, telling the The Atlantic\'s Jeffrey Goldberg that the\nadministration\'s actions there amounted to a "failure."\n\n\n\n"The failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who\nwere the originators of the protests against Assad--there were Islamists,\nthere were secularists, there was everything in the middle--the failure to\ndo that left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled," Clinton\nsaid.\n\n\n\nMr. Obama himself has called that line of argument a "fantasy."\n\n\n\n"This idea that we could provide some light arms or even more sophisticated\narms to what was essentially an opposition made up of former doctors,\nfarmers, pharmacists and so forth, and that they were going to be able to\nbattle not only a well-armed state but also a well-armed state backed by\nRussia, backed by Iran, a battle-hardened Hezbollah, that was never in the\ncards," Mr. Obama said in an interview with the New York Times\' Thomas\nFriedman that was published over the weekend.\n\n\n\nMarc Thiessen, a senior White House staffer during the George W. Bush\nadministration who is currently a fellow at the conservative American\nEnterprise Institute, called Mr. Obama\'s defense of his foreign policy\n"absurd."\n\n\n\nAt the same time, he noted that Clinton can\'t easily distance herself from\nMr. Obama\'s policies.\n\n\n\n"If she wants to achieve separation, she will have to answer some tough\nquestions in the period ahead, such as: how hard did she really fight for\narming and training the Free Syrian Army?" Thiessen wrote. "Did she\nthreaten to resign? What specifically did she advocate doing to help the\nopposition? Did she advocate air strikes against ISIS? And - most\nimportantly - did she oppose Obama\'s complete withdrawal from Iraq, which\nalso \'left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled\'?"\n\n\n\nJennifer Rubin, a conservative columnist for the Washington Post, called\nClinton\'s remarks "the worst sort of political opportunism for which she is\ninfamous."\n\n\n\n"For a year and a half after leaving the administration, she has not spoken\nout against the president on Syria or much of anything else," Rubin wrote.\n"She did not have the nerve to resign out of principle on Syria, as did\nformer ambassador Robert Ford. Only now, when the entire region has gone to\nseed she decides the Obama critics were right on some key aspects of\nforeign policy."\n\n\n\nThe Republican opposition research firm America Rising similarly called\nClinton\'s statements amount to " naked political opportunism." The group\npointed to a 2012 interview with CBS News in which shot down the idea of\nmore robustly arming the Syrian rebels.\n\n\n\n"What are we going to arm them with and against what?" Clinton said to CBS\nNews\' Wyatt Andrews. "We\'re not going to bring tanks over the borders of\nTurkey, Lebanon and Jordan... If you\'re a military planner or if you\'re a\nsecretary of state and you\'re trying to figure out do you have the elements\nof an opposition that is actually viable, that we don\'t see."\n\n\n\nClinton\'s political interest in distancing herself from President Obama\'s\nforeign policy is evident: a CBS News poll released last week showed that\nwhile 52 percent of Americans have at least some confidence in Mr. Obama\'s\nability to handle an international crisis, just 25 percent they have a lot\nof confidence -- down 14 points from last September.\n\n\n\nCriticism of Clinton\'s remarks was more muted on the left, though some\nanti-interventionist liberals took issue with her statements.\n\n\n\nLiberal Joan Walsh, the editor of Salon.com, wrote that as a 2008 Clinton\nsupporter, she found the former secretary of state\'s comments "sobering."\nIf Clinton were to run for president again, she "may think she can write\noff the anti-interventionist left - again."\n\n\n\nHowever, Walsh said, "So far, my approach to 2016 is to say that Clinton\nmay not be perfect, but she\'s the not-perfect candidate we know, very well."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Politico: \xe2\x80\x9cKarl Rove: Clinton tries to be \xe2\x80\x98Goldilocks\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/karl-rove-hillary-clinton-goldilocks-109908.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Sarah Smith\n\nAugust 11, 2014, 12:04 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nKarl Rove on Monday characterized Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s split with the\npresident on foreign affairs as the former secretary of state painting\nherself as \xe2\x80\x9cGoldilocks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s trying to position herself as sort of the Goldilocks of foreign\npolicy,\xe2\x80\x9d the Republican strategist said on Fox News\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cHappening Now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna be as belligerent as Bush or as overly cautious as Obama.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRove\xe2\x80\x99s comments were a response to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy interview with\nThe Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s Jeffrey Goldberg, published Sunday, in which Clinton voiced\nher harshest criticism yet of her former boss.
