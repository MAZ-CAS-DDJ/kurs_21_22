Below are some highlights\nfrom her remarks:*\n\n\xc2\xb7         \xe2\x80\x9cWatching the recent funeral for Michael Brown, as a mother, as a\nhuman being, my heart just broke for his familybecause losing a child is\nevery parent\'s greatest fear and an unimaginable loss.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xc2\xb7         \xe2\x80\x9cThis is what happens when the bonds of trust and respect that\nhold any community together fray. Nobody wants to see our streets look like\na war zone, not in America. We are better than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xc2\xb7         \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot ignore the inequities that persist in our\njustice system. Inequities that undermine our most deeply held values of\nfairness and equality.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xc2\xb7         \xe2\x80\x9cImagine what we would feel and what we would do if white drivers\nwere three times as likely to be searched by police during a traffic stop\nas black drivers, instead of the other way around. If white offenders\nreceived prison sentences ten percent longer than black offenders for the\nsame crimes. If a third of all white men \xe2\x80\x93 just look at this room and take\none-third \xe2\x80\x93 went to prison during their lifetime. Imagine that. That is the\nreality in the lives of so many of our fellow Americans and so many of\nthe communities in which they live.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xc2\xb7         \xe2\x80\x9cI applaud President Obama for sending the Attorney General\nto Ferguson and demanding a thorough and speedy investigation. That\xe2\x80\x99s both\nappropriate and necessary to find out what happened, to see that justice\nis done, to help this community begin healing itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xc2\xb7         \xe2\x80\x9cIt was 51 years ago today that Dr. Martin Luther King,\nJr. called us to live out the true meaning of our creed, to make the dream\nreal for all Americans. And that mission is as fiercely urgent today as\nwhen he stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in the hot August\nsun all those years ago. So we have a lot of work to do together.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'
