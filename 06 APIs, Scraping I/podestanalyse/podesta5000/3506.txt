Imperfect but important. And your leadership was\ncritical even if it was sorely missed within the USG in the last few\nmonths.  We are now moving towards implementation - obviously not a short\nterm effort.\n\nI\'m still hung up on women and data as central to success. We are fully\nlaunching at UNGA the really exciting Global Data Partnership we launched\nin Addis with Mexico, Senegal , ONE Campaign, MasterCard and now we are up\nto more than 30 partners. Here\'s a recent blog I did on the topic.\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jul/13/big-small-data-global-development\n\nI can only imagine how busy the campaign is keeping you. Hope one day to\nget your thoughts on SDG implementation. Maybe when I next go home to\nBrooklyn to see my mom I\'ll stop in : )\n\nBest, Daniella\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n\nYou are subscribed to Secretary\'s Remarks for U.S. Department of State.\nThis information has recently been updated, and is now available.\n\nSecretary\'s Remarks: Conclusion of Negotiations on the Post-2015\nDevelopment Agenda<http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/08/245594.htm\n<http://redirect.state.sbu/?url=http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/08/245594.htm>\n>\n08/02/2015 09:38 PM EDT\n\nConclusion of Negotiations on the Post-2015 Development Agenda\n\nPress Statement\nJohn Kerry\nSecretary of State\nWashington, DC\nAugust 2, 2015\n\n________________________________\n\nI applaud today\xe2\x80\x99s successful conclusion of negotiations on an ambitious,\ninclusive Post-2015 Development Agenda.\n\nThe goals and aspirations conveyed through these negotiations expand on the\nsuccesses seen under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), established\nby the global community 15 years ago. Those successes include a dramatic\ndrop in the share of the world\xe2\x80\x99s people living in extreme poverty, an\nequally dramatic increase in the number of people with access to clean\nwater, and long-sought parity among girls and boys in primary-school\nenrollment.\n\nThis bold new agenda of sustainable development goals features\ntransformative objectives for the next 15 years: eradicating extreme\npoverty; ensuring environmental sustainability and conservation; advancing\ngender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls; and building\npeaceful, well-governed, and economically prosperous societies to ensure\nthat we leave no one behind. It also strengthens our collective fight\nagainst those challenges we know keep setting us back, like conflict and\nclimate change.\n\nThis agenda reflects our evolving understanding of how development works,\nbeginning with local empowerment, ownership, and leadership, and made real\nthrough strong partnerships among governments, multinational institutions,\nnonprofit organizations, private companies, and individual citizens, which\ninstill accountability and drive inclusive economic growth.\n\nThe close of negotiations marks a pivotal moment of international consensus\non a common vision for our planet\xe2\x80\x99s future. This is a vision of a better\nworld that provides opportunities for the most vulnerable, and puts our\nplanet on a sustainable path. We must now turn our attention towards\nimplementation to make this vision a reality.\n\nWe look forward to participating in this fall\xe2\x80\x99s United Nations Summit for\nthe adoption of the Post-2015 Development Agenda and setting the course for\nsustained development progress for people around the globe for decades to\ncome.\n\n\nThe Office of Website Management, Bureau of Public Affairs, manages this\nsite as a portal for information from the U.S. State Department.\nExternal links to other Internet sites should not be construed as an\nendorsement of the views or privacy policies contained therein.\n\n________________________________\n\n\n________________________________\n\nExternal links found in this content or on Department of State websites\nthat go to other non-Department websites should not be construed as an\nendorsement of the views or privacy policies contained therein.\n\nUpdate your subscriptions, modify your password or email address, or stop\nsubscriptions at any time on your Subscriber Preferences Page<\nhttp://redirect.state.sbu/?url=https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USSTATEBPA/subscriber/edit?preferences=true#tab1>.\nYou will need to use your email address to log in.
