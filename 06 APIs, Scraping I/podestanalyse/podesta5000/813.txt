Schmidt\n\nNovember 22, 2014\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 A report released late Friday about the fatal 2012 attacks in\nBenghazi, Libya, left Republicans in the same position they have been in\nfor two years: with little evidence to support their most damning critiques\nof how the Obama administration, and then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham\nClinton, responded to the attacks.\n\n\n\nSimilar to five other government reports, the one released by the House\nIntelligence Committee on Friday said that the administration had not\nintentionally misled the public about what occurred during the attacks in\ntalking points it created for officials to use in television appearances\nthat turned out to be inaccurate.\n\n\n\nIt also said that no order was given by the military to \xe2\x80\x9cstand down\xe2\x80\x9d in\nresponding to try to save the four Americans killed in the attacks, a claim\nthat Republicans have made based on the account of a member of the security\nteam in Benghazi that day.\n\n\n\nComing six months after Speaker John A. Boehner created a separate special\ncommittee to investigate the Benghazi attacks, the report raised questions\nabout what that panel might uncover that the Intelligence Committee \xe2\x80\x94 whose\nchairman, Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan, is leaving\nCongress \xe2\x80\x94 and the other investigations missed.\n\n\n\nThe special committee that Mr. Boehner created is led by Representative\nTrey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, who has a budget of $3.3 million\nfor the investigation.\n\n\n\nMr. Gowdy, in a written statement, said that his committee had reviewed the\nlatest findings along with the other reports. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will aid the select\ncommittee\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive investigation to determine the full facts of what\nhappened in Benghazi, Libya, before, during and after the attack and\ncontribute toward our final, definitive accounting of the attack on behalf\nof Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nDemocrats have asserted that the special committee was created by\nRepublicans only to try to discredit Mrs. Clinton, who is expected to seek\nthe Democratic nomination for president in 2016.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe effort to turn the Benghazi tragedy into a political scandal never had\na factual basis,\xe2\x80\x9d said David Brock, founder of Correct the Record, a group\nthat defends Mrs. Clinton in the news media, and author of the e-book \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nBenghazi Hoax.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Republican committee report should close the case,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the\nscandal persists into 2016, it will only be for partisan reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhile the report backed up many of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding claims\nthat its response was proper, it agreed with the other reports that\ncriticized the State Department for having inadequate security at the\ncompound where the ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens, was killed.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe State Department security personnel, resources and equipment were\nunable to counter the terrorist threat that day and required C.I.A.\nassistance,\xe2\x80\x9d it said.\n\n\n\nThe panel\xe2\x80\x99s findings reflected well on the intelligence apparatus,\nparticularly the Central Intelligence Agency. The agency \xe2\x80\x9censured\nsufficient security\xe2\x80\x9d for its facilities in Benghazi and \xe2\x80\x9cwithout a\nrequirement to do so, ably and bravely assisted the State Department on the\nnight of the attacks,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the report.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir actions saved lives,\xe2\x80\x9d the report said.\n\n\n\nThe report said the C.I.A. did not have an \xe2\x80\x9cintelligence failure\xe2\x80\x9d in the\nmonths before the attacks. In fact, the report said, the agency had\nincreased its security because of intelligence reports showing that attacks\nhad intensified in the area.\n\n\n\nIn the course of the investigation, the committee reviewed thousands of\npages of intelligence assessments, cables, emails and other documents, and\nit interviewed many senior intelligence officials and people who were on\nthe ground during the attacks \xe2\x80\x94 including eight security personnel who\nresponded to them, it said.\n\n\n\nRepublican lawmakers have said that the administration, fearing political\nfallout from the attacks \xe2\x80\x94 which occurred on Sept. 11, 2012, less than two\nmonths before the presidential elections \xe2\x80\x94 tried to mislead the public.\n\n\n\nIn particular, the Republicans have said that Susan E. Rice, who was the\nambassador to the United Nations at the time, lied on several Sunday\ntelevision talk shows when she said the attacks were set off by a protest\nover an anti-Muslim video. They claimed that she glossed over whether the\nfatalities were the result of \xe2\x80\x9cterrorist\xe2\x80\x9d attacks by Al Qaeda because that\nwould have undermined the administration\xe2\x80\x99s narrative that it had all but\ndefeated the group.\n\n\n\nThe panel found that in the days after the attacks, there was contradictory\nintelligence about what precipitated them and who was behind them.\nUltimately, Ms. Rice\xe2\x80\x99s assertions were wrong, the committee said, but there\nwas no evidence that the administration was attempting to misconstrue the\nfacts.\n\n\n\nEven today, the report said, the government is still uncertain about much\nof what happened that day.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch of the early intelligence was conflicting, and two years later,\nintelligence gaps remain,\xe2\x80\x9d the report said. A mix of individuals,\n\xe2\x80\x9cincluding those affiliated\xe2\x80\x9d with Al Qaeda, participated in the attacks, it\nsaid, adding, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe intelligence was and remains conflicting\nabout the identities, affiliations and motivations of the attackers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA man accused of being the ringleader of the attackers was apprehended in a\nraid by American commandos in Benghazi in June, and will likely go on trial\nin Washington next year on murder charges.\n\n\n\nThe report also debunked a few accusations against the C.I.A. It said that\nthe agency had not intimidated or prevented \xe2\x80\x9cany officer from speaking to\nCongress or otherwise telling their story.\xe2\x80\x9d It also said that the agency\nhad not administered \xe2\x80\x9cany unusual polygraph exams\xe2\x80\x9d to officers about their\nassignment in Benghazi. And it said that the C.I.A. was not collecting arms\nin Libya and sending them to rebel groups in Syria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*AP: House intel panel debunks many Benghazi theories*\n<http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ecc3a300383445d5a90dd6ca764c9e15/house-intel-panel-debunks-many-benghazi-theories>\n\nBy KEN DILANIAN\nNov. 21, 2014 5:22 PM EST\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 A two-year investigation by the Republican-controlled\nHouse Intelligence Committee has found that the CIA and the military acted\nproperly in responding to the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in\nBenghazi, Libya, and asserted no wrongdoing by Obama administration\nappointees.\n\nDebunking a series of persistent allegations hinting at dark conspiracies,\nthe investigation of the politically charged incident determined that there\nwas no intelligence failure, no delay in sending a CIA rescue team, no\nmissed opportunity for a military rescue, and no evidence the CIA was\ncovertly shipping arms from Libya to Syria.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the attack, intelligence about who carried it\nout and why was contradictory, the report found. That led Susan Rice, then\nU.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to inaccurately assert that the\nattack had evolved from a protest, when in fact there had been no protest.\nBut it was intelligence analysts, not political appointees, who made the\nwrong call, the committee found. The report did not conclude that Rice or\nany other government official acted in bad faith or intentionally misled\nthe American people.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee report was released with little fanfare on\nthe Friday before Thanksgiving week. Many of its findings echo those of six\nprevious investigations by various congressional committees and a State\nDepartment panel. The eighth Benghazi investigation is being carried out by\na House Select Committee appointed in May.\n\nThe attacks in Benghazi killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, foreign\nservice officer Sean Smith, and two CIA contractors, Tyrone S. Woods and\nGlen Doherty. A Libyan extremist, Ahmed Abu Khatalla, is facing trial on\nmurder charges after he was captured in Libya and taken to the U.S.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attacks, Republicans criticized the Obama\nadministration and its then-secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who\nis expected to run for president in 2016. People in and out of government\nhave alleged that a CIA response team was ordered to "stand down" after the\nState Department compound came under attack, that a military rescue was\nnixed, that officials intentionally downplayed the role of al-Qaida figures\nin the attack, and that Stevens and the CIA were involved in a secret\noperation to spirit weapons out of Libya and into the hands of Syrian\nrebels. None of that is true, according to the House Intelligence Committee\nreport.\n\nThe report did find, however, that the State Department facility where\nStevens and Smith were killed was not well-protected, and that State\nDepartment security agents knew they could not defend it from a well-armed\nattack. Previous reports have found that requests for security improvements\nwere not acted upon in Washington.\n\n"We spent thousands of hours asking questions, poring over documents,\nreviewing intelligence assessments, reading cables and emails, and held a\ntotal of 20 committee events and hearings," said Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich.,\nthe committee\'s chairman, and Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland,\nthe ranking Democrat, in a joint statement.\n\n"We conducted detailed interviews with senior intelligence officials from\nBenghazi and Tripoli as well as eight security personnel on the ground in\nBenghazi that night. Based on the testimony and the documents we reviewed,\nwe concluded that all the CIA officers in Benghazi were heroes. Their\nactions saved lives," they said.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who serves on the intelligence\npanel and the Benghazi select committee, said, "It\'s my hope that this\nreport will put to rest many of the questions that have been asked and\nanswered yet again, and that the Benghazi Select Committee will accept\nthese findings and instead focus its attention on the State Department\'s\nprogress in securing our facilities around the world and standing up our\nfast response capabilities."\n\nSome of the harshest charges have been leveled at Rice, now Obama\'s\nnational security adviser, who represented the Obama administration on\nSunday talk shows the weekend after the attack. Rice repeated talking\npoints that wrongly described a protest over a video deemed offensive to\nMuslims.\n\nBut Rice\'s comments were based on faulty intelligence from multiple\nagencies, according to the report. Analysts received 21 reports that a\nprotest occurred in Benghazi, the report said \xe2\x80\x9414 from the Open Source\nCenter, which reviews news reports; one from the CIA; two from the Defense\nDepartment; and four from the National Security Agency.\n\nIn the years since, some participants in the attack have said they were\nmotivated by the video. The attackers were a mix of extremists and hangers\non, the investigation found.\n\n"To this day," the report said, "significant intelligence gaps regarding\nthe identities, affiliations and motivations of the attackers remain."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*American Bridge 21st Century: House Intel Panel Quietly Releases Benghazi\nReport That Clears Obama Administration of Wrongdoing Yet Again\n<http://benghazicommittee.com/house-intel-panel-quietly-releases-benghazi-report-that-clears-obama-administration-of-wrongdoing-yet-again/>*\n\n\n\nThe Republican-led House Intelligence Committee\xe2\x80\x99s two-year investigation\ninto Benghazi is the seventh major probe into the attacks to clear the\nObama Administration of wrongdoing.

Similar to the many preceding investigations\ninto the attacks -- including the Accountability Review Board and the\nbipartisan U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence -- the report found\nthat no stand down order was issued during the attacks, there was no\nintelligence failure leading up to the attack, and that the talking points\nthe administration used in the days following the attacks were based on the\nCIA\'s best assessment at the time.\n\nThe November 23 edition of Fox News Sunday did not inform viewers of the\nreport\'s findings. This stands in stark contrast to Fox\'s longstanding\ncampaign to promote myths about the attacks.\n\nFox has been a tireless promoter of nearly every facet of the Benghazi\nhoax. In the 20 months following the attacks, Fox ran over 1,100 segments\non Benghazi and hosted Republicans at a rate of 30:1 over Democrats to\ndiscuss the issue. Meanwhile, the network has routinely ignored and\ndownplayed evidence refuting its conspiracy theories.\n\nCNN media critic Brian Stelter noted that other Fox programs only provided\ncursory coverage of the report on the night of its release and that Fox\nnever mentioned it the following day. According to Stelter (emphasis added):\n\nSTELTER: Boy, has Fox News spent a lot of time over the past two years\nfocused on the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, and I mean a lot\nof time. [...] But when a new Benghazi report came out on Friday, there was\nhardly a peep, and maybe that\'s because the report, which was Republican\nled, it was by the House Intelligence committee, debunks many of the myths\nthat have run rampant on Fox News and in conservative media circles. [...]\nSo I have to wonder: will Fox will stop aggressively pushing its theories\nabout Benghazi? Probably not. With its audience largely in the dark about\nthe latest findings, the myths may, and perhaps will, live on.\n\nOn the November 23 edition of Fox News\' own MediaBuzz, host Howard Kurtz\nnoted that it only received "brief" coverage on Fox and that the results of\nthe two-year long investigation "deserved more coverage from all news\noutlets."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*FROM MEDIA MATTERS FOR AMERICA: Media Matters for America: \xe2\x80\x9cMedia Lessons\n>From The Benghazi Charade\xe2\x80\x9d*\n\n\n\nBy Eric Boehlert\n\nNovember 24, 2014\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] For Fox News, It\'s Six Strikes And You\'re Out\n\n\n\nThe calling cards of anger and denial have been on display since Friday\nafternoon when the House Intelligence Committee, led by Republican Rep.\nMike Rogers, released the findings of its two-year investigation into the\n2012 terror attack in Benghazi. Becoming the sixth government inquiry to\ncome to a similar conclusion, the report found nothing to support the\nallegations behind Fox News\' ongoing Benghazi witch-hunt. And that\'s where\nthe anger and denial came in.\n\n\n\nAppearing on CNN, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has staked his\nprofessional reputation on the endless claim of an elaborate White House\ncover-up, flashed irritation when he denounced the House report as being\n"full of crap."\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Fox News contributor Stephen Hayes did his best to deflate the\nsupposedly "deeply flawed" Republican report:\n\n\n\n*Weekly Standard\xe2\x80\x99s Stephen Hayes *@stephenfhayes: I\'d caution against\nreaching firm conclusions based on the #Benghazi report issued by the House\nIntel cmte. It\'s deeply flawed. [11/21/14, *7:57 p.m. EST*]\n\n\n\nFor Benghazi conspiracy disciples, unanswered questions always remain as\nlong as devotees say so, and as long as the answers provided by government\n(and Republican-led investigations) don\'t match up their conspiracy\nnarrative. But apparently if the seventh investigation finds wrongdoing on\nthe part of the administration, that\'s the one that will really matter?\n\n\n\nSorry Fox News, but six strikes and you\'re out.\n\n\n\nStill, Benghazi Truthers, like Joel Pollak at Breitbart, soldiered on,\nclaiming the exhaustive House report was no big deal [emphasis added]:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe House committee, chaired by Republican Mike Rogers (R-MI), found that\nthere was no intelligence failure leading up to the attack, and that the\nCIA and military personnel present did the best they could. The crucial new\nfinding is that there was no \xe2\x80\x98stand down\xe2\x80\x99 order, as some there have\nclaimed, and that no further military resources were available.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe three points Pollack mentioned that were debunked by the House report\nrepresented almost the entire basis of the "scandal" crusade. They were\neasily the inspiration for hundreds of Fox News programming hours over the\nlast two years, and likely thousands of hours of talk radio attacks on\nObama, Hillary Clinton and anyone connected to the administration. (Note\nthat Fox aired 100 segments on the "stand down" allegation alone during its\nevening programs in the 20 months following the attack.)\n\n\n\nWhile Breitbart and other right-wing media players gallantly tried to play\ndefense (it\'s just a flesh wound), Fox News simply went into denial as the\ncable news channel essentially turned a blind eye to the story: Fox\nNews Sunday completely ignored the topic. But it wasn\'t just Fox\nNews Sunday. CBS\' Face The Nation and ABC\'s This Week also ignored news\nabout the latest Benghazi debunking; a Republican debunking no less.\n\n\n\nThere was something fitting about those two omissions, considering CBS and\nABC likely suffered the two worst Benghazi-related black eyes within the\nmainstream media when their reporters, Lara Logan and Jonathan Karl\nrespectively, flew too close to the far-right flame and got very badly\nburned. (Note to reporters: When your sources have to make stuff up about\nBenghazi, it\'s a pretty good indication the \'scandal\' is lacking.)\n\n\n\nAnd don\'t forget how Logan played ball with at least one vociferous\nBenghazi critic behind the scenes while putting her fatally flawed 60\nMinutes report together. According to a May report in New York magazine,\nLogan met with Sen. Graham, who helped shape the Benghazi story. Then when\nthe 60 Minutes segment aired he immediately cheered it on, calling it a\n"death blow" to the White House and announced he\'d block every White House\nappointee until he got more answers about Benghazi.\n\n\n\nIn other words, the Benghazi lessons to be learned here aren\'t only for Fox\nNews. Media Matters has spent the better part of two years detailing how\nBeltway reporters, producers and pundits who should\'ve known better have\nplayed along with the contrived conspiracy talking points about the\nDemocratic president and a far-reaching cover-up. (Is Benghazi to Obama\nwhat Whitewater was to Bill Clinton?)\n\n\n\nThere\'s clearly been plenty of Pavolivan behavior on display here:\nRepublicans ring the Benghazi "scandal" bell and the press presents is as\nnews. For two years. (See here, here, here, here and here for National\nJournal columnist Ron Fournier\'s contribution to the bogus genre.)\n\n\n\nFor instance, just last spring major Beltway news outlets appeared to be in\ncomplete agreement that Benghazi represented a major hurdle in Hillary\nClinton\'s path to the White House, should she choose to pursue the\nDemocratic nomination. The story was "quickly growing into a potentially\ndevastating target of opportunity for the GOP," reported the Christian\nScience Monitor, while The National Journal claimed Benghazi represented\n"perhaps the biggest thing" she\'ll have to combat on the campaign trail. By\nplaying along with the flimsy premise, the press simply bolstered the\nRepublican goal of portraying Benghazi as a pending Democratic doomsday.\n(ABC News: "Scandal City.")\n\n\n\nThe media\'s proof for that sweeping claim about Benghazi possibly dooming\nHillary? There was none. But Republican sources were saying it was true, so\ntoo many journalists typed it up as analysis.\n\n\n\nAs for Benghazi conspiracy theorists backing down? Not likely. Recall this\nAssociated Press report from July 10:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe testimony of nine military officers undermines contentions by\nRepublican lawmakers that a \xe2\x80\x98stand-down order\xe2\x80\x99 held back military assets\nthat could have saved the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans killed\nat a diplomatic outpost and CIA annex in Benghazi, Libya.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nEven after nine U.S. military officers debunked and denied the "stand down"\nclaim under oath, it wasn\'t enough to move Fox off its talking point.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that over the last two years Fox News has claimed Obama never\ncalled the Benghazi attack an act of terror, that former CIA director David\nPetraeus was forced to resign because of Benghazi, and that the White House\nhad demanded changes in the original Benghazi talking points. They\'ve\ninsisted Obama watched Americans die in real time on September 11, 2012 and\nrefused to send help. That so-called whistleblowers have been blocked from\ntestifying, along with Benghazi survivors. Also, that Hillary Clinton faked\na concussion in order to avoid testifying about the terror attack. (That\nlast claim is all you really need to know about the Benghazi charade.)\n\n\n\nWhy the endless obsession?\n\n\n\nTwo years ago I highlighted an unhinged Benghazi column from a Boston\nHerald conservative, published on the eve of the presidential election that\nseemed to perfectly capture the larger-than-life meaning of Benghazi within\nthe Obama-hating community. According to the conservative writer, Benghazi\nconfirmed that Obama is "cowardly," "dishonest" and that he lacks\n"integrity" as well as "competence." Plus, he supposedly has a "reflexive\nimpulse to blame, rather than defend, America."\n\n\n\nThe point is, die-hard Obama haters are always going to say those things\nabout the president. Benghazi simply gave them a useful framework: He\'s the\nManchurian Candidate who let Americans die in Benghazi and "sacrificed\nAmerican lives for politics."\n\n\n\nBenghazi conspiracies have come to represent a vile and ugly chapter in\nAmerican politics. It\'s a chapter built upon hypocrisy and cynical Fox News\nethics. Journalists should keep that in mind the next time the right-wing\nmedia launch a hollow "cover-up" crusade against a Democrat.\n'
