I\nwant to emphasize that THIS *WILL* CHANGE because the team will have better\nideas on methodology and the strategy will evolve as the project\nprogresses.  I would still assume our budget will be in the $2+ million\nrange per my earlier memo, even though the attached budget is lower than $2\nmillion (obviously, we are going to make this as cheap as we can without\nsacrificing thoroughness and quality).\n\nBelow is information on the participants.  Attached is (1) a revised\noverview of the process and (2) a budget.\n\n*Please let me know if there are any objections or recommended changes,\notherwise I will proceed with the plan as outlined.*\n\nThanks!\n\nTHE TEAM:\nPollsters:  Jef Pollock and John Anzalone\n\nMedia consultant: Saul Shorr (like Jef and John, I will ask that he\nparticipate in the project, with no obligation by you or him that he work\nfor the campaign, should you decide to run.  I will offer Saul $20k plus\ntravel costs to work with us for the next three months and attend a number\nof the focus groups).\n\nAdvisors: I will have Wendy provide input on the instruments and\nmethodology for the first round--then we can evaluate the degree we want to\nshare data.  I would like to talk to her before we lock this in, since I\nhave never met her.\n\nSELF RESEARCH\nWe don't have a thematically organized set of self research on the your\naccomplishments pre-State.  I would like to give the pollsters full access\nto all raw materials on accomplishments pre 2009, especially the Senate.\nIt's very important that we come out of this process understanding which\naccomplishments are most meaningful to voters.\n\nPOLICY\nI would like to loop Dan and Jake into drafting of likely policy\ninitiatives for testing--they have already provided me some input, but I'd\nlike to get them on calls with the team to drill down on this in more\ndetail, since it's so important.  I know that policy is still a nascent\nprocess and will be highly iterative, but I don't think it makes sense to\ndo the polling in isolation from the policy work itself (since the research\nshould be supporting and informing the policy development).\n"
