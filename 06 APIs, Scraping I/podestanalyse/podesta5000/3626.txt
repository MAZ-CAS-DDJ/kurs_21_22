He\nsummoned his cabinet and senior advisers for a meeting at the White House\nto underscore the significance of the issue.\n\nAt the meeting, Mr. Obama was expected to sign a presidential memorandum\ncreating the task force, and to receive a report from the White House\nCouncil on Women and Girls titled \x93Rape and Sexual Assault: A Renewed Call\nto Action<https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1008370-white-house-sexual-assault-report.html>.\x94\nThe report says that one in five college students are sexually assaulted,\nbut just 12 percent of those victims report the violence.\n\nWhile both the administration and the news media have paid greater\nattention recently to sexual assaults in the military, rape is most common\non college campuses, according to the council\x92s report. The problem, it\nsays, is exacerbated by students\x92 alcohol and drug use.\n\nAccording to the White House, Mr. Obama will give the new task force 90\ndays to recommend actions that colleges and universities can take to\nprevent rape and sexual assault and to respond to allegations. It will also\nbe charged with proposing ways to raise awareness of schools\x92 records on\nthe matter, and to get federal agencies involved when institutions at which\nsexual assaults are occurring do not address the problems.\n\nLast month, Mr. Obama gave the Pentagon a year to address a wave of sexual\nassaults in the military and to show improvement.\n'
