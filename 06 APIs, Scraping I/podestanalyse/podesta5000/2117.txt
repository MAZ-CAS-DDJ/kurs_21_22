john.podesta@gmail.comb"Hi everyone\nA few great updates on the labor front today, building off our big SEIU\nendorsement on Tuesday.\n\n1.  Today, the Ironworkers Union and Laborer International Union\n(collectively representing another 820,000 members) voted to endorse HRC.\nVery exciting!  Their press releases are scheduled to go out on Monday\n(Ironworkers) and Tuesday (LIUNA).  Again, great collaboration with our\npolicy team on both of these.\n\n**I have submitted to Amanda two call sheets to thank O'Sullivan and Dean\nfor their endorsement.  It would help me a lot to get those calls completed\nby Monday.  Just quick thank yous.  Those sheets are attached.\n\n2.  We are building for a great crowd in Boston for our Hardhats for\nHillary launch on November 29th.  We have four national building and\nconstruction trades Presidents confirmed to attend already.  We've hosted\nthree build calls and should have hard counts on Monday.  T-shirts, signs,\nbanners are being ordered.  I expect a great turn out of rank and file\nunion members for this event.  We'll be signing folks up to help in NH.\n\n3.  With LIUNA's endorsement, the National Building and Construction Trades\nPresident Sean McGarvey has the support to bring a national building and\nconstruction trades endorsement for HRC to a vote.  I would be on the look\nout for this immediately after Boston.  The final politics are being worked\nout now.  They have never endorsed a Presidential candidate as a body\nbefore.\n\n4.  HRC met with AFGE Executive Board yesterday.  They were very friendly\nand positive.  I  am following up with them as they are next endorsement\ntop target.\n\nIf only all weeks could be this sweet:)\n\nThanks all.\n\n-- \nNikki Budzinski\nLabor Outreach Director\nHillary for America\n646-854-1442 (direct)\n"
