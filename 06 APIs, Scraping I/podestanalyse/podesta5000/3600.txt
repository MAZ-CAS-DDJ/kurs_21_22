john.podesta@gmail.comb'Realizing Jen is making edits presently, I have three flags:\n\n1. I also dislike the current reference to her 2007 Blackberry. As written,\nit seems like a strained attempt to make her seem relatable. If the point\nof it is to say that she was used to having only one email when she was a\nsenator, and simply wanted to continue that arrangement when she became\nSecretary, then the Blackberry reference would make sense bc it would help\nexplain how she made this decision in the first place. But it needs to be\nrewritten to be understood that way.\n\n2. This line - "\xe2\x80\x8eThis process of looking backwards to see if something\nshould have been classified at the time is fine" - is problematic. We\nshould not think it is fine to find something that "should have been\nclassified at the time." Our position is that no such material exists, else\nit could be said she mishandled classified info. We need to clarify to make\nclear we mean that it is fine to perform redactions today, but in doing so\nit doesnt mean that the material was classified at the time it was sent.\n\n3. In this line - "Some will be serious, some will be personal or mundane"\n- the word "serious" reads ominously/ suggestive of wrongdoing. I would say\nsomething like "some will give a real window into the day-to-day workings\nof the State Department..."\n\nOn Friday, August 21, 2015, Jennifer Palmieri <jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Yeah \xe2\x80\x93 I am trimming down more.\n>\n>\n>\n> *From:* Robby Mook [mailto:re47@hillaryclinton.com\n> <javascript:_e(%7B%7D,\'cvml\',\'re47@hillaryclinton.com\');>]\n> *Sent:* Friday, August 21, 2015 11:29 PM\n> *To:* Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com\n> <javascript:_e(%7B%7D,\'cvml\',\'gruncom@aol.com\');>>\n> *Cc:* Jennifer Palmieri <jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com\n> <javascript:_e(%7B%7D,\'cvml\',\'jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com\');>>;\n> Margolis, Jim <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com\n> <javascript:_e(%7B%7D,\'cvml\',\'Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com\');>>; Dan Schwerin <\n> schwerin@gmail.com <javascript:_e(%7B%7D,\'cvml\',\'schwerin@gmail.com\');>>;\n> John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com\n> <javascript:_e(%7B%7D,\'cvml\',\'john.podesta@gmail.com\');>>; Brian Fallon <\n> bfallon@hillaryclinton.com\n> <javascript:_e(%7B%7D,\'cvml\',\'bfallon@hillaryclinton.com\');>>\n> *Subject:* Re: Script\n>\n>\n>\n> Voila.
