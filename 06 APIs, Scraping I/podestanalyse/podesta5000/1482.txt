john.podesta@gmail.comb"John,\xa0\n\nWow, it's been an incredible month so far. As I've travelled around Indiana talking with folks, I can feel a real energy building for our campaign. People are sick and tired of the politics-as-usual, with divisive rhetoric and partisan gridlock.\xa0\n\nBelieve me, I know. I've seen it. But, I've also seen how we can get things done. I know we can do it again -- by expecting and demanding more from our leaders.\xa0\n\nI'm running to bring that leadership and accountability to Washington.\xa0To get there, I need you with me, John.\xa0We know that groups led by Karl Rove and the Koch brothers are going to do all they can to win this seat. We can't let that happen.\n\nPitch in $10 today to help us reach our July grassroots fundraising goal. We're just $1,533 away. Your help right now gives us the best shot at building a campaign that can defeat the special interests.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/baron-july?refcode=20150730&amount=25\n\nHitting these monthly goals is critical to our campaign because it allows us to make the early investments that will be vital on Election Day. If we fall behind now, we'll find ourselves even farther behind come next year.\xa0\n\nKeep this campaign strong and make a contribution today.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/baron-july?refcode=20150730&amount=25\n\nThanks for being with me,\xa0\n\nBaron \n\nPaid for by Baron Hill for Indiana\n\nPO Box 30675\nIndianapolis, IN 46230\n\nTo unsubscribe from this mailing list, click here - http://images.myngp.com/unsubscribe.aspx?crypt=Casv%2frrJxGATFUPEDM6baN3udw7F%2b%2bEdNB48cxCQ1es%3d\n\nPowered by NGP VAN, Inc.\n\n"
