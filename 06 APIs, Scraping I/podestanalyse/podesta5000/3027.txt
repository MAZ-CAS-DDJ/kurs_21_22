Obviously the import of those committees has declined in the super PAC era, but it's more a question of no Democrat who A) wants to be VP B) Wants to provide a challenge to Hillary from the Left and C) Wants to be best positioned if she decides not to run, or some combination thereof has yet to take the plunge. For instance, Gov. Dean formed his exploratory committee in around this time in 2002, and we've generally seen presidential cycles accelerate over the years. So what's taking Democrats so long? Are they making the wrong decision by waiting for Hillary to decide what to do? More pointedly, is the fact that most Democrats are waiting on the sidelines for Clinton to announce her intentions putting the party at risk if she decides not to run. Can they build the required infrastructure/name recognition/fundraising base/etc. starting early next year?\n>> \n>> The second story is the sequel. How does a Democrat run against Hillary (and Obama) in the primary. If history is a guide, after eight years of one party in power the incumbent party is at a disadvantage. How does a Democrat not named Clinton navigate the complicated personal and political dynamics of the party to make a name for themselves in a field with Clinton in it, and to what extent can they break with Obama? What will be the rules of the road for the not-Clinton candidate?\n>> \n>> I'd appreciate any help you can provide. I'm on my cell at any time if the phone is easier.\n>> Thanks so much,\n>> Zeke\n>> \n>> -- \n>> Zeke Miller\n>> Political Reporter\n>> Time Magazine\n>> @ZekeJMiller\n>> c: 516-581-9301\n>> w: 202-861-4096\n> \n"
