Winning will mean we make real progress towards some of the most critical issues of our time, and losing could mean even more years of Republican stonewalling.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important that we join forces to defeat Rob Portman. Senator Portman will do anything to hold onto his seat, and the Koch brothers are doing everything they can, and spending millions, to keep the Senate red.\n\nWill you contribute to make sure that we can reach our $1 million grassroots funding goal and take back the Senate from Portman and his backers?\n\n http://links.e.tedstrickland.com/ctt?kn=4&ms=ODM4NTM2MwS2&r=MTAyNDUyNjI4OTcwS0&b=2&j=ODIzMDE1NDk3S0&mt=1&rt=0 \n\nWe can do this if we work together. We\xe2\x80\x99re so close to hitting our goal already -- we are on track to raise a whopping $1 million. And, like Chuck said, it\xe2\x80\x99s so important that we do. In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely necessary for the state of our nation in the coming years.\n\nWith your help, we will the power to win this election and win back Senate control. Will you make a final contribution  before the deadline?\n\n http://links.e.tedstrickland.com/ctt?kn=1&ms=ODM4NTM2MwS2&r=MTAyNDUyNjI4OTcwS0&b=2&j=ODIzMDE1NDk3S0&mt=1&rt=0 \n\nYou are going to make all the difference. Are you with me?\n\nTed Strickland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.
