She\'s already signed up for five volunteer shifts this weekend, and is ready to sign up for two more. Unfortunately, without your support, she won\'t have what she needs to be effective. Click below and donate so that Nicole has the materials she needs.\xc2\xa0\n\n- $10 - Pens and paper <https://garcetti.ngpvanhost.com/crmapi/contribute/em051713>\n- $25 - Pens, paper, and a clipboard <https://garcetti.ngpvanhost.com/crmapi/contribute/em051713>\n- $100 - Pens, paper, a clipboard, and food for the weekend <https://garcetti.ngpvanhost.com/crmapi/contribute/em051713>\n- $500 - All of that for Nicole and four of her friends <https://garcetti.ngpvanhost.com/crmapi/contribute/em051713>\n- $1300 - Everything we\'ve mentioned already, plus a TV commercial playing in the background <https://garcetti.ngpvanhost.com/crmapi/contribute/em051713>\nThere are four days left, and Nicole is going to give it all she can.
