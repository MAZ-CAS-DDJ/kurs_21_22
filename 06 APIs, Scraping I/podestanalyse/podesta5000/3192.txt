The\n> video showcases the candidates own remarks on choice, including their\n> opposition to Roe v. Wade.\n> \n> "Voters may not hear John McCain and Sarah Palin talk about their\n> opposition to abortion in their daily appearances on the campaign\n> trail, but their positions are hard to deny," Keenan said. "John\n> McCain and Sarah Palin want to outlaw abortion, with no exception for\n> cases of rape or incest. Americans are not going to support the\n> McCain-Palin ticket when all they stand for is another four years of\n> Bush-style politics in the White House."\n> \n> This video series is intended to introduce pro-choice voters to the\n> McCain-Palin ticket, and in particular the mostly unknown and unvetted\n> Sarah Palin. The first video, which highlights Palin\'s opposition to\n> abortion, including cases of rape, will be sent to half a million\n> pro-choice activists. In addition, special ad buys are planned on\n> sites, like Facebook, aimed at young voters, and also blogs and Google\n> that will help reach pro-choice Republican and Independent women that\n> NARAL Pro-Choice America is unique in targeting.\n> \n> Highlights from the video:\n> *\tJohn McCain: "I favor the ultimate repeal of Roe v.
