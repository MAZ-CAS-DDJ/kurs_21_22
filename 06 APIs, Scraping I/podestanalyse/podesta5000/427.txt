The NIE confirms what has been apparent for some time: the situation in Afghanistan is increasingly precarious. While the Bush Doctrine may have been "preventive war," the concept of "prevention" clearly has never applied to their actual handling of foreign and domestic issues. With the current economic crisis, Iraq, Katrina, and Pakistan, the Bush administration only changed its approach after each became a full blown crisis. Similarly, violence has increased every year in Afghanistan but it was not until this summer that the Bush administration finally announced that it would change its approach and send more troops to Afghanistan. This is welcome, but a comprehensive adjustment in the overall strategy well beyond any troop increase is needed. Instead of ignoring Afghanistan, as Senator McCain has done, the U.S. must shift its focus and resources from Iraq back to Afghanistan and to those who attacked us on 9-11.\n\nNational Intelligence Estimate finds Afghanistan in a "downward spiral."  A draft National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Afghanistan found that the country is in chaos.  Violence has skyrocketed, but beyond the escalation of extremist attacks, the report also assesses "that many of Afghanistan\'s most vexing problems are of the country\'s own making," according to intelligence officials.  "[R]ampant corruption within the government of President Hamid Karzai" and "the destabilizing impact of the booming heroin trade, which by some estimates accounts for 50 percent of Afghanistan\'s economy" have contributed to the deteriorating situation.  The NIE\'s "conclusions represent a harsh verdict on decision-making in the Bush administration," whose "lack of leadership" contributed to the worsening crisis, according to Henry Crumpton, formerly the State Department\'s top counter-terrorism official.  According to the Washington Post, alarms were not sounded until early this year, "when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice returned from a trip to Afghanistan in early February," but "seven months would pass before the administration, distracted by issues as serious as the Iraq war and as far afield as the Olympics, was seized with the urgency to put a new strategy in place."

In 2003, McCain said we could just "muddle through in Afghanistan." Now that the situation has deteriorated, McCain\'s plan for Afghanistan is essentially just with more troops on the ground.  When comparing Afghanistan to Iraq at Tuesday\'s debate McCain said, "most importantly, we have to have the same strategy." But this has been insufficient. General Petraeus recently said, "People often ask, \'What did you learn from Iraq that might be transferable to Afghanistan?\'  The first lesson, the first caution really, is that every situation like this is truly and absolutely unique, and has its own context and specifics and its own texture."  McKiernan argued that more troops "are urgently required to combat a worsening insurgency, but he stated emphatically that no Iraq-style \'surge\' of forces will end the conflict there."  Petraeus also "says his tactics in Iraq cannot simply be transposed to Afghanistan. Indeed, there are big differences: Iraq is far richer, has a greater density of both American and local forces, its command is more unified, and insurgents enjoy nothing like the cross-border safe havens that the Taliban has in Pakistan\'s tribal belt."  The surge in Iraq is not a cookie-cutter strategy that can just be applies to all insurgencies. [Council on Foreign Relations, 11/5/03.

The U.S. needs more than a military-centric strategy to arrest Afghanistan\'s "downward spiral," it must also pursue a broader strategy that focuses on developing the Afghan state.  More troops are needed to arrest the increase in violence and the U.S. must develop a strategy to deal with the Taliban-Al Qaeda safe havens in Pakistan. But ultimate success requires building the capacity of the state that will put Afghanistan on the path to self government. The U.S. must help Afghanistan expand development and reconstruction activities, address the opium trade, encourage efforts to fight corruption, and improve the rule of law. While Iraq has received a total of $34.2 billion in reconstruction funding over five years, Afghanistan by comparison has received just $11.5 billion over almost seven years that U.S. forces have been on the ground and just $1.1 billion for 2008. Since the war began, "reconstruction goals have not been met due to inadequate coordination and implementation of a reconstruction strategy, insufficient funding, the mismanagement of reconstruction monies and corruption, the sidelining of the Afghan government, and growing insecurity." This must change. While Afghanistan has never been a western-style nation-state with a strong central government, progress can be made in stabilizing the country if urgent and comprehensive action is taken.
