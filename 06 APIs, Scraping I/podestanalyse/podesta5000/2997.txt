john.podesta@gmail.comb"Is the mayor's event a Vets event?  Assuming yes, I agree with Alyssa\nthat it will  look strange to do our own thing under the circumstances\nand this would be the one to drop by.\n\nIn terms of Thursday, I don't want to have an avail unless we have\nsomething to say - and I don't' want to do it for WH staff appointments\nThematically we were looking for a strong bipartisan hit for this week\nso the question is whether there is something we can put together for\nThursday along those lines \n\nI am not as worried about giving them pictures this week since we have\nthe radio address again Saturday and then 60 minutes on Sunday\n\n \n\nFrom: Alyssa Mastromonaco \nSent: Monday, November 10, 2008 2:01 PM\nTo: 'john.podesta@gmail.com'; Pete Rouse; Jim Messina; Stephanie Cutter;\nDan Pfeiffer; Robert Gibbs; Anita Dunn\nCc: Emmett Beliveau; Danielle Crutchfield\nSubject: THIS WEEK\n\n \n\nMcCain is off for Thursday. He is a possibility next Monday. \n\nTOMORROW: The Mayor is now hosting an event at Daley Plaza at 12PM. Do\nwe want to just drop by that? NEED ANSWER ASAP.\n\nIf answer is no, then we can go to Vets Memorial. But might be weird to\navoid Mayor's deal totally.\n\n60 MINUTES taping time is set for Friday.\n\n \n\nWhat are next steps for Thursday now that McCain is off - do we need\navail space?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11                         Chicago\n\nVeteran's Day \n\n9:30 am - en route\n9:50 am - Call with the Holy Father (Denis)\n10:00 - 10:30 am - PDB at HQ\n10:40 am - Meet Tammy D\n10:50 - 11:20 am  - Veterans Day Observance w/Tammy Duckworth, (lay a\nwreath 11th of 11th day of 11th - Eternal Flame at Daley Plaza)\n1:00 - 3:00 pm - Meetings per Froman (transition HQ)\n3:15 - 4:00 pm - Call Schedule (Denis)\n4:30 pm - Private Meeting per BO (#1 hold slot)\n9:00 pm - Daily Team Call\n\n12                           Chicago\n\n*JRB travels to Chicago, no RON\n\n10:00 - 10:30 am - PDB\n10:30 - 11:00 am - Inauguration Meeting\n11:00 - 1:00 pm - Economic Policy Meeting\n1:00 - 1:30 pm - Lunch/break\n1:30 - 3:30 pm - Froman/Rahm/Pete meeting \n3:45 - 4:15 pm - Meet with JRB\n4:30 pm - Private Meeting per BO (#1 back up)\n9:00 pm - Daily Team Call\n\n13                           Chicago\n\n \n\n \n\nWork out \nPolicy Time \nPolitical Conf Calls \n12pm - Meet with Bob Bauer  \nPrivate Meetings\nCall Schedule\n45 mins PDB\n9:00 pm - Daily Team Call\n\n14                          Chicago \n\n \n9:30 - 10:00 am - PDB at HQ\n10:00 - 12:00 pm - Policy time per Podesta \n12:50 - 1:15 pm - Lunch\n\n1:15 - 1:45 pm - Tape Weekly Radio Address (Global Summit if needed)\n2:30 - 3:30 pm  - 60 Minutes Taping w/MO\n9:00 pm - Daily Team Call\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n____________________________\nAlyssa Mastromonaco \n\nDirector of Scheduling and Advance\n\nObama for America \n\n312-819-2008\nwww.voteforchange.com <http://www.voteforchange.com>  \n\n \n\n"
