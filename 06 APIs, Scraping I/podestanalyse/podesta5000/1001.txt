They are joining forces to speak out against U.S.\ndependence on fossil fuels, and to call for action against the national\nsecurity threat of climate change. \n\nThe veterans are part of Operation FREE <http://www.operationfree.net/>\n, a rapidly growing coalition of leading veterans and national security\norganizations who recognize that climate change is a major threat, and\nsupport fast, bold action. \n\nOn Thursday, the veterans will visit the White House to participate in a\ndiscussion on the links between climate change, energy, and national\nsecurity.  The veterans will then meet with Senators from their\nrespective states to underscore their support of legislation on the\nsubject.  In the eyes of Operation FREE, climate change legislation is\nabsolutely critical and must accomplish the following goals: \n\n-          Allow America to cut down on carbon consumption and carbon\nemissions. \n\n-          Create clean energy incentives that will help accelerate the\ndevelopment and deployment of clean energy technology, such as electric\nvehicles, wind power, and solar power, creating green jobs in the\nprocess. \n\n-           Promote energy efficiency by helping consumers and\nbusinesses develop and acquire energy-efficient appliances and\nbuildings. \n\n"We want to see these principles become law so America can call its own\nshots in the world, combat climate change, and protect our nation\'s\nsafety and security," says Jonathan Powers, COO of the Truman National\nSecurity Project. \n\n###\n\n \n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
