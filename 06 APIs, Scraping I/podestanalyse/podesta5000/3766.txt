A system that leaves too many\nhardworking families struggling to get by or facing economic ruin.  Each\ngo round, politics, special interests and scare tactics said we can\'t.\n"We can\'t change.  We can\'t make our country better.  We just can\'t."\nNot this time.\n\n \n\n"Just eleven days ago, the United States House of Representatives\ndefined leadership by passing the historic Affordable Health Care for\nAmerica Act. And now, under Senator Reid\'s strong leadership, the Senate\nhas introduced their own legislation that gets us one step closer to\nhealthcare that works for the American people\'s bottom line, instead of\ninsurance company profits.  Senator Reid listened to the American people\nand made sure this bill keeps insurance companies from controlling our\nhealthcare system by guaranteeing choice and accountability through a\npublic health care option. \n\n \n\n"This is the Senate\'s opportunity to stand up and say "Enough!" No more\nscare tactics. No more kowtowing to conservative obstructionism. No more\npolitics as usual. No more hesitation.  \n\n \n\n"We all know the stakes, and we\'ve all seen the statistics.  But on the\nminds of each of the 44,000 Americans losing their health insurance this\nweek lurks the threat of a potential disaster.  Each of the 17,000\nAmericans forced into bankruptcy because of medical debt this week must\naccept the death of their dreams for their family.  And the loss of 400\nof our sisters and brothers this week simply because they lacked\ninsurance is nothing short of a national tragedy. \n\n \n\n"We are at this historic moment because Democratic members of both\nchambers chose leadership and governance over obstruction and timidity.\nBut there is no such thing as a Republican filibuster. Every American\ndeserves a vote on healthcare. And, every Democratic member must stand\nshoulder to shoulder with their fellow colleagues and allow the Senate\nto vote on true health insurance reform. \n\n \n\n"The American people expect and deserve results. It\'s up to the Senate\nto deliver."\n\n \n\n# # #\n\n \n\nWith 2.1 million members in Canada, the United States and Puerto Rico,\nSEIU is the fastest-growing union in the Americas.
