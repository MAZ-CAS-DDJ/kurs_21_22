It's got to stop, and we need your help to make it happen.\n\nGrassroots support is the only way to make Washington listen. You can be a part of that by chipping in $5 toward our $20,000 goal for July.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mbe140731?refcode=mbe140731_express_lane_104716_other\n\nWe've introduced a number of plans to help fix what's wrong with Washington. We've supported efforts to roll back the negative effects of Citizens United, including both a constitutional amendment and the DISCLOSE Act. Now we're taking action to build support for banning members of Congress from ever becoming lobbyists.\n\nAnd we're working every day to make sure special interests don't dominate the agenda in Washington. But we can't do it alone, and that's where you come in.\n\nGive $5, $10, or whatever you can to help us hit our $20,000 goal.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mbe140731?refcode=mbe140731_express_lane_104716_other\n\nFixing a broken Washington won't be easy. But with grassroots support from people like you, nothing is impossible.\n\nThank you. \n\nMichael\n\n***Paid for by Bennet for Colorado***\n\nThis e-mail was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.\n\nClick here to unsubscribe: \nhttp://www.bennetforcolorado.com/subscriptions/?email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu\n\n"
