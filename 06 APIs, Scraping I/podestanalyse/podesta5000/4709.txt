john.podesta@gmail.comb'===============================\nLeague of Conservation Voters\nhttp://action.lcv.org/ct/ApzLkNK1OXTO/\n===============================\n\nDear John,\n\nOne week from today. That\'s the grand finale of our petitions,\nlobbying, scientific research, public education, political\ndebate...\n\nA lot can happen in one week. The Senate could pass a global\nwarming bill with the teeth to get the job done. Or, we could\nwaste this long-awaited opportunity.\n\nThe Climate Security Act doesn\'t go far enough to fully combat\nglobal warming. So the League of Conservation Voters is using\nevery minute between now and the vote to secure the strongest\nglobal warming bill possible. YOU can make all the difference\nwith an emergency gift today.\n\nIt\'s time to make history. Your urgent gift today will give us\nthe resources to pass the strongest possible global warming\nbill.\nhttps://secure.ga4.org/01/globalwarming_c4_give/n47zLkNKqxhBv?\n\nPhone banks connecting constituents to key Senators.\nHard-hitting advertisements. Funding for staffers in key states.\nThese are the ingredients for a major victory in our fight\nagainst global warming. Every single aspect of this important\nwork is funded by you - individuals who truly care about the\nenvironment.\n\nThe Climate Security Act - our best shot at directly addressing\nglobal warming in 2008 - needs to be strengthened. With your\nhelp, the League of Conservation Voters can influence the\nlegislative process and press for amendments that will toughen\nthe bill. For example, we need to see:\n\n* Aggressive reductions in global warming pollution, to 80% by\n2050.\n* A requirement that polluters pay for pollution permits,\ngenerating money to promote clean energy and help consumers cope\nwith rising energy bills.\n* Fewer handouts to Dirty Coal and more proceeds going to the\npublic good.\n\nBig Oil and Coal are playing dirty. They\'re spreading propaganda\nabout the Climate Security Act. They\'re attempting to tear it\ndown with "poison pill" amendments that benefit Big Industry\'s\nbank accounts more than our environment and our health.\n\nDon\'t let that happen.

Let\'s not waste this incredible opportunity!\n\nThank you for all of your support,\n\nGene Karpinski\nLeague of Conservation Voters\n\n*******************************\nTell A Friend!\nTell your friends to sign up for LCV updates today.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/lcv/join-forward.html?domain=lcvorg&r=47zLkNKqxhBv&\n\nSign up for LCV Updates\nIf you received this message from a friend, you can sign up for\nLeague of Conservation Voters updates.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/lcv/join.html?r=47zLkNKqxhBvE&\n\nQuestions?\nIf you have any questions about this message or any other League\nof Conservation Voters issue, please click here or call\n202-785-8683.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/ct/A7zLkNK1OXT6/\n\nPolicy\nYou, or someone on your behalf, has subscribed to receive this\ninformation from the League of Conservation Voters.
