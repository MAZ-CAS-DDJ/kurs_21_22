In October, two students, Kayleigh Golish, L'15 and B. Shaw Drake, L'15, will be the first to represent the Law Center as observers.\n\n\n\n\x93The Guant\xe1namo observer program is emblematic of the Law Center\x92s long tradition of engaging with the most important law and policy issues of the day,\x94 said Georgetown Law Dean William M. Treanor. \x93Georgetown prides itself on experiential learning, and this latest initiative is a tremendous opportunity for students to see the law as it is applied.\x94\n\n\nMore information is available here:\n\nhttp://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/press-releases/georgetown-law-granted-observer-status-at-guantanamo.cfm\n"
