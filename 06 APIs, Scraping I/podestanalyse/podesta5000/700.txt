I just got back from our first office opening, and the volunteers I talked with are ready to hit the doors.\n\nUnfortunately, if we can\'t hit our fundraising goal tonight (we\'re at $4,824 to go as of 12:45 p.m.), we\'re going to have to make some tough decisions about the other three offices. Can you help? Click here to donate now--before midnight--so we can win this thing.\n\n"https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20140907-ld&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600"\n\nWith only 58 days until the election, every single dollar you donate right now goes directly to opening brand-new offices - and reaching 7,000 voters in the next seven days so they all know Hayworth will be a rubber stamp for the Boehner agenda. I really need you with me.
