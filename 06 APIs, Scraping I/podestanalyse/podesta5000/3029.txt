That's record-breaking for a House campaign (and more than many Senate campaigns!).\n\nTogether, more than 28,000 individuals from Illinois and around the country chipped in more than 54,000 times. John, I can't say thank you enough.\n\nBut we're not done yet. We've got 48 hours to go, and our race stands in a dead heat.\n\nSo John, I'm asking one more time: Will you pitch today and help us finish strong? I've never needed your more.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/schneiderq42014?refcode=em_FR_2014.11.02_b4_bs_all&amp;amp;recurring=auto&amp;amp;amount=25&amp;amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;amp;firstname=John&amp;amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;amp;city=Washington&amp;amp;state=DC&amp;amp;zip=20016&amp;amp;phone=2162818851&amp;amp;occupation=&amp;amp;employer=\n\nAs always -- thank you.\n\nBrad Schneider\n\nP.S. If you're already given, we could really use your help again. If not, it's not too late to make your first contribution.
