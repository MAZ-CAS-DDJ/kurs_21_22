These materials are the\npromised followup to our last briefing call, held March 15.\n\nThese groups demonstrated deep support for the idea of local job\ncreation councils, and giving local citizens, businesses and community\nleaders greater say and authority over how federal economic\ndevelopment funds are spent \x96 not Washington.\n\nThese materials were briefed earlier this week with colleagues at the\nWhite House, Treasury, and other federal economic development\nagencies.\n\nAlso attached, for those new to this list, is a one-pager on our\nproject and the briefing report from our first set of groups.\n\nUPCOMING CALENDAR NOTE:\n\nOur next catch-up and briefing call will be May 5th at 3 edt/12pdt.\nI will send around more information as we get closer to the date.\n\nIn the meantime, if your group is interested in arranging additional\nbriefings on these focus group and narrative results, or partnering on\nfuture efforts, please let me know.\n\nUSEFUL RESOURCES ON TREASURY'S SMALL BUSINESS INITIATIVES\n\nThis week the Treasury Department held an important conference on\naccess to capital for small business -- a critical issue in every\nregion and community.
