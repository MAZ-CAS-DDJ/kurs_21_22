One solution is to ensure a livable wage \xe2\x80\x93 and I was proud to join today\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98March for $15\xe2\x80\x99 to advocate for an increase for the minimum wage.\n\nBut I believe we must do more, so I also have launched a 2-week food drive to provide meals to the neediest families in the District.  (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1MQK_MsNTnBR2zOeL53qL7IrPWNukL6LmUycRTchVnjE/viewform)\n\nBy bringing the community together, we can help achieve Dr. King\xe2\x80\x99s vision for civil rights and advancement for the poor \xe2\x80\x93 and in doing so, strengthen our own communities and build a stronger society for all.\n\nClyde\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsvttuIiH54\nMy Tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King\n\n============================================================\n** (http://www.twitter.com/)\n** (http://www.facebook.com)\n** (http://mailchimp.com)\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2016 Clyde Williams for Congress, All rights reserved.\nClyde Williams for Congress\n\nContact us at\ncontact@clyde2016.com\n\nWant to change how you receive these emails?\nYou can ** update your preferences (http://clyde2016.us11.list-manage2.com/profile?u=13d0c4ee04919a2127f6c5960&id=804e337017&e=30c8959f18)\nor ** unsubscribe from this list (http://clyde2016.us11.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=13d0c4ee04919a2127f6c5960&id=804e337017&e=30c8959f18&c=25a4c444af)'
