john.podesta@gmail.comb'===============================\nLeague of Conservation Voters\nhttp://action.lcv.org/ct/jpzLkNK1OR0N/\n===============================\n\nDear John,\n\nWe\'re down to the wire.\n\nThe House is voting on the Energy Bill today. You and I know our\ncountry needs tougher fuel efficiency standards, increased\nenergy efficiency, and incentives for renewable energy. And with\na little more work, we can make this happen.\n\nAs your Representative casts his or her vote today, we need to\nmake sure our voices are heard. Will you make sure that we have\nthe resources to do it?\n\nMake your contribution of $35, $50, $100, $250 or more and\nensure that your voice is heard in Washington, DC at this\ncritical hour!\nhttps://secure.ga4.org/01/PAC_December_Energy/n_pzLkNKq-dpt?\n\nLCV staffers on Capitol Hill are working around the clock to\nbuild support for clean energy policy. We\'re meeting with\nmembers of Congress, flooding their offices with phone calls,\nand delivering your letters to lawmakers. \n\nBut we can\'t do it without your help. \n\nOur opposition - corporate polluters like the American Petroleum\nInstitute are lobbying just as hard against this energy bill.\nRight now, polluting industries are spending more than $50,000\nper day* in campaign contributions to Congress. \n\nWe can\'t match them dollar for dollar - but we can match them\nwith real people, people like you, making phone calls, sending\nletters, and volunteering. But running our kind of grassroots\nprogram takes resources, too - and that\'s why we need your help\nright now. \n\nDonate $50 to LCV today - just 1/10 of a penny for every dollar\nthe corporate polluters are spending each day - and help pass\nthe cleanest energy bill this country has ever seen.\nhttps://secure.ga4.org/01/PAC_December_Energy/n_pzLkNKq-dpt?\n\nIn this final push - with the Energy Bill poised to pass from\nthe House, and then the Senate - LCV is on the ground in\nWashington, standing up against dirty industry donations, and\nmaking sure your voice is heard. \n\nThank you for making sure we have the resources to pass a strong\nEnergy Bill. It\'s time to finish what we started. \n\nSincerely,\n\nGene Karpinski\nPresident\nLeague of Conservation Voters Action Fund\n\n* http://action.lcv.org/ct/m1zLkNK1OR02/\n\n*******************************\nTell A Friend!\nTell your friends to sign up for LCV updates today.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/lcv/join-forward.html?domain=lcvorg&r=_pzLkNKq-dpt&\n\nSign up for LCV Updates\nIf you received this message from a friend, you can sign up for\nLeague of Conservation Voters updates.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/lcv/join.html?r=_pzLkNKq-dptE&\n\nQuestions?\nIf you have any questions about this message or any other League\nof Conservation Voters issue, please click here or call\n202-785-8683.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/ct/jdzLkNK1OR0A/\n\nPolicy\nYou, or someone on your behalf, has subscribed to receive this\ninformation from the League of Conservation Voters.
