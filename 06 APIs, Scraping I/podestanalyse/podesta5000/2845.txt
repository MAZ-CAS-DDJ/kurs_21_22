Former Maryland Gov. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, who once\nextolled the virtues of centrism, now wants us to believe \xe2\x80\x94 in an\nunintentionally hilarious rewriting of history \xe2\x80\x94 that he\xe2\x80\x99s more liberal\nthan Hillary Clinton and a \xe2\x80\x9cprofile in courage\xe2\x80\x9d when it comes to fighting\nfor marriage equality.\n\n\n\nIn a not-so-subtle jab at Clinton, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley in a February speech said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cHistory celebrates profiles in courage, not profiles in convenience. The\ndignity of every person tells us that the right to marry is not a state\nright, it is a human right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA Clinton aide last week, responding to a Blade inquiry, affirmed that the\n2016 hopeful views same-sex marriage as a constitutional right. That\nstatement marked a change from her earlier position, articulated in an\ninfamous NPR interview last year, that she viewed marriage as a state\nissue.\n\n\n\nClinton, like President Obama and Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley and many others evolved\non the issue.\n\n\n\nThe problem with O\xe2\x80\x99Malley is that he\xe2\x80\x99s had more positions on marriage than\nall the 2016 hopefuls combined. And after pushing for civil unions right up\nuntil 2011, he now wants voters to believe that he\xe2\x80\x99s a pioneer on the\nissue. What nerve!\n\n\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s revisit O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s actual record rather than listen to his calculated\namnesia.\n\n\n\n In 2004, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley told a Baltimore TV station, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not opposed to civil\nmarriages.\xe2\x80\x9d Also that year, he emailed a plaintiff in the state marriage\nlawsuit that read, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just supporting something I strongly believe in,\xe2\x80\x9d\nreferring to marriage equality. But by 2006, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s position was\nshifting and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI was raised to believe that marriage is between a\nman and a woman. This is a fundamental issue of the state\xe2\x80\x99s public policy,\nand a decision that ultimately should not be made by a single trial court\njudge.\xe2\x80\x9d When confronted by gay activists after issuing that statement,\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley disavowed any previous support of marriage equality.\n\n\n\nAfter a 2007 Maryland court ruling limiting marriage to opposite-sex\ncouples, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley issued the following statement as heartbroken gay\nresidents were busy cancelling their weddings and mourning the court\xe2\x80\x99s\nmisguided decision: \xe2\x80\x9cI look forward to reading the court\xe2\x80\x99s full opinion,\nbut as we move forward, those of us with the responsibility of passing and\nenforcing laws have an obligation to protect the rights of all individuals\nequally, without telling any faith how to define its sacraments. I respect\nthe court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPrivately, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley had assured gay rights activists and plaintiffs in the\ncase that he supported marriage equality, only to reverse course and\nultimately invoke his Catholic religious beliefs to justify his support of\ndiscrimination.\n\n\n\n>From 2008-2010, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley publicly backed civil unions as bills to legalize\nmarriage equality were defeated in committee. He was even booed off the\nstage at a private LGBT donor gathering after advocating for civil unions\nover full marriage rights.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley finally said he would sign a marriage bill if passed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nhave concluded that discriminating against individuals based on their\nsexual orientation in the context of civil marital rights is unjust.\xe2\x80\x9d That\nbill ultimately failed.\n\n\n\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo embraced the cause of marriage\nequality as a civil rights issue \xe2\x80\x94 and well after Maryland Attorney General\nDoug Gansler did the same \xe2\x80\x94 that O\xe2\x80\x99Malley evolved yet again. Whereas Cuomo\nmade it clear even before he was elected that he supported full marriage\nrights and then lobbied for the needed votes to pass it, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley was \xe2\x80\x94\nuntil 2012 \xe2\x80\x94the reluctant advocate, offering meek, private assurances of\nsupport but refusing to publicly embrace the cause, even after winning a\nsecond term in a landslide.\n\n\n\nThough he eventually came around to full support and was instrumental in\npreserving the law after it went to referendum, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley was late to the\nmarriage party and certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve credit for its success.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley has, for years, embodied the poll-driven milquetoast politician\nwho checks the wind before staking out a position. Now he wants us to\nbelieve otherwise.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have the ability as a party to lead by our principles or are we going\nto conduct polls every time we try to determine where the middle is on any\ngiven day,\xe2\x80\x9d he told NPR this week.\n\n\n\nWe should welcome O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s more progressive positions without forgetting\nhis disappointing record of saying one thing in private and the opposite\nwhen the cameras are rolling.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Kevin Naff** is editor of the Washington Blade.
