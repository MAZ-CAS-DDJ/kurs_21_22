Day after day the republican candidate\nhas challenged Obama\'s domestic policies and being quick to point out his\ninexperience in foreign affairs. [...]\n\nDAVID WRIGHT: Senator I want to start by asking you about an extraordinary\nstatement you just made in that town hall meeting.\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: So apparently Senator Obama would rather lose a war in order to\nwin a campaign.\n\nWRIGHT: That\'s pretty strong language. Do you really think he\'s that craven?\n\nMCCAIN: I think that it\'s very clear that Senator Obama has refused to\nrecognize that the strategy in Iraq called the surge has succeeded.\n\nWRIGHT: But what you seem to be saying there is that it\'s all about personal\nambition for him and not about what he honestly thinks is right for the\ncountry.\n\nMCCAIN: I do not believe that any objective observer can conclude that the\nsurge did not work and he should know better if he wants to be\ncommander-in-chief and certainly behave differently as far as our presence\nand our strategy in Iraq.\n\nWRIGHT: But it sometimes seems, as an outside observer, that both of you\nguys sometimes get stuck in the past. Senator Obama\'s kind of stuck in 2003\nand whether the war was a good idea in the first place and you kind of seem\nstuck sometimes in 2007 and whether the surge was the right strategy.\nShouldn\'t this debate really be about the future and where we go from here?\n\nMCCAIN: Oh, you\'re exactly right. It\'s all about the future and the future,\nin my view, we have succeeded, but it\'s still fragile.\n\nWRIGHT: You yourself have said--\n\nMCCAIN: *The point is that we are responsible for our records.* I was right.\nSenator Obama was wrong. So therefore, *I think that I have more credibility\non what the future should be as opposed to Senator Obama* who, if he\' had\nhis way, we would be very likely be involved in a wider war today.\n\nWRIGHT: Charlie Gibson today sat down with Senator Obama in Jerusalem and,\nas you can imagine, they talked a lot about the Middle East peace process.\nHow would that initiative look different in a McCain administration than it\nwould in an Obama administration?\n\nMCCAIN: My policy and support for the state of Israel has been very\nconsistent. I visited there many, many times. I would be personally engaged\nin the efforts to bring about a peaceful settlement between the state of\nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority.\n\nWRIGHT: You\'ve been touring here in the states, had the domestic states all\nto yourself and yet, we\'re talking an awful lot about foreign policy. It\nseems like the narrative of this campaign is being driven by whatever\nSenator Obama does and that you\'re left to kind of react to that.\n\nMCCAIN: It may seem like that to you. It doesn\'t seem like that to me. We\'re\ngettin\' very good crowds. We\'re doin\' well in the polls. So I\'m very happy\nwith where we are.\n\nHighlight #2\n*Pfotenhauer: Correct Chronology Does Disservice to US and Iraqi Military;\nMcCain\'s Challenge on Iraq Strategy Resulted in Change of Sec. of\nDefense*(MSNBC 07/23/08 2:50pm)\nALEX WITT: [\x85] When it comes to the war in Iraq, John McCain continues to\nrepeat two lines of attack against Barack Obama. [He] charges that his [\x85]\nrival is flat out wrong when it comes to a timetable for withdrawing troops\nfrom Iraq and McCain accuses Barack Obama of being willing to lose a war in\norder to win a political campaign. [\x85]\n\nLet\'s talk about the interview last night during which Senator McCain said\nthat the surge helped with the Sunni or Anbar awakening. However, in fact,\nif you look at the historical details [\x85] the surge [\x85] began after that\nAnbar awakening yet the campaign is still sticking by the senator\'s remarks.\n[Witt reads campaign statement about error in interview.] Do you agree with\nthat?\n\nNANCY PFOTENHAUER: I do agree with it and it\'s not just our opinion. If you\ntalk to General Petraeus or [\x85] other military commanders or, if you even\ntalk to your colleague Joe Scarborough, they\'ll say there is no way the\nawakening could have been successful if it weren\'t for the surge. The surge\neffort is what made that possible.\n\n*Barack Obama and his supporters can try to litigate what came first* *or\nwhat was crucial but that\'s really an attempt to undermine the significance\nand the impact of the American troops and their sacrifice and their effort\nand that\'s something that does a disservice to the American military, men\nand women that put your lives on the line as well as the Iraqis forces who\nput their lives on the line, in order to fight back al-Qaeda.*\n\nWITT: [\x85] when you hear details [\x85] and you see, \'Oh there\'s going to be a\nquestion about the timing here,\' and you know the media is going to get on\nthis to try to get the facts out correctly, how does that make you feel? How\ndo you approach then, dealing with things?\n\nPFOTENHAUER: [\x85] this is a 24-7 job, as you know [\x85] we have a candidate who\nis extraordinarily well versed, in these matters, and [\x85] he\'s been on the\nrecord for years, if you will, on them and so he knows a tremendous amount\nabout what\'s happened on the ground and *he has the judgment and the proof\nis before the world right now*.\n\nHe has the judgment to make the right call like he did when *he went into\nIraq, came back, challenged his own president, demanded a change in strategy\n*. *It even resulted in the in a change of the secretary of defense*, in\norder to put his country\'s interest above his political interests and get to\na successful place in Iraq where we can now, all of us, be talking about\nvictory, if you will, rather than advocating the withdrawal and defeat that\nSenator Obama did.\n\nWITT: [\x85] I am totally out of time, but, if you can give me a yes or no\nanswer on this. [\x85] Will John McCain announce his VP choice this week [\x85]?\n\nPFOTENHAUER: I don\'t know.\n*\n**Olbermann Attacks McCain\'s History and Definition of the Surge in\nIraq *(MSNBC\n07/23/08 08:04pm)\nKEITH OLBERMANN: Which came first the surge or the surge? Apparently the\nsurge did.  [\x85] Senator McCain who yesterday wanted you to believe that the\nsurge predated the Sunni awakening in Anwar, now wants you to believe that\nthe surge started before President Bush said it did. If that is not\nconfusing enough, the presumptive Republican nominee would also have you\nbelieve that the surge and the Anbar awakening, and the counterinsurgency in\nIraq are all the very same thing. In front of the cheese case, at the king\nsuper market [\x85] the Senator tried to clear up any confusion of when he\nbelieves the surge actually began. [\x85]  It is worth noting that the vast\nmajority of surge troops went to Baghdad not to Anbar, and *the same Sheik\nthat MCCain claimed to Katie Couric that the surge was able to protect was\nhimself assassinated in September 2007 when the surge was at its peak*. But\nlet us return to our cheese case [\x85]\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: *First of all a surge is really a counterinsurgency strategy\nand it\'s made up of a number of components*.   And this counterinsurgency\nwas initiated, to some degree, by Colonel McFarland in Anbar province,\nrelatively on his own.  When I visited with him in December of 2006, he had\nalready initiated that strategy in Remadi by going in and clearing in\nholding in certain places. That is a counterinsurgency. And he told me at\nthat time he believed that that strategy, which is, "the surge", part of the\nsurge, would be successful. So, then, of course, it was very clear that we\nneeded additional troops in order to carry out this insurgency.\n\n*Prior to that counterinsurgency, prior to that, they had been going into\nplaces killing people or not killing people and then withdrawing* and the\nnew counterinsurgency surge entailed going in and clearing a holding which\nColonel McFarland had already started doing. Then, of course, later on there\nwere additional troops and General Petraeus has said that the surge would\nnot have worked and the Anbar awakening would not have taken place\nsuccessfully if they hadn\'t have had an increase in the number of troops. *So,\nI\'m not sure, frankly, that people really understand that a surge is part of\na counterinsurgency strategy, which means going in, clearing holding,\nbuilding a better life, providing services to the people and then clearly a\npart of that, an important part of that was additional troops *to help\nensure the safety of the Sheiks and to gain, regain control of Remadi, which\nwas a very bloody fight and then the surge continued to succeed in that\ncounterinsurgency.\n\nREPORTER: when you say surge then you\'re not referring to the one President\nBush initiated, you\'re saying it goes back several months before then.\n\nMCCAIN: Yes. And again, because of my visits to Iraq, I was briefed by\nColonel McFarland in December of 2006 where he outlined what was succeeding\nthere in *this counterinsurgency strategy, which we all know of now of now\nas the surge.*\n\nOLBERMANN: So, it was a secret surge. [\x85]\n\nCHRISTOPHER HAYES: This is really remarkable, right. This is a central tent\npole for McCain\'s vision for Iraq, what he is running on. Yesterday he\nportrayed the fact that he does not understand what it is. Okay. *They\ndidn\'t choose the name the surge because it sounded cool, they weren\'t\nnaming a rock band, right? They chose the surge because it referred to a\nsurge or increase in troops, full stop*. It is distinctive from everything\nelse that happened in Iraq [\x85]\n\nOLBERMANN: So Senator Surge who is now Senator Secret Surge, to push back\nagainst criticism that he didn\'t know when the surge began, he manages to\nmake this seem like he doesn\'t even understand what a surge is or what this\nsurge was. [\x85]\n\n*Fred Kagan Attempts to Dismiss McCain\'s Misunderstanding on the History of\nthe Surge* (MSNBC 07/23/08 08:04pm)\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI: [\x85] focusing on domestic issues after making a big gaffe on\nthe timeline of the Iraq war, I don\'t know if it was a big gaffe but it\nhappened.  During a national TV interview, Senator McCain was asked about\nObama\'s stance that the surge was only one factor that led to reduced\nviolence.  Senator Obama has also attributed improved security to the Sunni\nAwakening and the Shiite government\'s crackdown on the militias.  This was\nJohn McCain\'s answer:\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: Colonel McFarlane was contacted by one of the major Sunni\nSheiks, because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that Sheik\nand others and that began the Anwar Awakening.  I mean that\'s just a matter\nof history.\n\nBRZEZINSKI: *Here\'s the problem, the events Colonel Sean McFarlane was\ninvolved in pre-dated the surge.  Reports say he wasn\'t even in the Anwar\nprovince at the time*. [\x85]  The McCain campaign has responded by saying: "\nSenator McCain is correct. As General Petraeus has made clear, the surge is\nthe reason why the Anbar Awakening was so successful in tearing up Al Qaeda.\nThe surge strategy that was supported by John McCain and opposed by Barack\nObama was responsible for the reduction in violence we have seen over the\nlast year and a half. "  *What do you make of this sort of timeline of\nevents in terms of what John McCain is saying about the surge and what he\nattributes it to and does it match reality?*\n\nFRED KAGAN: It absolutely does match reality.  There is no question that you\nwould not have had the Awakening take form and expand in Anwar, and you\ncertainly would not have had the Awakening spread around into Baghdad and\nsouth of Baghdad and throughout the country without the surge forces.  And\nthere is no question about that. [\x85]  *I spoke with one of the very\nprominent Sunni Sheiks in Anwar and I ran this very question by him and I\nsaid you know there are some people that are saying the Awakening happened\nindependently of the surge and he said "what idiot said that".*\n\nBRZEZINSKI: Ok I want to cover a lot of ground with you if I can. Columnist\nRobert Novak is now saying that he was used by the McCain campaign.  Can you\nweigh in on this; Novak is now questioning the so-called scoop that a top\nMcCain aide gave him about him potentially announcing his Vice Presidential\npick this week.\n\nKAGAN*: No I\'m not a McCain spokesman. I am an expert on Iraq and I am happy\nto talk to you about Iraq issues. [\x85]*\n\nBRZEZINSKI: What do you make over this gaffe, over the timing of the Sunni\nor the Anwar Awakening?\n\nKAGAN:*I think that this is a trivial, I think gaffe is even too strong.  I\'ve\nspoken with John McCain; John McCain understands the timeline and the cause\nand events very clearly.  What troubles me is that we are in here parsing\nvery precise words that Senator McCain might have said* and we are missing\nthe fact that Senator Obama\'s description of what went down in Iraq in the\nlast 18 months is just 180 degrees wrong.  It\'s just wrong.  [\x85] So I think\nfocusing on this question of did McCain get himself tangled up in a sentence\nor not is so microscopic an issue compared to the absolute false of the\nvision of the last 18 months that Senator Obama and his supporters have been\ndescribing that its hard to for me to believe that we are even having this\ndiscussion.\n[\x85]\n\nANDREA MITCHELL: [\x85] What can the international community do to stop Iran\nfrom coming a Nuclear power short of an attack?\n\nKAGAN: *Well there is nothing that we can do short of an attack to force\nIran to give up it\'s nuclear program*.  And so if Senator Obama is actually\nserious in saying that he will not tolerate a nuclear arms race, at the end\nof the day the only way you can make sure that doesn\'t happen is with an\nattack.  There are a variety of thinks that you can do short of an attack\nand hope that it will work but hope is not a method here.  We\'ve got a very\nmuch of an audacity of hope going on [\x85]\n\nHighlight #3\n*Dana Bash Takes a Look at McCain\'s Attempts to Grab Your Attention* (CNN\n07/23/08 7:23pm)\nLOU DOBBS: Senator McCain today strongly criticized Senator Obama for\nsupporting a congressional ban on offshore oil drilling. *McCain said crude\noil prices dropped sharply after President Bush ended the executive ban on\noffshore drilling and Senator McCain is absolutely correct.* Crude oil\nprices have plunged more than $20 a barrel since the president lifted that\nban on the 14th of July. Crude oil prices today closing just below $125 a\nbarrel. [\x85]\n\nDANA BASH: Call this \'counter-programming.\'\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: We know that Americans are sitting around the kitchen table\ntonight, figuring out whether they can keep their home or not.\n\nBASH: While Barack Obama is overseas John McCain is trying to convince\nvoters back home he\'s working to ease their pain. He staged a photo-op, food\nshopping with a Pennsylvania family, going out of his way to show and tell\nhe gets it.\n\nMCCAIN: The price of a gallon of milk just went over $4 a gallon. Renee said\nthat that was the highest she had ever seen it.\n\nBASH: At a town hall he even suggested the price of oil is down because of a\ncontroversial White House decision he supported, lifting the federal ban on\noffshore drilling.\n\nMCCAIN: The President of the United States announced [\x85] a week or so ago\nthat we would be lifting the moratorium on offshore drilling. The price of\noil dropped ten dollars! We need to drill offshore!\n\nBASH: But talking pocketbook politics is only half of McCain\'s\ndouble-barreled strategy while Obama is abroad. The other, trying to keep\nObama from bolstering his foreign policy credentials this week by pounding\naway on his Iraq plans.\n\nMCCAIN: He is in favor of unconditional withdrawal. An unconditional\nwithdrawal, my friends, without paying attention to the facts on the ground\ncould lead to our failure.\n\nBASH: Republicans frustrated with Obama\'s overseas spotlight are trying to\nbe clever in getting their message out. The Republican National Committee\nwill run these radio ads in Berlin while Obama is there.\n\nRNC RADIO AD: When our military needed necessary resources, Barack Obama\nfailed to stand up.\n\nBASH: But, not that Berlin. The towns of Berlin in three battleground\nstates, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania and *the McCain campaign\nis resorting to sarcasm to get attention, handing out fake French press\npasses, dubbing the McCain media, \'The JV Squad, "Left Behind to Report in\nAmerica."\'*\n\nAnother Way McCain advisors know they\'ll get attention is to tease the media\non McCain\'s search for a running mate. The plan was to do that by going to\nNew Orleans to meet with someone on the VP buzz list, Louisiana governor,\nBobbi Jindal, but it didn\'t happen. The trip was cancelled because of bad\nweather.\n\n-- \nJacob Roberts\nPAO\n208.420.3470 (c)\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
