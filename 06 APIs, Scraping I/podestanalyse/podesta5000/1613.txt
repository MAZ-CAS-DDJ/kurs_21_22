Groups that refuse to disclose their donors are overwhelmingly backing Rossi over Senator Patty Murray, who has received only $256,205 - a ratio of 26 to 1.\n\n"These anonymous special interests and ultra-rich conservatives know Dino is their guy", said Aaron Ostrom, Executive Director of Fuse Washington, a progressive advocacy group. "And it\'s now crystal clear why he opposes the DISCLOSE Act that would require these donors to identify themselves - secret donors are the key to his success."\n\nDino\'s Secret Supporters\n\nGroup\n\nAmount of Secret Money\n\nSecret Money Reported Since 10/21\n\nCrossroads GPS\n\n$3,597,316[1]\n\n$1,049,573\n\nAmerican Action Network\n\n$1,300,000[2]\n\n0\n\nChamber of Commerce\n\n$997,525[3]\n\n$997,525\n\nCommittee for Truth in Politics\n\n$325,000[4]\n\n0\n\nNational Taxpayers Unions\n\n$300,000[5]\n\n0\n\nCoalition to Protect Seniors\n\n$36,499[6]\n\n0\n\nFocus on the Family Action\n\n$33,786[7]\n\n0\n\nBIPAC - Business Institute for Political Analysis\n\n$25,999[8]\n\n$25,999\n\nFaith Family Freedom Fund\n\n$24,750[9]\n\n$24,750\n\nEnterprise Freedom Action Committee\n\n$17,922[10]\n\n$17,922\n\nTOTAL\n\n$6,658,797\n\n$2,115,770\n\n\nFuse originally released research on October 22 showing Dino Rossi leading the nation in support from secret donors with $4,543,027. In just the last week, these shadowy groups have spent an additional $2,115,770 in support of Rossi\'s candidacy.\n\nGroups that refuse to disclose their donors have spent more than $100 million trying to influence hundreds of races this year. The Supreme Court\'s Citizens United decision in January of this year opened the floodgates to unlimited expenditures without public disclosure. These expenditures have backed conservative candidates at a ratio of 7 to 1.[11]\n\nThe DISCLOSE Act would increase transparency of corporate and special interest money in national political campaigns. It would require organizations involved in political campaigning to disclose the identity of the large donors, and to reveal their identities in any political ads. It would also bar foreign corporations, government contractors, and TARP recipients from making political expenditures. The DISCLOSE Act passed the House in June and has been mired in the Senate since September 23.[12]\n\nFuse Washington compiled this data through research of publicly available information and watchdog databases. However, the lack of disclosure requirements for these shadowy groups means that the actual numbers may be even higher. This underscores the importance of having strong disclosure requirements so that all voters know who is trying to influence their elections.\n\nFuse is the largest network for progressive change in Washington, giving more than 100,000 people a stronger voice in government, online, on the ground, and on the issues that matter most.
