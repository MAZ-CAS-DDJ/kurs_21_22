john.podesta@gmail.comb"Hi John -\n\nI'm going to be speaking with Jake via phone tomorrow morning on the\nquestion of organized outside messaging on national security. I understand\nthat he is interested primarily on the question of how progressives can\noperationalize the push back against the GOP candidates. That is basically\nwhat I have been talking about doing, so think I'm well-placed for that\nconversation. Welcome any thoughts that you may have. And of course, thank\nyou for your help on this.\n\nMy best,\nKen\n\nOn Mon, Jun 22, 2015 at 1:12 PM, Ken Gude <kengude@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n> John -\n>\n> Wanted to update you on my thoughts on the various strands of the\n> progressive community organizing to engage on national security issues\n> during the 2016 cycle.\n>\n> Following your recommendation, I connected with Derek Chollet.
