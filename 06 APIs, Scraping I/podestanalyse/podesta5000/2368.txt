In the Senate, I\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> put forward legislation to expand global AIDS research and assistance, and\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> increase prevention and education. And as Secretary of State, I launched a\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> campaign to usher in an AIDS-free generation through prevention and\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> treatment, targeting the populations at greatest risk of contracting HIV\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> (including key populations at risk of discrimination), and investing in\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> innovative research and technology.\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I believe there\xe2\x80\x99s even more we can do together. For\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> starters, we should call on Republican governors to put people\xe2\x80\x99s health and\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> well-being ahead of politics and extend Medicaid, which would provide\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> health care to those living with HIV/AIDS. And we should cap out-of-pocket\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> expenses, and hold companies like Turing and Valeant accountable when they\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> attempt to gouge prices of lifesaving medications. And we should expand\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> access to medications like PrEP.\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The AIDS crisis looks very different today. We\xe2\x80\x99re still\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> surrounded by memories of loved ones lost and lives cut short. But we\xe2\x80\x99re\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> also surrounded by survivors who are fighting harder than ever. We owe it\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> to them, and to future generations, to continue that fight together.  There\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> are more options for treatment and prevention than ever before. More people\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> with HIV are leading full, happy lives. For the first time, an AIDS-free\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> generation is in sight. And we can\xe2\x80\x99t let up until we reach that goal.\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> On Sat, Mar 12, 2016 at 1:15 PM, Jake Sullivan <\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Adding Megan to work with our team to get something good\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> cranked out.
