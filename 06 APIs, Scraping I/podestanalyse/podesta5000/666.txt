Super-best, T\n\n \n\nFrom: Luzzatto, Tamera (Clinton) \nSent: Friday, November 21, 2008 10:56 AM\nTo: Phil Schiliro; John Podesta-personal\nSubject: \n\n \n\nSee you at the chiefs meeting soon.\n\n \n\nAmong the hordes of people seeking HRC's push for Administration jobs,\nshe asked me last night to highlight two of particular interest to her:\n\n \n\nAT Smith, Assistant Director of the Secret Service, to take the top job.\nShe has stayed in touch with him, knows him, thinks the world of him,\nyou name it.  I have no relationship myself, so she is the person for\nanyone to talk to about him should he or she take a look at Smith, and\nshe'd be happy to do that.   I've got paper on him if you want someone\nto get it.\n\n \n\nGary Gensler - you must know him, he seems to be doing transition work,\nbut when he sent her the note below and bio attached, she asked me to\nsend along to you with a strong pitch.\n\n \n\nI also should mention she spent time with Ken Feinberg here the other\nnight - she's nuts about him, so I note that..................\n\n \n\nThanks,\n\nT\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHere is Gary's info. I think he is very good and would like him\nseriously considered. \n\n________________________________\n\nHillary,\n\n \n\nI continue to be very excited for the nation and you with the\npossibility of your service at State.  \n\n \n\nGiven all that is on your plate, I hope that it might not be too much\nthat I follow up on your offer of advice and support on my possible\nservice. \n\n \n\nGiven my extensive experience in Washington and in finance, as well as\nthe current financial crisis, I think that I could best serve as\nTreasury Deputy Secretary or secondly as Chair at the SEC.  It would be\na great honor, though, to be considered for other senior economic posts,\nsuch as the Deputy at the National Economic Council or OMB or as the\nUSTR.\n\n \n\nI would very much like to get your thoughts on this.  I have been\nspeaking with both Bob Rubin and Pete Rouse who are both supportive.\n\n \n\nIf comfortable, it would also be of great help if you were to speak\ndirectly with John Podesta and Rahm Emanuel on my behalf.  \n\n \n\nThough we have known each other for years, I have attached a most recent\nbio for your reference.\n\n \n\nI can best be reached on my cell phone at 301-980-7183.\n\n \n\nOnce again, thank you for any advice and support you might offer.\n\n \n\nGary\n\n \n\n"
