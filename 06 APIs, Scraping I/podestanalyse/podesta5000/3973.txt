I've calculated a few times and no matter how you cut it, not enough people have stepped up - we're still $30,000 short.\n\nWith the last poll showing a TIE and Cook Political Report AND Roll Call BOTH confirming this race a toss-up, Sean needs your help to counter the endless attacks. PLEASE - Click here to contribute $250 now.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20141030-930am-ld&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\nIf you don't contribute, we won't be able to fight back against Nan Hayworth's attacks on Sean and WE WILL LOSE.\n\nWe're counting on you. Call me at (845) 565-1842 to contribute.\n\n- Maura\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com. \n\nTo unsubscribe from the Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress email list, please click here:\n\nhttp://action.seanmaloney.com/page/unsubscribe/?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\n\n\nPaid for by Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n\n\n\n"
