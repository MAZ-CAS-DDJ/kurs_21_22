john.podesta@gmail.comb'WITH FEAR-MONGERING LOBBYIST CHARLIE BLACK IN THE LEAD, MCCAIN CAN\'T MAKE\nTHE CASE FOR CHANGE\n\nCharlie Black is in the news again because of comments\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/23/AR200806230\n1979.html?nav=rss_politics>  he made saying that McCain would benefit\npolitically from another terrorist attack.  This controversy is just the\nlatest for Black, who as a lobbyist has represented brutal human rights\ndictators, lobbied for a company that did business with Iran and helped sell\nthe Iraq war. With Black and 134 lobbyists assisting the campaign, McCain is\nrunning a classic, fear-and-smear -politics-as-usual operation.\n\n \n\n"In terms of being able to distort or mislead people, you\'re never running\nin the clear . Back in the 1970s, you could say all kinds of outrageous\nthings.  Now, in almost any state you go into, you\'ve got at least one,\nmaybe four or five state newspapers that will call your hand.  Some of these\nstate capital press corps are tougher than the national guys."\n\n-- Charlie Black [Washington Post, 1/17/89]\n\n \n\n \n\n.         McCain has no credibility to make the case for change when he is\nsurrounded by lobbyists like Charlie Black who have made millions fighting\nagainst the interests of Americans.  McCain has had at least 134 LOBBYISTS\n<http://mccainsource.com/corruption?id=0006>  advising, working for or\nraising money for his presidential campaign. These lobbyist advisers have\nmade millions advocating for big oil, insurance companies, Iraq contractors\nand white washing the crimes of dictators.\n\n \n\n.         Black is an architect of fear and smear campaigns that have sought\nelection victories by dividing people and scaring them.  He has mastered in\nhis own words "being able to distort and mislead people."\n\n \n\n.         Black helped Ahmed Chalabi and the Iraqi National Congress\nnavigate Washington in the run-up to the war in Iraq.  Chalabi helped\nengineer WMD claims and pushed the Bush administration to attack Iraq.\nChalabi has been accused of giving false information to the U.S. leading up\nto the war.\n\n \n\n.         Black\'s firm has represented numerous defense contractors who have\nmade billions from the war in Iraq.  Black\'s firm, BKSH, has lobbied for 8\n(or roughly 13%) of the top 60 companies receiving DOD contracts during\n2007, including the top DOD contractor (Lockheed Martin).\n\n \n\n.         While McCain has taken a strong stance on sanctions against Iran,\nBlack has represented a company who did business with Iran.  In 2000, while\nBlack worked as a lobbyist for General Electric Capital Services, GE\nsupplied hydroelectric generators to Iran.\n\n \n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
