As many of you may know, in Fall 2012, Katie was admitted to the Law Center\x92s evening program.  Since then, she has been supporting my office full time while at the same time working diligently as a law student.  Katie will begin her final year this Fall, and will now be able to focus full time on her studies and her life and career beyond law school.  Katie\x92s last day working in the office will be tomorrow, Friday, May 15th<x-apple-data-detectors://0>, having concluded another year of meritorious service as we move on to this year\x92s graduation ceremonies.\n\nSince her arrival in December 2010, Katie has been an integral part of my staff. As you know, she welcomed numerous visiting guests, scheduled (and often rescheduled!) countless meetings, and managed my calendar, itself a moving target.  Katie\x92s professionalism and grace in the face of the constant flow of activity and changes in plans are both indicative of her dedication to the Law Center and a tribute to her.  I thank Katie for her exceptional support these past years, and will miss her.\n\nPlease join me in thanking and congratulating Katie on her contributions to the Law Center and wishing her well on her final year in law school.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBill\n'
