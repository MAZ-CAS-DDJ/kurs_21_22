john.podesta@gmail.comb'I wanted to make you aware of Wilson Perspectives: The Paris Climate Agreement which is found at\nhttps://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/wilson-perspectives-the-paris-climate-agreement\n\nMy own assessment of the Paris result is found here:\nhttps://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/the-climate-community-turns-to-pragmatism-mostly  and (short version) here:  http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/14/finally-america-acts-like-grownup-takes-responsibility-climate-action\n\nDefinitely a big step in the right direction but lots of very hard work ahead.\n\nHappy Holidays,\nRuth\n\n\n\nRuth Greenspan Bell\nPublic Policy Scholar, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars\nResearch Associate, Center for Decision Sciences, Columbia Business School\nVisiting Scholar, Environmental Law Institute\nPhone: WWC: 202-691 4097\nU.S. Mobile: +1 202 361 2409\n\n\n'
