The White House deserves praise in alleviating\nthe Church\x92s concerns.\x94\n\nSalt said the Catholic Church also won today by maintaining a recognition\nthat issues of morality and personal choice must be respected.\n\n\x93As sensible Americans already know, and this new rule affirms, religious\nlliberty is protected and cherished in this country,\x94 said Salt. \x93The\ndivisive right-wing myth that religious liberty is somehow attacked has\nbeen thoroughly debunked, and today\x92s ruling is just another nail in that\ncoffin. Now the Church can focus on what brings us together: serving the\nleast among us, including the poor and marginalized.\x94\n\nFounded in 2004, Catholics United, and its educational arm, Catholics\nUnited Education Fund, are non-profit, non-partisan organizations dedicated\nto promoting the message of justice and the common good found at the heart\nof the Catholic Social Tradition.\n\nFor more information about Catholics United, \x93like\x94 us on our Facebook page\n(www.facebook.com/CatholicsUnited), follow us on Twitter (\nwww.twitter.com/CatholicsUnited) or on our blog at www.OurDailyThread.org.\n\n ###\n\n\n\n-- \nJames Salt\nCatholics United Executive Director\nCatholics United Education Fund Executive Director\n202-246-2583\njsalt@catholics-united.org\n\n-- \n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.
