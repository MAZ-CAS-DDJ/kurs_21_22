john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John,\n\nAs a member of LCV\'s Environmental Majority Council, we wanted to update you on our most recent efforts to educate citizens, elect pro-environment leaders, and hold elected officials accountable at all levels of government.\n\nPaul Ryan: Championing billions in taxpayer giveaways to Big Oil\n\nLast week the League of Conservation Voters launched a new television ad in Wisconsin\'s 1st district calling out Representative Paul Ryan\nfor his recently exposed conflict of interest: supporting billions in subsidies for oil companies while he and his family profited from some of the same companies receiving those tax breaks.\xa0\n\nA recent Newsweek investigation revealed that Representative Ryan, his wife, and father-in-law have made hundreds of thousands of dollars off of oil companies whose tax breaks he continues to support. On top of all of this, he has also proposed a 2012 budget that gives oil companies billions more in special tax breaks.\n\nThe television ad ran in the Milwaukee media market and we wanted to make sure you had a chance to see it. You can view the ad here:\xa0http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=dflxcVdIRB2gammAYmOMtQ.. \xa0\n\nLCV Education Fund Capital Dinner\n\nThanks to the support of LCV\'s Environmental Majority Council, LCV Education Fund\'s annual Capital Dinner in Washington, D.C. in June was a hugely successful event. EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson gave an inspirational speech about the need to protect public health. Additionally, we presented the Environmental Leadership Awards to George P. Shultz and Tom Steyer for their work as co-chairs of the No on Proposition 23 campaign in California.\n\nClick the below links to view excerpts of the event:\nLisa Jackson: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=0qk26O1pvbAwD37GeIs37g..\nGeorge P.

If you plan to donate to political candidates and care about the environment, the best giving strategy is to "bundle" your contributions with contributions from others who share your environmental values. Bundling through GiveGreen, a\nproject of LCV Action Fund, magnifies the power of your contribution by calling attention to the values that drive you to support the candidate in the first place. Check out Why Bundle with GiveGreen?

Tea Party-backed lawmakers, led by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, are pushing one of the most egregious anti-environment agendas in the\nnation.\n\nIn just a few weeks, Wisconsin will hold special recall elections for a handful of the most anti-environment state legislators. This is our opportunity to deal a blow to the Tea Party movement that won far too many victories last year. Wisconsin LCV is backing a\nstrong slate of pro-environment candidates who will fight for important environmental protections and vital clean energy policies.\n\nFor each of these races, the outcome could be decided by just a few DOZEN votes! That\'s why the League of Conservation Voters is working with Wisconsin LCV to identify and target 50,000 voters in swing districts.\n\nAs always, thank you for being a member of LCV\'s Environmental Majority Council and for all you do to protect our environment.
