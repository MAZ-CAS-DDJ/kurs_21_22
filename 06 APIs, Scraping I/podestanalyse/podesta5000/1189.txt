Bush speaks on December 5 in Washington, DC.\n\nAdministration officials get a memo from the White House suggesting what to\nsay about the last eight years: President Bush upheld \'the honor and the\ndignity of his office,\' for one.\n\nBy Peter Nicholas\nDecember 9, 2008\n\n\n\nReporting from Washington -- In case any Bush administration officials have\ntrouble summing up the boss\' record, the White House is providing a few\nhelpful suggestions.\n\n*A two-page memo that has been sent to Cabinet members and other\nhigh-ranking officials offers a guide for discussing Bush\'s eight-year\ntenure during their public speeches.*\n\n\n\nTitled "Speech Topper on the Bush Record," the talking points state that\nBush *"kept the American people safe" after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,\nlifted the economy after 2001 through tax cuts, curbed AIDS in Africa and\nmaintained "*the honor and the dignity of his office."\n\nThe document presents the Bush record as an unalloyed success.\n\nIt mentions none of the episodes that detractors say have marred his\npresidency: the collapse of the housing market and major financial services\ncompanies, the flawed intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq war, the\nfederal response to Hurricane Katrina or the abuse of prisoners at Abu\nGhraib.\n\nIn a section on the economy, speakers are invited to say that Bush cut taxes\nafter 2001, setting the stage for years of job growth.\n\nAs for the current economic crisis, the memo says that *Bush "responded with\nbold measures to prevent an economic meltdown."\n*\nThe document is otherwise silent on the recession, which claimed 533,000\njobs in November, the highest number in 34 years.\n\nA copy of the memo was obtained by The Times\' Washington bureau. A spokesman\nfor Bush said Monday that the White House routinely sends out suggestions to\nofficials and allies on ways to talk about the administration\'s record.\n\n"What we have in mind with these documents is we feel the president\'s many\naccomplishments haven\'t been given the attention they deserve and in some\ncases have been purposely ignored," said Carlton Carroll, a White House\nspokesman.\n\nNo one is required to recite the talking points laid out by the White House,\nCarroll said.\n\nThe memo closes with a reference to *Bush\'s 1999 memoir, "A Charge to Keep":\n*\n\n*"Above all, George W. Bush promised to uphold the honor and the dignity of\nhis office. And through all the challenges and trials of his time in office,\nthat is a charge that our president has kept."*\n\nOne accomplishment cited is passage of the *No Child Left Behind law, Bush\'s\nattempt to improve education. "He promised to raise standards and\naccountability in public schools -- and delivered the No Child Left Behind\nAct," the talking points read.*\n\nOn the presidential campaign trail this year, Democratic candidates found\nthat any criticism of No Child Left Behind was a surefire applause line.\n\nPresident-elect Barack Obama promised to revamp the program, contending that\nit elevated test-taking at the expense of a well-rounded education.\n\nNicholas is a writer in our Washington bureau.\n\npeter.nicholas@latimes.com\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail lori@progressiveaccountability.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
