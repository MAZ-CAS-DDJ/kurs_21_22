We created the Aspiration Redwood Fund (https://www.aspiration.com/our-products/?utm_campaign=sustainablehope&utm_medium=email&utm_source=mc&utm_content=teaser_ff_cust) to bring that same spirit to investing.\n\nAnd because we are huge nerds who are beyond excited about a big event this month (and we don't mean Christmas), we created this special parody.\n\nWe hope you enjoy, learn more about the Aspiration Redwood Fund (https://www.aspiration.com/our-products/?utm_campaign=sustainablehope&utm_medium=email&utm_source=mc&utm_content=teaser_ff_cust) , and share this (https://www.aspiration.com/sustainable-hope/?utm_campaign=sustainablehope&utm_medium=email&utm_source=mc&utm_content=teaser_ff_cust) with your friends.\n\nBecause greed is not good.
