john.podesta@gmail.comb'A helpful reminder that there was a spate of coverage in 2008 around time\nof income tax releases where pundits questioned whether her wealth would\nhurt her with voters. And we also had to combat stories about WJC income by\npointing out how many free speeches and speeches benefiting charitable\ncauses he made.\n\nIt could be true that few if any couples have helped raise more funds for\nmore different causes than the Clintons. (Plus they are historically more\ngenerous than most in the percentage of income they personally donate to\ncharity).\n\nOn Sunday, June 29, 2014, Huma Abedin <Huma@clintonemail.com> wrote:\n\n>  Thanks Roy.
