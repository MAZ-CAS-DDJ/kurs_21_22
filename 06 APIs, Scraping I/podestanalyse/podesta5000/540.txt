Ian Telfer, meanwhile, said he committed the funds\nbefore he ever realized he would do the deal with the Russians.\n\nThe New York Times reported on the donations in an explosive article this\nweek. The story involves a former Canadian mining company called Uranium\nOne Inc., in which Giustra and Telfer were two of the key principals.\n\nIn 2010, Uranium One began a process to sell itself to Rosatom, a\nstate-controlled nuclear giant in Russia. Uranium One had assets in\nKazakhstan and the United States, and multiple U.S. government departments\nhad to sign off on the deal. One of them is the State Department, which was\nled at the time by Hillary Clinton.\n\nUranium is considered a strategic resource, and it would be unthinkable\ntoday for the U.S. government to consider selling the country\xe2\x80\x99s uranium\nreserves to Russia. But the Uranium One sale happened prior to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s\nincursions into Ukraine last year, and Telfer said in an interview that\ngetting it approved did not require lobbying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no lobbying,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe Times story noted that between 2009 and 2013, Telfer donated US$2.35\nmillion to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s foundation. This coincided directly with the period in\nwhich the Rosatom gradually took control of Uranium One. Telfer was Uranium\nOne\xe2\x80\x99s chairman at the time.\n\nIn the interview, Telfer said he agreed to contribute US$3 million to the\nClinton Foundation back in March 2008, shortly after Giustra and Clinton\nset up their sustainable growth initiative for the natural resource sector.\nThat was before Uranium One had any negotiations with the Russians, and the\ndonations he has made since then were part of that initial pledge, he said.\nHe denied they had anything to do with influencing U.S. government\nofficials around Uranium One.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were no plans for us (in March 2008) to ever have Rosatom as a\nmajority shareholder of the company,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo therefore, there was\nnever any thought of influencing anyone because there was nothing to\ninfluence.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGiustra\xe2\x80\x99s direct involvement with Uranium One ended back in 2007, when he\nsold his company UrAsia Energy Ltd. to Uranium One for about US$3 billion.\nUrAsia held the key Kazakhstan assets that formed the backbone of Uranium\nOne, and there have been prior allegations that Giustra used his friendship\nwith Bill Clinton to help secure those assets when the two men were in\nKazakhstan together in 2005.\n\nGiustra has subsequently contributed US$31.3 million to the Clinton\nFoundation and pledged US$100 million more, according to the Times.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, Giustra said there \xe2\x80\x9cis not one shred of\nevidence\xe2\x80\x9d to back up claims that he tried to influence the U.S. government\nto approve the Uranium One sale to Rosatom. He called the Times piece a\n\xe2\x80\x9cwildly speculative, innuendo-laced article.\xe2\x80\x9d He also said that he sold all\nhis Uranium One shares in 2007.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would note that those (shares) were sold at least 18 months before\nHillary Clinton became the secretary of state. No one was speculating at\nthat time that she would become the secretary of state,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nIn addition to Giustra and Telfer, the Times noted that other people with\nties to Uranium One made contributions to the Clinton Foundation: Neil\nWoodyer, Frank Holmes, Paul Reynolds (who recently died in a triathalon\nincident) and GMP Securities Ltd.\n\n\n--\nJosh Schwerin\nSpokesperson\nHillary for America\n@Josh Schwerin\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "HRCRapid" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n'
