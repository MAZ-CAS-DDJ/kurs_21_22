I have copied a number of groups--which serves as an invitation to participate--but you may have others whom I have inadvertently omitted. You will notice that I have included Heather Booth of MoveON. As mentioned to you, MoveOn has made this its top priority and is willing to help in a variety of ways, thus the rationale for this invitation to Heather.\n>       NETWORK\'s address is: 25 E. St. NW.; phone is 202-347-9864.The meeting room is on the first floor. As you will note from the address, it is within walking distance from the Senate. So, those attending the meeting you have arranged with Senator Kaine\'s staff, who also may be on the list of those I have included on the invitation, can easily walk to the meeting.\n>       NOTO BENE: THOSE COPIED ARE INVITED TO THIS MEETING.\n>              Regards,\n>                                    Ben Palumbo\n>  \n>  \n> From: Paul Marchione [mailto:pmarchione@networklobby.org] \n> Sent: Thursday, August 06, 2015 12:45 PM\n> To: Bejamin Palumbo\n> Subject: RE: meeting on Iran\n>  \n> Ben \xe2\x80\x93 you are confirmed to meet in one of the nice conference rooms on the first floor of our building.  I booked it from 1-2:30pm.  It has a speaker phone.\n>  \n> Joan Neal from our team will represent NETWORK at the meeting.\n>  \n> If you need to send out a conference call number, you can use this:\n> Toll-free: 855-392-2520\n> Access code: 6957408#\n>  \n> But like I said, if it\'s only one person, it\'s easier (and cheaper) just to call him/her.\n>  \n> Let me know what else you need!\n> :paul:\n>  \n>  \n> Paul Marchione\n> Managing Director\n> NETWORK, A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby\n>   and NETWORK Education Program\n> 202-601-7869 (direct)\n> 202-347-9797 (main)\n> pmarchione@networklobby.org\n>  \n> From: Bejamin Palumbo [mailto:bpalumbo@covad.net] \n> Sent: Thursday, August 06, 2015 10:38 AM\n> To: Paul Marchione\n> Subject: meeting on Iran\n>  \n> Hi Paul,\n>      I just left you a voice mail message regarding the discussion we had yesterday about a meeting of Catholic groups supporting the Iran agreement, and the need for a venue. I discussed this with Bob Cooke of Pax Christi which is heavily involved in this effort. Bob has put together a meeting with Senator Kaine\'s staff for Tuesday which will end at about 12:45. So, your offer of space is perfect: we would like to use your conference room for a 1:15 meeting; and, we would very much like you to sit in. My recollection is that you have call-in capability. There will be at least one person who will need to take advantage of that system if you can arrange it and tell me how we do it so we can advise folks.\n>       Thanks again Paul. I look forward to hearing from you as I have to get the invitations out ASAP.\n>                                          Best,\n>                                                   Ben\n>                 \n'
