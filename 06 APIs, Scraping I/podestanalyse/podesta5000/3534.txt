[...] Obama fought the reform\nof the federal mortgage agencies three years ago along [...], but McCain and\nothers saw the crisis coming.

It\'s getting a little bit\nugly.  Is there some responsibility on Sarah Palin [\x85] when the campaign\nstarts [\x85] going on the attack, and they telegraph [\x85] that they were about\nto do this. Should everybody just take a deep breath and perhaps call out\nsome of the supporters who get a little rowdy and ugly on this thing?"\n\nJOE LIEBERMAN:  "Yeah, maybe everybody should take a deep breath.  I don\'t\neven know that Sarah Palin heard what was said.  Trust me.  In the rallies\nof both parties there\'s gotta be some people that are going to say things\nthat certainly don\'t reflect the views of the candidates.  So I think that\nthis a silliness and a distraction, both candidates, both parties should be\ntalking about what \'s on the minds of the American people, which is the\neconomy.  I think that John McCain and Barack Obama did that last night.  I\nthought John McCain was better because he came with some new ideas.  Reform\nideas, like the bold idea for the government to buy home mortgages of people\nto keep them in their homes."\n\nMITCHELL:  "Senator, the Obama campaign said that that\'s already in the\ntreasury bailout bill. And that it had already been referred to by Obama.   [\x85]\nWhat did he mean by "that one", and how did you take it?  [\x85]"\n\nLIEBERMAN: "A vice presidential candidate should not be into\npsychobabble.  John\nMcCain several times [\x85] referred to his opponent as Senator Obama.  One\ntime he said "that one", he pointed across the stage.  He looked at him all\nthe time.  There was a good back-and-forth going on.  [\x85]"\n\nMITCHELL:  "Do you think there were slurs here? Do you think this was John\nMcCain trying to be dismissive, trying to belittle his opponent?"\n\nLIEBERMAN:  "Oh no, he said "that one" supported my opponent, He could have\njust as easily said, my opponent supported the Bush \x96Cheney energy package\nfor the oil industry.  I, John McCain, oppose it.  He\'s very casual that\nway.  It was certainly not intended offensively.  Again, I think the\ndemocratic ticket is doing that this morning because McCain really dominated\nthe debate last night.  [\x85]"\n\n[\x85]\n\nLIEBERMAN:  "Lord knows I have a lot to repent for."\n\nHighlight #4\n*Mike Duhaime:  Doesn\'t Condone Barack "Hussein" Obama, Says American\nWorkers are the Fundamentals of Our Economy* (MSNBC 10/08/08 2:44pm)\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI: "Bill Plath, the chairman of the Lee High County GOP made a\ncomment [\x85] "Imagine if you woke up on November 5th and [\x85] Barack Hussein\nObama was our new president [\x85]"\n\nMIKE DUHAIME:  "We don\'t condone that, we do not want uh, um, any type of,\nuh, use of um, the Senator\'s middle name in a derogatory fashion like that.\nUh, we do not condone that, and, uh, we\'ll certainly make sure somebody\nspeaks to him.  He\'s a volunteer county chairman, so we\'ll make sure that he\nspoken to.  That\'s not something the campaign wishes to promote at all."\n\n[\x85]\n\nWILLIE GEIST: "[\x85] John McCain said "the fundamentals of the economy are\nstrong". That\'s when his number started to collapse.  Does John McCain\nregret saying that?  Or, does he still believe in the end the fundamentals\nof this economy, two weeks later, are still strong?"\n\nDUHAIME:  "What Senator McCain went was that the American workforce, the\ningenuity of America, that\'s the real driving edge of this economy."\n\nHighlight #5\n*Maybe McCain Thinks His Fellow Citizens Are Prisoners Because He\'s a\nMaverick* (CNN 10/08/08 6:47pm)\nJEANNE MOOS: Members of the Maverick family say hearing \'John McCain\'s a\nmaverick\' makes them want to shoot the TV. It\'s like hearing fingernails on\na chalkboard times 10. After all, they\'re liberal democrats. Some family\nmembers have held office in Texas.\n\nThey have nothing against the old TV show. They have nothing against Top\nGun, but when they hear the music from Top Gun at McCain rallies it must irk\nthem. They know the McCain folks are free to use the word \'maverick,\'\nbut....\n\nFONTAINE MAVERICK: I\'m free to be annoyed by it.\n\n[...]\n\nMOOS: But maybe only a true \'maverick\' would inadvertently refer to his\nfellow citizens this way....\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: This is the agenda I have set before my fellow prisoners.\n\nMOOS: Coming from a maverick, no one blinked.\n\nHighlight #6\n*Gupta Raises Doubts About McCain\'s Health, Melanoma* (CNN 10/08/08 1:45pm)\nSANJAY GUPTA: When questions come up about his age, 72 year old John McCain\nlikes to point to point to his mother Roberta.\n\nMCCAIN: People will judge uh, will judge by the vigor and the enthusiasm\nassociated with our campaign.\n\nGUPTA: According to actuarial tables, a 72-year-old man can expect to live\nanother 12 years, and McCain has some advantages, like good healthcare and\ngood genes.\n\n[\x85]\n\nThe biggest issue for McCain is cancer, specifically melanoma.\n\nThey gave us three hours to pour through more than 11,000 pages, they only\ncovered the last eight years and there was no way to determine what might be\nmissing. That same day in a conference call with reporters McCain\'s lead\ndoctor John Eckstein gave the candidate an unequivocal thumbs up.\n\n[\x85]\n\nBut that didn\'t silence critics\x85 just this month a liberal activist group\nBrave New Films ran a full-page ad in the New York Times. This petition,\nsigned by more than 2700 doctors. It calls on McCain to release his medical\nrecords to the public \x96 everyone, not just a few reporters\n\nDOCTOR: this is a skin cancer that can kill people. And that\'s what we need\nto find out, we need to know, did this melanoma spread, or didn\'t it?\n\nHighlight #7\n*Holtz-Eakin Enumerates the McCain Mortgage Plan* (MSNBC 10/08/08 6:47pm)\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI: Here with me now, to outline john McCain\'s next move,\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, senior economic adviser to the McCain campaign. [\x85] Do\nyou think John McCain missed an opportunity to really truly defined his\neconomic vision last night?\n\nDOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: I think John McCain did a great job of talking to the\nAmerican people about his record of reform in Washington about, his plans to\ntake on the great homeownership problems that are facing Americans, to\ncreate jobs, take care of small business and grow the economy. Barack Obama\nspent the night talking about running against George bush. The only person\nin that arena who ever ran against George Bush was John McCain. And Barack\nmight wish he was running against him. But, he\'s gonna have to come up with\na plan to beat John McCain.\n\n[\x85]\n\nHOLTZ-EAKIN: We think that the right thing to do is to number one, take a\ncrack at putting some of the resources that congress has already devoted to\nthis task, basically almost $1 trillion at this point, and put that money\nstraight into homeownership. Make sure people stay in their homes. And by\nsolidifying the value of some of these mortgages that\'s would otherwise go\ninto default, you solidify the evaluation of the MBS\'s, and that has been a\nhuge cancer on the balance sheets.\n\n[\x85]\n\nHOLTZ-EAKIN: [\x85] a homeowner could raise their hand, basically go to a\nmortgage originator or broker, and say, look, I need a refinance out of this\nMcCain resurgence plan. the government would go in and buy out the existing\nmortgage that takes that problem off the table entirely. Its  value is no\nlonger a mystery. Its weight no longer bearing down on the homeowner.  [\x85]\n\nDYLAN RATIGAN: You realize that\'s $1 trillion. We don\'t know [\x85] how much\nthat problem will cost American taxpayers [\x85].\n\nHOLTZ-EAKIN: We know that we\'ve already devoted resources at the federal\nlevel. We think that those resources ought to go to American home owners and\nsolve the financial stability problems that are clearly evident. The Fed, I\nthink, did a remarkable job last night. And senator McCain applauded their\nmove. But, these are all reactionary steps. We need to get ahead of this.\nThis problem began in the housing finance sector. It needs to be solved in\nthe housing finance sector, at least in part.\n\n[\x85]\n\nHOLTZ-EAKIN: [\x85] If Barack Obama wants to make the case that it\'s better to\nput this money into Wall Street, we\'re happy to have that debate. We think\nthis is an effective way to solve two problems. Number one, the declining\nhomeownership, the people in foreclosure, the kinds of bad [\x85] problems that\nproduces in neighborhoods. And number two, if do you this right, you can get\ninterest rates down in the mortgage market, stabilize the values. It has\nbeen a huge downdraft in the economy. And number three, put a floor under\nsome of these housing-related securities. That\'s a big objective here.\n\nHOLTZ-EAKIN:  [\x85] I think the bottom line here is we know that there are\nabout $10 million in the mortgages that are under water out there. There are\nestimates of the negative equity that would be out there that range\nsomewhere between the $300 and $600 billion dollar mark. We\'re not going to\nhave this be eligible to anyone. There\'s going to be a underwriting process\nthat would screen out those who did not supply credit information at the\noriginal mortgage Those who weren\'t living in the home, it isn\'t a primary\nresidence. There are gonna be sensible criteria to scale down which of that\nnegative equity gets attracted to the program. We\'re gonna target the real\nneeds.  People who want to be in their home, are really struggling. And the\nfallout that has on the financial sector.\n\nBRZEZINSKI : [\x85] I wonder if your candidate missed an opportunity, not last\nnight but during the bailout vote when he didn\'t hold folks on capitol hill\nthere until they came up with a bill that had no pork in it. So it sounded\nlike John McCain\'s bill.\n\nHOLTZ-EAKIN:  Well, I tell you, it is hard for him to, in the end to see\nthat kind of practice being jammed into a bill that he worked so hard to get\nrelief to the financial markets, but this is a situation whereas president,\nhe can make sure that never happens again. In the moment when the pressing\nneeds are visible, and the financial markets \x96 it was the wrong time to have\nthem do that. But he felt the greater need was to get bill through.  He\nworked awfully hard to build a bipartisan process to get a bill through.  What\nyou\'re seeing with this proposal last night, the resurgence plan, is a\ncontinuing effort to shape the use of those resources in the most productive\nway for this economy.\n\nHighlight #8\n*McCain Tells Couric the Great Depression is the Worst Thing to Affect\nAmerica* (CBS 10/08/08 6:41pm)\nKATIE COURIC: What do you think is the best and the worst thing that has\never happened to this country?\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: Well, that\'s an excellent question. Obviously, our founding was\nthe best thing that ever happened to our country because there was a unique\ncollection of the most wise and informed and incredible individuals that\njoined together to found our nation and create a document that is still a\nmodel to the rest of the world.\n\nMaybe the worst thing that happened to America is, in modern times, probably\nis the great depression. It affected probably more\x97a greater percentage of\nour population than any other economic or other impact that we experienced.\nI mean literally half of our population or 40% or whatever it was\x97huge\nnumbers that are incomprehensible were out of work and people literally\nstarved in America and that\x97we can\'t ever repeat that.\n\n-- \nJacob Roberts\nPAO\n208.420.3470 (c)\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
