Once we have this right, we will use it to build out other campaign materials, including the stump speech, web content, press releases, etc.  We want to get your feedback at the beginning to make sure we are on the right track.  Could you give us your thoughts and edits to this?  We're regrouping tomorrow at 8 am, so any initial comments tonight or tomorrow would be very helpful, but don't rush. \n> \n> Homebase\n> \n> People have fought their way back from tough economic times but the deck is still stacked for those at the top.  I'm running because I want to make being middle class mean something again.\n> \n> It's not enough that CEOs are making more than ever, your family needs to be able to get ahead too.  People need to have a little more so you can worry a little less.\n> \n> Look, I know it's not going to be easy.  We face some pretty powerful forces.  But  I've spent my whole life fighting for children, for families, standing up for America.  I think people know that I don't quit and I won't quit now\n> \n> For me, it isn't enough for American families to just get by, you deserve to get ahead.  It's your time.\n"
