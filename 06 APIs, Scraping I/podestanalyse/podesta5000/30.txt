john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi John,\n\nHope all is well with you.  I wanted to let you know I am moving back to\nColorado in early April.  I am really proud of what my team accomplished at\nDOE -- time to move on however.\n\nI want to help Hillary in any way I can.  I endorsed her very early on when\nI was still Majority Leader and remain firmly in her camp.\n\nNot surprisingly, there are some interesting political dynamics in Colorado\nthat I would be happy to discuss. Not email material.  Let me know how I\ncan be the most helpful.\n\nAlice\n303.589.2560\n'
