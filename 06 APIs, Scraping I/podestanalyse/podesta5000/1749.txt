Landrieu Ensures Americans Will Have A Real Debate on\nHealth Insurance Reform\n\n \n\n \n\nwww.americansunitedforchange.org\n<http://www.americansunitedforchange.org/> \n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                 CONTACT:      Jeremy Funk,\n202-470-5878\n\nDATE: November 21, 2009\nLauren Weiner, 202-470-5870\n\n \n\nAmericans United for Change statement on the vote to debate The Patient\nProtection and Affordable Care Act in the U.S. Senate\n\n \n\n Thanks to Senator Landrieu, Louisiana families and all Americans Will\nHave a Real Debate on Health Insurance Reform\n\n \n\nWashington D.C. - All Americans should be thankful for Senator\nLandrieu\'s vote tonight to allow debate on the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act\n<http://dpc.senate.gov/dpcdoc-sen_health_care_bill.cfm>  in the Senate\ntonight - allowing deliberation on sweeping health insurance reform\nlegislation that will cover 94 percent of the American people, make\ncoverage more affordable for all Americans, strengthen Medicare, and\nfinally put an end to the indefensible health insurance industry\npractices of denying coverage based on "pre-existing conditions" and\nrescinding policies when Americans get sick and need it most.\n\n \n\nTom McMahon, Acting Executive Director, Americans United for Change: "We\nare extremely pleased that the Senate tonight moved the ball forward on\nhealth insurance reform thanks to Senators like Mary Landrieu who\npromised to give Americans a true debate on a bill that includes a\nstrong public health insurance option and ensures that all Americans\nhave access to the quality, affordable health care they deserve.\n\n \n\n"On an issue of this magnitude - one that involves the well-being of all\nAmericans -- the very least members of the Senate owe their constituents\nis to allow this debate to take place.  Now every single Senator will\nget their chance to offer amendments and argue their case before the\nAmerican people on the floor of the Senate.  Yet, the Republican Party\nof NO has decided to vote against bringing this legislation to the floor\nat all - a vote that means they will do nothing as premiums continue\ngoing up four times faster than wages and health insurance companies\nreward their CEO tens of millions of dollars for doing unscrupulous\nthings to maximize profits, like rescinding policies when people get\nseriously sick. The only thing Republicans seem to be serious about is\nguaranteeing more big checks from the big health insurance industry by\nproposing no real reform at all.  So thank you Senator Landrieu for\ngiving a voice to those who need it most." \n\n \n\nClick Here to View Americans United for Change TV ad "After the Storm"\nWhich Aired in the Nation\'s Capital Recently Reminding Congress a Vote\nfor Health Insurance Reform Will Be a Vote on the Right Side of History\n<http://www.americansunitedforchange.org/press/releases/new_ad_tell_cong\nress_a_vote_for_health_insurance_reform_will_be_a_vote_on_t/> \n\n \n\n  <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXb2M7A1lyU> \n\n \n\nAmericans United for Change is a 501c4 issue-advocacy organization\nfounded in 2005 to help defeat President Bush\'s effort to privatize\nSocial Security.
