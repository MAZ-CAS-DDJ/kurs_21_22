john.podesta@gmail.comb'John -- \n\nThis is just adorable in every way.\n\nMyles, a 7-year-old from Milwaukee, wrote Vice President \nBiden a letter to suggest that if guns shot chocolate \nbullets, no one would get hurt.\n\nThe Vice President wrote back. Take a look at his response, \nthen share it with your friends:\n\n      Dear Myles --\n\n      I am sorry it took me so very long to respond to your letter.\n\n      I really like your idea. If we had guns that shot chocolate, \n      not only would our country be safer, it would be happier. People \n      love chocolate.\n\n      You are a good boy.\n\n      -- Joe Biden\n      \nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Note-to-Myles\n\nShare it on Facebook:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Note-to-Myles-FB\n\nShare it on Twitter:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Note-to-Myles-TW\n\nThanks,\n\nOrganizing for Action\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for Action\n\nContributions or gifts to Organizing for Action are not tax deductible.\n\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo update your address, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/change-address?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe from these messages, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscription\nOrganizing for Action, P.O.
