john.podesta@gmail.comb'Team,\n\nThought I would send a special edition of our Primary States Report with\nsome organizing highlights from our volunteers.\n\nAttached is a photo of our first volunteer shifts of the day to collect\nsign ups during Market Days in Chicago.  There are 33 volunteer shifts\ncurrently scheduled for Market Days this weekend.  Tomorrow we will have\nvolunteers at the Maine Democratic Party\'s Maine Lobster Bake.\n\nBelow are two emails we received at our grassroots@ account following our\nNational Volunteer Leaders call with Ambassador Young on the VRA\nanniversary and upcoming Commit to Vote Weekend of Action at the end of\nAugust. Our next call with volunteer leaders is scheduled for Monday night.\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nDate: Fri, Aug 7, 2015 at 8:32 PM\nSubject: FYI- note from CA\n\nI want you to make sure that you thank Ambassador Young for his\nmoving, inspirational words. I tried to write as fast as I can, but he\nmade me cry. I note the irony that I got to be in the presence of a\npolitical giant when others were worrying about the ten or so\nRepublican little men. I will never forget it. Yet another reason we\nmust elect Hillary.\n\nMy 1k-word article entitled "Why Progressives are going to vote for\nHillary but we don\'t know it yet" was published yesterday in the\nCommunity Alliance. I will send you a copy.\n\nThank you!\n\nPat, HFA Fresno Core Team\n\n*From:* <jcmitchell@net-venture.com>\n*Date:* August 7, 2015 at 9:00:51 PM EDT\n*To:* <Grassroots@HillaryClinton.com>\n*Subject:* *Question regarding the Vote Pledge forms*\n\nHi,\n\n     Great phone call yesterday. I loved hearing from Ambassador Young as\nwell as people from across the country!\n    I am in Tacoma, Wa. We are having an event Aug 26th and I would love\nto get the down load for the Vote Pledge for that event. I already have the\nSing Up forms. I am also going to have caucus info and dates to share.\n\n    I have ordered bumpers and lapel stickers for the event. Free would\nsure help, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait!  I have listed the event on the Hillary web\nsite.\n\n    Thanks again for the great call. I look forward to the call Monday!\n\nJeannie\n\nJeannine Mitchell\n\nTacoma/Pierce County\nHillary for America Co-Captain\n\nPast Chair ~Pierce Co.
