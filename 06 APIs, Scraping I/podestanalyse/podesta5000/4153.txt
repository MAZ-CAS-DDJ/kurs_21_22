john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\n \nToday, in what I hope will be one more step toward true marriage equality for all, the Supreme Court has announced its decision to hear two same sex marriage cases, including a constitutional challenge to the so-called "Defense of Marriage Act" (DOMA) in the case U.S.A. vs Windsor.\n\nThis is truly historic. Over the last 6 months, both the first and second federal appeals courts have declared DOMA unconstitutional, and now, for the first time since DOMA was signed into law in 1996, the nation\'s highest court will make its voice heard.  \n\nMomentum across the country is clearly growing towards recognizing the marriages of all loving and committed couples and finally putting the discriminatory DOMA policy into the dustbin of history. But even as DOMA heads to the Supreme Court, it is still incumbent upon Congress to pass the Respect For Marriage Act, which would not only repeal DOMA, but would also put in place much-needed protections for legally married same-sex couples.\n\nPlease sign my petition at repealDOMA.com to join the growing chorus of support for the passage of The Respect For Marriage Act and for the repeal of this discriminatory and unconstitutional law.\n\nhttp://www.repealdoma.com/petition-scotus\n\nIn addition to legislatively repealing DOMA once and for all, The Respect For Marriage Act, authored by my colleague Rep. Jerrold Nadler in the House, would also provide same-sex couples with the certainty that federal benefits and protections afforded straight married couples would be granted to them even if they were to move or travel to another state that doesn\'t recognize same-sex marriage.\n\nThe fact is, defeating DOMA in the courts is only half the battle. There is more work to be done and Congress must do its part too. I have no doubt that with your help, we will continue to build on each success to achieve the next success.\n\nPlease join the fight today at repealDOMA.com and let\'s send a clear message that discrimination has no place in our laws.\n\nhttp://www.repealdoma.com/petition-scotus\n\nThanks for joining me in this important fight for equality.\n\nKirsten \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis message was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.
