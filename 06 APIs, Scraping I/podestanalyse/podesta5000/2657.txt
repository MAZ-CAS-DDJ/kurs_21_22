Although I\'d tweak so it\'s not so much about winning and more about (a) generating a plan to get the economy working for the middle class and (b) building a campaign organization that can communicate that vision to all Americans--in person and online.  \n\n> On Dec 4, 2014, at 1:07 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com> wrote:\n> \n> Hi Everyone,\n> \n> Below are two versions of some forward-leaning language that would move the ball slightly on where she stands and allow for some transparency in terms of steps she\xe2\x80\x99ll take to think through all of this before a decision.

I could easily stop there and live the rest of my life a happy grandmother.  Over the last year and a half I\xe2\x80\x99ve had the opportunity to focus in new ways on the issues I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked on my entire career.  I launched my Foundation programs to address issues of women and girls\xe2\x80\x99 inequality, early childhood education, and our unemployed youth; I wrote a book about my time as Secretary of State, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve had some time to reflect on my experiences.  And this fall I had the opportunity to go out on the campaign trail and talk about Democratic values a little.  Of course the results were not as I would have hoped, but it was good primer to start thinking a little more broadly about what Democrats stand for and how important it is to convey those values to people, not run away from them.\n>  \n> \xc2\xb7      Now it\xe2\x80\x99s time to do my homework, to think about what American leadership should look like in 2015, 2016, and beyond and what I would bring to that.  And how a campaign for the presidency would be an effective tool to have that discussion.  Elections should be about testing people, and the result should not only be a President, but people who are better positioned to govern having had a healthy and honest conversation with their constituents.\n>  \n> \xc2\xb7      So I want to make sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from all kinds of people around the country with big and small ideas alike about how to keep moving this country forward, about how we can do better.  And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be talking to people who have insight into how a presidential campaign needs to look in 2015 & 2016 in in terms of positioning itself to be successful.\n>  \n> \xc2\xb7      So I want to make this decision on my own schedule, with as much thought and information as possible to guide me.  And if I run, I want to win, and do so by having a conversation about how America can always do better, how we can continue to move this country forward, how we can rebuild the middle class from the bottom up and the middle out.\n>  \n> \xc2\xb7      So that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s on my mind, and the next few months are going to be invaluable in turning my attention to this decision in earnest. And like I said, in the end, my goal is to get to \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>  \n>  \n> Question: Are you running for President?\n>  \n> [Less Forward-Leaning]\n>  \n> \xc2\xb7      Running for President is a humbling experience.

But like I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t something I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make a decision about until after the first of the year, and the goal is to make a decision that\xe2\x80\x99s right for my country and right for me and my family.\n> \n> ###\n> \n> \n> http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/clinton-2016-campaign-manager-guy-cecil-113314.html\n> \n> Hillary Clinton has met with potential campaign managers\n> By Maggie Haberman\n> Politico.com\n> With weeks to go until she makes an announcement about her future, Hillary Clinton has started meeting with a broad range of political figures \xe2\x80\x94 including potential campaign managers, POLITICO has learned.\n> \n> Clinton, who several people close to her describe as still not firmly decided on a campaign, met Wednesday with outgoing Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee executive director Guy Cecil, one of the two people most often described as a potential campaign manager for her 2016 campaign, people familiar with the get-together said.\n> \n> It was unclear whether the two discussed a future role in a campaign \xe2\x80\x94 Cecil did not respond to requests for comment.\n> \n> But the meeting is one of several Clinton has begun to hold in the period following the midterm elections, in which she was very active,  and as she is turning her attention toward what a campaign would look like if she runs again.\n> \n> Clinton has also spoken with Robby Mook, another often-mentioned potential campaign manager, about 2016, people familiar with the discussions said, but the details were unclear. Mook did not respond to an email.\n> \n> Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill, asked about the meetings, said, \xe2\x80\x9cAs [Clinton] decides, she\xe2\x80\x99s casting a wide net and wants to hear from a variety of people on a range of specific topics, from policy ideas to what a successful campaign would look like.\xe2\x80\x9d\n> \n> Mook, who managed longtime Clinton family friend Terry McAuliffe\xe2\x80\x99s 2013 campaign for governor of Virginia, is said to have informally worked with Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s advisers in the lead-up to the 2014 midterms, particularly around her initial trip to Iowa.\n> \n> Cecil worked with Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team on her schedule for a wide number of Senate candidates this cycle. Both Cecil and Mook worked on Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 presidential race.\n> \n> Another potential campaign manager, EMILY\xe2\x80\x99S List president Stephanie Schriock, recently declined to tell reporters at a daylong Ready for Hillary conference whether she had met with Clinton.\n> \n> Earlier Wednesday, the White House revealed that Clinton had spent an hour with President Obama at a catch-up meeting.\n> \n> The contours of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s potential campaign have been a fixation of Washington operatives and donors for much of the past two years, in part because of what her choices might say about lessons she learned from her failed 2008 effort.\n> \n> But it\xe2\x80\x99s also been in part because she is the prohibitive Democratic front-runner, making her the biggest game in town for people who want to work on the presidential race.\n> \n> Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s timing about making a final decision and then announcing it has been a source of speculation for months, as her advisers split on whether she should get in sooner \xe2\x80\x94 which some former Obama advisers counseled as well \xe2\x80\x94 to end the appearance of being coy, or take as long as she can.\n> \n> She has added three new paid speeches through January and February, indicating that a formal announcement may not come until after that window. John Podesta, currently counselor to President Barack Obama and a veteran Clinton hand, is expected to serve a senior role in her campaign.\n> \n> Podesta told reporters Thursday he will stay on until after the president\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address.\n> \n> ###\n'
