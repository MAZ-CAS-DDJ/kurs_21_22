john.podesta@gmail.comb'Yet another juicy nugget from today... Enjoy!\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: [...] You might recall this time last year at the time of the\nConvention my party, my candidacy was in a bit of trouble. [laughs] [...]\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: [...] Recently I think you made some statements in regards\nto an agenda that Ward Connerly has pushed to eliminate affirmative action.\n[...] Why in America where there are disparities -- alarming disparities --\nin employment between management, between income, wealth, health, would you\nwant to eliminate programs that document that so we understand where we are\nand can plan for where we need to go?\n\nMCCAIN: Well let me say that [audience applause interrupts, McCain awkwardly\nsmiles] Let me say that I- *Affirmative action is in the eye of the\nbeholder. *I think the United States of America has reached a point where we\nshould provide equal economic opportunities for all Americans. And I do not\nand Americans have rejected a quota system and that frankly is something I\ndon\'t think helps anyone and has not helped anyone. What I want to assure\nyou that I don\'t believe any of these initiatives that we\'re talking about\nin any way eliminates our ability to assist small businesses, people\neconomically disadvantaged, and others, and *I will continue my fight for\nequal opportunity for every American* and I\'m happy to tell you I think\nthere\'s still the best equal opportunity employer in America today is the\nUnited States military. I think that Colin Powell is an example that and I\nthink that fact that the United States Army just had a woman promoted to\nfour star general -- the highest rank -- and I\'m proud of equal opportunity\nin the United States military provides to everyone and we don\'t do it by\nquotas.\n(Speech; Orlando, FL 08/01/08)\nTo View: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPs9vgd6pwk\nTo Download http://issuealliance.box.net/shared/6hyltw5k4c\n\n-- \nSara DuBois\nTracking / Communications Manager\nProgressiveAccountability.org\nsara@progressiveaccountability.org\n202-609-7681 (office)\n410-967-7306 (cell)\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
