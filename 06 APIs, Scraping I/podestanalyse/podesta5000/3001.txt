john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hm, reinstatement fee for 1,000 miles is $10.  Is that worth it to you?\r\n\r\nWhy are your US air miles so low, you might ask?  Because we always put them on United, and then after the new merger, we always put them on American.  Your American miles are currently 125,468:\r\n\r\n[cid:image004.png@01D01871.06C32DD0]\r\n\r\nFrom: John Podesta [mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com]\r\nSent: Friday, December 12, 2014 2:14 PM\r\nTo: Sepp, Eryn\r\nSubject: Fwd: Don\'t lose your Dividend Miles\r\n\r\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\r\nFrom: "US Airways - Dividend Miles" <dividendmiles@myusairways.com<mailto:dividendmiles@myusairways.com>>\r\nDate: Dec 12, 2014 5:28 AM\r\nSubject: Don\'t lose your Dividend Miles\r\nTo: <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>\r\nCc:\r\n\r\nPlease add dividendmiles@myusairways.com<mailto:dividendmiles@myusairways.com> to your personal address book to ensure delivery.
