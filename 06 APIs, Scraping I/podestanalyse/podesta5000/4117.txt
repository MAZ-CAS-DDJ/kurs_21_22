john.podesta@gmail.comb'>From Richard:\n\nSince I was asked on Friday about the Defense of Marriage Act in an\ninterview on MSNBC, I\'ve checked with people who were involved then to make\nsure I had all my facts right. It turns out I was mistaken and the effort\nto pass a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage came some\nyears later.  The larger point I was trying to make about DOMA, however, is\nstill true. It was neither proposed nor supported by anyone in the Clinton\nadministration at the time. It was an effort by the Republicans in Congress\nto distract attention from the real issues facing the country by using gay\nmarriage, which had very little support then, as a wedge issue in the\nelection. The legislation passed by overwhelming veto-proof margins in both\nhouses of Congress and President Clinton signed it with serious\nreservations he expressed at the time. Luckily the country has evolved way\nbeyond this in the last 20 years and most Americans, including the Supreme\nCourt, now embrace LGBT equality. We are a better country for it. Although\nthere is much work that remains, and I\'m eager to help advance the day when\nwe are all truly equal.\n\n\nOn Sun, Oct 25, 2015 at 4:51 PM, Dominic Lowell <dlowell@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n> + JP\'s personal email\n>\n> On Sunday, October 25, 2015, Dominic Lowell <dlowell@hillaryclinton.com>\n> wrote:\n>\n>> Here is what Gautam put together to be helpful:\n>>\n>> "I\'m not my husband.
