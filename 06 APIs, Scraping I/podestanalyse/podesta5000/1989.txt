As Federal support for cyber incidents begins to focus on the most high-level targets, leaving states and their businesses and non-profits to fend for themselves in the event of a breach, new solutions are necessary.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Governor will describe his state\'s initiatives, including a new National Cybersecurity Intelligence&nbsp;Center, which will provide training, incident response and serve as a resource for business, non-government organizations, and Colorado government officials. Why does it matter and what will it do? &nbsp;</p> <h2 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif; font-size: 16px;">Speaker</h2> <p><strong>The Honorable John Hickenlooper</strong><br />Governor of Colorado</p> <h2 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif; font-size: 16px;">In Conversation with&nbsp;<br /></h2> <p><strong>The Honorable Jane Harman</strong><br /><span>Director, President and CEO, Wilson Center</span></p>\n\nRSVP NOW \xc2\xbb <http://pages.wilsoncenter.org/03.21.16Hickenlooper_Registration.html>\nForward to a Friend <http://go.wilsoncenter.org/v/s0YL0Dw0yV8F0M0b0q00V0U>\n<http://www.wilsoncenter.org>\nMonday, March 21, 2016\n\n11:00 am-12:00 noon\n\n6th Floor Auditorium\n\nDirections <http://www.wilsoncenter.org/directions>\n\nWilson Center\n\nRonald Reagan Building and\n\nInternational Trade Center\n\nOne Woodrow Wilson Plaza\n\n1300 Pennsylvania, Ave., NW\n\nWashington, D.C. 20004\n\nPhone: 202.691.4000\n\nwwics@wilsoncenter.org <mailto:wwics@wilsoncenter.org>\n\nPrivacy Policy <http://www.wilsoncenter.org/privacy-policy>\n\n<div style="text-align: center">Subscriber: podesta@law.georgetown.edu.
