Do you have time maybe Thur or Fri to talk about the action in October? Just wanted to do a quick check-in on that.\n> \n> Tomorrow (ha!) a group of over 100 Canadian scientists will formally call for a moratorium on tarsands expansion. I was hoping you could forward this to Mr. Podesta given your relationship with him. Given his recent comments in the Gaurdian (http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/28/canada-must-deal-with-tar-sands-emissions-says-clinton-campaign-chief) some on our side of things are wanting to make sure he gets this new info.\n> \n> A call for a moratorium has never been done in the scientific community\x97they decided to do this now as the road to Paris is happening and solutions to keep 75% of the commercially proven fossil fuels have to stay in the ground. \n> \n> It only makes sense to start with tar sands given how carbon intensive this form of oil is (not to mention the amount of water and energy used to mine and produce it).\n> \n> Of course, we have our own valid reasons for stopping the expansion of tar sands which focus around eminent domain for private gain, water pollution, liability of economic damages when a pipeline bursts, etc.\n> The consensus scientist statement from Canada draws a number of conclusions about tar sands:\n> \n> Continued investment in oil sands production and infrastructure is not consistent with Canada\x92s current climate targets and is incompatible with limiting climate warming to a level that society can handle without widespread harm.\n> Contaminants from oil sands development permeate the land, water and air of the Canadian boreal and many of these impacts are difficult to mitigate; \n> In Canada, there are few controls and no uniform standards regarding pollution and other impacts from oil sands mining; \n> The oil sands industry\x92s claim that its mine sites can be restored to their former natural state is not true;\n> Development of the oil sands violates the title and rights of many Aboriginal peoples of North America.\n> \n> \n>> \n> \n> \n\n'
