Concerned that this could\noffend other Latin groups bc it implies Cuban-Americans are the leading\nLatino group.  I worry about that and I\'m not sure we win enough by\nclaiming that line.\n\nLove that we give a shout out to the Pope.  Great.\n\nNot a huge fan of talking about Carlos - I think Bush would use it to later\nbe reasonable/understanding of folks who want to open up Cuba.\n\nPower of proximity - I\'ve asked Paola Luisi to think of something that\ncaptures this concept in spanish.  It doesn\'t quite apply as a direct\ntranslation.  But, by the way, this is a cool concept with Mexico too.  So,\nbuilding this out is interesting.\n\nIn the world of coming up with what I call "original content" is the idea\nbelow.  Not sure what others think but may be an easy line to add (flags\nalso raised below):\n\n"If Republicans had their way, they would relegate the island to 100 years\nof solitude."\n\nOne Hundred Years of Solitude is the title of Gabriel Garcia Marquez\'s most\nfamous novel and is the second most printed book in Latin America after the\nbible. The story is about a mythical town named Macondo that is doomed to\nthe inescapable repetition of history as protagonists and their descendants\nare haunted by ghosts and outside forces that represent colonialism and\nideological struggle.\n\nThis would need to be heavily vetted by policy and run by and a literary\nexpert as there are many metaphors in the book, but I think it would be\ninteresting to quote Latin America\'s most famous novelist if the speech\nindeed plans to frame Cuba policy within the greater context of the\nAmericas.\n\nPolitical considerations:\n\n-Garcia Marquez met with Castro, but he has also met with WJC. The author\nhad a personal relationship with Castro and criticized the revolution in\nlater years.\n-There is a part of the book where the Marquez illustrates the 1928 Banana\nMassacre by the United Fruit Company in Colombia and it highlights the dark\nhistory of American multinational corporations in LatAm. Some could link it\nto American companies that operated in Cuba before the revolution.\n\nOn Thu, Jul 30, 2015 at 8:15 AM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n> This is solid. 2 ideas:\n> 1) should she mention Oswaldo Paya on page 2 in the parade of regime\n> horribles?
