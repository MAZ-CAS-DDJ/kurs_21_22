I'm incredibly grateful for this new opportunity as the\nGovernment Relations team takes on a myriad of issues in support of our\nmembers and taking on this job, at this time- especially as we look\ntowards a new Administration and Congress in 2009 - is incredibly\nexciting.\n\n \n\nI look forward to talking to you in the coming weeks and discussing new\nways we can work together.\n\n \n\nMy contact information will remain:\n\nEmail:  amy.dacey@seiu.org <mailto:amy.dacey@seiu.org> \n\nPhone: 202-730-7727\n\nCell:     202-528-7492\n\n \n\nAll the best,\n\nAmy\n\n \n\n \n\n"
