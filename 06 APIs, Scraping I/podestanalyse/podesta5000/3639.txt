john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi\n\nAttached is my latest piece on what a Clinton Campaign can learn from the Hunger Games.\n\nHillary Clinton can become the face of a bottoms-up economic revolution like the one portrayed in "The Hunger Games: Mockinjay-Part 1," forcing the government to expand the middle class and see the economy through the lens of women.\n\nThe aspects of Hillary Clinton\'s life that make her arguably the most qualified candidate ever to run for President-lawyer, First Lady, U.S. Senator, Secretary of State, survivor-come at a cost: she\'s lived in a "celebrity bubble" for most of the last 30 years.  It limits her connections to people who nourish her emotional memory bank and who introduce her to their life stories.\n\nHillary\'s biggest challenge now is to get back into the field to refuel her authentic self.    Philip Seymour Hoffman\'s character-a mixture of Jim Margolis and Mike Murphy-gets it right when he argues that Katniss needs to "go home" to regain her passion for the fight.   It is all about seizing the opportunity to let Hillary return to Hillary-emotionally, psychologically, physically-so she can find herself in spontaneous and unscripted moments with the people she can help the most.\n\nhttp://www.sacbee.com/opinion/california-forum/article4299915.html\n\n\n\n\nKAREN SKELTON\nSkelton Strategies\nP:  415.531.2737\nE:  Karen@Skeltonstrategies.com<mailto:Karen@Skeltonstrategies.com>\nLinkedIn:  http://www.linkedin.com/in/karenskelton\n\n\n'
