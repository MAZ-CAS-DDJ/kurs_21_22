Jim McDermott Joins AUFC, NELP to Note First Round of Extended\nUnemployment Insurance Checks Shipping Out to Struggling Americans This\nWeek Thanks to the New Direction in Congress\n\n \n\nAfter 6 Straight Months of Lost U.S. Jobs, Help is On the Way for\nMillions of Americans Unable to Find Work in the Bush Economy \n\n \n\nWith the 2nd Incremental Increase in the Minimum Wage Set to Take Place\nNext Week, UI Extension Legislation Signed Into Law Last Month Was the\nLatest Example of What the New Leadership in Congress Means for\nStruggling Middle-Class and Less Fortunate Americans Long Neglected\nUnder Failed Bush-Conservative Policies\n\n \n\n            Washington D.C. - U.S. Rep. Jim McDermott (WA-7) joined by\nAmericans United for Change and the National Employment Law Project\ntoday to note the first round of unemployment insurance checks shipping\nout this week to millions of out-of-work Americans who have exhausted\ntheir unemployment benefits and are struggling under the Bush economy.\nAs a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and chairman of\nthe Income Security and Family Support Subcommittee, Congressman\nMcDermott was the chief architect of the legislation passed by the\nDemocratic-led Congress and signed into law last month to provide an\nadditional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits in all states for millions\nof Americans struggling to find work in the Bush economy.  The UI\nextension came not a day too soon with the latest U.S. Labor Department\njobless report <http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080703/economy.html?.v=20>\nfinding employers cut payrolls by 62,000 in June -- the sixth straight\nmonth of nationwide job losses. In all, the economy has lost 438,000\njobs this year.  \n\n \n\n            "The extended unemployment benefits are going to provide\nreal relief for struggling Americans during this economic crisis, and UI\nis the latest example of the new direction that Speaker Nancy Pelosi has\ntaken Congress in - putting the issues of the American people first on\nthe agenda," said U.S. Rep. Jim McDermott.  \n\n \n\n            NELP estimates that over 900,000 eligible jobless workers\nhave already exhausted their state benefits and will immediately begin\ncollecting extended benefits, once their states\' programs are in place.\nAn additional 2.7 million jobless workers will likely exhaust their\nstate benefits without finding work between now and the program\'s\nexpiration next March.  Altogether, the extension will help more than\n3.5 million long-term jobless workers make ends meet and pump billons of\ndollars back into the struggling economy, in a spur to job growth.  \n\n \n\n"Thanks to the new leadership in Congress, a much needed economic boost\nis on the way for millions of unemployed Americans who have worked hard,\npaid into the system, but have exhausted their benefits and are\nstruggling to find work in the Bush economy," said Jeremy Funk, of\nAmericans United for Change.  "It\'s also worth noting that next week, on\nJuly 24 - the second incremental increase in the minimum wage will\nofficially take place, raising it to $6.55 per hour on its way to $7.25\nper hour next July.  Raising the minimum wage - which hadn\'t been\ntouched in a decade under Republican rule - was among the very first\npriorities when the Democrats took control of Congress in 2007.    Along\nwith this UI extension, there\'s no better examples of what the new\nprogressive majority in Congress means for America\'s middle-class and\nless fortunate - the millions of Americans who don\'t belong to country\nclubs or sit on corporate boards that were neglected under 8 years of\nthe Bush administration and 6 years of conservative rule in Congress."  \n\n \n\n"We applaud the Congress for making the extension of jobless benefits a\nreality for nearly 4 million struggling workers and families, despite\nsignificant opposition from the Bush Administration.  In doing so, the\nCongress has also helped stimulate the economy by getting benefits out\nstarting this week that will help stimulate the economy far sooner into\nthe economy downturn compared to the extension program enacted last\nrecession.  There\'s more to be done, especially if the economy continues\nits decline, but this week marks an important milestone in the fight to\ncreate a more fair and effective safety net that meets the challenges of\ntoday\'s economy," said Maurice Emsellem, policy co-director of the\nNational Employment Law Project.\n\n \n\n            "After weeks struggling to find a job and nothing to show\nfor it, I thought there was something wrong with me," said Michael\nCottle, a long-term unemployed worker, formerly worked as an IT\nConsultant based in New Jersey.  "But, reading the newspaper every day\nand seeing how bad the economy has gotten, I realized it\'s a problem for\neverybody.  I really appreciate that the Democrats in Congress like\nCongressman McDermott were able to get this passed so struggling\nfamilies out there can get a little help through these tough times." \n\n \n\n-30-\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nJeremy J.
