john.podesta@gmail.comb"Dear colleagues,\n\nI wanted to share a few updates on CEA and our work over the past few weeks. (As always, if you have any feedback on these emails or would like to be removed from the list, please feel free to contact Andie Taverna).\n\nWe will have a few staffing changes taking place in the near future. First, as was announced yesterday, Sandy Black<https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/23/president-obama-announces-more-key-administration-posts> will be joining CEA as a Member, taking the place of Betsey Stevenson who will return to the University of Michigan. Maury Obstfeld<http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2015/pr15343.htm> will also be departing CEA for a new role as Economic Counsellor and Director of Research at the IMF. While we will greatly miss Betsey and Maury, they have both made significant contributions during their time here and CEA was quite lucky to have them as colleagues, perhaps no one more so than me. I would also like to share that CEA's talented and tireless Chief of Staff Jessica Schumer will sadly be departing, with Andie Taverna taking over the role. Finally, Jordan Matsudaira has recently departed as Chief Economist, and Matt Fiedler has stepped into the role.\n\nI would also like to share a few items that CEA has worked on in the past few weeks, as I have been out of the office welcoming a new baby.\n\n\n*         Interest Rate Report<https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/interest_rate_report_final_v2.pdf>: This report examines the decline in long-run equilibrium interest rates over the past thirty years, reviewing the latest data, academic research, and implications from market trends. We also study both transitory and longer-lasting factors that have contributed to the trend of declining long-run interest rates. (Under the leadership of Maury Obstfeld and Linda Tesar)\n\n*         Report on Costs of Youth Disadvantage<https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/mbk_report_final_update1.pdf>: This report reviews the significant opportunity gaps that disadvantaged youth, particularly young men of color, face in education, exposure to the criminal justice system, and employment. It quantifies the costs of these gaps to the U.S. economy and reviews high-return programs that can improve outcomes for these youth. (Under the leadership of Betsey Stevenson and Abbie Wozniak)\n\n*         Productivity Growth in Advanced Economies Speech<https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/20150709_productivity_advanced_economies_piie.pdf>: In a speech at the Peterson Institute, I examined trends in productivity growth since 1948 and the current state of productivity growth, driven largely by investment. I also discussed the potential future outlook for productivity growth and a policy agenda that could boost productivity and in turn middle-class incomes.\n\n*         Digital Divide Issue Brief<https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/wh_digital_divide_issue_brief.pdf>: This brief reviews differences in internet access by income, location, and age, along with the number and type of broadband options available across different places. Our analysis finds large gaps in internet access, with potentially wide-reaching impacts as many services and interactions move online. (Under the leadership of Tim Simcoe)\n\n*         Social Security and Medicare Trustees Report Blog Post<http://www.eop.gov/https:/www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/07/22/trustees-reports-highlight-continued-progress-slowing-growth-health-care-costs-need->: Following the annual Trustees Report release on Wednesday, this blog examines the dramatic improvement in Medicare's fiscal health since 2009, thanks in substantial part to the reforms of the ACA. It also reviews Social Security's finances, the need for Congressional action to protect disability benefits, and projections for the Social Security COLA and Medicare Part B Premiums this year. (Joint with Jeff Zients)\n\nBest regards,\nJason\n"
