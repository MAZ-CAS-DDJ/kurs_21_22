I can't tell if he would make equity/debt investments or just grants, but I got the sense during the Board meeting that he would like the flexibility to make both. \r\n \r\n\r\n----- Original Message -----\r\nFrom: John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>\r\nTo: Doug Band - PC\r\nCc: Amitabh Desai; Bruce Lindsey; Laura Graham; Justin Cooper - PC; Dennis Cheng\r\nSent: Mon Apr 30 14:35:45 2012\nSubject: Re: CHAI fund and advisory board\r\n\r\nI'm a little confused--an investment fund or an innovation fund?\r\nProbably both are bad, but they seem different in the pitch and\r\nliklihood that people would give $.\r\n\r\nOn Fri, Apr 27, 2012 at 9:21 PM, Doug Band <doug@presidentclinton.com> wrote:\r\n> Great stuff\r\n>\r\n> It would be hard to imagine a worse idea than ira magaziner running an\r\n> investment fund of any kind not to mention one under this scenario\r\n>\r\n> Good luck with this\r\n>\r\n> From: Amitabh Desai [mailto:adesai@clintonfoundation.org]\r\n> Sent: Friday, April 27, 2012 08:03 PM\r\n> To: Bruce Lindsey <blindsey@clintonfoundation.org>; Laura Graham\r\n> <lgraham@clintonfoundation.org>; Doug Band; Justin Cooper; Dennis Cheng\r\n> <dcheng@clintonfoundation.org>; john.podesta@gmail.com\r\n> <john.podesta@gmail.com>\r\n> Subject: CHAI fund and advisory board\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> You probably already are aware but just to be sure: yesterday in the CHAI\r\n> board meeting, Ira discussed the formation of an advisory board for CHAI \xe2\x80\x93\r\n> he said he is targeting 10 people to each give $500k per year for 3 years.\r\n> He mentioned the names below.
