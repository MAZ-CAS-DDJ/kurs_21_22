I\xe2\x80\x99m told Jorge Neri, who works at the White House office of public engagement, is leaving 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue for Nevada, where he worked in 2012. Neri ran a field campaign for immigration reform, has deep ties to the minority community and is going to be HRC\xe2\x80\x99s organizing director in Nevada. He also has ties to Team Reid. So with a Latina who could be the first Latina senator at the top of the ticket and a Hispanic probably the CD4 standard-bearer (no word yet on CD3), this could be the cycle the Latino vote reaches a new apex in Nevada. Add Neri to Emmy Ruiz and Tim Hogan, whom I already have told you about, and this shows Hillary knows we matter.\n> \n> -- \n> You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "TeamComm" group.\n> To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to teamcom+unsubscribe@jesseferguson.com.\n> To post to this group, send email to teamcom@jesseferguson.com.\n> To view this discussion on the web visit https://groups.google.com/a/jesseferguson.com/d/msgid/teamcom/15e8cecc1c3f165416b226381a0a396b%40mail.gmail.com.\n> \n'
