As author Michelle Alexander reported in her viral piece\nfor The Nation, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Hillary Clinton Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Deserve The Black Vote\n<http://www.thenation.com/article/hillary-clinton-does-not-deserve-black-peoples-votes/>,\xe2\x80\x9d\n"prison admissions for drug offenses reached a level in 2000 for African\nAmericans more than 26 times the level in 1983.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHillary Clinton, who had nothing to do with drafting the bill or signing it\ninto law, is being chastised for pushing it as first lady. Alexander\nslammed her for helping to sell the bill by invoking the now-discredited,\nsuperpredator myth, which wrongly predicted an exploding number of lawless\nyoung people.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are not just gangs of kids anymore,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are often\nthe kinds of kids that are called \xe2\x80\x98superpredators.\xe2\x80\x99 No conscience, no\nempathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to\nbring them to heel.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlexander overlooks that the quote came from a speech Clinton gave in\nJanuary 1996. The crime bill had been on the books for two years by then.\nStill, the quote has come back to haunt Clinton (a Google search shows it\nhas been mentioned more than 300 times).\n\nThere is another element of the story that hasn\'t been mentioned much. Sen.\nBernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is building a serious challenge to Clinton for\nthe Democratic presidential nomination, appears to have invoked the\nsuperpredator myth as well. And he did so in a speech addressing the crime\nbill\n<http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/8/8/1410122/-Senator-Sanders-remarks-on-1994-Crime-Bill>\nbefore\nit passed.\n\nSanders, who was in the House of Representatives at the time, was skeptical\nabout the legislation when it was being debated. Though he would vote for\nits passage\n<https://votesmart.org/bill/2673/8308/27110/violent-crime-control-and-law-enforcement-act-of-1994#.Vrz02ylCljC>,\nhe did have strong progressive-minded criticisms, lamenting the country\xe2\x80\x99s\nmass incarceration problem and income inequality. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can create meaningful\njobs, rebuilding our society, or we can build more jails,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nSanders also added this caveat:\n\nIt is my firm belief that clearly, there are people in our society who are\nhorribly violent, who are deeply sick and sociopathic, and clearly these\npeople must be put behind bars in order to protect society from them.\n\nSanders doesn\xe2\x80\x99t explicitly invoke the so-called superpredator idea in this\nstatement. But it seems likely this was his reference. In the context of\nthe crime bill, it\'s hard to imagine that his remarks were about serial\nkillers. This doesn\'t necessarily make him non-progressive. It just\nunderscores that Sanders, too, got swept up in the crack-era fearmongering\nof the time. He did, after all, support the bill, despite his reservations.\n\n*Watch Sanders\' speech: *\n\n\n\n-- \n\nJosh Schwerin\n\nSpokesman, Deputy Director of Rapid Response\n\nHillary for America\n\n@JoshSchwerin\n'
