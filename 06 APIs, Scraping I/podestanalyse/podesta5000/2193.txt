john.podesta@gmail.comb'Friend,\n\nAs we mourn the victims of the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, and\xc2\xa0send our deepest condolences to the parents and the entire community,\xc2\xa0we join many Americans who are asking what can be done to prevent\xc2\xa0similar tragedies from happening in the future.\n\nI have been concerned about gun violence here in Los Angeles and\xc2\xa0throughout our country. This incident, after the theater shooting in\xc2\xa0Aurora, Colorado, and the killings at a Sikh house of worship in\xc2\xa0Wisconsin, highlight the reality that it is far too easy for\xc2\xa0high-powered firearms to fall into the wrong hands.\n\nWhat we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is not working. This is a time for prayer and\xc2\xa0reflection, but it is also a call to action. You can help right\xc2\xa0now by clicking here <http://www.ericgarcetti.com/tellcongress> \xc2\xa0to sign our petition in support of Senator Dianne Feinstein\'s legislation to reinstate the federal Assault Weapons Ban. The\xc2\xa0Ban expired in 2004. It\'s time to bring it back. We need common\xc2\xa0sense measures to keep high-powered firearms from convicted felons,\xc2\xa0convicted domestic abusers, terrorists and people found to be\xc2\xa0dangerously mentally ill.\n\nSenator Feinstein has courageously stood up to the powerful gun lobby\xc2\xa0in Congress. Now we must stand with her.\n\nWe need to support programs like the Center to Prevent Youth\xc2\xa0Violence\'s "Speak Up for Youth!" that encourages students to help\xc2\xa0prevent school shootings and senseless violence. We need mental\xc2\xa0health screening and services to assess and treat those suffering from\xc2\xa0mental illness.\n\nNo program or law will stop every tragedy, but we can do better. As\xc2\xa0the Brady Campaign against gun violence says, "We Are Better Than\xc2\xa0This."\n\nPlease join me in supporting Senator Feinstein and demand that\xc2\xa0Congress reinstate the Assault Weapons Ban. Sign our petition today <http://www.ericgarcetti.com/tellcongress>.\n\nPlease share this email with your family and friends, and help us make\xc2\xa0our nation safer for everyone.\n\nThank you.\n\n-Eric\n\nhttp://www.ericgarcetti.com/ <http://www.ericgarcetti.com/>\n\n\n-=-=-\nEric Garcetti- Los Angeles Mayor 2013 - United States \nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.
