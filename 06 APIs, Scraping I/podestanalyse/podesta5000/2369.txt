Claire McCaskill\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-sen-claire-mccaskill/story?id=30399618&singlePage=true\n\nRADDATZ: And joining us now, Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, who was\none of the first to endorse Hillary Clinton.\n\nSenator McCaskill, we just heard Jon Karl say there will likely be two\nhearings right in the midst of the campaign.\n\nHow does Mrs. Clinton deal with that?\n\nSEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D), MISSOURI: Well, first of all, I think most\nAmericans understand that this has turned into a political exercise.\nBenghazi has had more hearings, more documents produced, more investigative\neffort than the entire Iraq War. And at this point, it\'s pretty clear that\nshe implemented all the recommendations of an independent review, she has\nanswered all of the questions.\n\nAnd so I think that they are really getting into dangerous territory where\nit becomes blatantly obvious that this is just about politics and not about\npolicy.\n\nRADDATZ: Let -- let me turn to what Democratic strategists are saying and a\nlot of Democrats and Independents, as well. They don\'t want this to be a\ncoronation, a Bloomberg Poll saying 72 percent of Democrats and Independents\nsay Hillary Clinton facing serious competition would be a good thing.\n\nYet you have said you don\'t think she needs a challenger.\n\nMCCASKILL: Well, first of all, I think this is about who is most qualified\nto be a champion for working families in this country. That\'s what this\nelection is about. It\'s not about personalities. It\'s not about what someone\nlooks like or it\'s not about political gotcha moments. It\'s about policy.\n\nAnd I think what she\'s shown this week is she wants to go out one-on-one and\nmake sure she is listening to the American people about their fears and\nfrustrations. I think the way she\'s going about this campaign shows she\'s\nnot interested in a coronation either.\n\nRADDATZ: But -- but you still don\'t think she needs a serious challenger?\n\nMCCASKILL: Well, the bottom line is, she\'s the most qualified. Anyone can\nchallenge Hillary Clinton if they would like to. The reason people aren\'t\nchallenging her is because of her qualifications.\n\nYou have a cast of thousands on the Republican side because there\'s -- it\'s\nclear that many of them are reading Cliff Notes to try to figure out this\ndangerous world right now.\n\nRADDATZ: Well, you -- you endorsed President Obama in 2008.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton wasn\'t the right person to be president then, why is she\nthe right president -- person to be president now?\n\nMCCASKILL: Listen, that was a tough choice. I am glad I don\'t have that kind\nof tough choice this time. This is not a hard choice. And I don\'t think it\nwill be a hard choice for America.\n\nThis is a woman who is tested, who has a strong resume of accomplishments in\nevery important job she\'s had.\n\nShe doesn\'t need to get briefed about the complicated world we live in. The\nreason this is not hard is because of who she is at this point in time in\nour country\'s history.\n\nRADDATZ: Marco Rubio -- we were talking about the Republicans, of course --\nwho announced his candidacy this week, frames it as a generational choice.\n\nLet\'s listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA: Now, just yesterday, a leader from\nyesterday...\n\n(BOOS)\n\nRUBIO: -- big money a campaign for president by promising to take us back to\nyesterday.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: Your reaction to that, Senator?\n\nMCCASKILL: Listen, there is -- if you look at Marco Rubio\'s record, he took\na principled, courageous stand on immigration reform and we passed a\ncomprehensive bill in the Senate. And then the minute his pol -- party\'s\nbase starting chewing on about it, the minute Rush Limbaugh criticized him,\nhe folded like a cheap shotgun. That\'s old politics. That\'s not what we need\nright now. That is the stalest trick in the book. That is shirking on your\nprinciples because of the political necessities of your party.\n\nSo, I don\'t think that he necessarily represents some generational change.\n\nIt sounds like to me old style politics.\n\nRADDATZ: OK, thank you very much Senator McCaskill.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Milia Fisher [mailto:mfisher@hillaryclinton.com\n<mfisher@hillaryclinton.com>]\nSent: Sunday, April 19, 2015 1:11 PM\nTo: Jesse Ferguson; Amanda Renteria; Tony Carrk; Kristina Schake; Jennifer\nPalmieri\nSubject: McCaskill on abc\n\nHi all- John asked me to see if you all happened to have the transcript of\nMcCaskill on abc this morning.
