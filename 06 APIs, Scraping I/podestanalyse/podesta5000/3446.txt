john.podesta@gmail.comb'Statement by Justin Ruben, Executive Director of MoveOn.org Political\nAction:\n\nAmericans from across the political spectrum agree: The Federal Reserve\'s\n"just trust us" attitude is unacceptable. That\'s why our 5 million members\nare looking to the Senate to pass Sen. Sanders\' amendment to bring\ntransparency to the Fed.\n\nVoters are looking for real accountability for those who wrecked our economy\nand then stuck American families with the bill. It is painfully obvious that\nour nation\'s most powerful financial institution not only got it wrong on\nthe economy, but is now trying to protect itself--and Wall Street--from\nbeing held responsible for their actions.\n\nAnd below is an email that went out to our members in key states asking them\nto call their senators.\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Daniel Mintz, MoveOn.org Political Action <moveon-help@list.moveon.org\n>\nDate: Tue, May 4, 2010 at 1:52 PM\nSubject: Audit the Fed\n\n\n  The Senate may hold a critical vote as soon as today to audit the Federal\nReserve. We need an audit to find out which Wall Street banks got $2\ntrillion of taxpayer-backed loans and on what terms. Can you call Sen.\nFeinstein right now and tell her to support Sen. Sanders\' amendment to audit\nthe Fed?\n\n Senator Dianne Feinstein\nPhone: 202-224-3841\n <http://pol.moveon.org/call?tg=FSCA_1&cp_id=1349&id=&t=1>Report your\ncall<http://pol.moveon.org/call?tg=FSCA_1&cp_id=1349&id=&t=2> Dear\nMoveOn member,\n\nDid you know that an arm of the federal government has the power to hand out\nunlimited amounts of taxpayer money\x97without having to tell Congress or the\npresident who they gave that money to, or why?1\n\nIt\'s called the Federal Reserve, and during the financial crisis, the Fed\ngave out more than $2 trillion in taxpayer-backed assistance to big Wall\nStreet banks.2 You read that right. $2 trillion! And the public still has no\nidea who they gave it to and on what terms.3\n\nToday, Sen. Bernie Sanders is offering a critical amendment to the financial\nreform bill that would bring transparency and accountability to the Federal\nReserve.\n\nIt will give us a public accounting of what went wrong and how our money was\nspent so we can learn from this disaster and make sure we don\'t repeat the\nsame mistakes in the future.4\n\nWall Street and the Federal Reserve are fighting the amendment, but we have\na real shot at winning\x97there is growing bipartisan support for it.5 The vote\ncould come as soon as this afternoon, so Sen. Feinstein needs to hear from\nher constituents today. Can you call Sen. Feinstein right now and tell her\nto support the Sanders amendment to audit the Fed?\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein\nPhone: 202-224-3841\n\nThen, please report your call by clicking here:\n\nhttp://pol.moveon.org/call?tg=FSCA_1&cp_id=1349&id=&t=3\nThe Fed is supposed to monitor the economy for systemic risks and take\naction to prevent them. But instead, they let the housing bubble grow\ndisastrously big and then tried to clean up the mess they made as quietly as\npossible\x97using our money. And yet, members of the Federal Reserve, like\nchair Ben Bernanke, think that they should be able to continue business as\nusual with no transparency.6\n\nNewly released minutes from a Federal Reserve meeting in 2004 show that they\nhad early evidence of the housing bubble, but chose to ignore it. And when\nasked whether they should justify that decision publicly, then-chair Alan\nGreenspan said:\nWe run the risk, by laying out the pros and cons of a particular argument,\nof inducing people to join in on the debate, and in this regard it is\npossible to lose control of a process that only we fully understand.7\n\nIn the wake of the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression, it\'s\nclear that Greenspan and the rest of the Federal Reserve got it wrong. But\nwithout a public accounting of what went wrong and who benefited from the\ncleanup, we won\'t be able to identify the mistakes that were made and learn\nhow to avoid future financial catastrophes.\n\nCan you call Sen. Feinstein right now and ask her to support Sen. Sanders\'\namendment to audit the Fed? Tell Sen. Feinstein that it\'s time to hold Wall\nStreet accountable.\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein\nPhone: 202-224-3841\n\nThen, please report your call by clicking here:\n\nhttp://pol.moveon.org/call?tg=FSCA_1&cp_id=1349&id=&t=4\nThanks for all you do.\n\n\x96Daniel, Jodeen, Nita, Milan, and the rest of the team\n\nSources:\n\n1.
