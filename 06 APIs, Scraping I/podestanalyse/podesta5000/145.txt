Lauded as one of the nation\x92s most dynamic writers, Elizabeth is the author of six books of poetry, including American Sublime, a finalist for the 2005 Pulitzer Prize, and The Light of the World, her critically-acclaimed memoir on love and loss. As the foundation shifts its overall focus to addressing inequality, Elizabeth will guide our efforts to examine how cultural narratives impact and shape social movements, and how media and the arts can contribute to a fairer and more just society.\n\nLegal scholar and author Michelle Alexander<http://fordfoundation.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3f89269c6132144b6f1c5ce78&id=3dc00e97ae&e=9b0d012622> (pictured, right) joins us as a senior fellow, contributing to the foundation\x92s work on democracy, rights, and justice. Michelle is a renowned and respected civil rights lawyer and legal scholar whose work has been foundational to racial justice movements over the past two decades. Her best-selling book, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, has spurred debate and action nationwide. In her role at Ford, Michelle will continue her advocacy efforts while working on a new book that addresses the practical questions involved in building a transformative human rights movement.\n\nThey will both bring new vibrancy to our work, and we are honored to welcome them to the foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis email was sent to hms@sandlerfoundation.org<mailto:hms@sandlerfoundation.org>\nView this email in your browser<http://us10.campaign-archive2.com/?u=3f89269c6132144b6f1c5ce78&id=2507f0ad86&e=9b0d012622>    unsubscribe from this list<http://fordfoundation.us10.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=3f89269c6132144b6f1c5ce78&id=4b4b67ddba&e=9b0d012622&c=2507f0ad86>    update subscription preferences<http://fordfoundation.us10.list-manage2.com/profile?u=3f89269c6132144b6f1c5ce78&id=4b4b67ddba&e=9b0d012622>\nFord Foundation \xb7 320 E 43rd Street \xb7 New York, NY 10017 \xb7 USA\n\n\n\n\n'
