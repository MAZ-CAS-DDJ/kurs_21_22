They want their elected leaders to have the integrity and sense of justice to know what's right, along with the strength and courage to get things done. We're fortunate to have all those qualities in Kirsten Gillibrand.\n\nKirsten has taken the lead in the Senate on issues New Yorkers care about - from providing health care coverage to all Americans to protecting our children from gun violence. She's working hard to find ways to create more jobs in this struggling economy, and she's been at the forefront of putting a stop to the Stupak Amendment. \n\nWe need to keep Kirsten's strong, progressive voice in the U.S. Senate, but we need your help to do it. Kirsten's campaign must raise $100,000 by midnight December 31 to reach a crucial end of quarter goal. By supporting Kirsten today, you'll make sure New York has a powerful advocate in the Senate for years to come.\n\nClick here and give a donation to Kirsten's campaign. Help her meet her goal of raising $100,000 by midnight December 31 so we can maintain New York's strong representation in the Senate.

They're pulling out all the stops - trying to find a high-profile candidate who they think can beat her and putting together their usual strategy of lies and distortions.\n\nThey're going to come at us with everything they've got, so we need to go after them with everything we've got. We must build up our resources now so we're ready to respond to the GOP attack machine when it starts up in full force.\n\nLet's tell the Republicans that Kirsten is no easy target. By contributing today, you'll show them that Kirsten has the strong grassroots support she needs to beat back their challenge and maintain the Democratic majority in the Senate.\n\nClick here to donate to Kirsten's campaign and help her reach this crucial end of quarter goal by midnight December 31.

There's no doubt in my mind that Kirsten Gillibrand has what it takes.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer"
