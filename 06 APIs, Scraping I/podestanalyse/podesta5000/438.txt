john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear VoteVets.org Supporter,\n\nWe\'re coming up to the end of the quarter for fundraising, and\nwe need your help so we can continue to support veterans running\nfor office. Over the course of two election cycles, since the\nfounding of VoteVets.org PAC, we\'ve had tremendous success,\nelecting a number of veterans to Congress, and helping make\nothers competitive in races where everything was stacked against\nthem.\n\nMost importantly, we have changed the debate. Can we count on\nyou to keep that going?\n\nCLICK HERE TO HELP VETERANS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS -\nhttps://secure.ga3.org/03/votevets_contribute_2009\n\nThink about where the debate on Iraq and Afghanistan was before\n2006, and where it is today. Back then, very few challenged\nthen-President Bush, and those neocons who controlled the agenda\non matters of war. Since VoteVets.org PAC burst on the scene,\nand exposed policies that hurt our troops and veterans, the\ndebate has very much shifted. And, those veterans we helped\nelect to Congress have carried that message loudly and clearly\nin the halls of power.\n\nLET?S KEEP ELECTING VETERANS ? HELP US HERE\nhttps://secure.ga3.org/03/votevets_contribute_2009\n\nOf course, we understand times are tough. But, every bit helps,\nand is appreciated. So, whatever you can afford, we can promise\nyou this - it will not go to waste. VoteVets.org PAC is\ncommitted to not just supporting good candidates, but spending\nevery penny wisely.\n\nTogether, we can keep moving the debate forward!\n\nSincerely,\nJon Soltz\nIraq War Veteran\nChairman, VoteVets.org\n\nPaid for by VoteVets.org Political Action Committee\nNot Authorized by Any Candidate or Candidate\'s Committe\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nVisit the web address below to tell your friends about this.\n\nhttp://ga3.org/join-forward.html?domain=votevets&r=r1dUYd5a2n3U\n\nIf you received this message from a friend, you can sign up for\nVoteVets.org at:\n\nhttp://ga3.org/votevets/join.html?r=r1dUYd5a2n3UE\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThis message was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.
