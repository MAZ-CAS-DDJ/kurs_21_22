john.podesta@gmail.comb'Let me know if I\'m too late on this, but I think we could be more specific on policy details.  At least we can point people to the topics where she has said she wants to offer solutions. (These are some I remember. I\'m sure there are more)\n\n\n-- the burden of student debt\n--the need to expand early childhood education opportunities\n--the unfair tax loopholes that let hedge fund managers pay less than truckers and nurses\n--the high cost of prescription drugs -- that are sold cheaper in other countries\n--leveling the playing field for small businesses who can\'t take advantage of the loopholes that big corporations use\n--unregulated money in politics\n\n\nMandy Grunwald\nGrunwald Communications\n202 973-9400\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Jennifer Palmieri <jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com>\nTo: Jesse Lehrich <jlehrich@hillaryclinton.com>\nCc: hrcrapid <hrcrapid@googlegroups.com>\nSent: Wed, Apr 15, 2015 3:04 pm\nSubject: Re: DRAFT - Surrogate attack and response talkers for today\n\n\n \nThanks - get rid of "lack of policy details" and replace with "policy questions."  \n \nNice job.  \n \n  \nSent from my iPhone \n \n  \nOn Apr 15, 2015, at 1:52 PM, Jesse Lehrich <  jlehrich@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:  \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n    \n     These would be going to a small group, only surrogates going on TV.

Anyone who knows her or her record knows that policy is core to who she is.\n\nHillary believes we need bold proposals to address the problems facing the middle class, focusing on tackling what she calls the \xe2\x80\x9cfour fights\xe2\x80\x9d:  \n     \n- building our economy\n     \n- strengthening families and communities\n     \n- fixing our dysfunctional political system\n     \n- protecting our country from threats.\n     \n     \n      \n(Four Fights in Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s own words from Monticello, Iowa event on 4/14/15): \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday. We need to strengthen families and communities, because that\xe2\x80\x99s where it all starts. We need to fix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all, even if that takes a constitutional amendment. And we need to protect our country from the threats that we see, and the ones that are on the horizon.\xe2\x80\x9d \n     \n     \n     But Hillary doesn\'t want to take policy off the shelf and say that specific policies are the answer for the country without spending a lot of time talking to the American people about their concerns.       \n\nShe wants to road test her ideas, and more importantly, hear from people directly to learn what they are worried about.  Often one will find that an issue the press or Washington might be focused on is not what is on the minds of everyday Americans.     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n     Marriage Equality    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      Hillary Clinton supports marriage equality and hopes the Supreme Court will come down on the side of same-sex couples being guaranteed that constitutional right.     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n     Issa Letter/NYT Story    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n     Topline response To Issa letter/NYT story:\n     \n      \n       \n      \n      \n       There is nothing new here. This was a letter sent in 2012 to all cabinet agencies leaked by congressional aides to the press two years after the fact at the start of Hillary Clinton\'s campaign.  The letter was sent shortly before she left the State Department and was responded to in due course.        \n      \n       \n      \n      \n       As we\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, as Secretary, she followed the letter and the spirit of the law.  She has provided all of her work email to the State Department and has asked the State Department to release them publicly as soon as possible.        \n      \n       \n        \nWe\'ve been over this, and over this, and over this again.  She had an email account.  She used that email account to correspond with over 100 people inside the State Department, outside the State Department, likely even some Republicans. This was not a secret being kept, it was an email address.\n       \n       \n        \nAnd let\'s remember something.  This was a 2012 letter, isn\'t it interesting that it\'s coming out over 2 years later in 2015, the first day she begins campaigning for President?  What does that tell you about this?  It tells you that this is more of the same partisan charade by the Republicans, the same Republicans who are turning to this because they didn\'t find any smoking gun on Benghazi.  \n       \n      \n      \n       \n      \n      \n       If asked about the mention in the story about violating the rules in the foreign affairs manual:      \n      \n       \n      \n      \n       Let\'s remember something, she wasn\'t the first Secretary of State to use a private email account.  But she was the first and only former Secretary to turn hers over to State, and certainly the first to ask for them all to be released to the public.        \n      \n       \n      \n      \n       She conducted herself according the letter and the spirit of the rule.  And funny enough, as recently as 6 weeks ago the Department was asking employees to use their private accounts because their servers were down.       \n      \n       \n      \n      \n       \n      \n      \n       If pressed on whether Hillary Clinton gets to play by her own set of rules:      \n      \n       \n      \n      \n       Well I\'ll tell you this, she has asked the State Department to turn over all 55,000 pages of her emails, and it\'s still not enough. So I\'d say that the Republicans try and hold her to a different standard because they are afraid of what she has to offer as a candidate.        \n      \n       \n      \n      \n       And the Republican candidates, not to mention Congress, are not exactly fully transparent in this regard.      \n      \n       \n      \n      \n       She\'s out there talking to voters, listening to their ideas and talking through some of hers.        \n      \n       So you will see them respond to these partisan attacks when needed, but they also aren\'t going to let this kind of charade distract from what this campaign is about: people.       \n     \n     \n      \n     \n     \n      \n     \n     \n      If asked whether this is going to derail her campaign:      \n     \n     \n      \n     \n     \n      Look, this campaign is not going to be about Hillary Clinton, and it\'s certainly not going to be about petty partisan attacks on Hillary Clinton. This is going to be a campaign about people, and which candidate will fight to get everyday Americans ahead and stay ahead.     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n--     \n    \n     \nJesse Lehrich      \nRapid Response Associate      \n      \nHillary For America      \n      \n781-307-2254      \n      \n@JesseLehrich      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n --    \n You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "HRCRapid" group.   \n To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to    hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.   \n To post to this group, send email to    hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.   \n For more options, visit    https://groups.google.com/d/optout.   \n   \n \n  \n --  \n You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "HRCRapid" group. \n To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to  hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com. \n To post to this group, send email to  hrcrapid@googlegroups.com. \n For more options, visit  https://groups.google.com/d/optout. \n \n\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "HRCRapid" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n'
