john.podesta@gmail.comb'John:\n \nCongratulations and gratitude for all that you and CAP have done to grease this moment.  America has never shone more brightly.\n \nLet me know if I can help you in any way.\n \nMarc Stanley (see below) is a prot\xe9g\xe9 of Fred Baron whose funeral I attended this week. NJDC, which he chairs, has some huge Jewish donors who are not known in  traditional progressive funding circles.  Frankly, I can\'t imagine you have the time, but if you do, it would be worth your while to spend 45 minutes with them. \n \nWarm regards,\n \nRob\n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: Marc R.

I hope all is well and you are having fun.  I am cautiously optimistic.\n\t\n\n\tAs you know, I am Chairman of the National Jewish Democratic Council (NJDC).  Our Annual Meeting is slated for December 4 in DC.  Would you be willing to address a dinner of our larger donors the evening before (December 3)?\n\n\tPlease let me know.\n\n\tMany thanks.\n\n\tMarc\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t***********************************\n\tMarc R.
