john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi John!  Hope all is well and you had at least a short breather over\nChristmas!  No rest for the weary though, I am sure.\n\nI wanted to check in to see if we might be able to steal your Truckee place\nthis weekend--not sure if you or the family are headed there, but the kids\nwere Jonesing for snow if it might be empty!\n\nThanks so much, and tell the HRC crew I send my love!\n'
