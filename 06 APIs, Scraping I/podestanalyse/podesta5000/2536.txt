Michele Bachmann (R-MN) to orchestrate the anti-health reform rally<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/11/05/holocaust-sign/> today. As ThinkProgress reported yesterday, AFP has been encouraging right-wing activists to board their buses - free of charge<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/11/04/king-astroturf-paulrevere/> - to attend the rally<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/11/05/akin-pledge/>. While AFP does not disclose all of its corporate donors, foundations controlled by David and Charles Koch provide millions in yearly funding, and David continues to chair the AFP foundation and preside over<http://washingtonindependent.com/62453/david-koch-at-defending-the-american-dream-summit> AFP\'s annual convention.\n\nThinkProgress found at least a dozen AFP staffers standing at their designated bus drop off point near the Capitol, handing out signs, directions, talking points, petitions, and donuts to protesters. Many of the people who work at AFP are longtime Republican operatives, like Ben Marchi<http://www.americansforprosperity.org/041709-ben-marchi-afp-va-state-director>, the AFP Virginia director who previously worked for the National Republican Congressional Committee and for Rep. Tom Delay (R-TX). Victor Zapanta produced this video report of AFP staffers talking about their exploits at the rally today:\n\nAFP STAFFERS: We have 25 buses just from Pennsylvania, New Jersey we probably have 5 or 6 from Maryland.\n\nAFP STAFFERS: We have about 40 buses coming.\n\nWatch it:\n\nDavid Koch\'s AFP has a long history of marshaling "grassroots" support for GOP objectives. In the early 1990s, AFP, then known as Citizens for a Sound Economy,worked secretly<http://www.pbs.org/newshour/forum/may96/background/health_debate_page3.html> with then-Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-GA) to organize angry crowds following the Clintons as they touted their health reform bill. Industry money from health insurance, telecommunications, oil, and other companies has flowed freely<http://www.citizen.org/documents/Citizens%20for%20a%20Sound%20Economy%20Report.pdf> to AFP over the years to help AFP promote an agenda of boosting the rich, stripping consumer safeguards, and maintaining corporate monopolies. Phillip Morris rented out AFP from the Koch family, contributing millions to the organization in exchange for AFPto build opposition<http://www.rollingstone.com/nationalaffairs/index.php/2009/10/01/echoes-of-philip-morris-and-hillarycare/> to tobacco regulations.\n\nAFP\'s daily activities are managed by Tim Phillips<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/05/29/afp-timphillips-astroturf/>, an infamous astroturf lobbyist who built a career using Christian front groups to wage stealth campaigns. For example, his work includes fighting under the radar<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/05/29/afp-timphillips-astroturf/> to promote energy deregulation for Enron and helping Jack Abramoff clients continue forced abortion sweatshops in the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nWill the media report on the true driver of today\'s rally? Or will they leave David Koch out of the equation, despite his hand-in-glove involvement.\n\n\n-----\nAdam Jentleson\nCommunications Director, Progressive Media\nCenter for American Progress Action Fund\najentleson@americanprogressaction.org<mailto:ajentleson@americanprogress.org>\najentleson (AIM)\n202-247-8614 (cell)\n\n\n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
