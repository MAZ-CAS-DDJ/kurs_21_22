Reportedly,<http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0303/Unemployment-benefits-Jim-Bunning-relents-Senate-passes-extension> had Republican Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky not lifted his block on the legislation Tuesday night, "More than 200,000 unemployed Americans were set to lose benefits, half of whom already had stopped receiving unemployment checks."\n\nSEE BELOW - as noted by the Institute for Southern Studies<http://www.southernstudies.org/2010/03/senators-voting-against-extending-jobless-benefits-hail-from-states-devastated-by-recession.html>, "Of the 19 Senators who voted against the [recent Senate] package including jobless benefits after [Sen. Bunning\'s] filibuster ended, eight of them come from states that face jobless rates higher than the national average,"  South Carolina\'s unemployment rate stands at 12.6 percent, significantly higher than the national average of 10 percent.\n\nTom McMahon, Acting Executive Director, Americans United for Change: "Jim DeMint\'s crusade to see President Obama fail<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/09/12/demint-health-battle/> has reached a new low.  In a perfect example of how out-of-touch a Washington politician can get with the realities back home, Senator DeMint actually voted to deny urgently needed unemployment assistance to thousands of South Carolina families for no other discernable reason but to play political games.  Considering South Carolina is suffering from worse joblessness than most states, Senator DeMint\'s actions are simply inexcusable.  Senator DeMint seems to believe his party can gain politically by keeping Washington in gridlock, and he\'s clearly willing to do anything to accomplish this misguided goal - even if that means playing games with the lives of his most vulnerable constituents.  It\'s sad."\n\n-30-\n[cid:image002.jpg@01CABBC2.58025D80]\n\nhttp://www.southernstudies.org/2010/03/senators-voting-against-extending-jobless-benefits-hail-from-states-devastated-by-recession.html\nSenators who voted against extending jobless benefits hail from states devastated by recession\nLate yesterday, Kentucky Republican Sen. Jim Bunning relented<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/02/bunning-blocks-jobless-be_n_482291.html> on a multi-day filibuster that was holding up passage of a bill including a 30-day extension on unemployment benefits.\n\nBunning\'s retreat allowed the bill to reach the Senate floor, where it quickly passed 78-19<http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=2&vote=00032#position> and was signed into law by President Obama last night (the House had passed a similar measure last week).\n\nThe Kentucky senator\'s intransigence may turn out to be a political blunder, just at a time when the GOP was gaining political momentum. Fellow Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine criticized Bunning\'s move<http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35675122/ns/politics-capitol_hill/>, saying over 500 jobless would lose benefits in the next week in her home state.\n\nIt\'s also unlikely to endear Bunning and Republicans in states hard-hit by the recession and facing high unemployment.\n\nOf the 19 Senators who voted against the package including jobless benefits after the filibuster ended, eight of them come from states that face jobless rates higher than the national average -- all but one of them (Sen. Ensign of Nevada) from the South.\n\n[cid:image004.jpg@01CABBC2.58025D80]<http://www.southernstudies.org/SenJoblessBenefits%202.jpg>\nAs the chart shows, Republicans in the South who voted against the bill are especially vulnerable to charges that they\'re putting politics ahead of the interests of their own recession-rocked constituents.\n\nThese are the kind of votes that could prove costly for Republicans where they face challengers in 2010, including North Carolina, Kentucky and New Hampshire.\n\nIt could even be an issue in states like Texas, where -- despite having an unemployment rate below the national average -- over a quarter million residents lost jobs in 2009. But ironically, the vote was cast by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who on the same day lost in her primary bid defend her senate seat.\n[cid:image005.jpg@01CABBC2.58025D80]<http://www.southernstudies.org/cgi-bin/mt/mt-cp.cgi?__mode=view&amp;blog_id=5&amp;id=19>\nBy Chris Kromm<http://www.southernstudies.org/cgi-bin/mt/mt-cp.cgi?__mode=view&amp;blog_id=5&amp;id=19> on March 3, 2010 2:02 PM\nAdd a Comment: 0<http://www.southernstudies.org/2010/03/senators-voting-against-extending-jobless-benefits-hail-from-states-devastated-by-recession.html#comments> | Recommend: Vote 2 Votes <javascript:void(0)> | Email this entry<http://www.southernstudies.org/cgi-bin/mt/plugins/SendEntry/mt-send-entry.cgi?__mode=create&entry_id=12166>\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
