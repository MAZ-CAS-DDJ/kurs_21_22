And thanks to your support, LCV waged one of the\nmost effective  campaign in the history of the environmental movement.\nCongratulations!\n\nIn  the face of unprecedented spending by big polluters, we helped\nre-elect  President Obama, won seven of our eight priority Senate\nraces, defeated four of  the Flat Earth Five, and defeated a\nrecord-smashing 11 Dirty Dozen incumbents.\xa0\n\nIf  Hurricane Sandy didn't make it plain enough, these hard-fought\nvictories send a  very clear message to policy makers at every\nlevel:\xa0 it is time to advance  strong climate policies.\n\nIt  has meant a great deal to have you as a partner in this work. I\nhope you'll enjoy  our more detailed analysis of the impact we had\ntogether: The 2012 Elections  and the Shifting Politics of Energy.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=KybJrDKnECjwEC6jsQj1Lg\n\nForward,\n\nGene\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\nP.S.  I hope you will join LCV's political team tomorrow for a post\nelection report,  analysis and discussion. The call will be held on at\n2 p.m. EST.\xa0  To receive the call-in number, please contact Josh\nHicks at (202) 454-4565 or Josh_Hicks@lcv.org.\xa0\n\n******************\n\nUpdate Your Profile\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=rv3JCoXK5aYB_G2Iej9zuA\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=ejkICv-nut2I7Rc4IC08eRBupMyL0k8x&cid=0\n\n1920 L Street, NW Suite 800 \nWashington, DC 20036\n202-785-8683"
