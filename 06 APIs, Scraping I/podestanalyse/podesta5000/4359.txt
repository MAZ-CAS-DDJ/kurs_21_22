john.podesta@gmail.comb'John --\n\nRight now, my job -- along with those of my colleagues -- could be in jeopardy.\n\nI\'m a public school teacher in Philadelphia. And, like most states across the country, Pennsylvania is facing some bad budget shortfalls.\n\nWithout federal help, a lot of teachers like me -- as well as other public servants like police officers and firefighters -- will lose their jobs. Maybe you know some of these people. Maybe it\'s you.\n\nDemocrats in Congress are trying to do the right thing, proposing emergency assistance for states to preserve more than 100,000 jobs like mine. They\'re racing back to the Capitol for an emergency session this week to pass this bill and save these jobs.\n\nBut Republicans are standing in the way. Minority Leader John Boehner is calling the bill a "payoff" to "special interests" and attacking every Democrat who is fighting for us.\n\nBut I\'m not a special interest. I\'m a teacher.\n\nCan you join me in telling House Democrats that they have our support as they fight for our jobs?\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/MyJob6\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi -- and the entire Democratic Caucus -- have decided to rush back to Washington to make sure that hundreds of thousands of workers like me will get to keep our jobs. In addition, the bill will actually create even more job growth by closing tax loopholes for companies that ship American jobs overseas.\n\nBut the Republicans are going to do everything they can to prevent this aid.\n\nPlease stand with me, in support of Democratic leaders who are standing up for folks like me:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/MyJob6\n\nThank you,\n\nWendy C.\nTeacher\nAmbler, Pennsylvania\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for America, a project of the Democratic National Committee -- 430 South Capitol Street SE, Washington, D.C. 20003.
