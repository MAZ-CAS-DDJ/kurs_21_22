It is slowing. More than\n400,000 people have lost their jobs since December, and the rate of new job\ncreation has fallen sharply. Americans are worried about the security of\ntheir current job, and they\'re worried that they, their kids and their\nneighbors may not find good jobs and new opportunities in the future. To\nmake matters worse, gas is over $4 a gallon and the price of oil has almost\ndoubled in the last year. The cost of everything from energy to food is\nrising.\n\nI have a plan to grow this economy, create more and better jobs, and get\nAmerica moving again. I have a plan to reform government, achieve energy\nsecurity, and ensure that healthcare is available and affordable for all. I\nbelieve the role of government is to unleash the creativity, ingenuity and\nhard work of the American people, and make it easier to create jobs.\n\nAt its core, the economy isn\'t the sum of an array of bewildering\nstatistics. It\'s about where Americans work, how they live, how they pay\ntheir bills today and save for tomorrow. It\'s about small businesses opening\ntheir doors, hiring employees and growing. It\'s about giving workers the\neducation and training to find a good job and prosper in it. It\'s about the\naspirations of the American people to build a better life for their\nfamilies; dreams that begin with a job.\n\nThere are many things the next president must do to get our economy running\nat full strength again, and to create the good jobs Americans need. But no\neconomic challenge today is more urgent than strategic energy independence.\n\nOur dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making,\nand was caused by the failure of politicians in Washington to think long\nterm about the future of the country. By 2030, America\'s demand for energy\nwill rise by nearly twenty percent. Our jobs, our way of life, and our\nsecurity depend on the next President beginning to solve this challenge.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I announced the Lexington Project. This project \x96 named for a\nplace where Americans asserted our independence once before \x96 will secure\nour energy future, and it will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs for\nAmericans.\n\nWe have billions of barrels of oil available to us in the United States, and\nvast reserves of natural gas as well. So we will begin by producing more of\nboth, to send a message to the market and result in lower prices for oil and\ngas.\n\nWe will develop more clean energy. Nuclear power is the most dependable\nsource of zero-emission energy we have. We will build at least 45 nuclear\nplants that will create over 700,000 good jobs to construct and operate\nthem.\n\nThe development of clean coal technology will create jobs in some of\nAmerica\'s most economically disadvantaged areas. Clean coal demonstration\nprojects alone will employ over 30,000 Americans. Ohioans get 86 percent of\nall their electricity from coal. Your energy future and this economy require\nus to find and deploy a clean coal technology.\n\nMy proposal to help automakers design and sell new generations of cars that\ndon\'t depend on gasoline will re-invigorate that struggling industry. In the\ndevelopment and manufacture of hybrid, flex-fuel, and electric cars, jobs\nwill grow at auto plants, parts manufacturers, and in the communities that\nsupport them.\n\nMy plan to develop wind and solar power and renewable technologies will\ndrive innovation and create high tech jobs. Ohio alone has more than 60\ncompanies in the wind turbine supply chain, and wind and solar energy can\nbecome a research mission for the state\'s universities, and a new focus for\nOhio\'s manufacturing base.\n\nMy opponent\'s answer to the Lexington Project is no; no to more drilling; no\nto more nuclear power; no to research prizes that help solve the problem of\naffordable electric cars. For a guy whose "official seal" carried the motto,\n"Yes, we can," Senator Obama\'s agenda sure has a whole lot of "No, we\ncan\'t."\n\nTo achieve full economic recovery, we need to think as well about the\nleading job creators in America. Small businesses have created 233,000 jobs\nso far this year while other sectors are losing jobs. Small businesses are\nthe job engine of America, and I will make it easier for them to grow and\ncreate more jobs. My opponent wants to make it harder by imposing a\nhealthcare mandate on small business that will add a crushing $12,000 to the\ncost of employing anyone with a family. That means new jobs will not be\ncreated, existing jobs will be cut, and small-business employees who keep\ntheir jobs will likely have their wages cut to pay for this mandate. My plan\nattacks the real problems of health care \x96 cost, availability and\nportability.\n\nWe also need to keep the IRS from taking more of your income and making life\nharder for small business. If you believe you should pay more taxes, I am\nthe wrong candidate for you. Senator Obama is your man. The choice in this\nelection is stark and simple. Senator Obama will raise your taxes. I won\'t,\nbecause jobs are the most important thing our economy creates. And when you\nraise taxes in a bad economy you eliminate jobs. I\'m not going to let that\nhappen.\n\nIf you are one of the 23 million small business owners in America who files\nas an individual rate payer, Senator Obama is willing to raise your tax\nrates. If you have an investment for your child\'s education or own a mutual\nfund or a stock in a retirement plan, your taxes could be higher. He will\nraise estate taxes to 45 percent. I propose to cut them to 15 percent. And\nfor those of you with children, I will double the child deduction from\n$3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent, in every family in America.\n\nMy opponent also believes America would be better off by foregoing\nopportunities to sell in growing foreign markets. I disagree. Twenty-five\npercent of all jobs in this country are linked to world trade. In just five\nstates \x96 Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Colorado \x96 over five\nmillion jobs depend on open markets. To promote job creation, I will expand\nforeign markets for our goods and services.\n\nBecause the vast benefits of a global marketplace come at a cost for many,\nwe have an obligation to help our workers receive the training they need\nwhen plants close and jobs are lost. Under my reforms, we will use our\ncommunity colleges to help train workers for specific opportunities in their\nhometowns. And for older workers who have lost a job that won\'t come back,\nif they move rapidly to a new job we\'ll help make up the difference in wages\nbetween their old job and the new one.\n\nTo promote job creation, we must also get government\'s fiscal house in\norder. Government has grown by 60 percent in the last eight years, because\nthis Congress and this Administration have failed to meet their\nresponsibilities. When I\'m president, I will order a stem to stern review of\ngovernment, modernize how it does business and save billions of dollars. I\nwill veto every single bill with wasteful spending. We aren\'t going to\ncontinue mortgaging this country\'s future for things Americans don\'t want or\nneed.\n\nMy opponent has a very different record on this issue. He voted for an\nenergy bill stuffed with give-aways to oil companies at a time of record\nprofits. I voted against it. He supported the $300 billion pork-laden\nagricultural subsidy bill. I opposed it. As for earmark spending, I have\nnever asked for a single earmark in my entire career. In his Senate career,\nSenator Obama has requested some $930 million for earmark projects. That\ncomes to more than a million dollars in pork for every working day since he\nbecame a United States Senator. There is never a good time to put your\nparochial and political interests above those of the nation \x96 and least of\nright now, during an economic downturn.\n\nFor many, it is a very tough time. But my friends, we\'ve been through worse,\nand beaten longer odds. Even in these difficult days, we must believe in\nourselves. Nothing is inevitable in America. We\'ve always been the captains\nof our fate. All you\'ve ever asked of government is that it stand on your\nside, not in your way. I intend to do just that: to stand on your side; to\nhelp business and not government create jobs; to fight for your future and\nnot the personal ambitions of politicians and bureaucrats.\n\nWe have much work to do if we are to end the self-interested partisanship\nthat prevents us from fixing problems that need to be fixed and changing\ngovernment to keep this country prosperous and at peace. I make you one\npromise I will always keep, no matter what.\n\nIn war and peace, I have been an imperfect servant of my country. But I have\nbeen her servant first, last and always. Whenever I faced an important\nchoice between my country\'s interests or my own interests, party politics or\nany special interest, I chose my country. Nothing has ever mattered more to\nme than the honor of serving America, and nothing ever will. If you elect me\nPresident, I will always put our country first. I will put its greatness;\nits prosperity and peace; and the hopes and concerns of the people who make\nit great before any personal or partisan interest. I will keep that promise\nevery hour of every day I am in office. And I will ask you to help me\nconvince Congress, Republicans and Democrats, to keep that promise as well.\nThere is nothing beyond our ability to achieve. We are Americans, and we\ndon\'t hide from history. We make history. All we need is to believe in\nourselves as we always have, and to cherish the beautiful country we are so\nblessed to call home.\n\n*Question and Answer:*\n1 Q) [holding a no nukes sign] My father worked at the Piketon plant and him\nand my mother died of cancer.  I want to clean-up the area.  I don\'t want\nother people to work in a very toxic industry.\nMCCAIN: I believe that nuclear power is and can be safe.  As you know, I\'ve\nserved in the Navy.  And we\'ve sailed nuclear ships around the world for 60\nyears -- and there\'s no report of people getting sick.  I know about Three\nMile Island and Chernobyl.  I do believe nuclear power is safe.  I think\nother energy sources aren\'t safe -- greenhouse gas emissions are also\nharming us.  The evidence I have is that nuclear power is safe and nuclear\nenergy needs to be part of our solution.\nFOLLOW-UP:  Workers going into the plant need to be protected.  I\'ve\ncontacted the authorities on this matter and no one is getting back to me.\nMCCAIN: One, I will take information from you and two, I will try to help\ntrack down that information for you.  I\'ll be back in contact with you.  And\nagain, please accept my sympathy for the loss of your mother and father.  I\npromise you I will learn and read the information you send me.\n\n2 Q) [College Student] What\'s your stance on TRIO funding -- it\'s support\nfor the upper-bound programs for college.\nMCCAIN: Yes.  I strongly support it.\n\nMCCAIN: Thanks members of Divided We Fail.\n\n3 Q) [Divided We Fail member] Health care is a major issue for every\nAmerican -- especially here in rural Appalachia.  Also the issue of\nfinancial security for all of us in our older years -- but young people\ntoo.  I like your bipartisan approach to things.  Can you talk about that?\nMCCAIN: Americans are sick and tired of being sick and tired of the partisan\npolitics in Washington.  The approval rating of Congress is now in the\nsingle digits -- 9%.  The last time Social Security was on the brink of\ndisaster, what happened?  There was a liberal Democrat, Tip O\'Neil and\nRonald Reagan sat down at a table together and worked it out.  And the fixed\nSocial Security for awhile.  And that\'s what Americans want to happen.  I\nwill sit down with Harry Reid or Nancy Pelosi.  It\'s time to put\npartisanship behind and get things done.  We will sit down together and fix\nthat system.  I have a history of reaching across the aisle.\n\nMCCAIN: One other organization here I\'d like to highlight -- ONE.\n\n4 Q) [ONE volunteer] Thank you Mr. McCain and your wife Cindy.  We have\n60,000 members in OH dedicated to the issue of global poverty.  You played a\nhuge role in helping us pass legislation.  You spoke about malaria - what\nwill you do to make eradicating malaria a priority as president?\nMCCAIN: I\'d like to commend this administration for their work to eliminate\nAIDS in Africa.  I would obviously support organizations like yours and\nothers.  Also, clean water -- that\'s important.  I believe when the\neconomy\'s of these nations are better, they will be able to solve their\nproblems better.  I commend ONE.\n\n5 Q) Divorce rates are high and marriage rates are low.  How can we fix our\neconomy if we can\'t even fix our families?\nMCCAIN: I think that families are the foundation and strength of our\nnation.  The two-parent family organization, statistics show are better.\nThe president did a good job with his faith-based program.  But I also think\nwe need to protect the rights of the born and the unborn.  It\'s one of the\nbig differences between me and my opponent. Obama voted against a\npartial-birth abortion ban.  Every life is precious and there\'s a family in\nAmerica for every child.  If we inspire Americans to serve a cause greater\nthan their self-interest, I think its obvious that families and America is\nstrengthened because of it.  I do think all the time how we can strengthen\nour values and nation -- but I\'ll think more about it now because or your\nquestion.\n\n6 Q) We hear that you\'re not the third-term of Bush.  I know you\'re not.\nWhen are you going to say, read my lips I am not the third term of Bush?\nMCCAIN: I\'ve agreed and disagreed with the president.  I respect him.  But I\nbelieve we need change.  We have to stop the out of control spending --\npork-barrel spending.  It\'s your money, not our money.  I will veto all\nthose bills and make famous those sponsoring them.\nWhen this war was conducted and we succeeding initially, I went over there\nand said things aren\'t working.  We need a new strategy.  And that wasn\'t\npopular.  And I said, I\'d much rather lose a political campaign than a war.\n[standing ovation]  We\'ve got a strategy that is working, a great general\nand the best men and women fighting.  If we set a date of withdrawal, we\ncould erase all of our success.  We should realize the benefits of winning.\nOur troops should come home, but with victory and honor, not in defeat.\nSenator Obama has said now after 900 days he is going to Iraq.  I\'m glad\nhe\'s finally going and finally sitting down with the commander.  I offered\nto go with him.  We do not want a situation where we have to send our\nsoldiers back again because we haven\'t seen this through.\n\n7 Q) I never knew a farmer to ask for a handout.  Why don\'t we take the\nrestrictions off the farmers and not pay them subsidies not to grow?\nMCCAIN: I\'m with you.  Congress just passed a bill with tons of money for\nasparagus subsidies and ethanol subsidies.  I voted against that, Obama\nvoted for it.  It\'s hard to vote against something called the Farm Bill\nbecause we all love farmers.  But as president, I would veto that bill.\nWe need to repeal the death tax.  Farmers should be able to hand down their\nfarms.\n\n8 Q) How can we speed up the process to get relief from gas prices?\nMCCAIN: We need to lift the ban on offshore drilling.  Can we get it\nimmediately?  No.  Some say it could take 5-10 years, but imagine if we had\nstarted it 5-10 years ago.  Clean coal we need to do.  And nuclear power,\nthe French are doing it and it\'s working for them.  We should not be sending\n700 billion dollars a year overseas and sometimes to terrorist\norganizations.  This is a national security issue.\n\n9 Q) [hospice founder] DHL is closing that airpark -- we\'re losing 80,000\njobs.  [crying] Will you investigate this?  Will you come to Wilmington and\naccept our petition with 10,000 signatures?\nMCCAIN: This is a terrible blow. I believe it was 8,600 jobs.  If there are\nanti-trust issues associated with this, I will have that investigated\nfully.  We have to offer people the opportunity of job training programs\nI gotta look you in the eye and give you some straight talk -- I don\'t know\nif I can stop this, in fact it\'s unlikely.  But we have to give people\nanother opportunity and give them programs to retrain for other jobs.  We\nneed to retrain the workers that need it and deserve it.  My heart goes out\nto you.\n\n10 Q ) What is your feeling about No Child Left Behind?\nMCCAIN: Cindy was in special education -- that honest line of work before I\ntook her out.  Thank you for being a teacher.  I think that NCLB needs to be\nfixed.  However, I think it was the right beginning.  I think we need to be\nable to test and measure performance across the board.  I think we need to\nhave goals and measure that.  But we also need to fund the things that\naren\'t being funding -- like special education.  I\'m for choice and\ncompetition.  We had the money to send our children to private school.  I\nwant every American to have a choice.  Charter schools are good.\nCompetition is good.\n\n11 Q) Proud to be a navy guy like you.  Do you agree with the timetable it\ntakes for a veteran to get his benefits?\nMCCAIN: Clarify please.\nQUESTIONER: Details injuries from Iraq.  As of today, I get medically\ndisqualified for jobs now and I am only 40% qualified to get my benefits.\nMCCAIN: Walter-Reid situation -- we passed legislation after that to fix the\nproblems there.  I believe it\'s going to take awhile to implement those\nchanges.  And we should be taking care of our soldiers for the sacrifices\nthat they\'ve made for us.\n\n12 Q) You are trying to inspire college students, young people.  I come from\na small school where the College Republican\'s have shrunk because they are\nnot happy with the direction of the party.  How can you address the concerns\nof the people of my age?\nMCCAIN: A lot of Republicans are upset because of the out of control\nspending.  The first thing I need to do is go to the venues where the young\npeople are.  And then, use as effectively as possible -- we have a lot of\nwork to do -- use the internet effectively because that is where young\npeople are communicating.  There\'s nothing that convinces young people like\nother young people.  I understand the challenge we face.  And this election\nabout your generation -- and I believe I have the inspiration that young\npeople are looking for.\n\n13 Q) Thank you Senator for the opportunity.  PENAC - wrote a document.  Can\nyou tell us about your role in the organization related to PENAC and is this\n... [9-11 conspiracy question] ...?\nMCCAIN: Lieberman and I sponsored legislation to make a commission to assist\nwith the 9-11 aftermath.  I am proud of what the 9-11 commission did.  I\nwill stand by their recommendations and conclusions and I am proud to have\nbeen one of those who established the 9-11 commission.\n\n14 Q) I\'m a school bus driver.  I paid into a pension plan.  My husband\nworked and paid into Social Security.  He\'s passed and now I can\'t afford to\nretire, because I\'m not going to get social security.  Do you think that\'s\nfair?\nMCCAIN: No you should not have to be penalized because of the death of your\nhusband.  Please accept my sympathy for your husband\'s passing.\n\n15 Q) Can we take Ahmadejinad seriously? Would you consider a 16 year old\nrunning mate?\nMCCAIN: If he is as attractive and articulate as you, then yes.  I worry\nthat the president of Iran\'s comments are not just crazy talk.  We all know\nthey just tested a missile.  I worry when any leader says they want to wipe\nIsrael off the map.  They are sending into Iraq the most explosive devices\nto kill our young men and women.  We should enact sanctions against the\nIranians.  If there\'s an outbreak of conflict, I worry that Americans will\nbe drawn into it.  I\'m all for diplomacy.  I\'m not going to sit down with\nthe head of Iran until he adheres to certain conditions.  If anyone is\nconcerned that we don\'t have communications with Iran -- that is not a\nproblem.  We have an ambassador that speaks to them.\n\n*Conclusion*\nOhio is a battleground state.  I gotta be hear a lot -- I need your help and\nsupport.  We need to drive around this state and stop in every town.  You\ncan help me in that.  I will never let you down.  And I will always, always\nput you first.\n\n\n-- \nCammie L.
