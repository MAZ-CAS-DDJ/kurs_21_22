Sean has always put our family first.\n \nI couldn\'t ask for a better partner to raise our three children, even if Sean\'s not as great a dancer as he thinks he is and mocks me for using the word "discotheque." [note: please ask Randy which spelling he prefers]\n \nOn this Father\'s Day, the kids and I wanted to do something special for him, so we put together a card. It would mean so much to Sean if you signed it, too!\n \nClick here to sign our Father\'s Day card for Sean!\n\nhttp://action.seanmaloney.com/page/s/happy-fathers-day\n \nSean feels so fortunate to get to do what he does for you and the people of New York. There\'s nothing he\'d rather do, and that\'s how I know it would mean the world to him if you took a moment to sign his card.\n \nThanks so much!\n \nRandy\n\n\n\nContribute -- https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spm_fathersday?refcode=20140615\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.\nTo unsubscribe from the Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress email list, please click here: http://action.seanmaloney.com/page/unsubscribe/?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\n\n\nPAID FOR BY SEAN PATRICK MALONEY FOR CONGRESS\n\n\n'
