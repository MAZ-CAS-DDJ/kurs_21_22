And as we have been for years, ProgressNow Colorado\nwill be on the ground from the opening gavel to the last vote.\n\xa0\nJoin us as we fight for our shared values in the Colorado legislature:\nclick here to make a donation to ProgressNow Colorado.\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=jh4iUtiQYvJNqOCpYPYKmA..\n\n\xa0\nHere is just a sampling of the legislation ProgressNow Colorado will\nbe working on in 2011:\n\xa0\nBudget Priorities: Colorado is just beginning to recover from the\nworst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Although the\neconomic situation is slowly getting better, we must work harder than\never to protect critical functions of state government such as health\ncare for Colorado's working families, transportation infrastructure,\nand education--both K-12 and higher education are threatened with huge\nbudget cuts this year. We must find a way to preserve resources for\nthese core priorities, and begin looking at a comprehensive solution\nto our state's chronic budget shortfalls.\n\xa0\nHealth care: Colorado is required to pass legislation this year\nsetting up health purchasing exchanges as mandated by federal health\ncare reform. This legislation will determine what health care in\nColorado will look like in the future, and make or break access to\nhealth care for hundreds of thousands of Coloradans. Several bills are\nexpected to be introduced, and passing the right plan is vital to our\nstate's future.\n\xa0\nCivil unions: Historic gains are being made around the nation to give\nequal protection before the law to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and\ntransgendered citizens. In Colorado, some conservatives have joined\nwith advocates for the LGBT community to push for civil unions for\nLGBT couples in committed relationships. A civil unions bill will be\nintroduced again in Colorado this year, and actually stands a better\nchance of passage than it has in recent memory.\n\xa0\nPayday lending: After last year's historic reform of the predatory\npayday lending industry, brought about in part by the hard work of\nthousands of ProgressNow Colorado members, lobbyists for the industry\nare working to introduce legislation that would undo these reforms and\nagain expose Colorado's most economically vulnerable residents to 500%\ninterest rates. The fact is, payday lending reform has already put $50\nmillion back in the pockets of Colorado families! It took years of\ndevoted organizing to regulate this industry against an army of\nwell-paid lobbyists and their allies on the right, and we will not let\nthis victory be undermined after the fact.\n\nThese are just a few of the literally hundreds of bills that will be\nintroduced in the Colorado General Assembly starting tomorrow. As with\nevery year, there are bills that would advance progress and others\nthat would roll back progress, and in many cases the news media will\nnever even mention them.\n\xa0\nThat's why ProgressNow Colorado is here. Since 2003, our job has been\nto empower Colorado progressives to take action before the\nlegislature, and to give a voice for real solutions to the challenges\nour community faces. You'll hear about the legislation that matters\nthis year before the press gets to it. You'll have opportunities to\njoin thousands of fellow Coloradans fighting for progressive\nsolutions--making phone calls, writing letters, and joining us at\nevents. Working together, we will protect the things that make\nColorado great, and stop the right wing from carrying out their\nbackward agenda.\n\xa0\nIt all starts now. Get started with your donation to ProgressNow\nColorado, and then watch your email box: we'll be in touch soon with\nthe next steps.\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=gVUf5CPA-39WP4_aBwMAhA..\n\n\xa0\nSincerely,\n\xa0\nAlan Franklin\nProgressNow Colorado\n\nPS.
