I wanted to get your advice on a couple of fronts and talk to you about WJC ideas re marriage/doma.  I had a great meeting with Chelsea yesterday too.\n\nLet me know how best to coordinate.\n\nThanks,\nChad\n\n\n\nChad Griffin\nPresident | Human Rights Campaign\nP: 202-216-1556 | F: 202-293-0633\nchg@hrc.org<mailto:chg@hrc.org> | www.hrc.org<http://www.hrc.org/>\n"
