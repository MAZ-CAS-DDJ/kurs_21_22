By cutting crucial programs like the Perkins Loan, Senator Alexander and his Republican colleagues are striving to create a permanent underclass.\xc2\xa0 No U.S. politician should support policies designed to hurt hard-working Americans and prevent them from realizing their hopes for a better future.\xc2\xa0 Apparently, Senator Alexander is comfortable with Americans perpetually toiling in low wage jobs after being denied access to colleges and universities due to their skyrocketing costs and the predatory nature of private student loan lenders.\n\nThat is why we have rolled out a new video which calls upon our fellow citizens to stand up and let their voices be heard. American students are drowning in student debt and Congressional Republicans will stop at nothing to cut every last lifeline they have.\xc2\xa0\n\nWATCH AND SHARE OUR LATEST VIDEO HERE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuIQVFoF83Y\n\nAlso, please take a minute to call Senator Lamar's office at 202-224-4944 and let him know we are watching and won't stand idly by while he crusades against low income students.\n\nThank you for the continued support,\n\nErik Altieri\nDirector of Communications\nAgenda Project Action Fund\n\n\nPS: We rely on donations from supporters like yourself to keep our rapid response machine operating.
