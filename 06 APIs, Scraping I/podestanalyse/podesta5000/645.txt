john.podesta@gmail.comb'HRC met with the United Farm Workers (UFW) and earned their endorsement by\nthe end of the meeting. Julie captured this unexpected moment on video--it\nwas special! We\'ll be working with UFW to discuss the roll out plan.\nThey\'ve asked their members to hold the news.\n\n   - She reiterated her commitment to fight for CIR with a pathway to\n   citizenship; protect and implement DACA and DAPA; and explore other ways to\n   protect undocumented people via executive action ("create new categories").\n   - She stated support for UFW\'s legislative proposal to expand overtime\n   pay for farm workers in CA, so overtime is av. after 40 hours/week or 8\n   hours/day.\n   - She was asked to help in the dispute between the UFW and CA-based\n   Gerawan Farming. She said she\'s do everything possible. After the meeting,\n   she had a private conversation with Arturo and expressed caution b/c of\n   campaign.\n   - She was asked about healthcare for the undocumented community. Stated\n   her support for all undocumented people to be able to buy in the exchange,\n   but acknowledged that most people don\'t have the resources to afford it.\n   She also said she would work to make the exchanges available to all,\n   including subsidies, but immediately linked it to CIR. Also wants to work\n   with states like CA and the UFW to explore other ways to provide HC\n   - Re Central American kids, she said government funded legal counsel for\n   UCs and working with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to take down drug\n   cartels and build the region.\n   - She was asked if she would appoint Obama to the SCOTUS. She said he\n   would be a very good candidate, but she wouldn\'t have that power...and he\n   probably wants a normal life. It was a fun exchange bet. her and the farm\n   workers.\n\n\nOn Sun, Feb 21, 2016 at 7:08 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Just met with the farm workers for an hour here in Palo Alto.
