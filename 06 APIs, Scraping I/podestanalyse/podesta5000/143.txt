Their political front group says the latest attacks are an \xe2\x80\x9cunprecedented effort.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact, the ads specifically urge viewers to vote against Ted. It\xe2\x80\x99s the FIRST time the Kochs have ever attacked a Senate candidate this directly.\n\nWith the future of Ohio -- and the country -- at stake, we must respond to these unprecedented attacks before the big mid-month fundraising deadline. \n\n432 donations needed for Ted: Chip in immediately to help us fight back against the Kochs\xe2\x80\x99 dark money.\n\nsecure.actblue.com/contribute/page/nov15?amount=25\n\nThanks,\n\nJustin \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.
