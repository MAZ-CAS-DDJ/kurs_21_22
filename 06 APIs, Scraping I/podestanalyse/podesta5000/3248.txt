Wade\xc2\xa0that recognized the right of American women to make their own healthcare decisions. Yet, because of the extreme views held by Tea Party Republicans women across the country are constantly in danger of losing this right.\n\nAlready, this year Tea Party Republicans in Congress have voted to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act and stop funding for Planned Parenthood.\xc2\xa0\n\nWill you chip in $5, $10, or $20 to my campaign right now so I can continue to fight for women\xe2\x80\x99s health and stop the war on women?\n\nWe need to work together to improve the health of our nation, not continue to play politics with women\xe2\x80\x99s health. Millions of people benefit from the services provided by Planned Parenthood \xe2\x80\x93 including a variety of cancer screenings for both women and men, HIV testing, and general health care services.\n\nAs a Maryland State delegate, I've fought to improve the healthcare of all Marylanders. As your representative in Congress, I will continue to fight to strengthen healthcare for women and challenge those who would weaken it.\n\nI have always stood up for Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s women. With your help, I will take this fight to the floor of the House too.\n\nPlease Contribute today.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseline\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nForward to a Friend: https://act.myngp.com/el/2677017938688542720/-1494363176607610880\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n|    Paid for by Joseline Pe\xc3\xb1a-Melnyk for Congress    |\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nJoseline Pe\xc3\xb1a-Melnyk for Congress\nP.O.
