john.podesta@gmail.comb'1. Foreign funding in earlier story\n2. Violations of tax laws\n\nRipe for hearings and an investigation. During the course of such an\ninvestigation I would suspect that donors might become disclosed.\n\n\n\n*The Washington Post*\n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/05/AR2010100501790.html\n\n*Campaign watchdogs accuse top conservative group of violating tax laws*\n\nDan Eggen\n\nOctober 5, 2010\n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/05/AR2010100501790.html\n\nTwo campaign-finance watchdogs asked the Internal Revenue Service on Tuesday\nto investigate Crossroads GPS, the big-spending conservative group supported\nby Republican guru Karl Rove, for allegedly violating U.S. tax laws limiting\nthe political activities of nonprofit groups.\n\nIn a complaint filed with the IRS, Democracy 21 and the Campaign Legal\nCenter say the group - an arm of the American Crossroads political committee\n- is using its nonprofit status to shield the identities of its wealthy\ndonors.\n\nThe complaint says "the group was organized to participate and intervene in\nthe 2010 congressional races while providing donors to the organization with\na safe haven for hiding their role."\n\nJonathan Collegio, spokesman for American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS,\nsaid the GPS group "carefully follows all laws" governing nonprofit\norganizations.\n\n"This is a baseless complaint, filed by a partisan group that files baseless\ncomplaints for its living," Collegio said.\n\nThe dispute signals an early volley in the looming legal battle over\nelection and campaign-finance rules for 2012, even as independent interest\ngroups set new records for spending on the November midterms. Critics say a\nshifting legal landscape has made it even more attractive for politically\nminded interest groups to cloak their spending in the shelter of nonprofit\norganizations.\n\nThe allegations also underscore the increasing pressure on the IRS to broker\nsuch disputes amid gridlock at the Federal Election Commission, which has\nseen its powers eroded by the courts and is hobbled by partisan differences.\nA labor coalition filed a separate IRS complaint last month alleging tax\nviolations by the nonprofit Chamber of Commerce.\n\n"We\'re living in a new world now, and the IRS can\'t just stand on the\nsidelines anymore," said Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21, who co-wrote the\nIRS complaint with Campaign Legal Center executive director J. Gerald\nHebert. "You have groups basically using their nonprofit status to keep\ntheir donors secret."\n\nThe IRS, which in general does not publicly discuss such complaints, had no\nimmediate comment on the letter.\n\nCrossroads GPS - short for Grassroots Policy Strategies - is organized as a\nnonprofit "social welfare" organization under section 501(c)(4) of the\nfederal tax code, which effectively means the group can raise and spend as\nmuch as it wants with minimal public disclosure.\n\nBut U.S. tax laws also say the primary purpose of such nonprofit groups\ncannot be political, including the "participation or intervention in\npolitical campaigns."\n\nHebert and Wertheimer argue that Crossroads GPS has made a mockery of that\nrequirement, bragging about its plans to target Democrats and extolling the\nvirtues of anonymity to donors.\n\nCollegio accused Wertheimer and other campaign-finance activists of looking\nthe other way when liberal groups, including nonprofits, spend big on\nelections.\n\n"Liberal groups spent more than $400 million in undisclosed campaign money\nin 2008 alone, with nary a peep from liberal lobbyist Fred Wertheimer or any\nof his groups," Collegio said.\n\nFEC records show the two Crossroads groups together have spent nearly $10\nmillion so far in support of Republican candidates, part of a stated goal of\nmore than $50 million by the midterm elections. The groups reported raising\na total of $32 million as of late last month. The money was about evenly\ndivided between the two.\n\nUnlike Crossroads GPS, American Crossroads is organized as a so-called\n"super PAC," which can raise and spend as much as it wants on direct\nadvocacy but must reveal donors. Records show that a handful of billionaires\nand their companies have contributed nearly all of American Crossroads\'\nmoney, including Texas oilman Trevor Reese-Jones, B. Public Storage founder\nWayne Hughes, and longtime Republican fundraiser Carl Lindner of American\nFinancial Group.\n\nA $400,000 contribution from the latter company would not have been possible\nbefore this year\'s landmark Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v.\nFederal Election Commission, which found that corporations can spend as much\nas they want for or against political candidates.\n\nThat decision and others have helped unleash a frenzy of spending by groups\noutside the party system this year, most of it by donors who do not have to\nbe publicly identified.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
