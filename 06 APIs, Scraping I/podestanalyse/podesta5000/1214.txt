Lawyers have become soft targets for insider scoops on mergers, patents, and other deals. At the same time, law firms are also attractive targets-if known to have a large corporate client base, drawing the attention of attackers. While the corporate clients may have sophisticated computer security defenses, their law firm\'s defenses are probably weaker. And once inside a law firm\'s defenses, the intruder likely has access to all of the firm\'s client information.\n\nThe ABA Cybersecurity Handbook, editied by industry experts, provides practical cyber threat information, guidance, and strategies to lawyers and law firms of all sizes. The guide considers the interrelationship between lawyer and client, establishing what legal responsibilities and professional obligations are owed to the client in the event of a cyber attack. The book provides strategies to help law firms defend against the cyber threat, but also offers information on how to best to respond if breached. \n\nhttps://apps.americanbar.org/abastore/index.cfm?fm=Product.AddToCart&pid=3550023&sc_cid=3550023-15P&sc_channel=email&sc_rec=\n\n\nThis message was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu. \nYour e-mail address will only be used within the ABA.
