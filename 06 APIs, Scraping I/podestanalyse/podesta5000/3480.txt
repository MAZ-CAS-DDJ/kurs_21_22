We also have been way out there on the\nright to organize and collective bargaining.  Thought you might make an\nexception to your dispepsia this year for our c4 work on McCain's policy\nagenda. That is important and going well. See today's story in the Wash Post\non McCain's trip to Kentucky, for example.  Whatever you can do, I would\nappreciate.\n\n\nOn 4/22/08, JStocks@nea.org <JStocks@nea.org> wrote:\n>\n> I am still working on this internally.
