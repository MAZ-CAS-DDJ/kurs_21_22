You can bet that Cheri will be one of their top targets. Last year, the Republicans and their shady outside groups spent over $4 million trying to win this seat. Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS group alone spent $1.3 million against her.\n\nThe only chance we've got to against all these negative attacks is to fight back, early and often. Will you chip in $10 or whatever you can before our big April fundraising deadline?\n\nDonate $10 or whatever you can right now to help Cheri fight back against Karl Rove the Koch brothers >>\nhttp://action.cheribustos.com/apr27-1\n\nCheri is dedicated to working for the people of Illinois, but she needs your help to keep doing that.\n\nIf Republicans are going to try and bring her down with misleading ads and attacks, we can't sit idly by. We have to stand up for Cheri.\n\nI hope we can count on you. Please chip in what you can before the deadline:\n\nhttp://action.cheribustos.com/apr27-1\n\nThank you for all of your support,\n\nLindsay\n\nLindsay Molnar\nFinance Director\nCheri Bustos for Congress\n\n\n\n\nThis message was emailed to: john.podesta@gmail.com\n\nTo unsubscribe from this email list, please paste this URL into your browser: \nhttp://action.cheribustos.com/unsubscribe\n\nPaid for by the Friends of Cheri Bustos\n\n"
