It is, as you know, just\nabout the most important work on the planet now.   I am even more happy\nknowing how talented the transition team itself is!\n\nYou asked me to send you some good recommendations.  Here are three:\n\n1.  For the National Security Council---expert on bioterrorism.   Dr.\nTara O\'Toole.  Dr. O\'Toole is CEO and Director of the Center for\nBiosecurity at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC),served\nas Assistant Secretary of Energy for Environment, Safety and Health in\nthe Clinton Administration. In this position she developed the first\nstrategic management and safety plan for dealing with the highly\nenriched uranium, plutonium, spent fuel, and radioactive waste left in\nplace when nuclear weapons production ceased in the early 1990s. She ran\nthe multi-agency, multimillion dollar task force that oversaw the\ngovernment\'s investigations into human radiation experiments conducted\nduring the Cold War, and led the US delegation to Russia to establish\nthe U.S./Russia cooperative effort to study radiation exposure and\nenvironmental hazards of the Russian nuclear weapons complex.  Tara is\none of the top talents on the committee which I chair, established by\nHSPD 21, the National Biosurveillance Advisory Subcommittee.  Tara is\nwell known to everyone in the field but in addition to her academic\nchops, brings a passion and practical knowledge impossible to beat.\n\n2.  To run DARPA---which among other things gave rise to the Internet,\nTCP/IP and so many other innovations.  Vint Cerf, known affectionately\nas the "Father of the Internet" winner of all sorts of awards, former\nSVP of MCI and now VP and Chief Evangelist for Google.  I was pleasantly\nsurprised from a recent conversation to know that he would be interested\nin going back into government into the same agency he worked for when\nthe Internet was born.  Vint knows everyone and every major advance in\ntech.  I do not know how good a manager he is, but I do know that his\nname is gold, his understanding unequaled, and his values solid.\n\n3.  At a lower level, and with the realization that I am no longer an\nobjective observer:  for a position in the the White House, Office of\nCommunications, my son Joseph Brilliant.  Joe was the youngest ever\nIntern in the Clinton White House (under Tom Kalil, Laura Tyson),\nBerkeley communications major, worked at Ogilvy and Deutsch in\nadvertising and most recently worked with Al Gore\'s CurrentTV.  Joe\nhelped build the online social networking part of Current.com, worked as\nan Obama volunteer in New Mexico, and wants to put his social networking\nskills to service in the communications office keeping Obama youthful\nsupporters engaged, informed, energized, and involved in building a new\nparticipatory administration.  Al Gore has told us he would give him a\nvery high recommendation.  So would I!\n\nHope everything else is going very well indeed.  Much love to Maria.\n\nLarry\n\n'
