Shell announced $6.9 billion in profits. BP earned over $5 billion during the first three months of the year.\n\nMeanwhile Americans across the country are struggling with near-record prices at the pump.\n\nAnd do you know the worst part? While the Big Oil companies rake in obscene profits, they\'re also getting billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded subsidies.\n\nTell Congress: It\'s time to end Big Oil handouts.

Let me repeat that. Since 2001, the world\'s biggest oil companies have made over\n$900 billion in profits.\n\nAt the same time, these oil companies benefit from more than $4 billion in special tax breaks every year. Why are we subsidizing one of the most profitable industries? Why does ExxonMobil get a tax break while we get stuck paying higher gas prices?\n\nTell Congress: It\'s time to end Big Oil handouts.

And amidst reports of tens of billions in oil industry profits and rising gas prices, House Speaker John Boehner is refusing to hold another vote on ending oil subsidies.\n\nBut momentum is building for action. Senate Majority Leader Reid has said that the Senate may soon vote on legislation that would strip the biggest oil companies of the government handouts they enjoy.\n\nTell Congress: It\'s time to end Big Oil handouts.
