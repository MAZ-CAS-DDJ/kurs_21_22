As you may know, for several years I have served as the University\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX Coordinator in addition to my other duties. I am pleased that Georgetown is now among a select group of universities to have a full-time dedicated Title IX Coordinator.\r\n\r\nAs the Title IX Coordinator, Laura will coordinate and implement the University\xe2\x80\x99s Title IX compliance efforts and strengthen a culture that supports a safe and respectful learning, working and living environment. This includes monitoring and enforcing the University\xe2\x80\x99s sexual misconduct policy, coordinating the prompt, effective, equitable investigation and timely resolution of complaints of sexual misconduct and leading the University\xe2\x80\x99s education, training, prevention and outreach efforts related to Title IX and sexual misconduct. Laura\xe2\x80\x99s appointment as Title IX Coordinator represents a significant development as we enhance the University\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to foster a safe and nondiscriminatory climate for all members of our community.\r\n\r\nLaura brings substantive experience to this significant role having served at the Georgetown University Law Center as the Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Liaison in Health Education Services. In that capacity, Laura provided confidential advice and options for survivors of sexual assault and relationship violence, assisted students in navigating campus disciplinary and/or criminal processes, and provided educational workshops and training to raise awareness for staff, faculty and students on sexual misconduct and sexual assault.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that position, Laura served at our Law Center as Director of the Office of Disability Services where she managed a heavy caseload of law students seeking educational and other accommodations. She provided crisis support for mental and physical health emergencies and helped students navigate career resources and mentor opportunities. Laura also worked as the Learning Disability Coordinator at the Catholic University of America. Laura is an alumna of Villanova University where she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree and Masters of Science in Counseling and Human Relations.\r\n\r\nPlease join me in welcoming Laura to this new role. I look forward to introducing Laura to many of you personally as we prepare to launch our first campus Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey tomorrow.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nRosemary Kilkenny, Vice President\r\nInstitutional Diversity & Equity\r\n[http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/open/log/24461478/NzE1OTM1MTE1MzUS1/0/NzIxNTE1MTExS0/1/0]\r\n\r\n'
