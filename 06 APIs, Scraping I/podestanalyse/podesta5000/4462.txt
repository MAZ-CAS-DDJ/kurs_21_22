john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi John,\n\nI just learned from Renee Stone (another reference) that Dan is concerned about my management ability.\n\n In case he asks you about it, in addition to speaking about how I led and managed the team at CAP, here is some info on what I\'m currently doing. It is non-traditional management, but it is really complex. \n\nI manage a $350M budget, directly supervise 5, de-facto supervise at least another 7, and coordinate with about 80 others just in this agency and the responsibility for delivering on the President\'s global climate change initiative is on me.  And it is the nature of a "Coordinator" role that my job is structured this way-it\'s not because I can\'t directly manage a team of 90, it\'s just not how the Agency is organized or how the position was designed. \n\nThanks so much,\nKit\n\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Apr 26, 2015, at 12:51 AM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com> wrote:\n> \n> Of course.
