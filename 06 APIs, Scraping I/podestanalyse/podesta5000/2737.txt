She is speaking around the country about the \'dog whistle\' discrimination that she faced during her campaign. She is extremely persuasive, while having a positive message and likable delivery style.\n>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>> She said she is in the process of setting up a C3 and C4 to organize around the effort to elect more women to office. While I think this is a great thing to do, Andrea Dew Steele commented after Davis left that it would be great if Wendy used her message and persuasive lecture to get out on the campaign trail for Hillary. Clearly, Davis has the bandwidth for a full-time job. So I thought this was something that might be useful for you to know.\n>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>> Eleni\n>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>> Ambassador Eleni Kounalakis\n>>>>>>> 2500 Steiner Street, Ninth Floor\n>>>>>>> San Francisco, CA 94115\n>>>>>>> KounalakisET@gmail.com\n>>>>>>> \n>>>>>>> Sent from my iPad\n'
