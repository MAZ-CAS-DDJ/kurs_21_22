I could\r\ndo something Wednesday afternoon, early Thursday afternoon and then I head\r\nout West for a week of vacation and a week of fundraising. If this week\r\ndoesn't work for you, we can get together when I'm back or arrange\r\nsomething with Jake Sullivan and Maya Harris. Let me know if any of that\r\nworks.\r\nJohn\r\n\r\n"
