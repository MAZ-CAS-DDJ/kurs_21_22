He thinks it is 90-95 percent that the TPA bill will drop Tuesday.\n>>>> \n>>>> I have been thinking about a version of the Podesta approach.  \n>>>> \n>>>> What if she said something along the lines of the following?\n>>>> \n>>>> Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m focused on the final deal, and whether it will measure up.  If it does, I\xe2\x80\x99ll support it.  If it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, I won\xe2\x80\x99t. \n>>>> \n>>>> TPA is about Senate procedure \xe2\x80\x93 and in any event it\xe2\x80\x99s just a draft proposal making its way through a Senate committee.  I want to focus on the substance:  will TPP be a good deal, or not?  We haven't seen the details so we can't answer that question yet.   \n>>>> \n>>>> Let me say this about TPA.  I believe that President Obama should have the negotiating authority to conclude a transpacific agreement that works for the American middle class and advances American leadership.  But I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we should give an open-ended fast track to the next president.  I hope I\xe2\x80\x99m the next president, and I think I should have to justify fast track to the new Congress.  And if a Republican is the next president, I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give fast track to them now \xe2\x80\x93 heck, that's why I voted against fast track for President Bush.\n>>>> \n>>>> These are all procedural issues.  The key for me is whether the final deal passes two tests:  pass two tests: First, does it raise wages and create more good jobs at home than it displaces? And second, does it also strengthen our national security?  Let\xe2\x80\x99s wait and see that final deal.\n"
