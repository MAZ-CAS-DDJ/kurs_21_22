john.podesta@gmail.comb"John --\n\nIn 2012, after thirty-two years in Republican hands, Brad Schneider finally won Illinois's 10th district for Democrats. \n\nNow, Boehner's on a mission to get it back.\n\nOver the weekend, we learned Republicans will spend a stunning $1,850,000.00 to smear Brad's strong progressive record. It's a big number, and it doesn't even include GOP outside groups.\n\nIllinois is a proud Democratic state, and Brad Schneider's a proud Democrat. But today, Brad needs your help.\n\nWill you rush $5 or whatever you can to support Brad's campaign for the final sprint to Election Day?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/schneidersep2014?refcode=em_FR_2014.09.29_b2_js_all&amp;amount=25&amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=DC&amp;zip=20016&amp;phone=2162818851&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=&amp;recur_weekly=true\n\nBrad's opponents are hell-bent on putting this seat back in Republican hands. They want ex-Congressman Bob Dold to be their reliable yes-man.\n\nI'm fighting with Brad to make sure that doesn't happen. But I need you with me -- today.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/schneidersep2014?refcode=em_FR_2014.09.17_b1_js_all&amp;amount=25&amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=DC&amp;zip=20016&amp;phone=2162818851&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=&amp;recur_weekly=true\n\nPlease don't wait,\n\nJan\n\nRep.
