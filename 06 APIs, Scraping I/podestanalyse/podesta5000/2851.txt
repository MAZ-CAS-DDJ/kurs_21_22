john.podesta@gmail.comb'John - first week and a half in Delhi has been good, if not a bit crazed prepping for Sec State and POTUS visits.  Had good meetings this past weekend at Vibrant Gujarat with Secretary Kerry.  You have probably gotten a read out by now.  Let me know what we can do to help you.  My state email is vermarr@state.gov.  \nBest, \n\nRich \n\nSent from my iPhone'
