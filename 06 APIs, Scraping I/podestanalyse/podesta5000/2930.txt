Says she is giving the best opening for attacking Obama. A.B.\nStoddard says HRC tried in her speech to sound like she was appealing to\nthe Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders supporters by talking about the\nDodd-Frank law and increasing profit sharing. Says she\xe2\x80\x99s not going as far\nas the progressive wing wants because she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to tilt too far\nbefore the general election.
