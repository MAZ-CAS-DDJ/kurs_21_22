And at the center of it is a\nlongtime aide to Hillary Clinton who has no particular background in\neconomics.\n\n\n\nJake Sullivan, a 38-year-old who rose to prominence in Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s State\nDepartment, now has the challenge of distilling advice from across the\nDemocratic Party. The resulting plan will be the foundation of a Monday\npolicy speech in which Mrs. Clinton intends to lay out her vision.\n\n\n\nHis challenge is evident in how the campaign has been buffeted by a\nsurprising challenge from the left in the form of independent Sen. Bernie\nSanders of Vermont. Part of the party\xe2\x80\x99s base wants to hear about government\nsolutions for problems such as income inequality and wage stagnation, while\nits more centrist members emphasize prescriptions to stimulate economic\ngrowth.\n\n\n\nWhile the subject material is new for Mr. Sullivan, colleagues say the\nprocess is familiar from his four years at Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s side when she was\nsecretary of state. Those who know Mr. Sullivan, from both sides of the\naisle, commend his intelligence and his ability to pull ideas from across a\nwide universe while shaping a policy that suits his boss.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe uses his access with her to be an honest broker with no preconceived\nagenda other than ensuring she has the best set of policy options to choose\nfrom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gene Sperling, a longtime economic adviser to Bill and Hillary\nClinton who remains in her tight inner circle.\n\n\n\nMark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of\nDemocracies and a sharp critic of the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear talks\nwith Iran, in which Mr. Sullivan played a big role, commends him for\nreaching out to those who dislike the direction of the negotiations.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe engages with his critics, and that\xe2\x80\x99s rare,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Dubowitz, who\nadded the administration should have done more to set a tough tone at the\nstart of the talks, to allow for more concessions later.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton in 2012 sent Mr. Sullivan and another aide to Oman to meet\nsecretly with Iran officials to gauge whether they were serious about\npotential compromises with the West. He concluded they were, setting the\nstage for the current talks.\n\n\n\nOn the economy, Mrs. Clinton has met with scores of experts on big issues\nsuch as income inequality and discrete topics including why states should\npublicize licensing rules for cosmetologists.\n\n\n\nBut the core brain trust is smaller. Besides Mr. Sullivan, who declined to\ncomment through a campaign spokesman, prominent Clinton staffers include\nAnn O\xe2\x80\x99Leary, who is developing proposals on education, health care and\nfamily issues, and Gary Gensler, a former Wall Street regulator who is the\ncampaign\xe2\x80\x99s chief financial officer and who participates in economic-policy\ndiscussions as well. Maya Harris is charged with social policy such as\nimmigration.\n\n\n\nOutside the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s Brooklyn headquarters, two longtime Clinton aides\nare her most important economic advisers: Mr. Sperling and Neera Tanden,\npolicy chief of the 2008 presidential campaign who is now president of the\nliberal think tank Center for American Progress.\n\n\n\nJust a handful of other outsiders hold sway, according to people close to\nthe process, including David Kamin, an expert on the federal budget and tax\nlaw at New York University\xe2\x80\x99s law school; Alan Krueger, a Princeton\nUniversity economist who served as chairman of President Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\nCouncil of Economic Advisers; Jacob Hacker, an expert on the politics of\nhealth and social policy at Yale University; Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel\nPrize-winning economist at Columbia University; and Heather Boushey, chief\neconomist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think\ntank.\n\n\n\nMr. Sullivan, who also oversees foreign policy for the campaign, is hunting\nfor someone to later handle economic policy, a campaign official said.\n\n\n\nFew can match the level of trust he enjoys with the candidate. In her book\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Clinton called him \xe2\x80\x9cearnest and brilliant,\xe2\x80\x9d with\ncredentials including a Rhodes scholarship, Yale law degree and Supreme\nCourt clerkship. In 2008, he was a policy aide and ran debate preparation\nfor Mrs. Clinton. He joined the Obama campaign for the general election.\n\n\n\nMr. Sullivan had planned to return to his Minnesota home to practice law\nand prepare for a likely run for Congress, but he was persuaded to join\nMrs. Clinton at State, first as deputy chief of staff and then the\nyoungest-ever director of policy planning. If Mrs. Clinton is elected\npresident, Mr. Sullivan is seen as a potential national security adviser.\n\n\n\n*George W. Bush Hopes Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton \xe2\x80\x98Elevate the Discourse\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/07/10/republican-candidates-appeal-to-anti-abortion-groups/>\n// NYT // Amy Chozick \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nIn his appearance in Texas with Bill Clinton on Thursday, George W. Bush\ncalled for an elevated political discourse in the 2016 presidential\ncampaign, defended his difficult wartime decisions, and said he did not\nplan to campaign for his brother Jeb Bush.\n\n\n\nMr. Bush, speaking at an event with Mr. Clinton in Dallas, complained that\nthe Internet \xe2\x80\x9cis a brutal place these days for political figures\xe2\x80\x9d and said\nit made the campaign discourse particularly nasty. But he attributed that\nto surrogates and not to the candidates themselves.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know Jeb and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident Secretary Hillary will elevate the\ndiscourse,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bush said of his brother, a Republican, and Hillary Rodham\nClinton, a Democrat. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t attest to their surrogates. I can attest to\nthis surrogate: I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna be a surrogate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBefore announcing his presidential bid, Jeb Bush declared, \xe2\x80\x9cI love my\nfather and my brother, but I am my own man,\xe2\x80\x9d and much has been made about\nhow much (or how little) he would rely on his brother as a campaigner,\nparticularly given how George W. Bush is still very popular in pockets of\nthe Republican Party, but remains a divisive figure to others.\n\n\n\nThe two former presidents, speaking to graduates of a jointly sponsored\nscholarship program at George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s presidential library, were both\nasked about their decision-making process. Mr. Clinton talked about the\nimportance of postponing some critical decisions. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d say: \xe2\x80\x98Can I kill\nthem tomorrow? Because I can\xe2\x80\x99t bring them back to life tomorrow.\'\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWithout directly commenting on the war in Iraq, Mr. Bush said the turbulent\ncircumstances during his presidency (unlike the comparatively peaceful\nyears in Mr. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s two terms) \xe2\x80\x9cmade it really imperative that you\ndecide and decide decisively.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe said he \xe2\x80\x9chad to make decisions that protected the homeland \xe2\x80\x94 that was my\ngoal and some of the decisions I had to make needed to be made pretty\nquickly because the enemy, that sadly still exists, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really care\nwhether a president agonizes over a decision or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Clinton plans Tuesday meetings with all Hill Democrats\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/clinton-plans-tuesday-meetings-with-all-hill-democrats-119973.html?ml=tl_11>\n// Politico // Lauren French \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton will meet with the entire House Democratic caucus on\nTuesday.\n\n\n\nThe former secretary of state was slated to meet with minority lawmakers\nfrom the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the\nAsian Pacific caucus but added another stop at the party\xe2\x80\x99s weekly caucus\nmeeting to her Washington swing.\n\n\n\nDeveloping a strong relationship with House members will be key for\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign. Lawmakers have often felt ignored by the White House\nduring President Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s tenure and Clinton is already making an\neffort to help Democratic lawmakers feel like they have a stake in her\npresidential bid.\n\n\n\nShe is also slated to meet with Senate Democrats, many of whom she knows\nfrom her tenure as a senator from New York before her 2008 presidential bid\nagainst Obama.\n\nFormer Maryland Governor Martin O\'Malley tours a section of Baltimore on\nThursday, May 21, 2015. O\'Malley is considering a run for President of the\nUnited States.\n\n\n\nThe Capitol Hill meetings are the most direct engagement from the Clinton\ncampaign since she announced earlier this year. Her senior aides held a\nseries of meet and greets but Clinton has yet to engage with the entire\ncongressional Democratic caucus personally.\n\n\n\nThe meetings are being billed as policy discussions.\n\n\n\n*SOCIAL MEDIA*\n\n\n\n*Josh Kraushaar (7/10/15, 5:01 PM)*\n<https://twitter.com/HotlineJosh/status/619597216672575488>* \xe2\x80\x93 Rick Perry\nsuper PACs raise $16.8M.

McDonnell, writing in an 89-page opinion that the onetime\nRepublican rising star \xe2\x80\x98received a fair trial and was duly convicted by a\njury of his fellow Virginians.\'\xe2\x80\x9d Of most relevance and interest to other\npols, McDonnell\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys argued he had not performed any \xe2\x80\x9cofficial acts\xe2\x80\x9d\nin exchange for bribes. The court nixed that complaint:\n\n\n\nThe appeals court panel disagreed, asserting that the government had\n\xe2\x80\x9cexceeded its burden\xe2\x80\x9d of proof on the topic of official acts. The opinion\ncited three particular ways in which McDonnell tried to use his office to\nhelp Williams: trying to get researchers to study Williams\xe2\x80\x99s product,\nAnatabloc; trying to the state tobacco commission to fund studies of an\ningredient in his product; and trying to get Anatabloc included in the\nhealth insurance plan for state employees.\n\n\n\nSo a mere favor for a donor, even to move along the bureaucracy, can be an\nofficial act. In that case, Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s e-mails \xe2\x80\x94 both the destroyed\nones and the ones turned over \xe2\x80\x94 raise the question: Why is McDonnell going\nto jail and Clinton going on the presidential trail?\n\n\n\nOne answer is that with McDonnell, the prominence of a single donor and the\nproximity of communications to the minor official acts made the case easier\nto prove. Clinton benefits from taking so much money for so many over such\na long time. This, mind you, does not mean she did not do official acts for\ndonors or that there was an implicit back-scratching arrangement; it means\nonly that it is hard to prove. And second, Hillary Clinton is Hillary\nClinton. She can lie about a subpoena, destroy potentially incriminating\nevidence, violate the terms of her disclosure agreement and take money for\nher family\xe2\x80\x99s foundation from an \xe2\x80\x9cIranian businessman accused by the U.S.\ngovernment of violating sanctions\xe2\x80\x9d as well as woman-abusing Arab regimes\nand Donald Trump. Democrats yawn. The media cover it for a day or two and\nthen move on.\n\n\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting Hillary Clinton has committed a crime and should take\nthe cell next to McDonnell. For one thing, no one has bothered to\ninvestigate her as McDonnell was when gift revelations came to light.\n(Imagine if a Republican had been in the White House and no Justice\nDepartment investigation of McDonnell took place.) I am saying without\nknowing anything more that it is hard to argue based on what we have\nalready seen that Clinton meets the character test for the presidency. But\nthat is for the voters to decide.\n\n\n\nOther pols should be wary, however. They are far more likely to be held to\nthe McDonnell standard than the Clinton standard.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton probably can\xe2\x80\x99t get gun control passed. But she should talk\nabout it, anyway.\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/10/hillary-clinton-probably-cant-get-gun-control-passed-but-she-should-talk-about-it-anyway/>\n// WaPo // Paul Waldman \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton is talking about guns, and everyone seems surprised. After\nall, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t she know the issue is a sure loser for Democrats?\n\n\n\nThe truth is quite a bit more complicated than that \xe2\x80\x94 in fact, pushing for\nmeasures like expanded background checks is likely to help Clinton in the\n2016 election. But if she\xe2\x80\x99s going to promise to make headway on this issue,\nshe needs to offer some plausible account of how as president she could\nmake real progress where Barack Obama couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\n\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s address the matter of the gun issue\xe2\x80\x99s political potency first. As is\nthe case on so many issues, the Republican position is more popular when\nthe questions are vague, while the Democratic position is more popular when\nthe questions are specific. If you look at polling on guns, what you see is\nthat the country is split pretty evenly on the broad question of whether\ngun laws should be more strict or less strict. But particular measures to\nregulate guns get much more support, especially universal background\nchecks, which as many as nine out of ten Americans endorse.\n\n\n\nAt some point in this discussion, someone will always say: \xe2\x80\x9cBut what about\nthe NRA? They\xe2\x80\x99re so powerful!\xe2\x80\x9d The NRA\xe2\x80\x99s power is real in some ways and\nillusory in others, and it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand which is which. When\nit comes to lobbying, the NRA is indeed hugely powerful. It has the ability\nto stop any legislation on guns, often before it even gets written. But\nelections are an entirely different story. Almost all the congressional\ncandidates who win the NRA\xe2\x80\x99s supposedly coveted endorsement are Republican\nincumbents from conservative districts who win their elections by huge\nmargins. When Republicans have a good election, as they did in 2014 and\n2010, the NRA rushes to reporters to claim credit, saying the election\nproves that voters will punish any candidate who isn\xe2\x80\x99t pro-gun. But when\nDemocrats have a good election, as they did in 2012 and 2008, the NRA is\nstrangely silent.\n\n\n\nGun ownership has been steadily declining since the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s, and guns are\nmore concentrated among voters that Democrats already won\xe2\x80\x99t win and don\xe2\x80\x99t\nneed. For instance, according to the Pew Research Center, whites are twice\nas likely as Hispanics to own guns. If winning over Hispanic voters is the\nsine qua non of a Republican victory, advocacy for loosening gun laws isn\xe2\x80\x99t\nexactly going to be part of a winning formula for the GOP. The person most\nlikely to be a gun owner is a married white man from the South \xe2\x80\x94 in other\nwords, probably a Republican.\n\n\n\nWhen people argue that Hillary Clinton shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t touch the gun issue, watch\nout for comparisons to how Bill Clinton did in the Electoral College,\nbecause America\xe2\x80\x99s political geography is very different than it was two\ndecades ago. For instance, I guarantee you that Senator Joe Manchin will at\nsome point loudly advise that Clinton needs to tread carefully on guns if\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s to win his home state of West Virginia like her husband did twice.\nBut the truth is that Clinton is probably not going to win West Virginia no\nmatter what she does, and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to. Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s two\ncomfortable Electoral College victories were built on combining Democratic\nstrongholds in the Northeast and West with the more liberal states in the\nMidwest and the fast-changing Southwest, where Hispanic votes are key.\nClinton will almost certainly seek to assemble the same map \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s one\nwhere advocacy for the more popular gun restrictions will help her, not\nhurt her.\n\n\n\nStill: if Clinton says it\xe2\x80\x99s vital to enact universal background checks and\nother \xe2\x80\x9ccommon-sense\xe2\x80\x9d gun laws, she has to explain how she\xe2\x80\x99s going to do it.\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that in the wake of the horrific Newtown massacre, a\nbipartisan measure to expand background checks failed to overcome a\nRepublican filibuster in the Senate, falling six votes short of the 60 it\nneeded. If a bill that had the support of 90 percent of the public couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nmake it past congressional Republicans just after 20 elementary school\nstudents had been murdered, how is Clinton going to convince them to vote\nfor whatever she proposes?\n\n\n\nBut talking about gun measures in the presidential campaign could still\nhave a practical impact, by elevating the issue and thereby making it more\nlikely that more gun laws might be passed on the state level. And that\xe2\x80\x99s\nwhere all the action has been of late: since the Newtown shooting, there\nhave been dozens of laws passed at the state level on the subject of guns,\nand they tell a story of red and blue America moving farther apart.\n\n\n\nIn Red America, one state after another has passed laws to expand who can\nget a gun and where you can take it. Last year Georgia passed a law\nallowing people to take guns into churches, government buildings, and bars.\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand your ground\xe2\x80\x9d laws have proliferated in Republican-run states\n(despite the fact that research indicates that they increase the number of\nhomicides).\n\n\n\nMeanwhile in Blue America, dozens of laws have been passed to rein in guns.\nLegislatures in states like California, Maryland, and Connecticut expanded\nbackground checks, restricted access for those with mental illness or\ndomestic abuse convictions, and made it harder to get assault weapons. In\n2014, voters in Washington state passed a ballot initiative mandating\nuniversal background checks by a wide margin.\n\n\n\nSo when we talk about the gun issue, we have to keep three things in mind.\nFirst, the kind of restrictions Clinton is proposing are hugely popular.\nSecond, there really are two Americas when it comes to guns. And third, one\nof those Americas has the ability and the desire to stop any gun\nlegislation in Congress. If Hillary Clinton has a plan to deal with that\nlast reality, it would be interesting to hear.\n\n\n\n*Jacob Lew: Americans Will Work Hard if Jobs Pay Decent Wages\n<http://on.wsj.com/1SdSABs> // WSJ // Nick Timiraos \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nTreasury Secretary Jacob Lew waded into a political spat over the economy\nsparked Wednesday when Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush said\nAmericans needed to work longer hours to boost economic growth.\n\n\n\nMr. Bush, the former Florida governor, said the comment referred to the\nelevated level of workers\xe2\x80\x94some 6.5 million Americans\xe2\x80\x94who have part-time\njobs but desire full-time work. Democrats jumped on the comment earlier\nthis week to portray Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s comment in an unflattering light.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a challenge for a lot of families to make ends meet. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\nthe problem is that Americans aren\xe2\x80\x99t willing to work hard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Lew in\nresponse to a question Friday at an event in New York sponsored by\nPolitico. \xe2\x80\x9cAmericans are willing to work hard if there\xe2\x80\x99s work available to\nthem and if they are paid a decent wage for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Lew said the government\xe2\x80\x99s job should be to provide anyone who is able\nand interested in working with the ability to get a job that can support a\nmiddle-class standard of living. He pointed to the White House\xe2\x80\x99s push to\nboost the federal minimum wage.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you work full time, you should not be below the poverty line in this\ncountry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton bucks trend, confronts NRA\n<http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/hillary-clinton-bucks-trend-confronts-nra>\n// MSNBC // Steve Benen \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nIn the three weeks since the mass shooting in Charleston, two notable\nstatewide gun measures have been signed into law. In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott\nWalker (R) scrapped his state\xe2\x80\x99s 48-hour waiting period, and this week in\nMaine, Gov. Paul LePage (R) got rid of his state\xe2\x80\x99s concealed gun permit\nrequirement.\n\nThe developments are a striking reminder about the politics of the gun\nissue. No matter how high-profile the shootings, and no matter how severe\nthe public revulsion, proposals to scale back restrictions keep advancing.\n\nAt the national level, meanwhile, the massive Republican presidential field\nis largely unified on all gun-related questions, and recent history\nsuggests the Democratic candidates will generally avoid the issue. But the\nWashington Post had an interesting piece overnight highlighting the degree\nto which Hillary Clinton is pursuing her own course.\n\n[I]n a sign that the political environment on guns has shifted in the wake\nof recent mass shootings \xe2\x80\x93 and of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s determination to stake out\nliberal ground in her primary race against insurgent Sen. Bernie Sanders\n(I-Vt.) \xe2\x80\x93 Clinton is not only initiating a debate about gun control but\nalso vowing to fight the National Rifle Association.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to speak out against the uncontrollable use of guns in our\ncountry because I believe we can do better,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said Tuesday in Iowa\nCity.\n\nA few days earlier, she said in Hanover, N.H.: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to take on the gun\nlobby\xe2\x80\xa6. This is a controversial issue. I am well aware of that. But I think\nit is the height of irresponsibility not to talk about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Post piece makes the case, persuasively, that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the norm for\nrecent Democratic candidates. None of the party\xe2\x80\x99s recent nominees in\n\xe2\x80\x9cseveral decades,\xe2\x80\x9d including President Obama, emphasized the issue at all\nwhile on the campaign trail.\n\nClinton, however, is trying something different. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth appreciating\nwhy.\n\nSome of this may be the result of a unique primary rival \xe2\x80\x93 Sen. Bernie\nSanders (I-Vt.) is running to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s left on some issues, but guns are a\nnotable exception. The Independent senator describes himself as aiming for\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe middle\xe2\x80\x9d on the issue and he has a voting record that arguably puts him\nwell to the right of many Democratic activists.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s possible, in other words, that Clinton is stressing the issue at this\npoint to help exploit a gap between Sanders and the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 progressive\nbase.\n\nBut chances are, there\xe2\x80\x99s even more to it than this. Practically all of the\nleading Democratic presidential candidates have shied away from the issue,\nfor over a generation, fearing a fierce backlash from far-right groups like\nthe NRA.\n\nClinton no doubt realizes, however, that as the NRA becomes more extreme,\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no placating the group \xe2\x80\x93 it goes after Democrats whether they try\nto make the group happy or not. Just ask former Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.),\nwho eagerly tried to keep the NRA happy, but who found that the NRA\ntargeted him with a vengeance anyway.\n\nTo this extent, the NRA has given up its credibility. The group\xe2\x80\x99s message\nused to effectively be, \xe2\x80\x9cPlay ball with us and we\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s transformed into, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re coming after you, whether you try to work\nwith us or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGiven those incentives, Clinton might as well speak her mind, confident\nthat the attacks are inevitable either way.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sander\xe2\x80\x99s awkward lunch\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/hillary-clinton-and-bernie-sanders-awkward-lunch-119974.html>\n// Politico // Gabriel Debenedetti and Jonathan Topaz \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton travels to Capitol Hill on Tuesday as part of her\nlawmaker charm offensive, she could be in for a slightly awkward encounter.\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders \xe2\x80\x94 the Independent who caucuses with Senate Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 will\nbe sitting there at the weekly lunchtime meeting, as he always does, while\nthe front-runner talks to her former colleagues.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s hardly unusual for rival presidential candidates to gather together on\nthe Hill \xe2\x80\x94 four Republican senators are currently running against each\nother, and other candidates occasionally visit \xe2\x80\x94 but in Clinton and\nSanders\xe2\x80\x99 situation, the tension is a tad thicker.\n\n\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s because Clinton has the support of 30 Democratic senators already \xe2\x80\x94\nincluding Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 Vermont colleague, Patrick Leahy \xe2\x80\x94 in her latest White\nHouse bid, while her opponent has the backing of none. Clinton has yet to\neven acknowledge her main rival by name on the campaign trail \xe2\x80\x94 despite\nrecent polling that shows Sanders nipping at her heels in Iowa and New\nHampshire, and despite being asked about him directly twice in a CNN\ninterview this week.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as Senate caucus politics go, this is probably as awkward as it\xe2\x80\x99s\ngoing to get. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing he can do about it. It is what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nJim Manley, a former veteran aide to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and\nTed Kennedy.\n\n\n\nBeyond Sanders, however, the room Clinton addresses will also likely\ncontain a handful of influential unaffiliated liberal senators \xe2\x80\x94 including\nprogressive icon Elizabeth Warren and Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown. Sanders\nrecently said that he\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x9clove to have\xe2\x80\x9d Warren campaign with him, while the\nMassachusetts senator has said multiple times that it\xe2\x80\x99s premature to say\nwhether she will.\n\n\n\nBut the meeting will also provide another reminder that, despite Sanders\xe2\x80\x99\nhuge crowds and scores of small-dollar donations, his candidacy remains\nmostly an afterthought at his place of business. Twenty-one members of the\nCongressional Progressive Caucus \xe2\x80\x94 Congress\xe2\x80\x99 leading caucus on liberal\nissues, in which Sanders is the lone senator \xe2\x80\x94 have endorsed Clinton, while\nnone has endorsed Sanders. And Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Tuesday swing across the Hill will\ninclude a meeting with that very group.\n\n\n\nSanders has had a similarly awkward reception with the party establishment\nback home in Vermont. In addition to Leahy, Gov. Peter Shumlin and Miro\nWeinberger, the mayor of Burlington \xe2\x80\x94 the city where Sanders served four\nterms as mayor and held his campaign kickoff \xe2\x80\x94 have also endorsed Clinton.\n\n\n\nClinton and Sanders have rarely crossed paths since they each announced\ntheir candidacies in April, save a chance run-in at New York\xe2\x80\x99s Penn Station\nlast month. But Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s encounter in Washington will likely be the second\nof at least three next week: they\xe2\x80\x99ll both appear in Kansas City at the\nNational Council of La Raza conference on Monday, and they\xe2\x80\x99re both\nscheduled to speak at the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 first cattle call of the cycle on\nFriday, the Iowa Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s Hall of Fame ceremony.\n\n\n\nClinton and Sanders overlapped for two years in the Senate before she left\nthe Hill for Foggy Bottom, and they have a cordial relationship. But as the\npair has emerged as the two leading candidates in the Democratic field, the\napparent distance between them has grown: Sanders does not shy away from\nimplicitly criticizing the front-runner on the stump, though he rarely goes\nafter her by name.\n\n\n\nClinton, meanwhile, has started pressing harder on issues where Sanders is\nperceived as weak by the liberal base, such as gun control.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, tensions between the two aren\xe2\x80\x99t anything like the strained\nrelations between Republican candidates, such as Sens. Lindsey Graham and\nRand Paul, who frequently clash. Sanders sat in on a meeting of the Senate\nDemocrats with Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign chairman John Podesta and political\ndirector Amanda Renteria in late April, and his spokesman told POLITICO\nthat the candidate \xe2\x80\x9cof course\xe2\x80\x9d planned to attend the event with Clinton\nherself. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign declined to comment for this story.\n\n\n\n(Two other Democrats running for president \xe2\x80\x94 Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb \xe2\x80\x94\nare former senators, but they are not expected to attend the Senate caucus\nmeeting.)\n\n\n\nThe former New York senator\xe2\x80\x99s Capitol Hill trip will also include meetings\nwith the House Democrats and members of the Congressional Black Caucus,\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus, and Congressional Asian Pacific American\nCaucus.\n\n\n\nAnd while the meeting will come days after Sanders attends a weekend\nretreat with Senate Democrats in Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard, the timing is unlikely\nto soften the impact of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s appearance.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s going to be walking down that hallway with her vast entourage,\npeople are going to be screaming out questions, and she\xe2\x80\x99s going to walk\ninto that room to a rock star reception,\xe2\x80\x9d Manley said.\n\n\n\n*Jeb Bush: Hillary Clinton \xe2\x80\x98can\xe2\x80\x99t be trusted\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/jeb-bush-criticize-hillary-clinton-no-trust-119943.html?ml=tl_24>\n// Politico // Nick Gass \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s greatest vulnerability?

Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the server, the emails, Benghazi, [she] just\nconstantly validates this notion that there are two sets of rules.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe former Florida governor rejected the notion that a potential general\nelection match-up of a Bush against a Clinton would deter voter turnout.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to win the nomination, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to run a campaign that will\ninspire people that their lives can get better,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99ll\ndrive turnout, particularly among people who are conservative and they just\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know it yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s ability to be trusted has been the subject of scrutiny in the\npolls. Quinnipiac University surveys conducted last month in Florida, Ohio\nand Pennsylvania found wide skepticism of her trustworthiness.\n\n\n\nBut in an interview with CNN earlier this week, Clinton dismissed the idea\nthat Americans have trust issues with her.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople should and do trust me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, blaming a \xe2\x80\x9cbarrage of attacks\nthat are largely fomented by and coming from the right\xe2\x80\x9d for any perceptions\nto the contrary.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s union problem\n<http://blogs.reuters.com/talesfromthetrail/2015/07/10/hillary-clintons-union-problem/>\n// Reuters // Luciana Lopez \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with AFL-CIO leaders later this month will\nunderscore just how much ground she has to make up with unions that are\nflatly angry at the presidential candidate over her recent policy stances\n(or lack thereof).\n\n\n\nClinton can \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely not\xe2\x80\x9d take unions\xe2\x80\x99 backing for granted, said RoseAnn\nDeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United, the largest U.S.\norganization of registered nurses.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that there was an assumption that whoever was anointed by the\nDemocratic Party would be the candidate of organized labor. And I think\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s proven to be false,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nIn fact, DeMoro noted, \xe2\x80\x9cour values as a labor movement line up pretty\nclearly with the program of (Bernie) Sanders, the nurses\xe2\x80\x99 values.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has drawn crowds of thousands to recent\nevents, surprising many political observers and suggesting a stronger than\nexpected challenge to Clinton.\n\n\n\nSanders, along with former Maryland Governor Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, will also\nspeak to the AFL-CIO executive council at the July 29-30 meeting as part of\nthe union\xe2\x80\x99s endorsement process. All three candidates are Democrats; an\nendorsement is not necessarily expected this early in the road to the\nNovember 2016 election.\n\n\n\nDeMoro also criticized Clinton and the Democratic Party on the Pacific Rim\ntrade deal that the Obama administration is working on. Clinton has called\nfor worker protections in any deal but has said little otherwise.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the elephant in the room,\xe2\x80\x9d DeMoro said.\n\n\n\nThomas Buffenbarger, president of The International Association of\nMachinists and Aerospace Workers, also called for greater regulation of the\nfinancial industry.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe re-imposition of Glass-Steagall legislation would kind of break up the\nbig banks and put some sanity into the thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nThe Glass-Steagall Act of the last century separated investment banks and\ncommercial banks in an effort to reduce risk in the banking system.\n\n\n\nBuffenbarger also noted that his union is worried about the U.S.\nExport-Import Bank, which was forced to halt business after its charter\nexpired on June 30.\n\n\n\nThe bank helps finance purchases by foreign companies of U.S. exports.\n\n\n\nThe three Democrats all returned questionnaires to the AFL-CIO as part of\nthe endorsement process.\n\n\n\nBut they\xe2\x80\x99re not the only ones, said Buffenbarger: \xe2\x80\x9cThe surprise was Mike\nHuckabee,\xe2\x80\x9d who Buffenbarger said also returned a questionnaire.\n\n\n\n*Modern campaigning: The Hillary Quilt Project\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/10/politics/hillary-clinton-iowa-quilts-2016-election/index.html>\n// CNN // Betsy Klein \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nThe group assembles every Tuesday, toting fabric, needles, the occasional\nrhubarb pie and their "Iowans Ready for Hillary" pins.\n\n\n\nFor two hours, they talk 2016 while stitching a very political quilt.\n\n\n\n"This is a supporter quilt. It\'s kind of a way to say to Hillary, \'We\'ve\ngot your back,\'" Iowan Clara Oleson said.\n\n\n\nFor Clinton supporters, this quilt has special significance: It\'s a sign of\norganization and momentum for a campaign that needs to ignite enthusiasm\nfor Clinton during her second race in the Hawkeye State. In 2008, Clinton\'s\nbid for the presidency faltered here and never recovered.\n\n\n\nMany Iowans said in interviews they had felt ignored by Clinton\'s campaign\nthe last time around. Connecting supporters over shared interests such as\nquilting offers one way to excite and engage them.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s campaign in Iowa, the first-in-the-nation caucus state, has 27\norganizers who have held over 2,500 meetings with Iowans. In addition to\nthe Hillary Quilt Project, they\'ve launched a morning swim group in Cedar\nRapids, a Kayaking group in Benton County, and a group that is working on a\ncommunity garden in Eastern Iowa.\n\n\n\nIt\'s a strategy, much like church small groups, that draws in supporters to\nconnect beyond the more broadly labeled coalition-building of campaigns\npast (for example, "Teachers for Hillary").\n\n\n\n"It used to be just strictly coalition-building. You\'d get this wide swath\nof teachers for whoever your candidate was, or farmers, or business\nowners," said Iowa Republican strategist Tim Albrecht. "But now, you\'re\nreally seeing this organizing at the micro level. If you can attract people\naround something they are already doing ... that\'s priceless."\n\n\n\nWith these grassroots common interest groups, the Clinton campaign is\nharnessing micro-organization at a level unmatched by her competitors in\nIowa and around the country.\n\n\n\nThere\'s a long history of quilting in American politics: Women gathered to\nstitch during the Civil War, supporters of the late 19th century temperance\nmovement created quilts as fundraisers, and more recently, the AIDS\nMemorial Quilt has been growing since 1987 with more than 48,000 individual\nmemorial panels.\n\n\n\nIn a state where the presidential campaign process is revered, quilts are\nalso engrained in Iowa culture, Oleson explained. Quilts are made for\nmomentous occasions: new babies, graduations, anniversaries, and now, a new\npresidential campaign.\n\nWhen the Clinton campaign unveiled its H logo this spring, Oleson saw an\nopportunity.\n\n\n\n"Boy, this would make a great quilt," Oleson wrote of the logo on Facebook.\n\nClinton campaign organizer Sarah Andrews also saw an opportunity -- and\nhours later, was in Oleson\'s living room.\n\n\n\nThe "Hillary Quilt Project" was born.\n\n\n\n"If there\'s a common touch in democracy," Oleson said, "My God, it\'s a\nquilt."\n\n\n\nOleson, 73, is a retired lawyer and a prolific quilter -- just don\'t ask\nher how long she\'s been working on any particular quilt. On one week this\nsummer, she led the men and women in the group as they went around the\nquilt circle, introducing themselves and choosing the color in the rainbow\n"H" logo of the quilt that they found most meaningful.\n\n\n\nEllen Heywood chose purple, the color of women\'s suffrage. Janean Arnold\nchose green for her concerns about climate change. Colleen Picek chose\nyellow, supporting the troops and hoping for an end to war.\n\n\n\nCameron Macaw-Hennick chose all of the colors together.\n\n\n\n"All of the colors in the center are important to me because of the\nrainbow. Something that really stands out to me about Hillary, from the\nvery get-go, is her unequivocal support of the LGBT community, which she\ndidn\'t have several years ago. But just like everyday citizens, she grows\nand changes," he said as he stitched.\n\n\n\nMacaw-Hennick is a campaign volunteer from Cedar Rapids who also happens to\nbe a skilled quilter. He and his husband are ardent Hillary Clinton\nsupporters.\n\n\n\n"The day she announced, I was jumping up and down. My husband is super\nexcited, as well... I said I have to be involved in this campaign."\n\n\n\nLater, the group continued to stitch while supporter Julie Kline read aloud\nfrom the Gaza chapter of Clinton\'s 2014 memoir, "Hard Choices."\n\n\n\nParticipants in the Hillary Quilt Project range from veteran quilters to a\nfew who had never even picked up a needle.\n\n\n\nThe quilt, Oleson said, exists in two worlds: physically in West Branch,\nand in "virtual reality," with its own Facebook page. Recently it was even\nfeatured on Clinton\'s official campaign Twitter account, which has nearly\nfour million followers.\n\n\n\n"It\'s good for quilting and it\'s good for Hillary," she said of the project.\n\n\n\n"The dance of democracy in Iowa is a privilege and an honor," Oleson, who\nsupported President Barack Obama in 2008, said.\n\n\n\n"I\'ve done it for 50 years and this is one of the most fun dances I\'ve\ndone. People working together, doing something they\'d never do, and this\ncampaign is open to that kind of an idea."\n\n\n\nOnce the quilt is done, the quilters and other Clinton supporters will sign\ntheir names on it. Oleson hopes the quilt will be signed and seen by many\npeople, including Clinton herself.\n\n\n\n"I want to see her standing in front of the quilt and giving a speech," she\nsaid. "You also make a quilt for the future, and sometimes you think about\nwhere is the quilt going to end up. It\'s not going to end up in somebody\'s\ncloset -- it\'s going to hang on somebody\'s wall or in a presidential\nlibrary."\n\n\n\nCNN caught up with Oleson at Clinton\'s Monday town hall event in nearby\nIowa City. Olseon had the opportunity to speak with Clinton following her\nspeech.\n\n"She knows about the quilt," Oleson said proudly. "And she says it\'s\nbeautiful."\n\n\n\n*Gowdy: \xe2\x80\x98Pulling teeth\xe2\x80\x99 to get info for Benghazi investigation\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/10/politics/trey-gowdy-hillary-clinton/> // CNN\n// Daniella Diaz \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHouse Select Committee on Benghazi Chairman Trey Gowdy said Friday that the\nObama administration could speed up the Benghazi investigation if they\nturned over the requested relevant documents, but they haven\'t cooperated.\n\n\n\nGowdy told CNN\'s Brianna Keilar that his panel has been specific with the\nadministration about the documents needed to be turned over for the\ninvestigation.\n\n\n\n"They begged us to narrow it so we narrowed it," he said.

That is much more of a Claire character than, for\ninstance, Cherie [Blair], who as far as I\xe2\x80\x99m aware didn\xe2\x80\x99t become actively\naware in politics as such.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily the endorsement the US presidential candidate would be\nafter but Dobbs is obsessed with the character of the former first lady and\nhow it\xe2\x80\x99ll affect her run for the top job.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fascinated by Hillary of course, because she comes with so much\nbaggage,\xe2\x80\x9d he tells BuzzFeed News, sitting on a bench outside parliament,\ndressed in a crisp white shirt and cufflinks. \xe2\x80\x9cThat baggage is her strength\nbut also her vulnerability. We just have to wait and see where the balance\nlies on that. Though it is bizarre that the system that was bred out of\n[rejection of a King] has produced the Bushes, the Kennedys, the Clintons,\nthe Roosevelts\xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhat about the real-life President Underwood? \xe2\x80\x9cMore Tony Blair than\nMargaret Thatcher. Thatcher left behind something called Thatcherism, we\nall know what we stood for and I\xe2\x80\x99m buggered if I know what Tony Blair stood\nfor other than being in office.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd troubled political aide Doug Stamper? \xe2\x80\x9cIn terms of focus and loyalty,\napart from myself of course, it\xe2\x80\x99d be Alastair [Campbell] in the UK.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDobbs knows what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about when it comes to political narratives.\nHe first created House of Cards as a novel in the late 1980s. A former\nassistant to Thatcher, he was the first person to tell her that she had won\nthe 1979 general election but was later sacked by his political idol, \xe2\x80\x9cShe\nattacked me horribly and grossly unfairly\xe2\x80\x9d. He turned to writing and\nwatched as his creation became a BBC TV series, followed by a highly\nsuccessful American reboot for Netflix in 2013. He\xe2\x80\x99s stayed actively\ninvolved all the way, offering advice to the production team and is\ncurrently promoting the DVD release of series three.\n\n\n\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s also a rare beast: a writer and an active parliamentarian \xe2\x80\x93 a believer\nin small government, he enjoys a \xe2\x80\x9chugely disruptive and distracting\xe2\x80\x9d three\ndays a week as a Conservative member of the House of Lords where he helped\nto lay the ground for the forthcoming referendum on Britain\xe2\x80\x99s membership of\nthe European Union. However, Dobbs keeps his personal politics out of his\nwriting because it bores the audience: \xe2\x80\x9cOnce people start writing through\npolitical prejudice then it\xe2\x80\x99s not likely to be very successful.\n\n\n\nIn House of Cards, for instance, I defy you to remember a single bit of the\nactual politics that was written about. It\xe2\x80\x99s about the people in politics.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe first three series dealt with Underwood\xe2\x80\x99s rise from Congress to the top\njob, but despite the show currently at the end of Francis\xe2\x80\x99 first term as\npresident, Dobbs dismisses suggestions the show necessarily has to come to\nan end any time soon. That\xe2\x80\x99s for the simple reason that there\xe2\x80\x99s always\nsomething else for the characters to do: \xe2\x80\x9cSome programmes have the ability\nto go on and on forever \xe2\x80\x93 those are the ones that are based around\nrelationships. How long can a show go on that is focused on a relationship\nbetween two people \xe2\x80\x93 Francis and Claire \xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not just\nabout power, it\xe2\x80\x99s also about their relationship which gives [the show]\nlegs. It has is a global audience, there are more watchers in China than in\nAmerica.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe talks with pride about the quality of the set and the people involved:\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople have come from the White House to inspect the set and their jaws\nhave dropped. Even the doors of the Oval Office close with the same quiet\nthud as they do. It\xe2\x80\x99s actually a third larger than the real Oval Office but\neverything is sourced to be just right in meticulous detail; even light\nswitches and door knobs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s planning to keep working on the show as well as a new project with\nAdam Price, the creator of Borgen and a proposed work about Winston\nChurchill. He says he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever write a character based on Ed Miliband\n(\xe2\x80\x9ccertainly not as a lead figure\xe2\x80\x9d) but he\xe2\x80\x99s optimistic about a political\nculture that is more engaged and less dependent on traditional sources of\ninformation: \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are beginning to bother again now and make up their\nown minds \xe2\x80\x93 The Sun Wot Won It? Not any more. It never did in the first\nplace but certainly not any more. There are no secrets anymore, everything\nyou do or say will come out eventually \xe2\x80\x93 the question is when and does it\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAt the same time, he wants to take an active role in the negotiations over\na referendum on the UK\xe2\x80\x99s continued membership of the European Union,\ntouring the country and speaking to the public.\n\n\n\nBut if he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to make that commitment, surely he already knows which\nway he\xe2\x80\x99ll campaign in the referendum?\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt depends! I will wait to see what the prime minister comes back with\n[from negotiations with EU leaders]. It would require returning some\nimportant powers, not just a standstill. Everyone in Europe knows the\nsystem is screwed and could be screwed magnificently over Greece. It is\nmadness to put institutions before the people they are meant to serve. 50%\nyouth unemployment in Greece is not their fault \xe2\x80\x93 that is the madness,\nBrussels thinks there is a way to make the Greeks to pay their debts back.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no way of paying it back! They are bankrupt!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSo is he a libertarian? \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a great believer in big government:\nthe more government promises, the less it delivers, that\xe2\x80\x99s been my entire\nexperience. It\xe2\x80\x99d be wonderful if we could find a way for people to say \xe2\x80\x98I\nwant government less in my life and for me to get on with it more\xe2\x80\x99. There\nare plenty of people who need government, it has got to a point where the\nsystem isn\xe2\x80\x99t working anymore.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nUltimately Dobbs credits his sacking from the 1980s Conservative government\nby Britain\xe2\x80\x99s first female prime minister as the moment that gave the world\none of the greatest ever political dramas: \xe2\x80\x9cPolitics is cruel. If you go\ninto politics to be cuddled and be hugged the whole time then you\xe2\x80\x99re in the\nwrong business. That was the start of House of Cards.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo that extent, I owe it all to Maggie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Beghazi Committee Chairman: Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Made \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe Half Dozen Demonstrably\nFalse Statements\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/benghazi-committee-chairman-clintons-made-maybe-half-dozen-d#.yo3BAOVLP>\n// BuzzFeed // Andrew Kaczynski \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nRep.

Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team decided which emails were personal and which\nwere official government records that needed to be turned over to the State\nDepartment. Her lawyer told the Benghazi Committee in March that her server\nwas wiped and the emails were deleted after they were turned over.\n\n\n\nClinton said in an interview with CNN she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t received a subpoena for\nemails from her time as secretary of state.

The company pleaded guilty to\ntwo counts of criminal information in 2010. In its plea agreement with the\nDepartment of Justice, Balli Aviation agreed to pay a $2 million criminal\nfine, serve five years corporate probation, and pay an additional $15\nmillion in civil fines. The hefty sum was \xe2\x80\x9ca direct consequence of the\nlevel of deception used to mislead investigators," Thomas Madigan, a top\nJustice Department official, said at the time.\n\n\n\nAlaghband is one of an array of questionable actors who\xe2\x80\x99ve been found in\nrecent months to give to the Clinton Foundation.  The gifts  \xe2\x80\x93 from foreign\ngovernments with human rights violations like Qatar, Algeria, Saudi Arabia\nand China as well as  FIFA, soccer\xe2\x80\x99s corrupt governing body \xe2\x80\x93 have\ncomplicated Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign for president and raised questions\nas to whether these entities were trying to curry favor with the former\nSecretary of State.\n\n\n\nBut Alaghband stands out from the rest, because the beneficiary of his\nfirm\xe2\x80\x99s deals with Tehran was an Iranian airline accused by the U.S.\ngovernment of working with the regime\xe2\x80\x99s foreign intelligence operatives and\nshipping arms and troops to Syria. Plus, if an agreement between Iran and\nthe world\xe2\x80\x99s major powers is concluded in the coming days \xe2\x80\x93 as is widely\nexpected \xe2\x80\x93 operators like Alaghband could stand to benefit. Hillary Clinton\nwill be put in the awkward position of either defending the act of the\nObama administration in which she once served or criticizing the\nculmination of a U.S.-Iran rapprochement effort, which her State Department\nbegan.\n\n\n\nOne of the two counts against Balli Aviation was that it \xe2\x80\x9cconspired to\nexport three Boeing 747 aircraft from the United States to Iran,\xe2\x80\x9d according\nto a Justice Department statement, without first obtaining the necessary\nexport licenses from the U.S. government. The company then used its\nArmenian airline subsidiary to buy the 747s with financing obtained from\nMahan Air, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s largest private airline, which is thought by the State\nDepartment to be controlled by former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi\nRafsanjani.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, the Treasury Department sanctioned the airline for \xe2\x80\x9cproviding\nfinancial, material and technological support to the Islamic Revolutionary\nGuard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF),\xe2\x80\x9d or the expeditionary arm of the Islamic\nRepublic\'s praetorian military division, now heavily active in both Syria\nand Iraq. At the time, the Treasury Department accused the Qods Force of\n\xe2\x80\x9csecretly ferrying operatives, weapons and funds\xe2\x80\x9d on Mahan flights.\n\n\n\nOn the Clinton Foundation website, Alaghband\xe2\x80\x99s company is listed as a donor\nin the $10,001 to $25,000 bracket. Moreover, on the website for Balli Real\nEstate, a property investment and development subsidiary also based in the\nUK, his personal bio describes him as a member of the Clinton Global\nInitiative.\n\n\n\nThis affiliation, along with his donation to the Foundation, came as a\nsurprise to Alaghband.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not a member of the Clinton Global Initiative,\xe2\x80\x9d he told The Daily\nBeast from London. \xe2\x80\x9cI attended a few meetings. The last meeting was 10\nyears ago. I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall having ever made a contribution.\xe2\x80\x9d Asked why he\nwas listed as a member of the CGI on his own corporate website, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t seen this website recently. If attending a few meetings makes you a\nmember, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA source familiar with the Clinton Foundation told The Daily Beast that\n\xe2\x80\x9cVahid Alaghband was never a member of CGI in a personal capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHowever, the source added, \xe2\x80\x9cIn 2007, Balli Group paid a onetime CGI\nmembership fee and they designated him as their delegate to the meeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAlaghband did recall giving money to another influential organization \xe2\x80\x94 the\nWashington, D.C.-based think tank the Brookings Institution. The donation\nhe gave was to Brookings\xe2\x80\x99 former Middle East policy shop, the Saban Center,\nwhich had been named for its major benefactor, the Israeli billionaire Haim\nSaban. (Staunchly pro-Israel, Saban is also, coincidentally, an avowed\nsupporter of Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s presidential ambitions.)\n\n\n\nIn 2007, Alaghband offered to give a $900,000 donation to run for three\nyears to Brookings via the U.S.-based PARSA Foundation, \xe2\x80\x9cthe first Persian\ncommunity foundation in the U.S. and the leading Persian philanthropic\ninstitution practicing strategic philanthropy and promoting social\nentrepreneurship around the globe,\xe2\x80\x9d as the foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website describes\nit.\n\n\n\nEmails obtained in the discovery process of a separate libel case show that\nAlaghband, who had already donated at least $50,000 to PARSA, initially\nintended to make a pass-through donation via the foundation to Brookings.\n\n\n\nBut Alaghband says that he never ultimately used PARSA as a conduit for his\ndonation; instead made his contribution directly to the Saban Center. He\nclaims that the amount given was \xe2\x80\x9cfar less\xe2\x80\x9d than $900,000 but declined to\nspecify how much. Furthermore, he insisted, the money wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ear-marked for\nany specific project or research use. \xe2\x80\x9cOur donation went to the Saban\nCenter and they had full discretion as to what to do with it,\xe2\x80\x9d Alaghband\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cMartin Indyk had discretion over the use of the funds.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIndyk, who headed the Saban Center from 2002 to 2013, is today the Vice\nPresident and Director for Foreign Policy at Brookings. He also served\xe2\x80\x94\ntwice\xe2\x80\x94as U.S. ambassador to Israel under the Clinton administration. In\n2013, Secretary of State John Kerry named Indyk the U.S. envoy to the\nMiddle East.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we took the donation nobody knew there were any problems with\nAlaghband,\xe2\x80\x9d David Nassar, the Vice President of Communications for\nBrookings, told The Daily Beast, speaking on behalf of the think tank.\nNassar also specified that the donation came from Balli Group bank\naccounts, not from Alaghband\xe2\x80\x99s personal accounts. (Full disclosure: Daily\nBeast executive editor Noah Shachtman previously did work as a non-resident\nfellow in Brookings\xe2\x80\x99 foreign policy division.)\n\n\n\nAsked why he was listed as a member of the Clinton Global Initiative on his\nown corporate website, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen this website recently.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA former Brookings staffer with direct knowledge of the donation told The\nDaily Beast said that, on the contrary, Alaghband\xe2\x80\x99s problems with the U.S.\ngovernment were known to the think tank at the time and that the money\nhelped finance the work of Suzanne Maloney, a former State Department\npolicy advisor and Republican advocate of U.S.-Iranian rapprochement.\n\n\n\nNassar told The Daily Beast that the suggestion that Alaghband\xe2\x80\x99s donation\nwas intended to bolster Maloney\xe2\x80\x99s pro-rapprochement research was false.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe money was general funding for the Persian Gulf Initiative and not\ndirected at any particular issue or any particular scholar,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nNevertheless, the Persian Gulf Initiative was a program run by the Saban\nCenter and Maloney worked on it.\n\n\n\nMaloney is married to Ray Takeyh, an Iran scholar who served in the Obama\nWhite House in 2009 and who, during that period, was one of the lead\nadvocates of engagement with Tehran.\n\n\n\nSince leaving the administration, Takeyh has emerged as a scathing critic\nof his former employer\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear diplomacy. But in 2008, Maloney and Takeyh\njointly published a 34-page white paper with the Saban Center titled,\n\xe2\x80\x9cPathway to Coexistence: A New U.S. Policy toward Iran.\xe2\x80\x9d  Arguing that the\nlongstanding U.S. policy of containment \xe2\x80\x9cis actually obsolete because Iran\nis no longer an expansionist power,\xe2\x80\x9d they called not for a mere \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy\nshift but for a paradigm change\xe2\x80\x9d in Washington.\n\n\n\nIn many ways, the paper essentially forecasted what Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s\napproach to dealing with Iran, from the largely hands-off approach to\nIran\xe2\x80\x99s bloody 2009 Green Revolution to the present-day compromises on its\nnuclear program.\n\n\n\nAlaghband\xe2\x80\x99s legal troubles did not appear to affect his relationship with\nBrookings a year after Balli Aviation was hit by the U.S. Commerce\nDepartment with a temporary ban on his Iranian export business. In February\n2009, he spoke at the U.S.-Islamic World Forum in Doha, where Brookings has\nanother Middle East center, this one bankrolled by the Qatari government.\nThe forum, in fact, was organized by the Saban Center on behalf of that\ngovernment.\n\n\n\nAlaghband, for his part, insists that he did nothing wrong, despite his\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe settlement [with the Justice Department] was one under which we did\nnot have to accept liability. We just agreed to make a payment and settle\nout of court,\xe2\x80\x9d he told The Daily Beast. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had to establish a compliance\nprogram and do all of those things. The transactions we were engaged in was\nreviewed by and subject to a legal to a legal opinion both in the UK and\nU.S. about the compliance of with sanctions. We proceeded on this basis.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe settlement also represented the largest civil penalty ever imposed by\nthe Commerce Department\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau of Industry and Security.\n\n\n\nPARSA\xe2\x80\x99s second largest recipient of grants is the National Iranian American\nCouncil (NIAC), a Washington, D.C.-based lobby group close to the Iranian\nregime, which advocates an end to all U.S. sanctions on Iran. It received a\ntotal received a total of $591,500 from the foundation. Alaghband\xe2\x80\x99s\nbrother, Hassan Alaghband, who is also the CEO of the Balli Group, spoke at\na organized conference in Tehran by one of NIAC\'s founders in June 2007, at\nwhich he spoke about Western companies doing business in Iran and cited\nBalli\xe2\x80\x99s client, Caterpillar, as a case study.\n\n\n\nThe Balli Group PLC had once been the world\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest steel trader\nbut it declared bankruptcy in 2013. A major reason for its folding? U.S.\nsanctions on Iran.\n\n\n\n*Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s Strategy Is Actually Brilliant\n<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/10/hillary-s-strategy-is-actually-brilliant.html>\n// Daily Beast // Nick Gillespie \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHas any future president been more misunderstood than Hillary Clinton?\n\n\n\nAs someone who cannot imagine any possible scenario in which I would cast a\nballot for the former Secretary of State, U.S. Senator, First Lady, and\nGoldwater Girl, I note this with a heavy heart. But Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s deafening and\nwidely criticized silence since announcing her candidacy isn\xe2\x80\x99t a weakness\nor a failing on her part. It underscores exactly the professionalism,\nstrategizing, and discipline that explain why she is atop the polls.\n\n\n\nShe has nothing to gain and everything to lose from shooting off her mouth\nfor at least the rest of the year. Like an aging boxer who survives more by\nsmarts than by slugging, Clinton knows that the fight for the White House\nis a 15-round bout that will certainly go the distance. Only a showboating\nchump would punch themselves out in the early rounds.\n\n\n\nSure, over the past few weeks, she\xe2\x80\x99s lost some ground among Democratic\nvoters to socialist Bernie Sanders. But she\xe2\x80\x99s still ahead of him, not to\nmention the ever-growing gaggle of Republican rivals. Sure, ever since\nannouncing she was running for president, Clinton has stayed awfully quiet,\npopping up in Chipotle surveillance camera footage like Patty Hearst on the\nlam and eschewing actual public events for \xe2\x80\x9cintimate\xe2\x80\x9d meetings with vetted,\nhandpicked supporters.\n\n\n\nOn the rare occasions when she does step out of her bubble, things have\ngotten hinky, like when she literally roped off the press during a Fourth\nof July parade in New Hampshire. The optics of that scene\xe2\x80\x94photogs and\njournos being physically restrained from getting close enough to her\nhighness to take good pics or ask embarrassing queries\xe2\x80\x94would be\nshame-inducing if not suicide-inducing to most candidates.\n\n\n\nBut do we need to spell it out, really? Hillary Clinton is not most\ncandidates.\n\n\n\nHillary is turning into a defensive master, but on her own terms.\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s learned from the acknowledged master\xe2\x80\x94husband Bill, who can\xe2\x80\x99t even be\nbothered to flatly promise not to give paid speeches if he becomes First\nDude\xe2\x80\x94that there\xe2\x80\x99s never a reason to give in to common decency and slink off\ninto the dark night of political oblivion. Hillary Clinton hasn\xe2\x80\x99t driven a\ncar since 1996 and it\xe2\x80\x99s a safe bet that she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t felt shame for even\nlonger.\n\n\n\nSince announcing for president, Clinton has granted exactly one televsion\ninterview, with CNN\xe2\x80\x99s Brianna Keilar, and smartly used the occasion to\nattack the Republican field for their weak-tea responses to Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s\nmuy stupido assertion that Mexican immigrants are mostly rapists.\nIndicating that she was \xe2\x80\x9cdisappointed\xe2\x80\x9d (read: elated) \xe2\x80\x9cin those comments,\xe2\x80\x9d\nClinton went on to note that her Republican rivals \xe2\x80\x9care all in the same\ngeneral area on immigration.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe worst part of that? She\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely right. Once the party of near-open\nborders (watch this video from 1980 in which Ronald Reagan and George H.W.\nBush one up each other on praising the contributions of illegal\nimmigrants), today\xe2\x80\x99s GOP, with minor exceptions, vilifies the wretched\nyearning to breathe free, at least when they come from Latin America.\n\n\n\nIn 2004, George Bush won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote. Eight years\nlater, Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x94who counseled that illegal immigrants should practice\n\xe2\x80\x9cself-deportation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94pulled just 27 percent. In the GOP \xe2\x80\x9cautopsy\xe2\x80\x9d of Romney\xe2\x80\x99s\nfailure in 2012, the authors wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cIf Hispanic Americans hear that the\nGOP doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want them in the United States, they won\xe2\x80\x99t pay attention to our\nnext sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d Given the way that the current candidates have been\nnon-reacting to Trump, that might be the best outcome the Republican Party\ncould hope for.\n\n\n\nAgainst such a backdrop, Clinton is right to keep mum, except when making\neasy layups against her opponents. Let Bernie Sanders whip Democrats into a\nprogressive frenzy and then step in with vague nods toward equality and\ngrowth for all. She knows full well that Sanders is not her real rival\xe2\x80\x94that\nwill be the GOP nominee, not a frothing-at-the-mouth socialist from a state\nwith a population smaller than Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\nShe also knows as well as anyone that her toughest challenge will be\nsweetening the air of inevitability that surrounds her like noxious\nsecond-hand smoke. No one outside of their immediate families wants to see\na Clinton-Bush contest, but such a showdown is more likely than not. She\nmay indeed be as \xe2\x80\x9carrogant\xe2\x80\x9d as Commentary and a thousand other similar\npublications contend, but she\xe2\x80\x99s likely smart enough to realize that nothing\nhumanizes her more than right-wing outlets foaming at the mouth about\neverything from blowjobs to Benghazi.\n\n\n\nThis is not to say that she\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect candidate. In fact, the roping off\nof journalists\xe2\x80\x94on a day celebrating indepence, no less!\xe2\x80\x94suggests Hillary\nClinton is in many ways singularly off-putting. Her feminist bona fides\nwere rightly called into question during her time as First Lady, her time\nas senator from New York was unmemorable, and her tenure as secretary of\nstate nothing short of disastrous. When under attack, she\xe2\x80\x99s capable of\nmind-bogglingly stupid comments, like when she started talking about Bobby\nKennedy\xe2\x80\x99s assassination during the end days of her 2008 run for the\nDemocratic nomination.\n\n\n\nThis is why she is smart to be running rope-a-dope strategy, essentially\nletting her opponents (Democratic and Republican) punch themselves out in\nthe early rounds. When they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken their best shots and mostly exhausted\nthemselves, she can come off the ropes and throw a haymaker or two. Along\nwith forgoing shame, this is another great tactical advantage she\xe2\x80\x99s learned\nfrom her husband.\n\n\n\nBill Clinton outlasted his opponents\xe2\x80\x94think Newt Gingrich and a gaggle of\nmoralistic congressmen, many of whom had skeletons of their own to hide.\nBill was like Muhammad Ali taking on George Foreman in the jungle heat, a\npersonable motormouth who loved to talk and press the flesh (sometimes a\nbit too much, to be sure). Hillary is turning into a defensive master, but\non her own terms. She\xe2\x80\x99s more like Floyd Mayweather, nobody\xe2\x80\x99s idea of a fun\nperson to hang out with, but capable of taking huge amounts of punishment\nand coming off the ropes in the late rounds to secure victory.\n\n\n\nIf the eventual Republican nominee\xe2\x80\x94whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Jeb Bush or Rand Paul or\ngod help us all Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x94wants a real chance at the crown, they\xe2\x80\x99d do\nbest to back away from Hillary and the anger-bear rhetoric that only makes\nher more sympathetic. The nominee would do well to outline an actually\npositive and inclusive message about how they plan to guide the country\ninto the 21st century rather than constantly harp on last century\xe2\x80\x99s\nscandals, the need for even newer and bigger wars, and protecting us from\nthe scourge of immigrants so desperate for a better life that they\xe2\x80\x99re\nwilling to risk arrest to come to America.\n\n\n\nA Republican employing positive rhetoric\xe2\x80\x94which is exactly how Barack Obama\ntoppled Clinton in 2008\xe2\x80\x94would pull her out of her crouch and cause her to\nswing recklessly and wildly. In all that lunging, she\xe2\x80\x99d be likely to knock\nherself out. But so long as the Republicans keep smacking themselves in the\nface, she\xe2\x80\x99s smart to hold her punches.\n\n\n\n*Clinton camp on Bush\xe2\x80\x99s fundraising: It should scare you\n<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-camp-jeb-bush-fundraising-it-should-scare-you>\n// MSNBC // Alex Seitz-Wald \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign is looking to turn Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s money into her own.\n\n\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate\xe2\x80\x99s super PAC announced Thursday a\nrecord-shattering $103 million fundraising haul, an astonishing number even\nin the post-Citizens United era. That\xe2\x80\x99s almost quadruple the amount of\nmoney every super PAC had raised by this point in the 2012 election cycle\ncombined, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and more than\nthe pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA, which is now backing Clinton,\nraised in two years during the last presidential election.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign is sounding the alarm, even as allies see a\npotential silver lining in Bush\xe2\x80\x99s haul.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Clinton finance director Dennis Cheng sent an email to\nsupporters pleading for contributions with the subject line: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary needs\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d In the email, Cheng said he had \xe2\x80\x9cbad news\xe2\x80\x9d and noted that Bush\xe2\x80\x99s\ncampaign and super PAC had raised a combined $114 million. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that number\nscares you, good. It should,\xe2\x80\x9d Cheng warned.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here\xe2\x80\x99s a point at which it may be too much \xe2\x80\x93 when we can\xe2\x80\x99t make up for\nit by organizing better and spending our resources more wisely,\xe2\x80\x9d Cheng\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot hit that point, especially this early in the\ncampaign.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut the Clinton campaign is hardly broke.\n\n\n\nLast week, her campaign announced that it had raised $45 million since it\nlaunched \xe2\x80\x93 the most any primary candidate had raised in history. Priorities\nUSA, that super PAC supporting Clinton, announced that it raised $15.6\nmillions so far this year, almost all of it coming in the previous four\nweeks.\n\n\n\nClinton has been on a break-neck fundraising spree since announcing her\ncampaign in April, hopscotching across the country to attend dozens of\n$2,700 per head fundraises. Aware of Team Bush\xe2\x80\x99s goal of raising more than\n$100 million, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign pushed back her big kick-off rally in part\nto give her more time to fundraise. Donors reported intense pressure to get\nchecks in early, and Clinton has gone hardly more than a few days between\nfundraisers.\n\n\n\nBush\xe2\x80\x99s haul is daunting, but not surprising since his campaign telegraphed\ntheir goal. And some Clinton allies insist it could actually help encourage\ntheir donors to pony up. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s obviously an impressive number. But it could\nbe good for us, it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to raise money against nothing. We now have a\nreal threat that should motivate our prospective donors to step up in a way\nmost haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said one source in the pro-Clinton super PAC world, who\nspoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\n\nThere are also downsides to Bush in raising most of his money via super\nPACs instead of campaigns. Super PACs are legally prohibited from\ncoordinating with campaigns, so the candidate has little say in how the\nmoney is spent or what the super PAC does. For instance, Democratic\npresidential candidate Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley was recently forced to publicly\ndenounce an ad made by the super PAC supporting him attacking Bernie\nSanders on gun control.\n\n\n\nAnd campaigns get a discounted rate not available to super PACs when it\ncomes to purchasing TV ads, the main expenditure of super PACs. That means\ncampaigns can run more ads for less money than super PACs, potentially\npaying huge dividends. Mitt Romney learned this the hard way when he and\nhis super PAC outspent Obama by almost a third, but ended up running 50,000\nfewer ads nonetheless.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillary\xe2\x80\x99s $45m in campaign money is much more valuable to her campaign\nthan Jeb\xe2\x80\x99s $100m in Super Pac money is to his,\xe2\x80\x9d former Obama official Dan\nPfeiffer said on twitter.\n\n\n\nAnd Clinton allies note that Bush\xe2\x80\x99s super PAC may not be able to repeat its\nmassive haul again. Bush himself led the PAC and made personal appeals to\ndonors on its behalf, something he is now prohibited from doing since he\xe2\x80\x99s\nan official candidate. Enthusiasm could drop off if Bush is no longer\ninvolved.\n\n\n\nBut even setting aside the super PAC, Clinton could fall behind Bush.\nBush\xe2\x80\x99s official campaign managed to out-compete Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s record-breaking\nhaul in one key measure. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s campaign raised $11.4 million to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\n$45 million, but he did it just 16 days compared to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 81. That\nbreaks down to $555,555 a day for Clinton, but $712,500 per day for Bush.\n\n\n\nBush\xe2\x80\x99s sprint could just capture the boost of enthusiasm any candidate\nreceives after they announce, and his numbers could drop off afterwards.\nMeanwhile, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be preoccupied with the Republican presidential primary\nand will have to spend most of money bashing Republicans before he even\nmakes it to the general election \xe2\x80\x93 if he makes it at all.\n\n\n\nBut it could also spell trouble for Clinton is she continues to be\nout-raised among both Bush\xe2\x80\x99s campaign and super PAC.\n\n\n\n*Medical Bill: Mystery donor picked up $150G tab for 2010 Clinton speech\n<http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/10/medical-bill-mystery-donor-picked-up-150g-tab-for-2010-clinton-speech/>\n// Fox // Malia Zimmerman \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nIt was a big coup when a nonprofit medical trade group landed Bill Clinton\nas a speaker at its 2010 annual conference in Chicago -- so big that some\nmembers wondered how the former president was being paid.\n\n\n\nNot to worry, members of the Radiological Society of North America were\ntold: An anonymous donor footed his bill.\n\n\n\nThe $150,000 fee was a mere fraction of the $48 million Clinton took in\nfrom 215 speeches between 2009 and 2013, while his wife was secretary of\nstate. Who paid Clinton and why they thought it was a fair bargain may\nnever be known \xe2\x80\x94 but government watchdogs say it is a prime example of how\nelusive accounting can be for the ex-president\'s eye-popping earnings.\n\n\n\nIt was clear, however, that the husband of America\'s top diplomat was not\nchosen for his medical expertise.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think this is interesting that you would ask me to come and speak today\nto a group of people from all over the world, and everyone of you knows\nmore about the subject than I do,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said at the beginning of his\n45-minute address to an audience of 4,250.\n\n\n\nDr. Sam Friedman, a radiologist from Columbia, SC., said at first he was\n\xe2\x80\x9cpeeved\xe2\x80\x9d when he heard Clinton was paid $150,000 for the \xe2\x80\x9crambling\xe2\x80\x9d speech,\nduring which Clinton took several \xe2\x80\x9cgratuitous shots\xe2\x80\x9d at Republicans and\nblamed U.S. doctors for many of the healthcare problems in third world\ncountries. When he and like-minded members made their objections known to\nthe organization, they were told the fee was paid by an \xe2\x80\x9canonymous\xe2\x80\x9d donor.\n\n\n\nRadiological Society of North America spokesman Marijo Millette told\nFoxNews.com the group \xe2\x80\x9cstrives to provide compelling speakers that will\nsatisfy the educational needs and special interests of a diverse audience.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMillette would not comment on Friedman\'s claim, which was also reported by\ntrade media, but said Clinton\'s fee and travel expenses were paid to the\nHarry Walker Agency, which represents Clinton. The organization\xe2\x80\x99s 990\nforms, filed with the Internal Revenue Service and required to maintain its\n501(c)3 status, do not list any payment to Clinton or his representative.\nNeither the executive director nor three executive board members contacted\nby FoxNews.com would divulge who paid Clinton\'s fee.\n\n\n\nMatthew Whitaker, executive director of the Foundation for Accountability &\nCivic Trust, a Washington-based, non-partisan campaign and ethics watchdog\ngroup, said the anonymous donation \xe2\x80\x9copens up a Pandora\xe2\x80\x99s box of questions\nincluding who funded this speech and what their motivations were.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis issue has to be resolved," Whitaker told FoxNews.com. "There has to\nbe an answer as to who gave the money. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has the smell of someone trying\nto move money through an organization to curry favor with the former\npresident. It also calls into question almost every speech Bill Clinton as\nmade and who the ultimate funder is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNeither Clinton\'s representatives at Harry Walker nor at the Clinton\nFoundation responded to a request for the name of the mystery sponsor. It\nwas not clear if other speeches by Clinton were similarly funded by\nanonymous third parties.\n\n\n\nTom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, a Washington D.C.-based government\nwatchdog foundation, said much of the $48 million Bill Clinton made from\n215 speeches during the time Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State went to\nthe Clintons\' personal coffers, not to the foundation. Federal disclosure\nforms filed by Hillary Clinton for 2010 record her husband\xe2\x80\x99s compensation\nas $150,000 from the Oak Brook, Ill.-based group, but critics say the lack\nof transparency about where the money really came from raises serious\nquestions.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBill and Hillary Clinton are married, so under the law, paying him for a\nspeech is like giving money directly to her \xe2\x80\x93 to the Secretary of State,\xe2\x80\x9d\nFitton said. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot think of a comparable \xe2\x80\x98pay to play\xe2\x80\x99 scandal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton gave 542 speeches around the world between 2001 and 2013, earning\n$104.9 million, and delivered another 53 speeches between January 2014 and\nMay 2015, earning an additional $13.5 million, according to reports by Fox\nNews and the Washington Post. The former president\'s speaking fees have\nranged from $28,100 for a 2001 talk at the London School of Economics to\n$750,000 for a 2011 appearance at an event for Swedish communications\ncompany Ericsson.\n\n\n\nWhile Clinton\'s knowledge of world events and charm as a raconteur is\nwell-documented, critics doubt the sky-high fees are doled out by anonymous\nparties for sheer entertainment value.\n\n\n\n"These donors don\'t cut checks because they want to hear a brief speech,"\nsaid Sean Davis, co- founder of The Federalist, a conservative online\nmagazine. "They do it to gain access or favors from the Clintons. The\nClintons owe voters a clear explanation of who is funneling them this money\nand why.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Kudos To Sanders, With A Wink To Clinton, Too\n<http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/07/10/421566327/kudos-to-sanders-with-a-wink-to-clinton-too>\n// NPR // Ron Elving \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nThese are palmy days for Sen. Bernie Sanders and his improbable campaign\nfor president. Thousands throng his events in Maine, Iowa and Wisconsin. He\nhas raised $15 million in just a few months, and he polls better among\nDemocrats than any one Republican is polling among Republicans.\n\n\n\nAt a minimum, the "independent socialist" senator has established himself\nas the insurgent to watch among Democrats in this cycle. So, we should\nsalute the man. But we should also cast a smiling glance toward the other,\npossibly ultimate, beneficiary of his early success.\n\n\n\nThat would be Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nWhy? Because in the long run, "the Sanders summer" is likely to boost her\nbid for the White House. Indeed, from her perspective, Sanders may be the\nideal rival en route to the nomination.\n\n\n\nHe\'s a man, he\'s 73, and he\'s well to her left on most issues. Moreover, he\nstarts from a low base of national recognition, lacks conventional media\nappeal and hails from a tiny northeastern state that is totally lopsided\npolitically. Did we mention he calls himself a socialist?\n\n\n\nClinton would have had far more to fear from the candidate dynamics had\nanother senator, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, made the race. Even if\nClinton prevailed, the inevitable wounds would be felt in the fall campaign.\n\n\n\nWarren would have equal claim to Clinton\'s magic demographic wand: the\nprospect of being the nation\'s first female president. Warren is also eight\nyears younger than Sanders, and two years younger than Clinton. She has\nheartland roots in Oklahoma, and the momentum from a late-blooming career\nand a scrappy battle to the top of Bay State politics. Her issue profile\nwould match the economic equality mood of the moment without stretching the\npoint.\n\n\n\nSanders, of course, goes further. He pleases crowds with full-throated\nproclamations about universal health care and Wall Street reform. He\nquickens the pulse of liberals and populists alike, including many who,\nlike Sanders, have not been card-carrying Democrats.\n\n\n\nBeyond that, he has earned his moment with his own brand of vitality and\npolitical punch. Brooklyn born and raised, Sanders is far more New York\nthan Clinton will ever be, but even his combative nature carries a certain\ncharm.\n\n\n\nAll this helps explain Sanders\' rise to the level of respectable in\nnational polls, including strong numbers in tuned-in Iowa and New\nHampshire. But those polls also bespeak the hunger many Democrats feel for\na choice in 2016. They may be "ready for Hillary," or resigned to her, but\nthey feel entitled to a little competition first. It\'s just part of being a\nDemocrat.\n\n\n\nSanders should benefit from this, tapping into the nostalgia of boomers who\nrebelled against the Democratic establishment decades ago, backing Eugene\nMcCarthy in 1968 and George McGovern in 1972. Some also remember their\nenthusiasm for Howard Dean a dozen years ago. Those upstart candidates,\ntoo, made a virtue of lacking conventional charisma.\n\n\n\nTaken together, these threads of political sentiment weave a ready-to-wear\nmantle for some Democrat plucky enough to put it on. Naturally, the Clinton\ncamp has been watching keenly for years now to see who it would be.\n\n\n\nNow, halfway through the critical pre-election year, the Democratic field\nconsists of Clinton, Sanders and three other white males who have failed to\nmake much of a dent. It is possible one of them will catch fire, but\nSanders is in their way. It is also possible other candidates will emerge,\nbut Sanders is in their way, too.\n\n\n\nAnd that helps Clinton.\n\n\n\nUltimately, though, Sanders\' greatest boon to Clinton may be in making her\nwork harder to connect \xe2\x80\x94 both with the party\'s activist left and with its\ntraditional lunch-bucket issues. Rooting her in what Dean liked to call\n"the democratic wing of the Democratic Party."\n\n\n\nWe always knew that Clinton could not be crowned the nominee in the\npresumptive manner of an incumbent president, or even an incumbent vice\npresident. We always knew there needed to be, and would inevitably be,\nsomeone who mounted a challenge from within Democratic ranks.\n\n\n\nNow that someone has emerged. He\'s Bernie Sanders, and he\'s doing very\nwell, thank you.\n\n\n\nClinton should be grateful.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton to Visit Senate Democrats at Lunch\n<http://blogs.rollcall.com/wgdb/hillary-clinton-to-visit-senate-democrats-at-lunch/>\n// Roll Call // Niels Lesniewski \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary\nRodham Clinton is scheduled to attend the July 14 Senate Democratic caucus\nlunch, a senior Democratic aide told CQ Roll Call.\n\n\n\nIt is one of several meetings with congressional Democrats Clinton is\nexpected to hold while in Washington, D.C., next week.\n\n\n\nBut the visit with her former Senate colleagues, a good number of whom have\nalready endorsed her presidential bid, is interesting because another\nperson seeking the Democratic nomination in 2016, Sen.

The hefty sum was \xe2\x80\x9ca\ndirect consequence of the level of deception used to mislead\ninvestigators,\xe2\x80\x9d Thomas Madigan, a top Justice Department official, said at\nthe time.\n\n\n\nAlaghband is one of an array of questionable actors who\xe2\x80\x99ve been found in\nrecent months to give to the Clinton Foundation. The gifts \xe2\x80\x93 from foreign\ngovernments with human rights violations like Qatar, Algeria, Saudi Arabia\nand China as well as FIFA, soccer\xe2\x80\x99s corrupt governing body \xe2\x80\x93 have\ncomplicated Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign for president and raised questions\nas to whether these entities were trying to curry favor with the former\nSecretary of State.\n\n\n\nBut Alaghband stands out from the rest, because the beneficiary of his\nfirm\xe2\x80\x99s deals with Tehran was an Iranian airline accused by the U.S.\ngovernment of working with the regime\xe2\x80\x99s foreign intelligence operatives and\nshipping arms and troops to Syria. Plus, if an agreement between Iran and\nthe world\xe2\x80\x99s major powers is concluded in the coming days \xe2\x80\x93 as is widely\nexpected \xe2\x80\x93 operators like Alaghband could stand to benefit.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) is gaining momentum as a Democratic\npresidential rival to Hillary Clinton. But he\'s no threat just yet.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, The New York Times reported that Clinton staffers are becoming\nincreasingly concerned that the Vermont senator is a serious threat to\nClinton\'s campaign.\n\n\n\nThey point to his rising poll numbers and his large event turnouts \xe2\x80\x94\naccording to The Washington Post, Sanders drew 7,500 at a Maine event on\nMonday, a week after drawing a 10,000-person crowd in Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nBut Sanders\' first problem is that, as political strategists and analysts\ntold Business Insider, his candidacy at this point is more resembling that\nof former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean (D) in 2004 than Barack Obama in 2008.\n\n\n\nHis momentum is concentrated in the first two early-voting states, Iowa and\nNew Hampshire. The general consensus among many left-leaning strategists\nand pollsters is that Sanders is best suited to win in those two states,\nwhere there are a sizeable portion of white, liberal voters.\n\n\n\n"Sanders is certainly doing a lot better in Iowa and New Hampshire where\nvoters are playing close attention than he is anywhere else," Tom Jensen,\nthe director of Public Policy Polling, told Business Insider.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t think that [Clinton campaign strategists] think that Sanders is\ngoing to win the nomination, but they probably take it seriously that he\ncould win a state or two early," added John Hagner, a campaign strategist\nat Clarity Campaign Labs.\n\n\n\nHagner, a veteran of the former Democratic National Committee chairman\nDean\'s 2004 presidential campaign team in New Hampshire, pointed to\nsimilarities between Sanders and Dean\'s momentous starts \xe2\x80\x94 and not just the\nfact that they\'re both from Vermont.\n\n\n\nHagner noted that Dean\'s team also garnered lots of liberal enthusiasm\nearly on, raising millions in small donations from passionate primary\nvoters. And he said Dean wasn\'t the only upstart to mount a challenge in\nNew Hampshire. Former Vice President Al Gore almost lost the state to\nformer Sen. Bill Bradley (D-New Jersey) in 2000.\n\n\n\n"The similarities [between Dean and Sanders] is in the fan base and in the\nintensity. And there really are, particularly in New Hampshire, a lot of\nvery progressive voters who enjoy uncertain candidates," Hagner said.\n\n\n\nAnalysts also told Business Insider that Sanders is benefiting from the\ndisproportionate share of white voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. Though\nhe\'s tried to outflank Clinton to the left on a number of issues like\nincome inequality and taxes, Sanders has been less decidedly liberal on\ntopics like immigration reform and gun control.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, he voted against an immigration-reform package in the Senate,\nteaming up with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to add restrictive amendments\nto the bill. Many Latino lawmakers don\'t believe that Sanders has\nimmigration reform at the top of his agenda in the same way that Clinton\ndoes.\n\n\n\n"It is not his priority," Arturo Vargas, the executive director of the\nNational Association of Latino Elected Office, told CNN last month. "I\nthink that is one of the challenges his campaign is going to have to\nconfront."\n\n\n\nSanders also hasn\'t made many inroads with African-American voters. Jensen,\nthe director of Public Policy Polling, told Business Insider that most\nrecent polls put the former Secretary of State\'s support among\nAfrican-American voters at around 70-80%.\n\n\n\n"If Sanders wins Iowa or New Hampshire it will build a lot of momentum for\nhim that will help in the states that follow, but he\'s still going to\nstruggle in places like South Carolina with large black populations and\nNevada with large Hispanic populations unless he improves his appeal to\nnonwhite voters," Jensen said.\n\n\n\nHagner said that if the Clinton campaign becomes legitimately nervous, they\nmay start putting issues in the spotlight that historically resonate with\nblack and Hispanic voters.\n\n\n\n"Immigration and gun rights are going to be problems for him. If you start\nto see stories pop up that have some finger prints, we\'ll know they\'re\ntaking it seriously," Hagner said.\n\n\n\nhillary clintonL.E. BaskowPresidential candidate Hillary Clinton arrives at\nthe Aria and greets workers before speaking at a conference in Las Vegas.\n\n\n\nFor its part, the Clinton campaign could also see the benefit in a\nstrengthened Sanders.\n\n\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly slammed national Democrats for running a\ncampaign that much more resembles an incumbent\'s. Clinton has long sought\nto avoid looking like she\'s taking her party\'s nomination for granted.\n\n\n\nAnd campaigns always like to lower expectations in the early-voting states.\nAnd every candidate wants to be able to claim momentum, regardless of the\nreality on the ground.\n\n\n\nSaid Bill Burton, a former top adviser to Obama\'s 2008 campaign: "Hillary\nClinton tried out inevitability as a message, and it was not successful."\n\n\n\n*No, Hillary Clinton Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Need a Plan For Passing Gun Control\nLegislation\n<http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/07/no-hillary-clinton-doesnt-need-plan-passing-gun-control-legislation>\n// Mother Jones // Kevin Drum \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nLots of political observers are surprised that Hillary Clinton is talking\nabout guns. That\'s a loser for Democrats, isn\'t it? Paul Waldman isn\'t so\nsure:\n\n\n\nThe truth is quite a bit more complicated than that \xe2\x80\x94 in fact, pushing for\nmeasures like expanded background checks is likely to help Clinton in the\n2016 election. But if she\xe2\x80\x99s going to promise to make headway on this issue,\nshe needs to offer some plausible account of how as president she could\nmake real progress where Barack Obama couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\n\n\nAllow me to impolitely disagree. Presidential campaigns are extended\nexercises in affinity marketing. No presidential candidate ever has to\nexplain how they\'re going to enact legislation. The most they have to do is\noffer a bit of breezy blather about crossing the aisle and focusing on\nareas of agreement and Americans not really being as polarized as the media\nmakes them out to be. That\'s plenty.\n\n\n\nOh sure, there are a few thousand annoying know-it-alls like Waldman and me\nwho are going to write blog posts about how this or that promise ain\'t\ngonna happen because the politics are impossible. But hell, even we don\'t\ncare. We\'re still going to vote for whoever we planned to vote for anyway.\nIt\'s not as if any of the other candidates are going to work miracles\neither.\n\n\n\nNow, it\'s true that some candidates run on a theme of competence, of\n"getting things done." Scott Walker is doing it this year. Michael Dukakis\ndid it. But I don\'t think there\'s any evidence that even this pale shadow\nof "how I\'m going to get things done" has much effect on voters. They just\nvote for the candidate who seems to be generally on their side, or\ngenerally most reasonable, or generally good to have a beer with. The\ndetails can be left to the wonks.\n\n\n\n*Ariana Grande\xe2\x80\x99s Manager Is Throwing a Big Fundraiser for Hillary Clinton\n<http://www.mediaite.com/online/ariana-grandes-manager-is-throwing-a-big-fundraiser-for-hillary-clinton/>\n// Mediaite // Jamie Frevele \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nIt looks like Hillary Clinton definitely has the Canadian teenybopper vote,\nif they\xe2\x80\x99re old enough and not all Canadian!

It is simply part\nof a criminal enterprise which dates back at least 10 years, all designed\nto enrich themselves personally at the expense of the American people and\nour nation.

The group\xe2\x80\x99s\nfounder is former President Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s entry into the presidential\nrace has prompted questions about the foundation, including foreign\ndonations to it and potential conflicts of interest. The campaign has\nrejected those criticisms.\n\n\n\nKen Quinn, president of the World Food Prize, said he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t intend for\nthe event to become political. But Timothy Hagle, a University of Iowa\npolitical science professor, said that might be hard to avoid.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat might be difficult in Iowa, in the middle of a presidential cycle,\xe2\x80\x9d\nHagle said. \xe2\x80\x9cEven with an important issue, politics may intrude.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nQuinn said he reached out to invite Chelsea Clinton months before her\nmother decided to take another run at the White House. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve worked very\nhard to never have the World Food Prize seen as anyway involved in\npolitics,\xe2\x80\x9d said Quinn, a former ambassador.\n\n\n\nChelsea Clinton will receive no fee for speaking at the event, scheduled\nfor Oct. 14-16. The World Food Prize will provide airfare and lodging, he\nsaid.\n\n\n\nEncouraging the education of women and girls is a big push for the World\nFood Prize. This year\xe2\x80\x99s prize winner, Sir Fazle Hasan Abed, is being\nhonored for his work creating the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee,\nfocused on giving women the social and economic tools to help themselves\nand their communities.\n\n\n\nQuinn said women play key roles in attacking hunger, improving health and\nincomes in developing countries. As small-holder farmers, they make many of\nthe decisions about growing but often have limited access to education.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cChelsea Clinton has been speaking a great deal, and the Clinton Global\nInitiative is focused on, girls\xe2\x80\x99 education and empowering women around the\nworld,\xe2\x80\x9d Quinn said.\n\n\n\nQuinn said he also invited Lauren Bush Lauren, founder of FEED, a nonprofit\nthat uses part of the sale of bags and accessories to help address hunger.\nLauren, granddaughter of president George H.W. Bush and niece of president\nGeorge W. Bush, was unable to attend the Des Moines event.\n\n\n\nChelsea Clinton will speak about the foundation\xe2\x80\x99s work, not politics, Quinn\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI stressed that we are nonpartisan.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHagle said even talking issues like STEM \xe2\x80\x94 science, technology, engineering\nand math training that many political leaders favor \xe2\x80\x94 could be viewed as\nChelsea Clinton subtly pushing for her mother. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will bring attention to\nthe issue, but she could get some eyebrows raised and criticism,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nQuinn said other political figures have been honored and spoken at the\nWorld Food Prize in the past, without being political, including current\nRepublican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee and former President Jimmy\nCarter, who is an honorary member of the council of advisers.\n\n\n\nQuinn said it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether Chelsea Clinton will take the opportunity\nto be in Iowa to campaign for her mother. Campaign and foundation officials\ncould not immediately say what her plans are while in Iowa.\n\n\n\nQuinn said Chelsea Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s staff has indicated she wants to meet with\nyoung people to talk about the importance of education.\n\n\n\nIn addition to Clinton, Sheryl WuDunn, an author and Pulitzer Prize winner,\nalso will speak about empowering women.

I\'m not so sure the feelings will be the same on the Republican\nside," Corroon said.\n\n\n\nUtah Republican Party Chairman James Evans said he isn\'t surprised Clinton\nis coming to Utah \xe2\x80\x94 the Democratic candidates have in the past \xe2\x80\x94 and he\ndoesn\'t expect her visit to stir up protests.\n\n\n\n"They come to Park City several times and I would expect her to visit with\nthe liberal elite, as she certainly is not connected to the everyday\nAmerican," Evans said. "I don\'t think people are going to go out of their\nway to protest her. We\'ll be respectful because everybody knows who she is\nand what she\'s about. So there\'s nothing else to really say other than\ncertainly she will be a disaster as president. I think people already know\nthat."\n\n\n\nEvans said he expects prominent Republican candidates to visit the state\nfor fundraisers, possibly as early as next month.\n\n\n\nSix of the Republican contenders already visited Utah last month \xe2\x80\x94\nWisconsin Gov.

He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to crush their dreams, and he ended up with crushing\ndebt.\n\n\n\nLast week, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley spelled out a proposal to help students graduate\ndebt-free from public colleges and universities by increasing Pell Grants\nand automatically enrolling borrowers in income-based repayment plans. One\nkey part of his plan calls for helping students and parents refinance their\ndebt at lower interest rates.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley knows of what he speaks. In announcing his proposals, he revealed\nthat his family has accumulated more than $339,200 in student loans, the\nbulk of which are parent PLUS loans. He and his wife borrowed to educate\ntheir daughters, Grace, 24, who attended Georgetown University and is a\npublic school teacher in Baltimore, and Tara, 23, who attended the College\nof Charleston in South Carolina and is now an administrative assistant for\nthe United Nations Foundation in the District. The couple still has two\nsons to get through college, William 17, and Jack, 12.\n\n\n\nWhen O\xe2\x80\x99Malley was governor of Maryland, he fought to have the state\nuniversities freeze tuition. Even with his vast political and legal\nexperience, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley couldn\xe2\x80\x99t win a key argument with his daughters that\nstate schools were a good bargain.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m blessed with strong-willed women in my life,\xe2\x80\x9d he gently laughed during\na phone interview while campaigning in New Hampshire. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted them to go\nin-state. But I lost the vote.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nI can empathize with O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s dilemma. His father, a World War II\nveteran, graduated from Georgetown. His daughter pleaded to have the same\nopportunity, although his father went on the G.I. Bill. And once you allow\nthe first child to go out-of-state, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to deny the second.\n\n\n\nWe can second-guess the wisdom of the O\xe2\x80\x99Malleys\xe2\x80\x99 decision, and I do. But\nnow that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made it, I hope the family \xe2\x80\x94 given their public platform \xe2\x80\x94\nwill use their experience as a cautionary tale that, for most families,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not okay to cave to an 18-year-old whose dreams of a particular\ncollege will create decades of debt.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hold us up as a metaphor of every family,\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Malley said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are very lucky in that both of us are working and hopefully will\ncontinue to work. I think one thing that is true for all of us as\nAmericans, it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for our country or our economy to saddle\n[families] with the sort of debt that we have. A lot of families don\xe2\x80\x99t have\nthe ability to go into that sort of debt.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nTotal outstanding student loan debt has reached $1.3 trillion. When we talk\nabout the student-loan crisis, we mostly focus on the amount of debt being\naccumulated by students. But there\xe2\x80\x99s not enough emphasis on the amount\nparents are borrowing. PLUS loans for parents have reached almost $69\nbillion, according to Department of Education data.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter we have the debt than [our children] have the debt,\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Malley said.\n\n\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a sentiment many parents hold. And even as public servants, the\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malleys (Katie O\xe2\x80\x99Malley is a Baltimore District Court judge) may be able\nto manage the debt load. But are other families really thinking through\nwhether they can?\n\n\n\nAs Consumers Union points out, PLUS loans, which are also available for\ngraduate students, have much higher borrowing limits. The organization, in\na letter urging the Department of Education not to lower borrowing\nstandards for PLUS loans, made some important observations.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLoans to graduate students are made on the promise that they will see an\nincrease in salary from their educational attainment that enables them to\nrepay the loans they borrowed,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Suzanne Martindale, a staff attorney\nfor Consumers Union. \xe2\x80\x9cParents, on the other hand, do not see an increase in\ntheir incomes from their children\xe2\x80\x99s education. . . . They have no guarantee\nthat their children will help pay the loans back, or will even finish\nschool. For these reasons, allowing parents to borrow many thousands of\ndollars in PLUS loans raises unique concerns.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve heard promises on the campaign trail this year about helping families\nafford college. And we do need some legislative intervention so that many\npeople won\xe2\x80\x99t be priced out of a college education.\n\n\n\nBut we also need to press upon parents and their children that dreams can\ncome true without going to colleges that result in a heavy debt load.\n\n\n\nAs we wrapped up our conversation, I asked O\xe2\x80\x99Malley an obvious question.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the plan for their sons?\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope to make a compelling argument with them to choose more affordable\noptions for their parents,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI may put your column under their\npillows.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHey, governor, I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to do an in-person intervention.\n\n\n\n*Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s comeback plot\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/martin-omalley-2016-strategy-policy-119963.html?ml=tl_1>\n// Politico // Jonathan Topaz and Gabriel Debenedetti \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nMartin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, stuck in low single digits in national and early-state\npolls, has embarked on an aggressive strategy to out-wonk his rivals,\nsending out a flood of super-specific policy proposals on Wall Street and\nclimate change and more.\n\n\n\nBut fellow Democrats who themselves have slogged through long-shot\ncampaigns aren\xe2\x80\x99t sold.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not going to grab voters\xe2\x80\x99 attentions,\xe2\x80\x9d said 2008 presidential\ncandidate and former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, of O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s policy\nproposals.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMartin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s challenge is this: why him and not Hillary Clinton?\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no good reason,\xe2\x80\x9d said Steve Murphy, who was Dick Gephardt\xe2\x80\x99s\ncampaign manager in 2004.\n\nThe contrast between O\xe2\x80\x99Malley and his rivals can be jarring.\n\n\n\nOn the same day that Bernie Sanders rallied nearly 8,000 raucous supporters\nin Portland, Maine, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley was on Haitian radio discussing the\nhumanitarian crisis in the Dominican Republic.\n\n\n\nAnd while the political world had its eyes fixed on Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s first\nnationally televised interview this week, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley was readying to detail\npolicy proposals on debt-free college and financial regulation.\n\n\n\nRunning a distant third behind a popular, entrenched front-runner in\nClinton and a surging liberal firebrand in Sanders, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley \xe2\x80\x94 whose camp\nalways assumed he would be the progressive alternative in the race \xe2\x80\x94 is\nhoping that he can grab voters\xe2\x80\x99 attention by staking out deeply specific\nand deeply liberal positions on issues other candidates have yet to weigh\nin on.\n\n\n\nLast month, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley released a white paper on climate change that vowed to\ntransition to 100 percent clean energy by 2050 \xe2\x80\x94 a bold plan that earned\nthe praise of billionaire Democratic donor and environmentalist Tom Steyer\n(who has longstanding ties to Clinton and already hosted a fundraiser for\nher).\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, he put forth a plan to increase Pell Grants and offer\ndebt-free public higher education within five years. A day later, he\nreleased a set of financial regulatory proposals that would, in part, put a\ngreater emphasis on criminal prosecution on Wall Street and institute a\nthree-year revolving door ban on regulators and Wall Street firms.\n\n\n\nAnd early next week, the campaign \xe2\x80\x94 which has placed significant emphasis\non immigration early in the campaign \xe2\x80\x94 will release a similarly detailed\npolicy rollout on that issue.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, he has also pushed hard on a series of issues that are far from\nthe front of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s and Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 minds. His statement on providing some\nrelief for Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s debt crisis came days before Clinton or Sanders\nweighed in, and he remains the only candidate to talk about the crisis in\nthe Dominican Republic. To his team, such issues are moral ones that\ndistinguish O\xe2\x80\x99Malley from his supposedly more poll-driven competitors.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s advisers say his attempt to dig in on progressive policy will\nput him in a strong position in the early-voting states when it comes time\nfor caucus- and primary-goers to actually make up their mind.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to be policy-heavy,\xe2\x80\x9d said top O\xe2\x80\x99Malley strategist Bill Hyers.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur plan is to do a bunch of policy and have him in Iowa rolling out his\nplans \xe2\x80\x94 talking about them in Iowa and New Hampshire. That\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99ll\ngrind it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHyers concedes that the candidate is a virtual unknown \xe2\x80\x94 70 percent of Iowa\nDemocrats in a recent Quinnipiac survey said they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know enough about\nhim to make an opinion.\n\n\n\nThe idea, then, is to continue to introduce the candidate to voters by\nstaying the course and being specific on policy, especially as Clinton\ndraws flak for her vague stances on issues like trade and the Iran deal.\nThe campaign is also presenting O\xe2\x80\x99Malley as more of a heavyweight than\nSanders, who harbors a radical past.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lived through Howard Dean. Al Cranston won the Wisconsin straw poll in\n84,\xe2\x80\x9d added Hyers \xe2\x80\x94 an implicit jab at Sanders, whom several Democrats have\ncompared to Dean and Cranston, who ultimately flamed out after hot starts.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBruce Babbitt was hot in Iowa. It was Joe Biden at some point. That\xe2\x80\x99s the\nfun of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut Sanders has hardly been vague himself. Forcing specificity from Clinton\nwas a core plank of his strategy from the start, as he \xe2\x80\x94 like O\xe2\x80\x99Malley \xe2\x80\x94\nhas refused to go after the front-runner by name with attack ads.\n\n\n\nSanders, for example, has said that he wants to raise top marginal tax\nrates to above 50 percent. He was one of the leaders in Congress leading\nagainst fast-track authority and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He has\nreleased a proposal on paid sick leave and a 40-hour work week. And since\nlaunching his candidacy, he\xe2\x80\x99s introduced legislation to break up so-called\nToo Big to Fail banks and provide tuition-free college at four-year public\ncolleges.\n\n\n\nStaking out his own position, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley offered some criticism for the\nlatter plan on Wednesday, saying \xe2\x80\x94 again without naming Sanders \xe2\x80\x94 that\naddressing tuition alone wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough.\n\n\n\nBut the liberal former governor is hardly a red-in-the-face\nanti-establishment crusader like the Vermont legislator, despite his\npenchant for railing against Wall Street.\n\nHaving developed a name for himself back in Maryland as a data-driven\nexecutive, the policy roll-outs fit his style better than the massive\nrallies Sanders has been headlining across the country.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSanders is basically seen as the anti-establishment candidate,\xe2\x80\x9d explained\nRichardson, who found himself far behind Clinton and Obama \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention\nJohn Edwards \xe2\x80\x94 early in the 2008 race. The New Mexican said he had reviewed\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s climate plan, and that he has discussed foreign policy with the\nMarylander as recently as a month ago. \xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x99Malley is seen as the progressive\nestablishment candidate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nUnaffiliated Democratic strategists who\xe2\x80\x99ve run previous long-shot campaigns\naren\xe2\x80\x99t convinced that O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s in a position to catch up to Clinton, or\neven Sanders. No number of wonky or lefty policy roll-outs can make up for\nhis name recognition or polling deficits, they say \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention the\nfact that there\xe2\x80\x99s little room on the left as the front-runner continues to\nwork to win over the liberal base. And O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s organization in Iowa,\nwhere caucus mechanisms must be built months in advance, lags as well.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s put it this way, this strategy would not get him a spot on the\nRepublican debate stage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gina Glantz, who ran Bill Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s 2000\nlong-shot campaign against Al Gore.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s doing exactly the same thing,\xe2\x80\x9d added Murphy, referring to Clinton.\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s addressing one issue after the other in comprehensive fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNonetheless, while many Democrats are skeptical of O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s ability to\npass Sanders anytime soon, Richardson counseled patience.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the Bernie Sanders boomlet develop,\xe2\x80\x9d he advised. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t stop it\nanyway, for now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*How O\xe2\x80\x99Malley Would Let Private Lenders Back Into Federal Student Loans\n<http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasondelisle/2015/07/10/how-omalley-would-let-private-lenders-back-into-federal-student-loans/>\n// Forbes // Jason Delisle \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nPresident Obama won a major victory by kicking banks out of the federal\nstudent loan program in 2010. It was no-brainer good policy. Now Governor\nMartin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley is proposing to let the same banks into the program through\nthe back door. And expensive colleges are likely to pick up a little cash\nas part of the deal.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley wants to let people with private student loans convert them to\nfederal student loans. The plan is a little light on details (there\xe2\x80\x99s only\none sentence on his campaign webpage) but we can assume it works like this.\nYou have a private student loan. You file an application with the U.S.\nDepartment of Education to \xe2\x80\x9crefinance\xe2\x80\x9d your private loan into a federal\nloan. The federal government pays off your lender and issues you a new loan\nwith the same balance. This loan now has a lower interest rate and you can\nrepay it through income-based repayment or any other repayment plan the\ngovernment offers.\n\n\n\nHere is why expensive colleges will like the plan. It makes the limits\nlawmakers placed on the amount undergraduates can borrow each year in\nfederal loans moot. The federal loan program doesn\xe2\x80\x99t let undergraduates\nborrow an unlimited amount of money for a variety of good reasons (Parent\nPLUS loans not withstanding). But under Governor O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s plan students\nwould max out federal loans and then take out even more private loans. Then\nthey would promptly convert the private loans to federal student loans.\nThat would allow them to enroll in income-based repayment and make progress\ntoward having their erstwhile private student loan forgiven at the expense\nof taxpayers. Few policies would drive tuition up more.\n\n\n\nPrivate lenders are big winners, too. Private lenders do not make loans to\nanyone at any school. They underwrite, trying to gauge who is likely to\nrepay, who is a good bet, etc. But under Governor O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s plan they can\nsafely get out of the underwriting business and make loans to everyone. If\na borrower gets behind on payments the lender can inform him of the\nwonderful benefits of refinancing his loan into the federal loan program.\nHeck, they might even pay him to do so. The federal student loan program\ncan provide him no-questions-asked forbearance or loan forgiveness through\nincome-based repayment.\n\n\n\nIn finance lingo, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley is selling private lenders a put option on every\nloan they make \xe2\x80\x94 taxpayers bear 100 percent of the risk on each and every\nloan. Make a bad loan; put it to the government at face value. In fact,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s a lot like how the federal loan program used to work when banks made\nloans with full government guarantees.\n\n\n\nGovernor O\xe2\x80\x99Malley may be the only progressive who wants taxpayers\nguaranteeing student loans again. Sadly, some Republican candidates might\nactually get behind this idea.\n\n\n\n*O\xe2\x80\x99Malley to speak at candidate forum in Des Moines\n<https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#label/Clips/14e7962bc5f3e3e8> // Des\nMoines Register // Jason Noble \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley will speak in Des Moines\non July 24 as part of a bipartisan series of candidate forums.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley is the former governor of Maryland and one of several declared\ncandidates for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\n\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll appear at 11:30 on July 24 at the State Historical Building in\ndowntown Des Moines.

Earlier this year, the parents of one of the 12 innocent people\nkilled during the Aurora movie theater shooting, they saw their lawsuit to\nhold ammunition sellers liable for the attack, they saw that dismissed. And\none of the reasons was a law that you voted for, which protects\nmanufacturers of firearms and ammunition from being sued. Why did you vote\nthat way?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): \xe2\x80\x9cNow, the issues that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about is,\nif somebody has a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer, and that\nmurderer kills somebody with the gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer\nresponsible? Not anymore than you would hold a hammer company responsible\nif somebody beat somebody over the head with a hammer. That is not what a\nlawsuit should be about.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 exchange during a CNN interview, July 5, 2015\n\n\n\nSanders\xe2\x80\x99s answer, which came after an aside about the low grade the\nNational Rifle Association gave him and the need for a sensible debate on\ngun control, was circulated online amid growing attention to his record on\ngun issues. His vote on the 2005 law is one of the key criticisms from\nDemocrats about his record.\n\n\n\nSanders, an Independent running for the Democratic presidential nomination,\ncharacterized the law as providing immunity for gun manufacturers from\nbeing sued when a gun is misused by a third party. It\xe2\x80\x99s as if a hammer\nmanufacturer were to be held responsible if someone used the hammer to beat\nsomeone else, he said.\n\n\n\nClearly, there is a difference between using a gun and using a hammer as a\nweapon. Our goal is not to nitpick or play gotcha, but rather explore the\ntypes of protection a gun manufacturer has under this law that would not\napply to other consumer-goods manufacturers \xe2\x80\x94 hammer or otherwise. How\naccurate is Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s characterization?\n\n\n\nThe Facts\n\n\n\nCongress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act in 2005 after\na wave of lawsuits filed against gun manufacturers by municipalities and\ngun-control advocates. Some of this can get technical, so bear with us.\n\n\n\nVictims accused manufacturers of creating \xe2\x80\x9cpublic nuisance\xe2\x80\x9d and not doing\nenough to ensure safe distribution of guns or prevent the flow of guns into\nillegal markets. They alleged that manufacturers were oversupplying the\nindustry (and therefore knew that some of the guns would end up on the\nblack market) and that they marketed the guns by promoting attributes that\ncould be associated with criminal activities.\n\n\n\nAdvocates for gunmakers argued that these lawsuits threatened Second\nAmendment rights and that law-abiding manufacturers should not be held\nliable for criminal actions of individuals. They pushed for the 2005 law,\nwhich generally shielded manufacturers and sellers of firearms and\nammunition from civil lawsuits \xe2\x80\x9cresulting from criminal or unlawful misuse\xe2\x80\x9d\nof their product by a third party.\n\n\n\nThe law\xe2\x80\x99s proponents, including the NRA, argued it was necessary to block\nbaseless lawsuits that threatened to bankrupt the firearms industry.\nOpponents said it gave unprecedented blanket immunity and took away\nconsumer rights. The Fact Checker takes no position on the law.\n\n\n\nThe bill passed the House (where Sanders was at the time) 223 to 140, with\n59 Democrats voting with the majority.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, just five years earlier, the Clinton administration had\nreached an unprecedented deal with a major gun manufacturer, Smith &\nWesson, to adopt safety measures. The agreement nearly ruined the company,\nas revenues declined 40 percent within a year amid an NRA boycott and\ncriticism from gun advocates.\n\n\n\nThe 2005 law does not guarantee blanket immunity, and it has some\nexceptions. Manufacturers or dealers can be sued if they knowingly sold a\nproduct that would be used to commit a crime. They can be sued if they were\nnegligent in selling the product to someone they knew was unfit (i.e., a\nchild or someone who was drunk). They can be sued for another technical\nnegligence claim (\xe2\x80\x9cnegligence per se\xe2\x80\x9d) that relates to the violation of a\nsafety statute. The law bars any other type of negligence claims against a\ngun manufacturer.\n\n\n\nStill, it provides a unique federal legal shield that most consumer goods\nmanufacturers do not have.\n\n\n\nNegligence claims in tort law allow consumers to sue for negligence caused\nby carelessness, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always involve a violation of the law or\nknowingly entrusting someone unfit to handle the product, said Timothy\nLytton, a Georgia State University law professor who specializes in tort\nlaw and gun policies. (For example, doctors can be sued for carelessness\nand negligence in medical malpractice. You can sue a supermarket if you\nslip and are injured, and the market did not display a \xe2\x80\x9cwet floor\xe2\x80\x9d sign.)\n\n\n\nWhile the law allows victims to sue if there was a design defect or a\nmalfunction with the gun, there have been exceptions. For example, the\nIllinois Supreme Court in 2009 cited the law in dismissing a case where a\nyoung boy playing with his father\xe2\x80\x99s gun accidentally shot and killed his\nfriend. The victim\xe2\x80\x99s family sued the gun manufacturer, saying the gun did\nnot have proper safety features or proper warnings. The court found the\nplaintiffs did not fit the technical definition in the exception.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the gun is defectively designed so that when fired it explodes and\ninjures the shooter\xe2\x80\x99s hand, they can sue for that. The suit that\xe2\x80\x99s barred\nis by a crime victim who wants to say that a different design could have\nprevented or mitigated the crime,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kermit Roosevelt III, a University\nof Pennsylvania constitutional law professor specializing in Second\nAmendment and gun-control laws.\n\n\n\nFew industries have federal liability immunity. Vaccine manufacturers have\nlimited protection from lawsuits if their vaccine led to an injury. The\nfederal government enacted this immunity to encourage companies to produce\nmore vaccines without the fear of lawsuits, for their benefit to public\nhealth. Another example is federal protection for the airline industry from\nlawsuits arising from the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. But unlike the gun law,\nboth cases established a compensation scheme for victims to recover money\nfor damages.\n\n\n\nWhile the law provides protections that no other industry has, courts have\nbeen reluctant to impose liability on manufacturers for third-party misuse\nof the product, said John Goldberg, Harvard Law School professor who\nspecializes in product liability. So the types of lawsuits that Sanders\nmentioned (for hammers or guns) didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a slam-dunk chance in court\nbefore this law came about. Instead, this law ensures that those types of\nlawsuits can\xe2\x80\x99t be brought against gun manufacturers.\n\n\n\nSanders\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman, Michael Briggs, said in a statement: \xe2\x80\x9cBernie\xe2\x80\x99s\nposition is that a manufacturer should not be held liable for the illegal\nand unintended use of its product.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\n\n\nAs Sanders says, under the 2005 law, gun manufacturers are not held\nresponsible if a murderer uses their gun to kill someone. But it does more\nthan that. It gives broad protections to gun manufacturers, including for\nnegligence, and can protect them from being sued in certain types of claims\nrelating to the gun\xe2\x80\x99s design. The Illinois case is one example where this\nimmunity was cited to dismiss a lawsuit over the safety features of a gun\nthat was accidentally fired by a boy. That type of technical protection\nwould not apply to someone using a hammer.\n\n\n\nFurther, Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s comparison makes it seem as if this lawsuit came about\nsolely because people were suing gun manufacturers for making guns that\nsomehow fell in the hands of criminals. But that is not exactly the case.\nAdvocates and cities were suing manufacturers alleging their actions were\nincreasing the risk that guns would fall into criminal hands. The gun\nindustry then responded with legislation to shut down those lawsuits.\nSanders\xe2\x80\x99s statement is misleading and a simplification of this complex case.\n\n\n\nTwo Pinocchios\n\n\n\n*Sanders Makes Play for Caucus States\n<http://www.wsj.com/articles/sanders-makes-play-for-caucus-states-1436550252>\n// WSJ // Peter Nicholas \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has been showing up in unexpected places:\nColorado, Maine and Minnesota, states that seldom see a candidate at this\nearly point in a presidential-primary campaign.\n\n\n\nDrawing large, boisterous crowds, Mr. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s travel itinerary may seem a\nquixotic hunt for the most liberal pockets of the Democratic Party that\nrelish his anti-Wall Street, pro-tax-and-spend messages. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\n\n\nMr. Sanders is making a play for caucus states rather than traditional\nprimaries. His goal is to mobilize his passionate, grass-roots backers and\nrack up enough delegates to pose a real challenge to Hillary Clinton. It is\na tactic President Barack Obama successfully used against Mrs. Clinton in\n2008, which raises the bar for Mr. Sanders. Can he pull off a repeat?\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99ve thought about for a while,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tad Devine, an\nadviser to the Sanders campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cA few thousand people can make a big\ndifference in those early caucus states, so that\xe2\x80\x99s a big part of the\nstrategy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOf the 57 states and territories that will hold contests in the Democratic\nprimary, about one-third use caucuses to determine the winner. Last month,\nMr. Sanders spoke to almost 5,000 people in Colorado, a state tentatively\nset to hold its caucus on March 1. He addressed more than 7,500 people\nearlier this week in Maine, where a caucus is now set for March 6.\n\n\n\nCraig Hughes, a Democratic strategist who served as a Colorado senior\nadviser to Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s two presidential bids, said the Sanders strategy\nmakes sense, though it isn\xe2\x80\x99t at all certain he can parlay the early\nenthusiasm into concrete support in the caucuses.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you saw in Denver was a very large crowd for Sanders, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see\nmuch ability to grow that for him as I see the potential for Hillary here,\xe2\x80\x9d\nMr. Hughes said.\n\n\n\nIowa, the state that kicks off the nomination contests, is also a caucus\nstate, and Mr. Sanders is spending ample time and money there, too. After\ncollecting $15 million in campaign donations in the last quarter, he has\nhired 27 people in Iowa, compared with five in New Hampshire, which holds a\ntraditional primary election. Mrs. Clinton, who raised three times as much\nas Mr. Sanders in that same time frame, has 47 organizers on the ground in\nIowa.\n\n\n\nIn his book about the 2008 campaign, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Audacity to Win,\xe2\x80\x9d former Obama\nCampaign Manager David Plouffe wrote that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Clinton campaign was\nessentially ceding caucus states.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNot this time, her advisers said.\n\n\n\nOne of her most important hires may turn out to be Jeff Berman, who helped\nexecute the 2008 Obama campaign\xe2\x80\x99s strategy of capitalizing on the often\narcane caucus rules to maximize his delegate take.\n\n\n\nAsked to contrast the present-day Clinton campaign with the 2008 model, one\nsenior campaign manager ruefully made the point that this time around, Team\nClinton grasps that caucus states can\xe2\x80\x99t be ignored because\xe2\x80\x94no less than\nstates that hold primaries\xe2\x80\x94they help candidates amass the delegates needed\nto clinch the nomination.\n\n\n\nPaul Begala, a Democratic strategist who is now part of the pro-Clinton\nsuper PAC Priorities USA Action, recalled Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s decision to fly\naround Iowa in a helicopter at one point in the 2008 race. \xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nhave had a worse way to approach Iowans than flying around in a helicopter\nlike the Queen of England,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Begala said.\n\n\n\nIn April, after announcing her candidacy, Mrs. Clinton visited Iowa before\nany other state, eschewing a chartered helicopter and opting for a road\ntrip from her New York home in a van she dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cScooby-Doo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn an interview with CNN this week, Mrs. Clinton said: \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the things\nthat I learned last time is it\xe2\x80\x99s organize, organize, organize.\xe2\x80\x9d She now has\na supporter in each of Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s 1,682 election precincts, the campaign said.\n\n\n\nStill, Mr. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s large crowds have raised worries inside the Clinton\ncamp. Rightly so, said Troy Jackson, a Maine Democrat. In 2008, he backed\nMrs. Clinton; now he supports Mr. Sanders. \xe2\x80\x9cObama never had crowds like\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\n*Bernie defends Jeb\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98longer hours\xe2\x80\x99 comment\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/bernie-sanders-jeb-bush-longer-hours-comment-react-119948.html?hp=l3_4>\n// Politico // Nick Gass\xe2\x80\x94July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders on Friday defended Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s remarks that Americans need to\nwork longer hours, acknowledging that Bush was \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely correct\xe2\x80\x9d if he\nwas referring to the need for more full-time jobs than part-time jobs.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course we need full-time jobs rather than part-time jobs, but to\nsuggest that people have got to work harder \xe2\x80\x94Chris, here\xe2\x80\x99s the fact: People\nin the United States of America today are working the longest hours of a\npeople of any major industrialized countries,\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders said in an interview\non CNN\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cNew Day\xe2\x80\x9d with Chris Cuomo.\n\n\n\nBush came under fire from his presidential race rivals, including Hillary\nClinton and Sanders, for his comments late Wednesday, which reminded some\nof Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c47 percent\xe2\x80\x9d moment.\n\n\n\nBut Bush quickly clarified that he was referring the millions of people who\nwant full-time employment and can\xe2\x80\x99t find it, and has found some success in\ndefusing the situation.\n\n\n\nIn the interview on Friday morning, Sanders also acknowledged that he will\nnot be able to avoid having every part of his personal life scrutinized as\nhe runs for the Democratic presidential nomination. But politicians and the\nmedia should not turn it into a soap opera, he said.\n\n\n\nThe self-described democratic socialist candidate addressed a POLITICO\nMagazine article in which Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs confirmed that\nSanders had his only son Levi in a relationship outside of his first\nmarriage.\n\n\n\nThe United States, Sanders said, \xe2\x80\x9cfaces enormous problems, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s\nincumbent upon political leaders and the media to focus on those issues and\nnot make politics into a soap opera.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe also partially defended Democratic rival Hillary Clinton against what he\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cunjustified attacks,\xe2\x80\x9d urging a focus on the issues rather than the\npeople. At the same time, Sanders noted his policy differences with the\nformer secretary of state and his former Senate colleague.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am prepared to break up the large financial institutions because I feel\nthat Wall Street has too much power. She has not been clear on that. So you\nknow, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be beating her up and attacking her in personal\nways,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI like her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*The One Point on Which Bernie Sanders Agrees With Jeb Bush\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-10/the-one-point-on-which-bernie-sanders-agrees-with-jeb-bush>\n// Bloomberg // Arit John \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nNews flash: Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders just said\nRepublican presidential rival Jeb Bush is right about something. Sort of.\n\n\n\nOne day after saying Bush "does not seem to understand what is happening in\nour economy today," Sanders, Vermont\'s democratic socialist senator,\ngrudgingly acknowledged Friday that he may actually agree on at least one\naspect of the former Florida governor\'s views.\n\n\n\nAt issue: Bush\'s much-discussed interview with the New Hampshire Union\nLeader editorial board on Wednesday in which Bush said that improving the\neconomy means "that people need to work longer hours and through their\nproductivity gain more income for their families."\n\n\n\nOn Friday, CNN\'s "New Day" host Chris Cuomo asked Sanders if he\'d been\nunfair, given that Bush seemed to be talking about the need for more\nfull-time jobs, as opposed to part-time work.\n\n\n\n"Of course we need full time jobs rather than part time jobs, but to\nsuggest that people have gotta work harder..." Sanders said, adding that\nAmericans work some of the longest hours of any major industrialized\ncountry. "So what we need to do is raise wages and income not force our\npeople, who are already stressed out by long hours, to work even more\nhours."\n\n\n\nCuomo pushed him, and said that Sanders needed to be "consistent" if he\nwanted to stay above the board of dirty politics.\n\n\n\n"Well if he is talking about the need for more full-time jobs rather than\npart-time jobs he\'s absolutely correct. That\'s what we have to do," Sanders\nsaid.\n\n\n\nIn an earlier statement released after Bush\'s comment, Sanders said that\n"[u]nfortunately ... Gov. Bush does not seem to understand what is\nhappening in our economy today." Hillary Clinton also criticized Bush in a\ntweet:\n\n\n\nBush pushed back on Thursday. "You can take it out of context all you want,\nbut high sustained growth means people work 40 hours rather than 30 hours\nand that by our success they have disposable income for their families to\ndecide how they want to spend it rather than standing in line and being\ndependent upon government," he said.\n\n\n\nSanders was less willing to go after Hillary Clinton. Cuomo mentioned that\nClinton has "trust issues"\xe2\x80\x94specifically, a June CNN poll found that 57\npercent of Americans don\'t consider her to be honest and trustworthy.\n\n\n\n"Look, I have known Hillary Clinton for 25 years. I respect her. I like\nher," Sanders said. His criticism of her lies with her stances, or lack of\nstances, on issues like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and breaking up large\nfinancial institutions.\n\n\n\nThe interview also touched on a new Politico profile, which reports that\nSanders has a son born out of wedlock. Cuomo asked Sanders if he thinks he\ncan continue to run his campaign without opening up more about his personal\nlife.\n\n\n\nSanders said he couldn\'t avoid it, but would rather focus on the issues,\ngiven the problems the country is facing. "I think it\'s incumbent on\npolitical leaders and media to focus on those issues and not make politics\ninto a soap opera," he said.\n\n\n\n*Sanders dings Bush on work, ducks personal questions\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/10/politics/bernie-sanders-jeb-bush-work-hours/index.html>\n// CNN // Tom LoBianco \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nDemocratic candidate Bernie Sanders hit Republican contender Jeb Bush for\nhis comments on the productivity of American workers and said he was best\npositioned to take on the nation\'s "billionaire class" if elected president.\n\n\n\nThe Vermont senator, who identifies as a Democratic socialist, said that 85\npercent of men and 65 percent of women are working more than 40 hours a\nweek.\n\n\n\n"So what we need to do is raise wages and income, not force more people,\nwho are already stressed out by long hours, to work even more hours,"\nSanders said on CNN\'s "New Day".\n\n\n\nJeb Bush told The Union Leader in New Hampshire Wednesday that "people need\nto work longer hours", which quickly drew a blast from frontrunner Hillary\nClinton, who accused Bush of not understanding how hard Americans already\nwork.\n\n\n\nThe Bush team explained his comments were taken out of context and said he\nmeant that more part-time workers need full time jobs.\n\n\n\nWhen pressed on if he was twisting Bush\'s comments, which Bush has said\nwere about the availability of good full time jobs an not about American\nwork ethic, Sanders relented.\n\n\n\n"If he is talking about the need for more full time jobs than part time\njobs he is absolutely correct," Sanders said.\n\n\n\nSanders has been gaining ground on frontrunner Hillary Clinton steadily, as\nthe liberal wing of the Democratic party has coalesced behind him. As he\nhas inched forward, personal questions from his past have bubbled up in\nmedia.\n\n\n\nAsked about a Politico story on the child he had out of wedlock almost 40\nyears ago, Sanders deflected, saying he wanted to focus instead on issues.\nCNN\'s Chris Cuomo asked Sanders if he believed he could avoid personal\nscrutiny while running for president.\n\n\n\n"I\'m not being na\xc3\xafve, I understand it, yes," Sanders said. "No, no, I don\'t\nthink I can avoid it. But this this country faces enormous problems and I\nthink it\'s incumbent upon political leaders and the media to focus on those\nissues and not make politics into a soap opera."\n\n\n\n*Bernie Sanders: The Cable Bill Is Too Damn High\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/10/bernie-sanders-cable_n_7772806.html>\n// HuffPo // Zach Carter \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nSens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter\non Friday accusing big cable companies of using monopoly powers to muscle\nconsumers into paying higher prices.\n\n\n\nIn the letter, addressed to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom\nWheeler, Sanders and Warren wrote that mega-mergers have left over 60\npercent of Americans with no choice whatsoever when it comes to their cable\nand Internet providers. This state of things, they wrote, makes it possible\nfor companies to jack up prices without losing customers to competition.\nSens. Al Franken (D-Minn.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) also signed the letter.\n\n\n\n"As the telecommunications industry becomes increasingly concentrated, this\nlack of choice has resulted in huge price increases and often poor service\nfor consumers," the senators wrote. "There are now de facto\ntelecommunications monopolies throughout the United States."\n\n\n\nThe letter noted that a new merger between Time Warner Cable and Charter\nCommunications would only exacerbate the problem, saying that recent Time\nWarner price increases suggest the cable giant is already insulated from\nnormal market pressures. Modem rental charges for Time Warner have jumped\n203 percent since they were introduced in 2012, according to the letter.\nThe FCC has the power to block the TWC-Charter deal.\n\n\n\n"Given the lack of incentive for companies to provide better quality\nservice and competitive prices, it is no surprise that individuals rank\ncable and Internet providers last in customer satisfaction when compared to\nother companies in other industries," the senators wrote.\n\n\n\nSanders and his colleagues asked for the FCC to publish a host of cable and\nbroadband pricing data, so consumers could see how much they pay compared\nto customers in other areas. They asked the FCC to provide average prices\nfor each state and each cable provider, and also asked the agency to\npublicize the average prices in urban areas compared to those in rural\nmarkets.\n\n\n\n*Bernie Sanders: Income Tax Proposal To Come \xe2\x80\x9cIn Two Or Three Weeks\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/christophermassie/sanders-says-income-tax-proposal-to-come-in-two-three-weeks#.tc3Pav34Y>\n// BuzzFeed // Christopher Massie \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders said on Friday that he would have a concrete proposal for an\nincome tax rate on the highest earners \xe2\x80\x9cin two or three weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidate was discussing legislation he has\nintroduced as a senator from Vermont that he says \xe2\x80\x9cwould end this business\nof companies being able to store their profits in the Cayman Islands\xe2\x80\x9d and\ntax \xe2\x80\x9cWall Street speculation,\xe2\x80\x9d when he was asked to name his preferred tax\nrate on the upper echelon of individual incomes.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re working on that,\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders said on a New Hampshire radio station.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk me that question in two or three weeks, I will give you a definitive\nanswer. How\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn late May, Sanders said that, under the Eisenhower administration, the\ntop tax rate \xe2\x80\x9cwas something like 90 percent,\xe2\x80\x9d and said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that\nwas necessarily too high a rate to reinstate.\n\n\n\nIn June, Sanders alluded to \xe2\x80\x9ca comprehensive tax package\xe2\x80\x9d his team was\nworking on and said he suspected that it would, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the top marginal\nrates, go over 50 percent.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the interview on Friday, Sanders said that the plan to be released in\nthe coming weeks would \xe2\x80\x9cask the rich to pay a higher tax rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn general, what I can tell you is that when Warren Buffett tells us that\nhe pays an effective tax rate lower than his secretaries or lower than\nnurses, there\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong with our tax system,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after again\nrefusing to give a specific number. \xe2\x80\x9cSo yes, my proposal will ask the\nwealthiest people in this country, who, by and large, are doing\nphenomenally well right now, while the middle class is disappearing, yes, I\nwill ask the rich to pay a higher tax rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Bernie Sanders Is The Left\xe2\x80\x99s Trump\n<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/11/bernie-sanders-is-the-left-s-trump.html>\n// Daily Beast // Ana Marie Cox \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders is the Left\xe2\x80\x99s Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nBear with me here. There is a lot they don\xe2\x80\x99t have in common, including\nwhere they stand in their respective party\xe2\x80\x99s polls\xe2\x80\x94though Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 slow\ncreep into a distant second is likely to be more sustainable. Still, they\nhave both managed to disrupt their respective nomination races, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve\ndone that because they both have a similar appeal: They\xe2\x80\x99ve tapped into\nanti-establishment passions with rhetoric that is a kind of\nwish-fulfillment fantasy for some voters. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has the guts to say what\nothers won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d could be the slogan for either of them.\n\n\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to gloss over the content of that gut-driven bluntness. In\nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s case, just because he\xe2\x80\x99s saying what others won\xe2\x80\x99t doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean what\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s saying is true. And it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to point out that Trump\xe2\x80\x99s\nlowest-common-denominator xenophobia is a sugar high kind populism: it\xe2\x80\x99s\ncheap and easily reproduced but difficult to sustain. Sanders, on the other\nhand, offers a chewier and less visceral version of \xe2\x80\x9cus-versus-them\xe2\x80\x9d:\ndiscussions about income inequality and financial regulatory policy don\xe2\x80\x99t\ncreate the same kind of direct line to voters\xe2\x80\x99 emotions that Trump\xe2\x80\x99s talk\nof rapists and thieves travels on.\n\n\n\nThe media is covering them in a similar fashion, too, though that\xe2\x80\x99s mainly\na function of how the political media cover campaigns in general. The story\nis the process, not the messages or ideas. \xe2\x80\x9cAnalysis\xe2\x80\x9d consists of asking,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat this will do the race?\xe2\x80\x9d and not, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it mean for voters?\xe2\x80\x9d\nGranted, only one of the candidates in question has ideas to cover. Indeed,\nSanders reliance on a few big ideas\xe2\x80\x94not personality, not easy outrage\xe2\x80\x94is\none of the reasons coverage of Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 rise has an element of arch\nbemusement. Note The New York Times: \xe2\x80\x9cSomehow, Bernie Sanders, the\n73-year-old senator from Vermont, has emerged as a king of social media.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSomehow!\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we need to just cut to the chase and have a real\nlibertarian/conservative go up against Elizabeth Warren or avowed socialist\nBernie Sanders.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrump coverage, of course, is more straightforwardly mocking (I highly\nrecommend the Trump Chrome extension). While everyone wonders what Trump\xe2\x80\x99s\nrise might do to the GOP race, no one is wondering how it is he got as far\nas he did. Just ask any of the other, \xe2\x80\x9cmore serious\xe2\x80\x9d candidates, whose\nreluctance to criticize Trump proves that his only real divergence from the\nRepublican mainstream is stylistic, not substantive.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, there are real policy differences between Sanders and\nthe Democratic leadership\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s why he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a Democrat until recently,\nafter all. Moderate Democrats have been denouncing Sanders with a vigor\nconspicuously absent from the intraparty Trump conversation: Missouri\nSenator Claire McCaskill complained, \xe2\x80\x9cI very rarely read in any coverage of\nBernie that he\xe2\x80\x99s a socialist\xe2\x80\x9d and declared him \xe2\x80\x9ctoo liberal\xe2\x80\x9d to be\npresident.\n\n\n\nPut it another way: When Democratic base voters flock to Sanders, they are\nexpressing dissatisfaction what current Democratic policies. When\nRepublican base voters flock to Trump, they are expressing dissatisfaction\nwith Republican rhetoric.\n\n\n\nBut I said I was going to talk about what they had in common, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\neasy enough here: whether its rhetorically or policy-wise, Trump and\nSanders supporters are asking their parties to move away from the\ncenter\xe2\x80\x94or, perhaps more clearly stated, away from each other.\n\n\n\nIndeed, there are those on both sides who long for a Trump-Sanders\nmatch-up. It would, on some level, be a battle of caricatures\xe2\x80\x94as defined by\nthe opposing side. And what about the Democrats who would love to see Trump\nget the nomination? And Republicans who\xe2\x80\x99d like to see Sanders? They\nenvision that contest as referendum more than an election, a chance to\nfinally and fatally eject the other side from the political spectrum. As\nGlenn Beck put it recently: \xe2\x80\x9cI think we need to just cut to the chase and\nhave a real libertarian/conservative go up against Elizabeth Warren or\navowed socialist Bernie Sanders. This country could finally make up its\nmind based on two honest and completely different visions of the future of\nthis country.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA nation born of revolution is given to absolutes, of course. (\xe2\x80\x9cGive me\nliberty or give me death,\xe2\x80\x9d no middle ground, etc.) But the Founders never\nthought we\xe2\x80\x99d be using those words against each other. Beck and others frame\nthe prospect of two extremists as a contest of \xe2\x80\x9cvisions\xe2\x80\x9d but both sides are\nactually color blind: Everything is black and white. One side is totally\nwrong; one side is totally right. This zero-sum mentality and vengeful\nnihilism threaten to turn government into just another WWE show, a cage\nmatch of ideologies.\n\n\n\nLeft unspoken in these hyperbolic hypotheticals is what happens if the\nother guy\xe2\x80\x99s caricature wins. That 50-50 chance of total validation is just\ntoo blinding, I guess. But what happens if their own caricature wins, more\noften than not, is just as vague. It\xe2\x80\x99s standard practice to snigger when\nasking a supporter of a fringe candidate (though neither Trump nor Sanders\nare really fringe) what will happen were their dream president actually to\nsit down in the Oval Office. The objectively ridiculous proposition of a\nPresident Sanders or a President Trump actually trying to govern is\nsupposed to destabilize the fantasy.\n\n\n\nBut the attraction of a Sanders or Trump presidency for true believers\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t the opportunity to govern all of us, but the chance to punish the\nrest of us.\n\n\n\nIn June, the South Carolina Highway Patrol honor guard carried the mortal\nremains of the murdered Sen. Clementa Pinckney up the State House steps and\ninto the rotunda.\n\n\n\nMembers of the honor guard flanked the open coffin, spit polished and\nerect, eyes straight ahead in a silent show of respect as thousands of\nmourners filed past. A black cloth had been draped over one of the windows\nto spare anyone who might be offended by the Confederate battle flag flying\nout front.\n\n\n\nA bill called the Heritage Act passed in this very building prevented the\nflag from being lowered even to half-staff, much less taken down without a\ntwo-thirds vote of the legislature.\n\n\n\nBut on Thursday, the legislature voted to do just that and set a 24-hour\ndeadline on having it done.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, the honor guard returned, this this time to lower the\nConfederate battle flag, which had been designed by William Porcher Miles,\na onetime mayor of Charleston who had been a prominent \xe2\x80\x9cfire-eater,\xe2\x80\x9d as the\nmost ardent proponents of slavery and secession leading up to the Civil War\nwere called.\n\n\n\nThe honor guard had performed countless other ceremonies, but this one was\na little different. And they had not been given much time to work out\nexactly how it should go.\n\n\n\nThe flag was being taken down in the first place because it was seen by\nmany people\xe2\x80\x94African-Americans in particular\xe2\x80\x94as a hateful symbol of slavery\nand oppression. Some rightly view it as a shameful banner of treason.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing was said. I felt like that was appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut it had been hoisted there in the first place because it is viewed by\nothers\xe2\x80\x94none of them African-Americans\xe2\x80\x94as a symbol of an idealized heritage\nand history.\n\n\n\nAnd the very fact that the honor guard had been chosen to lower it was an\nimplicit nod to those people.\n\n\n\nAt the appointed time on Friday morning, the guard went about lowering the\nflag with the same ritualistic respect as it would with the Stars and\nStripes.\n\n\n\nTwo of the officers took the lowered banner in their white gloved hands.\n\n\n\nAnd for a moment, it seemed as if they might fold it as they would an\nAmerican flag that had covered the coffin of a fellow cop or a U.S. solider\nwho had made the supreme sacrifice.\n\n\n\nInstead, they rolled it, presumably an echo of the way Confederate\nregiments furled their battle flags in surrender at the end of the Civil\nWar.\n\n\n\nA black sergeant was the one who then took the furled banner. He had done\nthis at American flag ceremonies where race was not issue, but it was hard\nto believe that he had been chosen by chance in this instance.\n\n\n\nHe seemed to be an attempt to compensate for the bigotry associated with\nwhat he now carried so solemnly over to the State House steps. The director\nof the South Carolina Relic Room and Military Museum waited to receive it.\n\n\n\nFor a second, truly terrible moment, the ritual was too much like that\nperformed when the flag from a hero\xe2\x80\x99s coffin is presented to a grieving\nloved one along with the words, \xe2\x80\x9cOn behalf of a grateful nation.\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThankfully, the sergeant uttered not a word. The director, Allen Roberson,\nwas also silent as he took the furled flag.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing was said,\xe2\x80\x9d Roberson later told The Daily Beast. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt like that\nwas appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRoberson was escorted up into the State House.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just wanted to make sure I didn\xe2\x80\x99t trip when I was carrying the flag,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nrecalled.\n\n\n\nHe then descended to the basement, where an armored car was waiting to\ntransport the flag to the museum.\n\n\n\nUpon arriving, Robeson brought the flag in through a back door. The flag\nwas unrolled, smoothed and carefully folded.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t crease,\xe2\x80\x9d Roberson said.\n\n\n\nThe museum\xe2\x80\x99s registrar, Rachel Cockrell, and an intern named John\nFaulkenberry placed it in an \xe2\x80\x9cacid-free textile storage box, padded with\nacid-free tissue.\xe2\x80\x9d The box was stored in the museum\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csecure,\nclimate-controlled Artifact Storage area.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLocked and alarmed,\xe2\x80\x9d Roberson said.\n\n\n\n150710-daly-confederate-embed\n\nCourtesy of the SC Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum\n\nRoberson dismissed as not entirely accurate reports that there had been a\ntacit agreement as part of a legislative compromise to store the flag in a\nmultimillion-dollar facility funded by the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x94which would include,\nnecessarily, the descendants of slaves.\n\n\n\nHe allowed that there had been some brainstorming with various architects\nand planners, but nothing had been decided and whatever was ultimately done\nwould not likely be so grand.\n\n\n\nHe noted that he has not been able to get added funding for anything in\nrecent years.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur budget has not increased at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nBack at the State House, the flagpole where the banner had flown was now\nbare, but a monument to the Confederate dead remained. The inscription on\nthe north side reads:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis monument\n\nperpetuates the memory,\n\nof those who\n\ntrue to the instincts of their birth,\n\nfaithful to the teachings of their fathers,\n\nconstant in their love for the State,\n\ndied in the performance of their duty:\n\nWho\n\nhave glorified a fallen cause\n\nby the simple manhood of their lives,\n\nthe patient endurance of suffering,\n\nand the heroism of death,\n\nand who,\n\nin the dark house of imprisonment,\n\nin the hopelessness of the hospital,\n\nin the short, sharp agony of the field\n\nfound support and consolation\n\nin the belief\n\nthat at home they would not be forgotten.\n\nUnveiled May 13, 1879\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe fallen cause they glorified included sedition and slavery. The people\nat home included slaves who had suffered horrors that outdid even war.\n\n\n\nThere is also an inscription on the north side:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the stranger,\n\nwho may in the future times\n\nread this inscription,\n\nrecognize that these were men\n\nwhom power could not corrupt,\n\nwhom death could not terrify,\n\nwhom defeat could not dishonor\n\nand let their virtues plead\n\nfor just judgment\n\nof the cause in which they perished.\n\nLet the South Carolinian\n\nof another generation\n\nremember\n\nthat the State taught them\n\nhow to live and how to die.\n\nAnd that from her broken fortunes\n\nshe has preserved for her children\n\nthe priceless treasure of their memories,\n\nteaching all who may claim\n\nthe same birthright\n\nthat truth, courage and patriotism\n\nendure forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe truth is they died fighting to deny fellow human beings the right to\nlife and liberty. Their legacy is racism and hate.\n\n\n\nThe flowery falsehoods on the monument remain, now that the flag has been\ntaken down in somber ceremony with white gloved hands and tucked safely\naway by a very nice museum director in an acid-free box, locked and alarmed.\n\n\n\n*Bernie Sanders is the Ron Paul of 2016\n<http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/247470-bernie-sanders-is-the-ron-paul-of-2016>\n// The Hill // Eddie Zipperer \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is the Ron Paul of the 2016 election \xe2\x80\x94 with his\nenormous crowds, a network of hardcore supporters and an iconoclasm that\nseems to transcend the politics-as-usual establishment.\n\n\n\nBut none of that will be enough to carry him to victory. The fringe\ncandidate drawing huge crowds and surging in the polls because he appeals\nto the party base is nothing new. He\'ll strut and fret his hour upon the\nstage and then be heard no more \xe2\x80\x94 just like then-Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) in\n2012.\n\nHere\'s how Nina Malika Henderson summed up the state of the Paul campaign\nin The Washington Post on April 1, 2012: "[E]nthusiastic crowds who love\nPaul\'s fierce independence but fail to carry him to victory at the polls.\nAfter running in 30 states and gaining a scant 50 delegates, according to\nthe Associated Press, Paul has learned a hard lesson: Crowds don\'t vote."\n\n\n\nSanders is going to learn the same lesson in a few months.\n\n\n\nGeoffrey Skelley, associate editor of Larry Sabato\'s Crystal Ball at the\nUniversity of Virginia Center for Politics, had this to say about Sanders\'s\ncrowds:\n\n\n\nMost of the places we\'ve seen him draw huge crowds are exactly the kinds of\nspots where we might expect it: whiter urban areas like Denver and\nMinneapolis (compared to most big cities), liberal college towns like\nMadison, Wis., and now most recently in very white Portland, Maine, the\nmost liberal part of the Pine Tree State. National polling hasn\'t shown\nSanders making in-roads with nonwhite voters, and much of his support is\ncoming from whites who are particularly liberal.\n\n\n\nProgressive media outlets will continue to cite enormous crowds,\ncherry-picked state polls and a general feeling of Bernie-mania in order to\npush the narrative that Hillary Clinton is being seriously challenged.\n\n\n\nIn late 2011 to early 2012, Paul had a media surge very similar to what\nSanders is experiencing now.\n\n\n\nWhen Paul spoke at UCLA to a crowd of 6,000 to 7,000 people jammed into an\nover-capacity stadium, one wire service reported that Paul fans who\ncouldn\'t get in were "climbing nearby trees to see the speech."\n\n\n\nStories of Paul\'s rise in the Iowa polls were ubiquitous for weeks.\n\n\n\nBut you know how the story ends: with former Gov. Mitt Romney (R-Mass.)\ncoasting over the finish line and beating Paul by a count of nearly 1,400\ndelegates.\n\n\n\nPaul had niche appeal, but not mass appeal. Any argument that Sanders will\nbe different \xe2\x80\x94 that he\'ll score the mass appeal that Paul lacked \xe2\x80\x94 is two\nparts hope and zero parts reality.\n\n\n\nSanders\'s power to rise in the polls is going to slam headfirst into the\nsocialist ceiling. It makes no difference what the word "socialism" means\nto Sanders or his supporters. A Gallup poll from June 22 showed that while\n74 percent of Americans would vote for a gay or lesbian presidential\ncandidate, 73 percent would vote for an evangelical Christian and 60\npercent would vote for a Muslim, only 47 percent of Americans would vote\nfor a socialist presidential candidate.\n\n\n\nThen, there\'s money. If the rest of Sanders\'s problems don\'t shut his\ncampaign down, the money problem will. Michael Hagen, associate professor\nof political science at Temple University, points out that "Sanders\'s\nfunding situation will make it difficult for him to let Democrats know who\nhe is and what he stands for."\n\n\n\nThe largest differences between Paul and Sanders are the advantages Paul\nenjoyed, which Sanders does not.\n\n\n\nIn order for Sanders \xe2\x80\x94 a candidate on the party\'s fringe \xe2\x80\x94 to win, he would\nneed serious challengers to divide and conquer the Clinton coalition.\nFormer Gov. Martin O\'Malley (D-Md.), former Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.) and\nformer Gov. Lincoln Chaffee (D-R.I.) are practically nonexistent. Vice\nPresident Biden puts a small dent in Clinton\'s lead (as we\'ve seen when his\nname is removed from polls). But Sanders fanatics need Biden and a second\nestablishment challenger to step in. Preferably a big-name Democrat who is\nwithin an ideological arm\'s length of Clinton.\n\n\n\nMy goal is not to pour cold water on the hopes of Sanders fans. It is\nsimply to hold a mirror up to nature and present the reality of his\nsituation \xe2\x80\x94 a reality being ignored by the left-wing media where many\nSanders fans turn to for their news.\n\n\n\nPartisan news sources are food for intellectual dishonesty. The real story\nabout candidates like Ron Paul and Bernie Sanders is the same every four\nyears: big crowds, big hype, big loss.\n\n\n\n*Sanders: \xe2\x80\x98We have got to apologize for slavery\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/sanders-we-have-got-to-apologize-for-slavery/article/2568017>\n// Washington Examiner // Barbara Boland \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\n"As a nation, we have got to apologize for slavery" Sen. Bernie Sanders,\nI-Vt., said during a recent Sirius XM interview.\n\n\n\nHost Joe Madison of Sirius XM\'s "The Black Eagle" asked Sanders, "If\nelected president of the United States, would you apologize for slavery?"\n\n\n\n"You know, obviously, nobody in this generation is involved in slavery,"\nreplied Sanders. "But as a nation, slavery is one of the abominations that\nour country has experienced. There is no excuse. What can we say about it?\nIt was horrific, it killed millions of people who never made it even across\nthe oceans, and it destroyed just the lives of so many people."\n\n\n\n"So as a nation \xe2\x80\x93 and I don\'t think as a president, but as a nation \xe2\x80\x93 we\nhave got to apologize for slavery, of course," Sanders said.\n\n\n\n"So is that a yes or a no?" asked Madison.\n\n\n\n"Well, it\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 I mean \xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m not exactly sure what it means," replied Sanders\nhaltingly. "As a nation, we have got to apologize for slavery; and of\ncourse, the president is the leader of the nation."\n\n\n\nWhile a recent poll found that Sanders trailed Democrat rival Hillary\nClinton by only 12 points in New Hampshire, Sanders garners the support of\nonly 5 percent of black Democrats according to a poll by Fox News.\n\n\n\nThe latest RealClearPolitics poll shows Clinton leading Sanders in the\nDemocrat nomination by 48 points.\n\n\n\n*Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders defends past votes on gun control\nmeasures\n<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/bernie-sanders-defends-votes-gun-control-measures-article-1.2287649>\n// NY Daily News // Cameron Joseph \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders defended his past opposition to some gun control measures in\na testy exchange Thursday night.\n\n\n\nThe Vermont senator and fast-rising progressive primary challenger to\nHillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination doubled down on\nhis past votes to block people from suing gun manufacturers and allow\npeople to check guns in their baggage on Amtrak trains.\n\n\n\nSanders was confronted at an appearance by Honora Laszlo, the local\nchairwoman of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, who criticized\nhim for his votes and statements opposing some gun control measures.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf somebody has a gun and somebody steals that gun and shoots somebody, do\nyou really think it makes sense to blame the manufacturer of that weapon?\xe2\x80\x9d\nSanders said, before he and Laszlo began talking over one another.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf somebody assaults you with a baseball bat, you hit somebody over the\nhead, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to sue the baseball bat manufacturer,\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to be some compromises on both sides. So\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t apologize for that vote."\n\n\n\nSanders, a self-described Democratic socialist, is a hardline liberal on\nmost issues. His economic populism has been earning him plaudits from\nprogressives, generating enthusiasm with the liberal Democratic base and\npumping up his poll numbers in early voting states. But he has a mixed\nrecord on gun control, and Clinton is to his left on an issue that\xe2\x80\x99s\ncrucial to many progressives.\n\n\n\nThe senator touted his votes to ban assault weapons, create instant\nbackground checks and close the gun show loophole, arguing that Democrats\nneed to end the culture wars over guns to get \xe2\x80\x9ccommon-sense solutions\xe2\x80\x9d\nthrough.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can argue all that we want between Vermont and Montana and urban\nAmerica about guns. We are not going to succeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nLaszlo said she\xe2\x80\x99d been a longtime Sanders fan and told the Daily News\nafterward that she arrived hoping he would walk away from his past\npositions because she\xe2\x80\x99s not crazy about Clinton.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was dishonest in the way he talked about it. He is using this language\nthat the NRA and their supporters use to polarize people,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nreally hoped that if I gave him the chance to walk those statements back\nthat he would, and instead he just really threw a bunch of smoke out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s Big Break With the Left on Guns\n<http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/run-2016/2015/07/10/bernies-big-break-with-the-left-on-guns>\n// US News and World Report // David Catanese \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nAs a lifelong Bernie Sanders fan, Honora Laszlo was hoping for the best\nwhen she came to a forum here Thursday night to challenge the Vermont\nsenator and presidential candidate on his gun control position.\n\n\n\nThe avowed socialist Sanders voted in 2005 to prohibit lawsuits against gun\nmanufacturers when crimes are committed with their weapons. In the wake of\nthe 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, he told a\nhome-state media outlet that stronger gun control legislation wouldn\'t have\nprevented the shootings.\n\n\n\nThis bothered Laszlo, a member of the local chapter for Gun Sense In\nAmerica, who agrees with Sanders on virtually every other issue. So she\nstood up to pointedly pin him down on the matter, seeking a conversion or\nat least a concession. Instead, she got a confrontation \xe2\x80\x93 which illuminated\nSanders\' weakest spot with liberals in his long-shot quest for the\nDemocratic Party nomination.\n\n\n\nLaszlo first wanted to know how Sanders could claim that further gun\ncontrol measures wouldn\'t prevent future mass casualty tragedies. She then\npressed for an explanation on his 2005 vote.\n\n\n\nA defender of the Second Amendment from a rural state, Sanders explained he\nknows tens of thousands of his constituents who hunt and target practice\nsafely and lawfully. He stressed he has voted for a ban on assault weapons,\nin favor of instant background checks and to close the gun-show loophole\ncovering private sales.\n\n\n\nBut not unlike many conservatives from the heartland of America, Sanders\nasserted that it would be folly to make Burlington and Boston live under\nthe same gun laws.\n\n\n\n"The overwhelming majority of people who hunt know about guns and respect\nguns and are law-abiding people. That\'s the truth," he said. "We will not\nsucceed on this terribly important issue if we continue the cultural\nwarfare between urban America and rural America."\n\n\n\nBut his answer on why gun manufacturers should be shielded from civil\nlawsuits is what really irked Laszlo.\n\n\n\n"If somebody sells you a baseball bat and you hit somebody over the head,\nyou\'re not going to sue the baseball bat manufacturer," Sanders said, to a\nsmattering of applause among a mostly liberal audience. "I don\'t apologize\nfor that vote."\n\n\n\nAfterward, Laszlo called that analogy "ridiculous" and felt Sanders was\nemploying language that mimicked the "dog-whistling" of the National Rifle\nAssociation. (The lawmaker\'s current grade from the NRA is still an F.)\n\n\n\n"[Baseball bats] have other uses. The guns we\'re talking about only are\ndesigned to kill a lot of people in a short amount of time," she says.\n"It\'s not about whether people like guns or don\'t. This honest conversation\nhe\'s talking about is not at all rural versus urban because there\'s a lot\nof people that are killed in rural communities all the time."\n\n\n\nWhereas Sanders posited that he had a balanced record on gun control that\nheeds to his state\'s culture but acknowledges the nationwide problem,\nLaszlo found his language as polarizing as some on the right.\n\n\n\n"He reinforces the idea in people on the other side of the divide that this\nis about people hating them and about people hating guns. This is not. This\nis about safety," she says.\n\n\n\nA super PAC supporting former Maryland Gov. Martin O\'Malley has also\nidentified gun control as Sanders\' weak spot, running an ad targeting the\nvery issue concerning Laszlo. "Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it\ncomes to guns," it blares.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Hillary Clinton has been more vocal on gun violence in recent\nweeks, promising to speak out against the "gun lobby" and "uncontrollable\nuse of guns in our country." She has yet to directly frame a contrast with\nSanders.\n\n\n\nBut the line of attack hasn\'t gained serious traction yet, mostly because\nliberals have prioritized Sanders\' withering message of economic inequality\nover all else.\n\n\n\n"These Vermonters like their guns, but ya know, we go along with that,"\nsays Madi Green, a Sanders fan in the audience who also disagrees with his\ngun control stand. "You just say, \'OK, they\'re hunters,\' you pardon them.\'\n\n\n\nBut Laszlo isn\'t giving him a pass.\n\n\n\nShe was yearning for him to change her mind: "He absolutely could\'ve, if he\nhad talked about it in a different way."\n\n\n\nInstead, she walked out of Thursday\'s forum unable to support him.\n\n\n\n"A lot of us were super Bernie Sanders supporters before," she says. "We\nwere all really disappointed to hear him talk about it in this way that is\nboilerplate NRA language."\n\n\n\n*Did Bernie Sanders vote against background checks and waiting periods for\ngun purchases?\n<http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/10/generation-forward-pac/did-bernie-sanders-vote-against-background-checks-/>\n// PolitiFact // Linda Qiu \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nAs hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows,\npolitical opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the\nsocialist Vermont senator is a gun nut.\n\n\n\n"One issue your Democratic rivals are starting to hit you with is the fact\nthat you have, in the past, sided with the NRA on some gun issues," CNN\xe2\x80\x99s\nJake Tapper said in a July 5 interview with Sanders, alluding to an attack\nad paid for by a pro-Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley group.\n\n\n\n"Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and\nwaiting periods," said the attack, which first aired June 25. "Bernie\nSanders is no progressive when it comes to guns."\n\n\n\nSanders\xe2\x80\x99 record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire ("Bernie\nSanders, gun nut") as well as conservative glee ("Sorry liberals, Bernie\nSanders is a gun nut"). So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the\nBrady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control\nlegislation.\n\n\n\nThe Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to\nwait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks.\n(After 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the\nchecks.)\n\n\n\nBut before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations. Sanders,\nelected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous\ntimes, virtually almost always in opposition:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day\nwaiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill\nreturned to the House. In Nov. 1991, Sanders voted against that version.\nThough it passed in the House, the Senate didn\xe2\x80\x99t muster enough votes. The\nBrady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that\nreinstated the five day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted\nagainst that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background\ncheck instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant\nchecks didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist at the time).\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting\nperiods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know\nwhy.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The final compromise version of the Brady bill --  an interim five-day\nwaiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was\npassed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it.\n\n\n\nAccording to Sanders\' campaign manager Jeff Weaver, Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 reason for\nopposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a\nnational waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his\njob.\n\n\n\n"He wasn\'t opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to.\nThe Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them,\nand Bernie voted that down," Weaver said. "He said he would be against\nwaiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont."\n\n\n\nIn April 1991, Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 then-chief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea\nthat Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents.\n\n\n\n"Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s response is that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just represent liberals and\nprogressives. He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont," Pollina\nsaid. "It\xe2\x80\x99s not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority\nposition, particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about."\n\n\n\nThe Green Mountain State, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership\nrate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate). That and\nSanders\xe2\x80\x99 own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record,\nexperts told us.\n\n\n\n"As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners,\nVermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues,\nhistorically," explained Bertram Johnson, a professor of political science\nat Middlebury College in Vermont. "He seems to support more regulation of\nguns than the U.S. presently has, but he recognizes his constituents\xe2\x80\x99\npreferences so does not make gun control a priority."\n\n\n\n"I think he has disappointed many progressives in Vermont with his gun\npositions, which sort of walk a middle line \xe2\x80\x93 and angering both sides\nthrough the years," said Chris Graff, the former Vermont Associated Press\nbureau chief. "Gun control is a tough issue in Vermont for all politicians."\n\n\n\nFormer Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, whose 2004 presidential bid is often\ncompared to Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 2016 run, received high marks from the National Rifle\nAssociation. Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy also voted against the\nBrady bill. For his part, Sanders has voted to tighten gun control about\nhalf the time, and to protect Second Amendment rights the other half.\n\n\n\nHere are his votes on key gun bills in his 25 years in Congress (bold\nreflects a pro-gun control position):\n\n\n\nSanders\xe2\x80\x99 moderate stance is noted by firearm enthusiasts and gun control\nadvocates alike.

Brady Campaign president Dan Gross\nsays Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since those first Brady\nvotes and added he isn\xe2\x80\x99t a "gun lobby lapdog."\n\n\n\nExperts agreed that on guns, Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 views are to the right of his\nDemocratic rivals.\n\n\n\n"When it comes to guns, he\xe2\x80\x99s not Ted Cruz, but he believes federal policy\nshould be less intrusive than Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley or Hillary Clinton," said\nEric Davis, who studies Vermont politics at Middlebury College.

Between 1991 and 1993, Sanders voted against it five times. He\ndid, however, vote for a version of the bill that imposed instant\nbackground checks, and against an amendment that repealed state background\nchecks.\n\n\n\nExperts noted Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 votes were representative of Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s gun owners\nand gun laws.

Bush, into Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s stimulus\nprogram, and through the earmarking process. But his biggest achievement\ncame in 2010 through the Affordable Care Act. In a series of high-stakes\nlegislative maneuvers, Sanders struck a deal to include $11 billion for\nhealth clinics in the law.\n\n\n\nThe result has made an indelible mark on American health care, extending\nthe number of people served by clinics from 18 million before the ACA to an\nexpected 28 million next year.\n\n\n\nAs one would expect, the program was largely met with plaudits from\npatients and public health experts, but it has also won praise from even\nthe biggest Obamacare critics on Capitol Hill. In letters I obtained\nthrough multiple record requests, dozens of Republican lawmakers, including\nmembers of the House and Senate leadership, have privately praised the ACA\nclinic funding, calling health centers a vital provider in both rural and\nurban communities.\n\n\n\nTo Sanders, the clinics have served as an alternative to his preferred\nsingle-payer system. Community health centers accept anyone regardless of\nhealth, insurance status or ability to pay. They are founded and managed by\na board composed of patients and local residents, so each center is\ncustomized to fit the needs of a community. No two health centers are alike.\n\n\n\nIn rural North Carolina, ACA-backed health centers now provide dental and\nnutrition services, while in San Francisco, the clinics provide translation\nservices and outreach for immigrant families. In other areas, they provide\nmental health counseling, low-cost prescription drugs, and serve as the\nprimary care doctors for entire counties. They have also served as a\nplatform for innovation, introducing electronic medical record systems and\npaving the way with new methods for tracking those most susceptible for\nheart disease and diabetes.\n\n\n\nAuthor John Dittmer, in The Good Doctors, traces the history of the modern\nhealth center to the civil rights activists who ventured into the South\nduring the early 1960s. The activists were seen as outside agitators, and\nlocal doctors refused to treat them. As a solution, volunteer bands of\nphysicians were organized by a group called the Medical Committee for Human\nRights.\n\n\n\nBeyond treating the civil rights workers, the MCHR physicians were struck\nby the stark disparity in health services, encountering many\nAfrican-Americans who had never seen a doctor before in their lives. The\nactivist physicians returned to the South after the \xe2\x80\x9cFreedom Rides\xe2\x80\x9d to\nfound a small clinic in Mound Bayou, Mississippi, in the heart of the\nMississippi Delta, and by doing so, began a movement to launch health\nclinics across the country in underserved areas. Winning support from\nPresident Lyndon Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Economic Opportunity, the clinics\nbecame part of Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWar on Poverty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOver the years, health centers have gained support on a bipartisan basis.\nHealth centers secured critical funding from the efforts of the late Sen.\nTed Kennedy, D-Mass., and both George W. Bush and John McCain campaigned on\npledges to expand them.\n\n\n\nSanders\xe2\x80\x99s place in health clinic history will be remembered for his\nforceful role in the winter of the health reform debate. In December 2009,\ntensions ran high as Congress inched closer to a final health reform deal.\nSen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., tapped Sanders to help win support from liberals\nwho thought the bill was too weak as well as from Democrats from rural\nstates who were facing mounting pressure. More funding for community health\ncenters, Sanders argued, was a win-win solution for both camps, since the\nprogram would ensure access to health care for even the most remote areas\nof the country while also helping those without insurance. Sen. Ben Nelson,\nD-Neb., among others, held out to the very last moment.\n\n\n\nTwo days before the Senate voted to break a Republican filibuster of the\nbill, Reid called on Sanders to make his case on the Senate floor. Sanders,\nin typical fashion, said the legislation was far from perfect, but\nthundered about the common-sense need for health centers, citing the acute\ndemand for more primary care doctors, the cost-savings from patients who\nwould otherwise use the emergency room for the common cold, the\npatient-centered model of clinics, and so on. Senate Democrats rallied and\novercame the Republican filibuster.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother turning point came several weeks later, when Massachusetts\nRepublican Scott Brown won a special election in an upset victory, ending\nthe Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 filibuster-proof majority. Brown\xe2\x80\x99s election brought\nDemocrats close to despair, because lawmakers could only use a procedure\ncalled reconciliation to pass the law. Such a move would keep chances for\npassage alive while foreclosing any chance of enacting the much stronger\nlegislation that originated in the House of Representatives through a\nconference committee. For progressives, it was a painful blow that not only\nsealed the defeat of the Public Option insurance program but also removed\nmany robust provisions they had worked hard to include. Again called upon\nto work out a solution with House liberals, with whom Sanders enjoys a\nstrong working relationship, the Vermont senator forged a deal to build\nsupport for the bill by focusing on health clinics.\n\n\n\nDaniel Hawkins, vice president of the National Association of Community\nHealth Centers, recalls that in the end Sanders was able to negotiate with\nRep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., to increase health clinic funding through a\nspecial technical amendment that could modify the reconciliation Senate\nbill through a simple majority vote. The technical amendment passed, with\n$9.5 billion targeted for health center operations and $1.5 billion for\nconstruction and renovation projects. The House passed the final Senate\nbill, and President Obama signed the legislation with $11 billion in health\nclinic funding into law on March 23, 2010.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no one who played a more important role than Senator Sanders,\xe2\x80\x9d\nHawkins says, remembering Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s constant lobbying of other lawmakers to\nsupport the funding.\n\n\n\nAlthough the health reform has transformed the funding of local health\nclinics, few patients even realize that the changes have occurred as a\nresult of the law, because few aspects of the health reform are explicitly\nbranded as being part of the ACA.\n\n\n\nThat relative invisibility has shielded health clinic funding from the\nhyper-partisan attacks faced by other provisions of the law. But it has\nalso allowed Republican opponents of Obamacare to play a two-faced game.\nEvery single congressional Republican has voted to repeal the entire bill,\nhealth center funding included. But many have taken credit for popular\nlocal health clinic programs funded by the ACA, without disclosing the\nsource of the funds. Others have written letters expressing their support\nfor the money.\n\n\n\nAs I reported previously for The Nation, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., among\nother Republicans, authored letters to the Obama administration to\nrecommend ACA funding for local health clinics. Now, a new batch of\nletters, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, shows other\nrequests by GOP leaders.\n\n\n\nRep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the House Republican whip, for instance, signed\nonto a letter with other members of the Louisiana congressional delegation\nto ask the Obama administration for health center funding in New Orleans.\nThe proposed clinic, the letter noted, would build a graduate medical\ntraining program, a proposal that \xe2\x80\x9cwill attract not only more citizens back\nto our community but provide critical training opportunities for our\nregion\xe2\x80\x99s future healthcare workforce.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the number two leader in the Senate, wrote at\nleast 17 letters to the administration asking for funding, in cities such\nas Lubbock and Houston, for a wide range of programs, including clinics\ndevoted to low-income rural residents and Asian-Americans in Texas.\nSenators Mark Kirk, R-Ill., Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., David Vitter, R-La., Rob\nPortman, R-Ohio, and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., made similar requests.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder that politicians from rural states such as Texas would seek\ncommunity health centers to better serve their constituents. A recent\nreport from the Texas A&M School of Public Health found that only 9 percent\nof physicians practice in rural areas. Many rural Texans live in areas that\nare more than 30 minutes from the nearest hospital, which dramatically\nraises mortality rates in cases of medical emergencies.\n\n\n\nStill, press releases from GOP officials have lashed out at the Affordable\nCare Act\xe2\x80\x99s health center funding as some sort of \xe2\x80\x9cslush fund.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRegardless of the politics, the success of health centers has been\nparticularly satisfying for Sanders, who can simply point to his own state\nas a reminder of its impact. One in four Vermonters are now served by more\nthan 50 health centers throughout the state, according to the senator\xe2\x80\x99s\noffice. Just last month, a new federally qualified health clinic opened in\nShoreham, Vermont, to provide dental care, physicals and medication for\ncommon diseases.\n\n\n\nThough his own role in securing the funds for the ACA is barely mentioned\non his Senate website, the image gallery is adorned with pictures of\nSanders beaming a smile as he breaks ground and cuts ribbons for various\nhealth clinic openings in Vermont.\n\n\n\n*WEBB*\n\n\n\n*Jim Webb arrives in the age of Sanders and Trump\n<http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/247489-jim-webb-arrives-in-the-age-of-sanders-and-trump>\n// The Hill // Bernie Quigley \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nYears ago, when I went to the Baptist South to work at a college, the\ncountry women who came down from the hills to work in our offices offered\nlife advice as I, coming into the country from New York City, seemed likely\nto need it. Which I did. Like when our last child was about to be born,\nthey would ask, "Did you get your girl yet?" Actually, no. All boys so far.\n"She\'ll come on the moon," they would say. And as I recall, she did come on\nthe full moon. They would often advise, "When God closes a door, he opens a\nwindow," which was pretty metaphysical stuff but might be as accurate as\nany historical hypothesis: Things begin again where they end, and the world\nstarts again right there as if from scratch.\n\n\n\nIt came to mind yesterday afternoon, when South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley\n(R) announced that the Confederate battle flag would be removed from the\nState House. Fifty years ago it went up, not so much to respect the\ntradition of honor and bravery in America\'s most difficult and important\nmoment, but to repudiate congressional passage of the civil rights efforts.\n\nThe Confederate flag, shorn of original intent, symbolically represented\nthat counterforce and yesterday it ended. So it was an auspicious day for\nJim Webb (D), former Virginia senator and secretary of the Navy under\nPresident Reagan, who announced last week that he will run for president,\nto make his public debut in a morning interview on "CBS This Morning."\n\n\n\nThe battle flag has "long been due to come down," he said. Webb had been\ncriticized on comments recently on the history of the South and the\nConfederate flag. And it was a good interview. It slowed things down. Webb\nexplained his thinking as the interviewers egged him on to speed it up and\nget to it: How you gonna beat Hillary, that\'s what we\'re talking about.\n\n\n\nBut that was not what Webb was talking about. When Webb cited statistics\nabout slave ownership and participation of the Civil War, he explained\nhimself, citing the master historian John Hope Franklin, bringing his own\ntempo to the discussion.\n\n\n\nIt may have been one of those days yesterday when the South awakened as if\nfrom a great sleep, or another day, possibly beginning a new era in which\nthe South will fight for its life and our own. As oddly enough, history has\nturned in the last few weeks and Webb comes to us in that turning.\n\n\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and celebrity entrepreneur and politico\nDonald Trump enter fate virtually at the same moment. The mainstream media\ntell us not to worry \xe2\x80\x94 they will soon go away (it is their job to say so) \xe2\x80\x94\nbut one can look with some disgust today at former Presidents Bill Clinton\nand George W. Bush on stage together, Bush declaring that former Gov. Jeb\nBush (R-Fla.) and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, both\ncandidates for president, will "elevate the discourse." It is, as might be\nheard in the hills, "enough to gag a horse."\n\n\n\nInstead, for whatever else might be said about these two, Sanders and\nTrump, they transcend the painful banality of Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush\nand awaken new energies. Energies, however, which suggest or approximate\nthe formulation of the the last world more than a hundred years ago, when\nLeon Trotsky was writing his first dramatic prose in Russia and Gabriele\nD\'Annunzio rode bareback on the beach to the rise of fascism in Italy.\n\n\n\nSanders has hundreds of thousands of Facebook followers and has\ncommandeered the millennials. Trump comes at a time when at least two dozen\nAmerican states in the middle and north of Texas are looking for a\ndramatic, public figure to oppose the federal government on a garden\nvariety of issues. They will not go away. It is Jeb Bush will go away.\nHillary Clinton will go away. Like Haile Selassie, god king of Ethiopia, an\nold antique lost in the attic of history, they are suddenly caught in\nhistory\'s cross fires and will remain mystified to the very end about their\nsudden irrelevance.\n\n\n\nSaid here in The Hill recently, as the Confederate flag comes down, the\nGadsden flag goes up. We face a coming era of civil disobedience,\ncommentator Pat Buchanan writes this week, but this time it will be\nconservatives. Indeed, it is well underway as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R)\nbrings an impressive posse of heartland governors to challenge the\npresident\'s executive order on immigration. The idea has caught on. As The\nHill reports, "State legislators around the country have introduced more\nthan 200 bills aiming to nullify regulations and laws coming out of\nWashington, D.C., as they look to rein in the federal government."\n\n\n\nThis movement needs a dramatic (flamboyant) public spokesperson and it will\nbe Trump. And New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) today rallies the major\ncities against the governors, in coordination with the president and the\nfederal government. He likewise needs a dramatic, charismatic public figure\nas spokesperson and that surely is to be Sanders.\n\n\n\nThis is where Webb enters history, and he arrives with a sterling\nendorsement by one of the most respected scholars and commentators today,\nAndrew Bacevich.\n\n\n\nOf all proposed candidates, writes Bacevich, "Only Webb has the bona fides\nto promote a serious debate that looks beyond bogus issues such as\nBenghazi."\n\n\n\nPossibly it is nature that sends the single indispensable warrior to us at\ntimes like this, as the women of Appalachian hills will say, to open a\nwindow. That warrior is Jim Webb.\n\n\n\n*OTHER*\n\n\n\n*Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Candid Views of the Political Press\n<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/07/10/bill-clintons-candid-views-of-the-political-press/>\n// NYT // Amy Chozick \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s relations with the political news media had been\ntense long before she declared her candidacy in April, and her campaign\xe2\x80\x99s\nefforts to try and improve those relations have backfired at times.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, Bill Clinton provided a candid look at how the former first\ncouple felt about the role the news media played in the presidential\ncampaign.\n\n\n\nAt a joint event in Dallas alongside George W. Bush, Mr. Clinton said that\npart of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s problem was a news media driven by the belief that\n\xe2\x80\x9cconflict is better than concord.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Bush blamed the political divisiveness on candidates\xe2\x80\x99 impassioned\nsurrogates and the Internet granting them a veil of anonymity to hurl nasty\nattacks. But Mr. Clinton ultimately put the blame squarely on the political\npress.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s suppose we were in a campaign against each other,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his\npredecessor. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would have his narrative and I would have mine and each of\nus would try to convince you that our narrative was better than the other.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s O.K.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the people covering the campaign, they develop a narrative, too, a\nstoryline, and it\xe2\x80\x99s almost impossible for the real story to be the same as\nthe storyline,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very hard for the American people\nto be well informed if the storyline swamps the real story.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Clinton did not specifically mention Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign (except\nfor saying \xe2\x80\x9cI know who I want to win\xe2\x80\x9d) and he did not discuss recent\narticles about her use of private email at the State Department and foreign\ndonations to the Clinton Foundation.\n\n\n\nHis comments come just days after Mrs. Clinton tried to begin a more\naccessible phase in the campaign, by sitting down on Tuesday with CNN\xe2\x80\x99s\nBrianna Keilar in her first national interview.\n\n\n\nIn his remarks, Mr. Clinton also echoed a frequent and widely held\ncomplaint that the political press is too focused on the horse race of who\nis ahead in the campaign rather than policy and issues.\n\n\n\n*Latinos Gather For NCLR Conference Amid Political Spotlight\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/upshot/class-or-ideology-my-conversation-with-bernie-sanders.html?_r=0&abt=0002&abg=0>\n// // NYT \xe2\x80\x93 Upshot // Griselda Nevarez \xe2\x80\x93 July 11, 2015*\n\n\n\nAn estimated 2,000 Latinos are expected to attend the National Council of\nLa Raza\'s annual conference, which kicks off Saturday in Kansas City,\nMissouri.\n\n\n\nNCLR prides itself as the nation\'s largest Hispanic civil rights and\nadvocacy organization. The four-day conference is garnering the national\npolitical spotlight - the top three Democratic presidential candidates will\naddress the Latino advocates and leaders gathered at the event.\n\n\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is scheduled to speak Monday morning at a town\nhall forum. Also speaking Monday during a luncheon are former Secretary of\nState Hillary Clinton, who is considered the Democratic front-runner in the\nrace for president, and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\'Malley.\n\n\n\nThe candidates are "expected to address issues vital to Latinos and all\nAmericans: jobs and the economy, civil rights, immigration, education and\nmore," according to NCLR.\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidates were invited to attend but none are\nscheduled to speak.\n\n\n\nThe conference comes several weeks after Republican presidential hopeful\nBen Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, was the only Republican to speak at the\nNational Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials\' annual\nconference in Las Vegas. Sanders and Clinton also spoke at the NALEO\nconference.\n\n\n\nIt also comes as at a time when Latino leaders are urging Republican\npresidential candidates to counter remarks surrounding Donald Trump after\nhis controversial comments that Mexico is sending "rapists" and "criminals"\nto the U.S.\n\n\n\nThe conference takes place in Missouri, a state which has experienced\nstrong Latino growth over the last few years. Currently, Latinos make up\nnearly 4 percent of the state\'s population and 10 percent of Kansas City\nresidents. Between 2000 and 2010, Missouri\'s Latino population grew by 79.2\npercent, according to the U.S. Census.\n\n\n\n*DNC Chair Says Candidates Must Meet \xe2\x80\x98Threshold\xe2\x80\x99 For Debates, Though\nCriteria And Dates Still Unclear\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/10/democratic-debate-criteria_n_7772156.html?1436561457>\n// HuffPo // Michael Calderone \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates will have to meet a certain \xe2\x80\x9cthreshold\xe2\x80\x9d\nto participate in the party\xe2\x80\x99s six scheduled primary debates, Democratic\nNational Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said Thursday, though she\ndid not specify which criteria, such as state or national polling, will be\nused to determine who qualifies.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be a threshold that\xe2\x80\x99ll be expansive and allows for the maximum\ninclusion of our major party candidates," Wasserman Schultz told MSNBC\xe2\x80\x99s\nAri Melber. She said the DNC hasn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cquite finished formulating the\ndetails\xe2\x80\x9d for the debates, including specific dates, locations and media\nsponsors.\n\n\n\nThe lack of clarity has been frustrating to both campaigns and major TV\nnetworks, the latter of which produce the debates and need to book venues\nand handle logistical details well in advance.\n\n\n\nIn May, the DNC announced plans to hold six primary debates, four of which\nwould be held in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South\nCarolina and Nevada. The DNC said debates would begin in "the fall of\n2015," though didn\'t specify when.\n\n\n\nThe first Republican debate, sponsored by Fox News, is scheduled to take\nplace less than four weeks from now, with the second and third GOP contests\nplanned for September (CNN) and October (CNBC).\n\n\n\nThe DNC\xe2\x80\x99s plan drew criticism from Democratic presidential contender Sen.\nBernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who urged Wasserman Schultz to accelerate the\nschedule and start debates during the summer, as well as to consider\nincluding Republican contenders. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe we need to go beyond the bounds\nof traditional party debates,\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders wrote in a letter.\n\n\n\nIt\'s understandable Sanders would want more debates given that national\nmedia exposure likely benefits him and any candidates not named Hillary\nClinton. She already has worldwide name recognition, is a clear\nfront-runner in the polls, and presumably has the most to lose by getting\non the debate stage. Some Democrats have suggested the DNC is protecting\nClinton by sanctioning only six debates.\n\n\n\nIn response to Sanders\' request, a DNC spokeswoman reiterated on June 1\nthat the committee would continue with the six-debate framework and said\nmore details would be provided "in the coming weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Republican schedule, meanwhile, has been settled since January. The\nRepublican National Committee announced plans to hold nine debates, along\nwith their locations, media sponsors and each month they\xe2\x80\x99d take place. The\nRNC also announced that three additional debates could be sanctioned\ndepending on the circumstances next year.\n\n\n\nThough the Republicans\' schedule was rolled out smoothly, the debates\nhaven\'t been without controversy. Fox News\' decision to limit its primetime\ndebate to only candidates ranking in the top 10 in national polls has drawn\ncriticism from campaigns arguing that the barrier for entry is placing too\nmuch emphasis on national name recognition rather than early state\ncampaigning.\n\n\n\nBoth the RNC and DNC are taking a firmer hand with the debate process by\npenalizing candidates who participate in non-sanctioned debates by not\nallowing them in sanctioned events. Candidates may attend forums in which\nthey don\'t directly engage with one another.\n\n\n\nDemocratic candidates appeared in over two dozen debates in 2008, which\nincluded repeated verbal slugfests between Barack Obama and Hillary\nClinton. Republican candidates debated 20 times in 2012, a grueling process\nthat party leaders want to avoid this cycle.\n\n\n\n*Hillary and her rivals to meet with union leaders\n<http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/hillary-and-her-rivals-to-meet-with-union-leaders/article/2568030>\n// Washington Examiner // Sean Higgins \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nFront-running Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her top\nchallengers, Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\'Malley,\nwill meet privately with the AFL-CIO\'s executive council at the end of July.\n\n\n\nUnion leaders will press the candidates on their stances, particularly on\ninternational trade, at the meeting in Silver Spring, Md., Reuters reported.\n\n\n\nThat will be a tricky issue for Clinton, who has tried to stay above both\nthe recent congressional fight over Trade Promotion Authority legislation\nand the looming one over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade\ndeal. Clinton has not taken definitive positions on either. Labor leaders\nstrongly oppose both, and AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka has said trade\nwill be crucial to 12 million-member labor federation\'s presidential\nendorsement.\n\n\n\nSanders, I-Vt., has consistently and loudly opposed President Obama\'s trade\nagenda. O\'Malley opposes both as well.\n\n\n\n"There is no middle ground, and the time for deliberations is drawing to a\nclose. In the 2016 campaign, there will be no place to hide for those who\naspire to lead America," Trumka said in an April speech at the AFL-CIO\'s\nWashington headquarters on trade and the election.\n\n\n\nAsked after the speech if he was calling on Clinton to issue a clear\nstatement on Trade Promotion Authority, Trumka told the Washington\nExaminer, he was referring to "all candidates." He added later that Clinton\n"would have to respond like every candidate."\n\n\n\nClinton, nevertheless, did not issue a clear statement. Her status as the\nfront-runner far ahead of all other Democratic candidates in the polls has\nmade liberal groups reluctant to criticize her. Sanders has gained in\nrecent polls, though, and the prospect of Vice President Joe Biden entering\nthe race means she may not be able to count on that advantage forever.\n\n\n\nTrade is treacherous territory for Clinton. Her husband, former President\nBill Clinton, used a version of Trade Promotion Authority to help secure\npassage of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement in 1994, but she voted\nagainst renewing the authority in 2002 when she was a New York senator.\n\n\n\nComing out in opposition of the Trans-Pacific Partnership would put Clinton\nat odds with the administration where she served as the top official on\ninternational relations and took part in the deal\'s negotiations.\nSupporting it would put her at odds with much of the party\'s base as she\ntries to lock down the party\'s presidential nomination with a minimum of\ndrama.\n\n\n\nShe has tried to adopt a more skeptical position on trade in recent months,\nbut has left open the possibility that she could support the\nadministration\'s agenda.\n\n\n\n*GOP*\n\n\n\n*DECLARED*\n\n\n\n*BUSH*\n\n\n\n*Jeb Bush Draws on Family Dynasty for Fund-Raising Efforts\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/us/politics/jeb-bush-draws-on-family-dynasty-for-fund-raising-efforts.html?ref=politics>\n// NYT // Nicholas Confessore \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nThe Bush people arrived by private plane, black car and finally\nold-fashioned trolley, shuttled in by the hundreds for a bonding ritual\nunlike anything else in contemporary politics.\n\n\n\nThey posed on the lawn for pictures with Barbara Bush, the former first\nlady. They dined on lobster rolls and burgers, traded business cards with\neminent executives and former ambassadors, and basked in the inner sanctum\nof the most successful political dynasty in history.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is to the Bushes what Hyannis Port is to the Kennedys,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dirk Van\nDongen, a lobbyist in Washington, making his first journey to the Bush\nfamily compound.\n\n\n\nIn his early months as a candidate, Jeb Bush seemed unsure of how tightly\nto embrace the family mantle, dodging questions about the record of his\nolder brother, George W. Bush, as president, eschewing his surname on\nbumper stickers and declaring at his campaign kickoff that \xe2\x80\x9cnot a one of us\ndeserves the job by right of r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9, party, seniority, family or family\nnarrative.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut Jeb Bush is now seeking both advantage and refuge in the trappings of a\ndynasty, eagerly deploying the unique political assets of a family that has\nalready supplied two United States presidents and that hopes to produce a\nthird.\n\n\n\nHis father, his mother, his wife and even his son have raised money for the\ncampaign or for his \xe2\x80\x9csuper PAC,\xe2\x80\x9d tapping into a vast network of donors that\nbegan with the Bush family\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas card mailing list. And the Bush\nfamily compound in Kennebunkport \xe2\x80\x94 for decades the ultimate V.I.P. room in\nRepublican politics \xe2\x80\x94 is now Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s reward to bestow.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, the last Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, dined\nthere with Mr. Bush, hoping to soothe lingering hurt over what Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s\nsupporters considered a desultory endorsement of their nominee in 2012.\n\n\n\nAnd as the donors arrived here on Thursday for two days of cocktails and\nstrategy briefings, Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s campaign and super PAC announced that they\nhad amassed more money, and more quickly, than any presidential effort in\nhistory, easily outpacing his rivals for the Republican nomination.\n\n\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\nMoney Raised So Far\n\nThe first Federal Election Commission filing deadline for presidential\ncandidates is Wednesday, but some organizations have released their totals\nearly. Below, the announced money raised by the campaigns, \xe2\x80\x9csuper PACs\xe2\x80\x9d and\nnonprofits supporting each candidate.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think Jeb\xe2\x80\x99s made clear that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to run away from his family,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Eric J. Tanenblatt, who led the Georgia campaign efforts of George W.\nBush during the 2000 presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nDonor retreats have become a routine feature of presidential campaigns, all\nthe more important as the price tag for a major-party candidacy breaches\nthe $1 billion mark. They are curated to reflect some actual or projected\nessence of the candidate: Hillary Rodham Clinton gathered her top\nfund-raisers in May at a Brooklyn warehouse, for example, while Mr. Romney\ninvited top donors for annual hikes and foreign policy lectures at the\nStein Eriksen ski resort in Utah, a favorite destination of his family.\n\n\n\nGeorge W. Bush, a Texan who styled himself as a political outsider,\npointedly eschewed the establishment trappings of Maine: Many of the donors\nin Kennebunkport recalled, with something less than fondness, their\nfrequent meetings at Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s ranch in Crawford, Tex., huddled under a\ntent in 100-degree heat.\n\n\n\nBut few candidates, they said, could compete with the Bush family seat, a\ncompound of a half-dozen homes on a rocky spit jutting into the Atlantic,\none of them recently built for Jeb Bush and his family. The guests were\ngreeted by Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s mother and ushered into the main house for drinks,\nwhere the elder George Bush made a brief appearance.\n\n\n\nThe veteran Bush donors had chosen their socks carefully, in tribute to the\nelder Mr. Bush, known for his taste in brightly colored ones. Later, they\ndined at a nearby luxury hotel, where Jeb Bush promised his guests that he\nwould not let their hard work go for naught.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou leave saying: Not only was the next president of the United States,\nbut the most important American of my lifetime, George H. W. Bush, sitting\nat my table, making me feel comfortable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ron Kaufman, who served as\npolitical director for the elder Mr. Bush.\n\n\n\nAnother top fund-raiser for Jeb Bush, who spoke on the condition of\nanonymity lest the Bush family think him crass, said, \xe2\x80\x9cFor fund-raising, it\nis gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not hauling these guys into a two-week rental in Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe fund-raiser said, adding that Kennebunkport was \xe2\x80\x9ca little bit more\nspecial than what Hillary can offer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe guests who trickled onto the compound were a microcosm of the financial\noperation that Mr. Bush is hoping will overwhelm his rivals. Robert M.\nDuncan, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Woody\nJohnson, the owner of the New York Jets, are among the party\xe2\x80\x99s leading\nfund-raisers. There was also new blood: a contingent in their 30s and 40s\nwho one donor referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cP\xe2\x80\x99s crowd,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to one of Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s\nsons, George P. Bush.\n\n\n\nSome had served under, or raised money for, the last two Presidents Bush\nand fondly recalled their past visits to Maine. One guest, trying to convey\nthe simplicity of the Bush home, described arriving on a past Kennebunkport\nvisit and being offered a bowl of Fritos.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll of you who are playing shrink to the Bushes these days overstate a lot\nof things,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kaufman said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is, Jeb has always summered in\nKennebunkport. This is his place. He loves it in his blood. This is him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*That time Jeb Bush invited 300 top donors to his parents\xe2\x80\x99 house\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/07/10/when-jeb-bush-invited-300-top-donors-to-his-parents-house/>\n// WaPo // Ed O\xe2\x80\x99Keefe \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nOne by one, nearly 300 of Jeb Bush\'s top donors, from New York, Washington,\nMiami \xe2\x80\x94 even Americans living abroad in China and Germany \xe2\x80\x94 climbed aboard\na trolley here for a trip a mile and a half down Ocean Avenue.\n\n\n\nThere was Dina Powell, a Goldman Sachs executive and a former assistant\nsecretary of state under George W. Bush. And Mike Duncan, the former\nRepublican National Committee chairman. Several Floridians \xe2\x80\x94 including\nAgriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, former Republican Sen. George Lemieux\nand former Republican Gov. Bob Martinez. Younger faces like Jay Zeidman, a\nclose friend of George P. Bush, were among a few dozen notably youthful\nbenefactors.\n\n\n\nWoody Johnson, Bush\'s national finance chairman, was one of the last people\nto board a trolley Thursday evening as the crowd traveled to the nearby\nBush family estate. The owner of the NFL\'s New York Jets was carrying a\nwhite visor with the team\'s green logo.\n\n\n\nAdmiring a green sweater slung over the shoulders of a fellow donor,\nJohnson commented: "You can never have too much green."\n\n\n\nThe confab for some of the GOP\'s wealthiest donors came just hours after\nBush\'s campaign and an allied super PAC announced that they\'d donated more\nthan $114 million to support the former governor \xe2\x80\x94 an unprecedented sum in\nAmerican politics that gives him a sizable financial advantage over more\nthan a dozen GOP rivals.\n\n\n\nBush had announced plans for the Kennebunkport donor retreat at the start\nof his campaign, dangling one of the most cherished chits in Republican\npolitics -- a visit to his family\'s storied beachfront estate -- as an\nincentive to entice benefactors to deliver. Supporters who gave the maximum\n$2,700 to Bush\'s primary campaign, and were able to find at least 10 other\npeople also willing to do so, were invited to attend.\n\n\n\nBush was asked by reporters on Wednesday night why he had decided to hold\nthe retreat at his parents\' estate, known as Walker\'s Point. He deflected\nthe question by clarifying that "It\'s at the Colony, it\'s not at my\nparents\' home, that would be a little overwhelming for them."\n\n\n\nThat was kind of correct.\n\n\n\nThe Colony Hotel is where most guests stayed and where closed-door\nbriefings will be held with top campaign officials on Friday. But on\nThursday evening, the family compound at Walker\'s Point was the main venue.\n\n\n\nThe gathering began at the hotel around 5 p.m., as attendees gathered at\nthe Carriage House, with about a half dozen Secret Service agents looking\non. Some in the crowd said that they\'d just learned about Bush\'s\nfundraising total.\n\n\n\nOnce on the grounds of the estate, the crowd was split up in groups of 40\nor 50 for a quick tour. Former President George H.W. Bush and his wife,\nBarbara, were the main tour guides, leading people across the compound to\ntheir home on the southern tip. Elated at the invitation, some attendees\nquickly posted photos on social media.\n\n\n\n"Incredible night in Kennebunkport! #allinforjeb," Fritz Brogan, a\nWashington-based donor and former aide to Jeb Bush when he was Florida\ngovernor, wrote on Facebook as he posted a photo of him alongside George\nH.W. Bush.\n\n\n\nReporters were not allowed to attend the dinner, but could easily watch the\nproceedings from a public overlook about 1,200 yards to the west, where\ntourists and locals often gawk at the property.\n\n\n\nAround 5:30 p.m., Jeb Bush was spotted entering his parents\' home and came\nout a few minutes later, dressed in a dark blue sweater, to greet his\ndonors. The entire party posed for a photo on the western lawn of the home\naround 6 p.m. Several attendees held campaign signs aloft as a photographer\ntook shots of the crowd. Barbara Bush \xe2\x80\x94 with her infamous locks of white\nhair \xe2\x80\x94 was easily spotted from a distance standing in the front wearing a\nbright coral sweater.\n\n\n\nAfter the photo and more mingling, the crowd was transported to the nearby\nHidden Pond luxury resort. The mood was celebratory, as donors dined on\nlobster rolls and hamburgers and Bush touted their record-breaking\nfundraising effort. His wife, Columba, was on hand, smiling proudly.\n\n\n\n"Money is great but votes matter a lot more. I will outwork everybody,"\nBush said, according to attendees, who asked to remain anonymous because\nguests were asked not to discuss details.\n\n\n\nAlready, the campaign is plotting ahead: Donors said there\'s talk of plans\nto have top donors help raise another $20,000 over the next 20 days in\norder to win an invitation to a campaign-sponsored party in Cleveland on\nAug. 6 \xe2\x80\x94 the date of the first Republican presidential debate.\n\n\n\nAs the crowd mingled on the lawn of Bush home, tourists at the lookout\nwatched unaware of why such a large crowd had gathered.\n\n\n\n"They didn\'t invite us," quipped a woman who said she grew up in\nKennebunkport and was visiting from Seattle, but declined to give her name.\n\n\n\nAs trolleys full of donors kept driving past, she turned to her\ndaughter-in-law and said, "Those are trolleys full of Republicans. Because\nusually they never let trolleys in there."\n\n\n\nAnother man watching the reception unfold marveled at the scene: "Every\ntime I come here I think: There\'s two people who spend time over there who\nknow the contents of what\'s in Area 51."\n\n\n\n*Jeb Bush and Allies Raise More Than $114 Million in 2016 Race\n<http://stream.wsj.com/story/election-2016/SS-2-738144/> // WSJ // Rebecca\nBallhaus \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s campaign and his allies have\nraised more than $114 million to back him in the 2016 race, surpassing\nexpectations.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s campaign and its allied super PAC raised more than $114 million\nin the first half of the year, surpassing expectations and far outstripping\nhis Democratic and Republican rivals for the White House.\n\n\n\nThe Republican presidential hopeful\xe2\x80\x99s super PAC, called Right to Rise USA,\nsaid Thursday that it had received $103 million from more than 9,900\ndonors\xe2\x80\x94a broad pool of supporters he could tap for yet more money for the\nsuper PAC and for donations to his campaign, which are capped at $2,700 per\nperson for the primary. The campaign, meanwhile, took in $11.4 million in\nthe two weeks between its launch and the end of June.\n\n\n\nThe only candidate positioned to keep up with Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s fundraising is the\nDemocratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, who launched her campaign two\nmonths before he did. She has raised $45 million for her campaign and three\ngroups backing her raised about $24 million, for a total of $69 million.\n\n\n\nMr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s campaign fundraising also outpaced many GOP rivals who started\nraising money earlier in the year.\n\n\n\nThe rise of the super PACs and their expanding roles in presidential\ncampaigns means any candidate with a wealthy backer, or a collection of\nthem, can spend exponentially more on his or her candidacy and stay in the\nrace longer than in prior presidential contests. There is a cost, though:\nThe candidates can\xe2\x80\x99t control their friendly super PACs by directing where\nthey spend their money and what messages they send to try to motivate\nvoters.\n\n\n\nOnly one-tenth of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s haul went to his Miami-based campaign, with\nthe rest going to the technically independent super PAC, which is based in\nCalifornia and is legally barred from coordinating its activities with his\nteam.\n\n\n\nThe imbalance exists partly because the super PAC has been raising money\nsince January, while Mr. Bush didn\xe2\x80\x99t launch his campaign until mid-June,\nonly two weeks ahead of the second-quarter fundraising deadline. But since\nthe super PAC can raise money without contribution caps, it is expected to\ncontinue to overpower the campaign.\n\n\n\nIn the 2016 presidential race, the balance of cash increasingly favors\noutside groups over campaigns, a shift political strategists say threatens\nto reduce the effectiveness of their political operations\xe2\x80\x94or to turn some\nvoters away.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCandidates are going to have less control over the resources in their\ncampaigns than ever before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tony Corrado, a professor of government\nat Colby College and a campaign-finance expert.\n\n\n\nSuper PACs first began backing individual candidates in the 2012 election,\nfollowing a 2010 Supreme Court decision that led to their creation. They\nare poised to play a much bigger role in the current election cycle.\n\n\n\nMr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s super PAC smashed all previous fundraising records set by such\ngroups. In the 2012 election, the super PAC backing GOP nominee Mitt Romney\nraised just $12 million in the first half of 2011, and brought in $153\nmillion over the course of the race. Priorities USA Action, the super PAC\nbacking President Barack Obama, raised less than $80 million for the entire\ncycle.\n\n\n\nAs super PACs\xe2\x80\x99 roles grows, campaigns and super PACs supporting the same\ncandidate risk duplicating their activities, particularly voter\nmobilization and grass roots organizing.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe question will be whether you will reach the point where voters are\ntired of having people at their door or picking up the phone,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Corrado\nsaid.\n\n\n\nKevin Madden, a GOP strategist who advised Mr. Romney, said there is a\n\xe2\x80\x9cstrong advantage\xe2\x80\x9d to keeping field work under the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s supervision.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d want to have as robust a field operation under the auspices of my\ncampaign as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between losing and\nwinning sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBarred from coordinating with campaign leadership, super PACs also risk\nveering away from the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s central message, even though\nmany\xe2\x80\x94including Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94are being run by former top aides to the\ncandidates themselves.\n\n\n\nMr. Madden recalls a moment when the Romney campaign was focused on\nneutralizing former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum while the super PAC was\nrunning ads attacking Newt Gingrich. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were like, \xe2\x80\x98What are they doing?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe said.\n\n\n\nIn the current election cycle, super PACs have outraised the campaigns of\nat least three out of the four Republicans who have disclosed their\nfundraising totals so far. The super PAC backing the fourth, retired\nneurosurgeon Ben Carson, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet released its fundraising haul.\n\n\n\nFour super PACs backing Texas Sen. Ted Cruz have raised nearly $38 million,\nalmost four times as much as the amount raised in the second quarter by his\ncampaign, which launched in March.\n\n\n\nUnlike many candidates, Mr. Bush and his supporters haven\xe2\x80\x99t touted grass\nroots support from small donors.\n\n\n\nMr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s campaign didn\xe2\x80\x99t provide an average donation size, while his\nsuper PAC disclosed that about 95% of its donors had given $25,000 or less.\nMrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, by contrast, stressed that about 90% of its\ndonations were for $100 or less.\n\n\n\nAs their share of funds grows, super PACs are expanding their roles to\ninclude tasks traditionally reserved for a campaign, such as compiling\nvoter data and running field operations.\n\n\n\nThat marks a contrast from 2012, when super PACs were new to the scene and\nmostly focused on running advertisements.\n\n\n\nThe super PAC backing former Hewlett-Packard Co. chief executive Carly\nFiorina has taken on some press operations and helped set up candidate\nevents. Her super PAC said this week it raised $3.4 million, more than\ntwice as much as her campaign.\n\n\n\nOver the next month, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is slated to hold at least\nseven town hall events in Iowa, where he will speak about the \xe2\x80\x9cmost\nimportant issues of the day,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the organizers. The events have\nthe trappings of a traditional campaign event, but their host is Mr.\nJindal\xe2\x80\x99s super PAC, called Believe Again. Neither the campaign nor the\nsuper PAC has yet released fundraising details, but the totals for the\nsuper PAC that launched in January are virtually certain to be higher than\nthose of the campaign, which began in late June.\n\n\n\nOn the Democratic side, super PACs seem to be operating more like they did\nin the 2012 election. Priorities USA Action, the main super PAC backing\nMrs. Clinton, plans to limit its efforts to paid advertising on television\nand the Internet, according to people close to the group. It won\xe2\x80\x99t do any\norganizing or field work, they say.\n\n\n\n*\xe2\x80\x98Space Guy\xe2\x80\x99 Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Donor Categories: \xe2\x80\x98Voyager,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Endeavor,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Apollo\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/07/10/space-guy-jeb-bushs-donor-categories-voyager-endeavor-apollo/>\n// WSJ // Beth Reinhard \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nGoing where no candidate has gone before, presidential fundraising leader\nJeb Bush is naming donor levels after the great NASA space missions of the\npast.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Mission Jeb 2016\xe2\x80\x9d levels: Voyager, for donors who raise $250,000;\nEndeavor for $150,000, and Apollo for $75,000.\n\n\n\nMr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s team announced the categories Friday to the roughly 250 donors\ngathered for a two-day retreat at Kennebunkport, Maine. Donors are expected\nto hit up their business associates, friends and family members for maximum\ncontributions of $2,700 to the campaign in order to reach the different\nlevels.\n\n\n\nMr. Bush, a self-proclaimed \xe2\x80\x9cspace guy\xe2\x80\x9d and the former governor of Florida,\nwhich hosts the Kennedy Space Center, has said he would increase funding\nfor space exploration if elected president.\n\n\n\nThe retreat for donors who raised at least $27,000 in the first two weeks\nof Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s campaign amounts to a victory party for a record-setting\nfundraising team. Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s campaign and super PAC announced Friday they\nhad raised more than $114 million since January.\n\n\n\nOn Friday night, the donors dined on burgers and lobster rolls at Walker\xe2\x80\x99s\nPoint, where the Bush family has long vacationed. Former President George\nH.W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush offered tours of the family\ncompound, where they are building a new home for their son as well as an\nartist\xe2\x80\x99s studio for his brother, former President George W. Bush.\n\n\n\nGeorge W. Bush was the candidate who pioneered the system of encouraging\ndonors to bundle campaign contributions. Texans for Public Justice, a\nnon-partisan non-profit, lists 940 people who achieved the status of Ranger\n(raising at least $200,000) or Pioneer (at least $100,000) in the 2000 and\n2004 campaigns.\n\n\n\nWhen Mr. Bush first began raising money earlier this year for his Right to\nRise super PAC \xe2\x80\x93 which unlike the campaign can collect unlimited donations\n\xe2\x80\x94 he was encouraging donors to write checks or raise as much as $500,000.\nThe campaign is required to disclose the names of its donors and the size\nof their contributions next week, while the super PAC\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure is due\nat the end of July.\n\n\n\nAccording to donors who attended the dinner Friday, Mr. Bush told them that\nhe planned to outwork all of his rivals.\n\n\n\n*Jeb to donors: You\xe2\x80\x99re not done\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/jeb-to-donors-youre-not-done-119975.html?ml=tl_1>\n// Politico // Eli Stokols and Anna Palmer \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nLess than 24 hours after Jeb Bush revealed an unprecedented war chest, he\nand his top campaign staffers gathered donors at the family compound in\nKennebunkport, Maine, to let them know that $114 million is not enough.\n\n\n\nThis weekend\xe2\x80\x99s invitation wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just a reward for the roughly 200 major\ndonors who helped Bush amass a just-announced record fundraising haul \xe2\x80\x94\nalthough, as one attendee said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere was lots of high-fiving.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt was a reminder that, with the Iowa caucuses still seven months away,\nthis is just the beginning. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s operation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t plan to sit on its\nmassive cash pile, but to keep adding to it.\n\n\n\nAccording to sources who attended two days of meetings at the Bush family\xe2\x80\x99s\npicturesque seaside compound, the Bush team outlined a number of ambitious\nnew incentives for donors including one called \xe2\x80\x9cEight for Eight,\xe2\x80\x9d tasking\nmajor bundlers with signing up eight new supporters to make a maximum\n$2,700 contribution by Aug. 8.\n\n\n\nDonors learned Friday morning that the Right to Rise leadership PAC, a\nthird fundraising entity,has hauled in $5 million, bringing the total\ncombined war chest of Bush\xe2\x80\x99s campaign and supporting super PAC, which both\nannounced their fundraising hauls Thursday, to $119 million.\n\n\n\nEven though that\xe2\x80\x99s more than twice the total haul of any other presidential\ncandidates (Ted Cruz sits in second place with a combined $51 million),\nBush\xe2\x80\x99s team reminded donors that there\xe2\x80\x99s more work to be done, and laid out\na near-term schedule of fundraisers and future meetings.\n\n\n\nOne highlight: cocktails with Columba. According to a one source, Bush\xe2\x80\x99s\nwife is scheduled to host a cocktail fundraiser in Washington, DC on July\n22 with a minimum required contribution of $500.\n\n\n\nThe next gathering of Bush donors is likely to take place just days before\nthe first GOP primary debate, scheduled for Aug. 6 in Cleveland; and the\ngroup is planning another get-together in Miami, where the campaign is\nheadquartered, in the fall.\n\n\n\nEven as his campaign is focused on introducing him apart from his\npresidential father and brother, Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s robust fundraising machine is\nbuilt in large part on the strength of his family\xe2\x80\x99s network, which started\nas his mother\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas card list and has been growing for more than 50\nyears.\n\n\n\nWhile Jeb Bush will continue to assume the posture of a humble,\nhard-working candidate, careful to avoid giving off even a whiff of\nentitlement, his campaign\xe2\x80\x99s fundraising prowess is a signal of strength to\nundecided donors that should grease the skids for even more contributions.\n\n\n\nFormer president George H.W. Bush made a brief appearance Friday night\nduring a welcome reception at Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s Point, the home he shares with his\nwife, Barbara Bush, who greeted donors as they arrived.\n\n\n\nAmong those attending: Ron Kaufman, Woody Johnson, Brian McCormack,\nKimberly Fritts, Reg Brown, Al Cardenas, Jamie Wareham and Dirk Van Dongen.\n\n\n\nPresentations from Jeb Bush, finance director Heather Larrison and campaign\nmanager Danny Diaz took place Friday morning. Bush, according to sources,\ntold donors that he is enjoying the campaign and sticking to his plan \xe2\x80\x94 and\nhe promised not to squander their overwhelming financial support.\n\n\n\nAll of them were careful, sources said, not to talk about the Right to Rise\nsuper PAC, which Bush spent the first six months of the year raising money\nfor but is now, as an official candidate, prohibited from coordinating or\ncommunicating with in any way.\n\nBush\xe2\x80\x99s fundraising numbers aren\xe2\x80\x99t just staggering for the amount of money\nraised but the breadth of his donor list. Nearly 10,000 individuals gave\nmoney to his super PAC; of those, 500 gave $25,000 or more. Such a\ndiversified portfolio of donors allows Bush a huge cash advantage and the\nability to compete in every state; and it helps establish his independence\nfrom any individual billionaire.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means he won\xe2\x80\x99t have any one person you can characterize as a\nco-investor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlie Black, a GOP lobbyist who advised George W. Bush\nand Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaigns. \xe2\x80\x9cI think these others that have\nbig super PAC donors are honest, sincere people, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a better\nperception for Jeb that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have one big sugar daddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMike Murphy, who is running Bush\xe2\x80\x99s media operation through the super PAC,\n\xe2\x80\x9chas told donors a number he wants to hit by end of the year,\xe2\x80\x9d a source\nsaid, without divulging what that number is.\n\n\n\nFor the last few weeks, even before the fundraising numbers were released\nThursday, donors headed to Kennebunkport knew the initial effort had hit\nthe mark, that the two days of meetings would be a chance to celebrate the\nearly success and to lay out a path that will sustain it.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t hit their numbers, they\xe2\x80\x99d have been on everyone\xe2\x80\x99s ass for\nthe last several weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d one donor said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that dog didn\xe2\x80\x99t bark, so we\ncould all tell they\xe2\x80\x99d gotten what they wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Is Donald Trump Helping the Bush Brand?\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-10/is-donald-trump-helping-the-bush-brand->\n// Bloomberg // Michael C. Bender \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nWhile Republican Party mandarins wring their hands over Donald Trump\'s\npresidential bid, the celebrity real estate mogul\'s untethered political\napproach may actually be buoying Jeb Bush, the target of his most frequent\nattacks, and making the former Florida governor\xe2\x80\x99s moderate approach to\nimmigration more palatable in the process.\n\n\n\nThat\'s the case for a least some New Hampshire voters who were impressed by\nBush\'s performance at a town hall meeting this week and offered favorable \xe2\x80\x94\nand unprompted \xe2\x80\x94  comparisons to Trump.\n\n\n\n"He seemed to really get into the weeds talking about issues," Dennis\nHogan, the Hillsborough County Attorney, said after listening to Bush. "And\nhe says it in a sellable way. Not like Trump, where you\xe2\x80\x99re saying something\nand you\'re losing as many people as you\'re gaining. We don\xe2\x80\x99t need that in a\nnominee."\n\n\n\nTrump announced his presidential campaign on June 16 by saying the country\nneeds "somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it\ngreat again." But following that speech and a series of interviews,\nRepublican donors and elected leaders have worried about what damage he\'s\ndoing to the party\'s brand.\n\n\n\nNBC, Univision, Macy\'s and other companies cut ties with Trump as he\ndefended his comments that many immigrants in the country illegally are\nrapists. Republican donor John Jordan told the Associated Press on Monday\nthat GOP leaders should take steps to block Trump\'s access to the first\npresidential debate next month. Trump told CNN that Republican National\nCommittee Chairman Reince Preibus asked him to "tone it down a little bit."\n\n\n\nMuch of Trump\'s invective has been targeted at Bush. Trump briefly posted\non his Twitter page, followed by 3.14 million people, another person\'s\ncomment that Bush "has to like the Mexican Illegals" (sic) because his wife\nis from Mexico. Trump called Bush\'s position on education standards\n"pathetic" and ridiculed the former governor for saying many immigrants\nillegally cross the border as "an act of love. "I mean what kind of stuff\nis that?" Trump said on Fox News this week. "It\'s baby stuff."\n\n\n\nThe comments have earned him media attention, and now the top spot in the\nRepublican field, according to a new Economist/YouGov poll. The poll showed\nTrump with support of 15 percent of respondents, 4 percentage points ahead\nof Bush and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. A plurality of respondents, 29\npercent, said they believed Jeb Bush would ultimately win the party\'s\nnomination.\n\n\n\nTrump, who lives part-time in Palm Beach, Florida, has a long and\ncomplicated history with Bush, whose home is about 90 minutes south in\nMiami. The two helped raise money in 1990 for a Nicaraguan presidential\ncandidate. Trump gave $50,000 to the Florida Republican Party while Bush\nwas governor as he unsuccessfully pushed for Bush to expand gambling in the\nstate. Trump has called Bush\'s brother, George W. Bush, "probably the worst\npresident in the history of the United States," and repeatedly says that\nthe "last thing we need is another Bush."\n\n\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Bush was chuckling at criticisms from Trump. Now,\nhe\'s taking it personally. "His views are way out of the mainstream of what\nRepublicans think," Bush told reporters after marching in a pair of Fourth\nof July parades in New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nOn immigration, it can be difficult to define the mainstream of the party.\nTwo of the four U.S. senators running for president backed a bipartisan\nbill that included a path to citizenship for many of the country\'a 12\nmillion undocumented immigrants. But House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio\nRepublican, couldn\'t get enough support for even a watered-down version in\nhis chamber. "This has become the biggest political football I\'ve seen in\nmy congressional career, this whole issue of illegal immigration and what\nto do about it," Boehner told reporters on Thursday.\n\n\n\nBush has thrown himself into the immigration issue, and is attempting to\npersuade his party to take a more moderate position on immigration, arguing\nthat legalizing undocumented workers will boost the economy and help the\nparty.\n\n\n\n"I want to win elections," Bush said while answering an immigration\nquestion on Wednesday at the New Hampshire town hall meeting. "And to win\nwe better start figuring out ways to message our beliefs in a way that\ngives people hope that everybody will be included in the progress that\ncomes with this."\n\n\n\nBush added a dose of humor. When one man started his question about border\ncontrol by saying, "Me gusta Latinos y Mexicanos," Bush laughed. "Maybe you\ncould talk to Donald Trump about that," Bush said. "I don\'t have his\nnumber, but I can find it for you. Give him a call."\n\n\n\nBush, who has led in most recent president polls of New Hampshire, is also\nfiguring out ways to connect with Republican crowds as he pushes a plan\nlegalize undocumented immigrants.\n\n\n\nHe earned applause from the audience when he said he\'d campaign "in Spanish\nand English," and again for tough talk about the death of Kathryn Steinle,\nwho prosecutors say was killed in San Francisco by a Mexican man who had\nalready been deported five times. "We ought to eliminate sanctuary cities,"\nBush said. "We shouldn\'t provide law enforcement monies for cities like San\nFrancisco until they change their policies."\n\n\n\nOn the border, Bush talked about stationing agents closer to the\nU.S.-Mexico line, building a "virtual wall," and using drones to patrol the\narea and "send a signal."\n\n\n\n"Donald Trump is colorful, but Bush is trying to think of a solution,"\nValerie Morelli, a 69-year-old from Amherst said when asked why she was\nimpressed with Bush\'s performance. "One thing I wish is that he (Bush)\nwould still build a wall, even though he said there\xe2\x80\x99s other way to do it."\n\n\n\n"I was impressed," said Ed Gorman, a 66-year-old from Londonderry who has\nconcerns about illegal immigration. "He\'s the first candidate that I\xe2\x80\x99ve\nheard actually say that we have a situation with illegal immigrants, that\nif you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to deport them wholesale, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to deal with them\nhere. And it sounded like he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do that."\n\n\n\nGorman isn\'t totally sold yet. He brought up Trump\'s comments on\nimmigration, saying "there\'s a smidgeon of truth there."\n\n\n\n"The best people are not always coming over, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to support\nanything he said," Gorman said of Trump.\n\n\n\nGorman said he was looking forward to seeing other Republican presidential\ncandidates speak in New Hampshire before making his decision, mentioning\nU.S. Senator Marco Rubio, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and Wisconsin\nGovernor Scott Walker.\n\n\n\n"I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see Trump," he offered. "That\xe2\x80\x99s a waste of my time."\n\n\n\n*Bush raises over $100 million to help his campaign\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/09/politics/bush-fundraising-second-quarter/index.html>\n// CNN // Theodore Schleifer \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015*\n\n\n\nJeb Bush and his allied super PAC raised $114 million to support his\ncampaign, a massive fundraising haul made possible in part by rewriting the\nrules of how presidential campaigns raise money.\n\n\n\nBush\'s super PAC, Right to Rise USA, said Thursday it collected $103\nmillion since January, money that it must spend independently to back\nBush\'s presidential bid. Together, Bush\'s super PAC and campaign came close\nto raising as much money in the first half of 2015 -- a year before a\ngeneral election -- as American Crossroads, the second biggest super PAC in\n2012, did during the entire two-year cycle.\n\n\n\nAll groups will be required to file detailed reports by the end of the\nmonth, but the Bush super PAC raised two and a half times as much as its\ncurrent closest competitor.\n\n\n\nWhat enabled its size was an innovative strategy that some of Bush\'s GOP\nrivals chose to emulate: By not formally running for President, Bush could\nkeep the independent group close by and help it grow into a political and\nfinancial juggernaut.\n\n\n\nFundraisers and strategists had questioned aloud whether or not Bush would\nsucceed in raising the $100 million, a benchmark repeatedly swatted away by\ncampaign aides looking to measure expectations. But it was never in doubt\nthat the former Florida governor would lead the pack by a significant\nmargin.\n\n\n\nThough campaign-finance reformers scoffed at what they saw as Bush\'s\nfeigned indecision, he was able to hire staff, travel the country and share\nstrategy with advisers who soon would be off limits. And most critically of\nall, he was able to headline high-dollar fundraisers for the super PAC for\nsix months, delaying his own campaign launch in order to ask donors for\nunlimited cash that gives him an unparalleled bank account entering the\nsummer.\n\n\n\nBush eventually formally launched his campaign in mid-June, and the\ncampaign itself said it raised $11.4 million in the 16 days between the\nlaunch and the end of the fundraising quarter in June. That haul -- at a\nclip of $710,000 a day -- is all eligible for spending in the primary, his\ncampaign said.\n\n\n\n"Jeb is encouraged and grateful for the tremendous early support and\nenthusiasm his candidacy has generated since he launched his campaign," New\nYork Jets owner Woody Johnson, national finance chairman of Bush\'s\ncampaign, said in a statement.\n\n\n\nYet it is the Los Angeles-based super PAC that will likely play the heavy\nin the Bush political shop. The Right to Rise super PAC made its first\nindependent expenditures on Wednesday to bolster the campaign, releasing an\nadvertisement that compared Bush\'s record on transparency with Clinton\'s.\n\n\n\nThe group, led by longtime Bush senior aide Mike Murphy, had over $98\nmillion cash on hand and raked in contributions from 9,900 donors. Five\nhundred of those contributors gave in excess of $25,000.\n\n\n\nSome campaign reformers reflected on the past six months by charging that\nBush had made a mockery of the super PAC system. David Donnelly, the head\nof the advocacy organization Every Voice, said in a statement "that Bush\nattended dozens of fundraisers to help raise that cash while claiming he\nwasn\'t running for president is the political lie of the year so far."\n\n\n\nSuper PACs directly linked to candidates are playing a more central part in\n2016 than the outside groups ever have before. And Bush\'s super PAC in\nparticular is reported to be playing an even greater role than is\ntraditionally done by outside groups, taking on more of the day-to-day\nfunctions typically run out of a campaign headquarters.\n\n\n\n"We are grateful for the overwhelming response from the thousands of donors\nwho have been drawn to Jeb\'s optimistic message of conservative renewal and\nreform," said Charlie Spies, the election lawyer who is advising Bush and\nhelped Mitt Romney raise more than $150 million for Romney\'s super PAC in\n2012.\n\n\n\nThe cash announced by Bush Thursday also does not include any money raised\nby an allied nonprofit group, Right to Rise Policy Solutions. That group\nwon\'t be required to disclose its contributors.\n\n\n\nDrawing on his family\'s vast network of experienced bundlers and\ndeep-pocketed donors, the Bush fundraising operation is likely to well\noutperform its nearest competitors. But despite the campaign\'s opening\nattempt to convince rival Republicans to pass on the race by exclusively\nsecuring major donors -- a "shock and awe" salvo, as some allies described\nit -- Bush will be joined by 16 other Republicans in the race for the White\nHouse.\n\n\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz posted a greater second-quarter fundraising total than\nBush\'s campaign did, collecting $14.2 million, though he had much more time\nto raise the cash and that sum includes a small amount of money earmarked\nfor the general election. His four linked super PACs claim together claim\nto have raised just under $38 million, putting Cruz likely in second place\nin the fundraising competition.\n\n\n\nAnd on the Democratic side, a set of groups backing Hillary Clinton say\nthey have raised $24 million and her campaign has raised $45 million.\n\n\n\nOther top raisers include Florida senator Marco Rubio, who has a nonprofit\ngroup and a super PAC that raised $16 million each. His official campaign\nhas not yet said how much it raised in the second quarter.\n\n\n\nBush is currently in Kennebunkport, Maine, huddling with these top donors\nand bundlers.\n\n\n\n*Bush rips Obama over OPM hack, but had data issues of own in Florida\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/09/politics/jeb-bush-florida-data-breach/index.html>\n// CNN // Chris Frates \xe2\x80\x93 July 9, 2015 *\n\n\n\nAfter news broke last month that suspected Chinese hackers stole the\nsensitive personal data of millions of Americans from the federal\ngovernment\'s human resources department, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\ncalled for the agency\'s director to be fired.\n\n\n\nBut when a human resources company Florida hired compromised the personal\ninformation of an estimated 100,000 state employees, then-Gov. Bush didn\'t\nfire the contractor.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the state official who managed the contract, Bill Simon, is now\nhelping Bush build his presidential campaign\'s policy team.\n\n\n\nIn 2006, the Florida Department of Management Services estimated that\n108,000 then-current and former state employees may have been affected when\ntheir personal data, managed by Convergys Corporation, was improperly sent\nto India by a subcontractor, Computerworld reported at the time.\n\n\n\nBush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said Thursday night that Bush\'s\nadministration acted quickly to address the issue, including strengthening\nsecurity measures, providing protection for potentially affected employees\nand tightening oversight of the program.\n\n\n\nBut Bush didn\'t cancel the company\'s $350 million contract.\n\n\n\nCampbell argued that the recent Office of Personnel Management case and the\nFlorida incident are not comparable.\n\n\n\n"This was not a national security breach or threat," she said. "The OPM\nbreach was just another example of President Obama\'s failed and flawed\nleadership."\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to the federal government\'s data breach, the Republican\npresidential contender has had tough words for OPM Director Katherine\nArchuleta. On Thursday, the agency announced the breach compromised the\ndata of 21.5 million Americans, about five times more people than\noriginally estimated.\n\n\n\n"The Office of Personnel Management head, a woman who was the political\ndirector of the Obama re-election campaign, a political hack, in charge of\nsomething of that responsibility, said \'No one was responsible at OPM for\nthis. The Chinese government was responsible,\'" Bush told a crowded VFW\nhall in New Hampshire Wednesday night. "No ma\'am, you\'re responsible for\nit, and you ought to be fired for incompetence."\n\n\n\nAsked by reporters Wednesday if it was appropriate to compare the OPM\nbreach to the data compromise that occurred during Bush\'s governorship, he\nstrongly pushed back.\n\n\n\n"I\'d say its a slight difference when you have up to 18 million records\nthat are stolen by a foreign government where security clearances are\njeopardized, where people are filling out 100-page forms sharing their\nwhole life history to find out if they are qualified for a security\nclearance controlled by a foreign government," Bush said.\n\n\n\n*Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s $114 million haul: By the numbers\n<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/jeb-bushs-114-million-haul-the-numbers> //\nMSNBC // Aliyah Frumin \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to fundraising, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush\nhas blown his GOP and Democratic competition out of the water.

MSNBC\xe2\x80\x99s Aliyah Frumin reported\nthat the former governor\xe2\x80\x99s super PAC has raised a staggering $114.4\nmillion, on top of the $11.4 million Bush\xe2\x80\x99s campaign itself raised in the\n16 days following his formal launch.\n\nTo put this in perspective, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner,\nraised $45 million in the second quarter, on top of the $15.6 million haul\nfor the pro-Clinton super PAC. Those totals were widely seen as pretty\nimpressive \xe2\x80\x93 initially the best of any candidate in either party \xe2\x80\x93 though\nthey pale in comparison to the Bush fundraising juggernaut.\n\nThe former governor\xe2\x80\x99s fundraising prowess is all the more impressive in\nlight of the enormous field of Republican candidates \xe2\x80\x93 with 17 candidates\nvying for contributions from GOP donors, it\xe2\x80\x99s that much more difficult for\none contender to dominate. Bush nevertheless has more than doubled the\nmoney raised by his next closest Republican rival.\n\nBut what struck me as funny about all of this was a quote in the Associated\nPress report about Bush\xe2\x80\x99s fundraising success.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa6Bill Kunkler, a Chicago private equity executive and Bush donor, said that\nwhile the Bush name may have opened some doors, it\xe2\x80\x99s Jeb Bush who closed\nthe deal.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople have been willing to take a look, and he\xe2\x80\x99s overcome the people who\nhave said, \xe2\x80\x98Not another Bush,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Kunkler said Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are looking\nat him as a guy who did it on his own, and who stands on his own.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s amusing about this is how wrong it is.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to take away anything from Bush\xe2\x80\x99s fundraising totals \xe2\x80\x93\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re genuinely impressive \xe2\x80\x93 but by no fair measure is he someone who\nsucceeded and stands \xe2\x80\x9con his own.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs regular readers may recall, the New York Times reported earlier in the\nyear that Jeb Bush spent much of his adult life taking advantage of his\nfamily connections to advance his interests and ambitions. In Florida,\npeople went out of their way to get close to Bush in the hopes that he\xe2\x80\x99d\nrelay messages and suggestions to his powerful relatives \xe2\x80\x93 which he\nroutinely did.\n\nWhen Bush decided to run for president, he quickly exploited a \xe2\x80\x9cwide\nnetwork of donors who supported his father and brother.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, when\nfundraising appeals started reaching GOP donors, they were sent directly\nfrom his father, mother, brother, and even his son (an elected official in\nTexas). It\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with a life filled with unique opportunities made\navailable to Jeb because of his powerful last name and political legacy.\n\nMaybe the voting public will care about this, maybe not. But either way, if\n\xe2\x80\x9cpeople are looking at him as a guy who did it on his own, and who stands\non his own,\xe2\x80\x9d those people are mistaken.\n\n\n\n*Paul Ryan Explains What Jeb Bush meant When He Said Americans Should Work\nLonger Hours\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/10/jeb-bush-paul-ryan_n_7772234.html>\n// HuffPo // Michael McAuliff \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nRep. Paul Ryan, who was Mitt Romney\'s vice presidential nominee in 2012,\ndeclined Friday to say whether 2016 contender Jeb Bush\'s recent declaration\nthat "Americans need to work longer hours" was as damaging as Romney\'s\ninfamous "47 percent" remarks.\n\n\n\n"You\'re Huffington Post aren\'t you? What the hell?" the Wisconsin\nRepublican joked at first.\n\n\n\nBut Ryan, a notorious data geek, did offer his interpretation of what Bush\nmeant to say.\n\n\n\n"I think what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about is the fact that there are too many people\nin America who have part-time jobs who want full-time jobs. That\xe2\x80\x99s a\nproblem; that\'s what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about," Ryan said. "If you get into the\nlabor force participation rates, inside of that, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of part-time\nworkers who don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be part-time workers, who want to be full-time\nworkers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBush was hammered over the remark by commentators and the campaign of\nHillary Clinton, which noted that Americans are the most productive workers\nin the world, and that while productivity has kept on rising, it is pay\nthat has lagged. On top of that, Gallup reports that American workers\nalready average nearly 47 hours per week.\n\n\n\nStill, part-time workers\' share of the workforce has been slowly falling\nsince it peaked at 20 percent after the recession. It still stands at 18.6\npercent, a couple of points higher than before the recession.\n\n\n\nAsked how many times Bush would now have to say it Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s way, Ryan said,\n"Welcome to politics."\n\n\n\n*Does Jeb Bush Understand Economics?\n<http://www.newsweek.com/jeb-bush-its-stupid-economy-352232> // Newsweek //\nKurt Eichenwald \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush set off a firestorm this week by\nappearing to say in a newspaper interview that Americans should work longer\nhours. Democrats pounced, even as the Bush campaign said his comments were\ntaken out of context.\n\n\n\nBut everyone is missing the real story. Whether Bush\xe2\x80\x99s comment was a\ncriticism of American workers or a lament about a weakened job market, his\nwords demonstrated such a lack of knowledge of economics that it\xe2\x80\x99s\nvirtually impossible to understand what was the context of his words.\n\n\n\nBush\xe2\x80\x99s full statement was: \xe2\x80\x9cMy aspiration for the country and I believe we\ncan achieve it, is 4% growth as far as the eye can see. Which means we have\nto be a lot more productive, workforce participation has to rise from its\nall-time modern lows. It means that people need to work longer hours and,\nthrough their productivity, gain more income for their families.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThis word salad mixes together different economic terms as if they mean the\nsame thing and reaches for statistics that are, quite simply, ridiculous.\nPerhaps Bush was just sloppy in his language, but whatever aide is prepping\nhim on economics needs to do a better job\xe2\x80\x93maybe by working longer hours.\n\n\n\nThe key terms in his statement are growth, workforce participation,\nproductivity and income. His campaign insisted that when he said \xe2\x80\x9cpeople\nneed to work longer hours,\xe2\x80\x9d he was referring to them being able to obtain\njobs that are full-time or offer close to full-time hours. Bush speaks of\nthese economic concepts as if they are all interlinked; some are, some\naren\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\n\n\nStart with 4% growth \xe2\x80\x9cas far as the eye can see.\xe2\x80\x9d Lots of problems there.\nConstant growth at that rate has never been achieved in the history of the\nUnited States. In fact, the average from the boom of 1947 to this year is\n3.26%. Even the Republican saint, Ronald Reagan, only achieved an average\nof 3.5%. The longest period during which the United States achieved 4% or\ngreater growth was four years, under President Bill Clinton. So\nessentially, Bush has as his aspiration something that has no precedent in\nhistory.\n\n\n\nBut this part of Bush\xe2\x80\x99s comment has both a logical flaw and a sign he\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t been paying much attention to political language over the years. As\nshould be obvious, no one can see growth rates into the future, so the idea\nof growth \xe2\x80\x9cas far as the eye can see\xe2\x80\x9d is the kind of clumsy infelicity that\nshould raise an eyebrow. \xe2\x80\x9cAs far as the eye can see,\xe2\x80\x9d though, is a common\nterm used by politicians in reference to one element of economics: deficits.\n\n\n\nThe phrase was first popularized during the Reagan administration by David\nStockman, then the director of the Office of Management and Budget. In a\n1981 interview with the journalist William Grieder, Stockman let slip the\ndirty secret of the Reagan budgets: that there would be $200 billion\ndeficits \xe2\x80\x9cas far as the eye can see.\xe2\x80\x9d (Just $200 billion? Ah, those were\nthe days.) Since then, politicians on both sides have used the term\nendlessly to refer to deficits. (John Boehner, the speaker of the House,\nsaid it just a few months ago.) Given that rapid deficit growth started\nunder Reagan, reversed under Clinton and then exploded to astronomical\nheights under Bush\xe2\x80\x99s brother, using phrases that make no logical sense and\nare connected to huge economic blunders isn\xe2\x80\x99t smart.\n\n\n\nJust as with the growth rates, Bush\xe2\x80\x99s original\xe2\x80\x93and revised\xe2\x80\x93statements about\nemployees working more hours is statistical hooey. The average annual hours\nper worker has essentially been unchanged for many, many years. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take\nthe best full economic year during the George W. Bush presidency\xe2\x80\x932005\xe2\x80\x93and\ncompare it to the worst under President Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x932011. Under Bush,\nAmerican workers put in an average of 34.6 hours of work a week. Under\nObama, they worked an average of 34.3 hours a week. That\xe2\x80\x99s a difference of\n3 minutes and 36 seconds a day, which translates for the median worker\nsalary to $1.62 (for minimum wage workers, it\xe2\x80\x99s 39 cents). The problem is\nthat American business believes\xe2\x80\x93unwisely\xe2\x80\x93that using contractors and\npart-timers boosts profits. How does Bush plan to make economic growth\nrates translate into longer hours when that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened in the past 15\nyears? He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x93he\xe2\x80\x99s just saying things.\n\n\n\nBush\xe2\x80\x99s statement about workforce participation is correct\xe2\x80\x93sort of. No doubt\nthe low workforce participation rate signals a weak recovery. But unlike\nthe unemployment rate, the participation rate is a complex amalgam of\nissues. According to a just-released report by the American Enterprise\nInstitute\xe2\x80\x93a respected center-right think tank in Washington\xe2\x80\x93the meaning\nbehind the statistics is much more complex than Bush implies. AEI says\nworkforce participation has shrunk 3% since the Great Recession, but it\ncites a report from Barclay\xe2\x80\x99s attributing two points of that drop to the\naging population. The report also notes that women have been dropping out\nof the workforce in a constant pattern since the mid-1990s. Still, there is\nno doubt that there are plenty of chronically unemployed people who have\ndropped out of the job market, so Bush gets a point.\n\n\n\nBut the rest of his comment makes him a loser in this game.\n\n\n\nHe says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to be a lot more productive,\xe2\x80\x9d and then later refers to\nproductivity. This clearly demonstrates he has no idea what has been going\non in the economy. Productivity means something in economics. As a\ncomparison, it would be like saying the word \xe2\x80\x9cinflation\xe2\x80\x9d in an economic\nstatement but then arguing you were referring to the expanding American\nwaistline.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to productivity, American workers have been doing a great\njob. Productivity, which is the economic output per worker, has grown\nrelentlessly since 1947 in almost a straight upward line. Implying that\nAmericans aren\xe2\x80\x99t being productive enough is about the same as saying\nMcDonald\xe2\x80\x99s doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sell enough hamburgers. How much is enough to Bush? If\nrecord productivity\xe2\x80\x93with a cumulative growth of almost 300% since\n1947\xe2\x80\x93doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cut it, what does?\n\n\n\nThere is no context where \xe2\x80\x9cwe have to be more productive\xe2\x80\x9d means anything\nother than \xe2\x80\x9cpush yourselves past record levels, workers!\xe2\x80\x9d That is, unless\nBush doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what the word means.\n\n\n\nBut with this full statement, he has also demonstrated that he has no idea\nof the real problem facing American workers. No doubt, he is blaming them\nfor their stagnant wages\xe2\x80\x93all that\xe2\x80\x99s needed is more hours of work, and wages\nwill improve significantly.\n\n\n\nAs history proves, that\xe2\x80\x99s hokum. America went through nearly a century\nwhere the profits generated by growth in worker productivity was shared\xe2\x80\x93the\nmore they produced, the more money everyone made. What Bush and far too\nmany Republicans refuse to acknowledge is that wages and productivity\nbecame uncoupled around 1973: Productivity goes up, corporate profits go\nup, the rich get wealthier, but the financial benefits don\xe2\x80\x99t trickle down\nto workers. Since the great uncoupling, the only times there was\nsignificant percentage wage growth that even vaguely mimicked productivity\ngrowth were in the Carter and Clinton administrations. (Both George W. Bush\nand Obama had short periods of wage growth, but nothing to brag about.)\n\n\n\nAmerican history\xe2\x80\x99s most productive workers are not responsible for the fact\nthat they aren\xe2\x80\x99t paid enough. Do Bush and his GOP cohorts really believe\nthat the wealthy are sitting in their offices, twiddling their thumbs,\nwaiting for workers to demand more money that will then be handed over\ngladly? Wages are growing at their lowest level since World War II. In\nfact, income inequality is worse today than it was in 1774, even when\nslavery is included in the numbers, according to a study by the National\nBureau of Economic Research.\n\n\n\nThe bottom line: Folks are missing the real news in Bush\xe2\x80\x99s jumble of\neconomic words. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what is happening in the economy, he\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what economic terms mean and he is willing to blame workers\nfor their own stagnant wages by proclaiming all that is needed is for them\nto get more hours a week at the job. And what he leaves off the table? That\nthe problem is his friends in corporate America, whose wages keep\nskyrocketing because of growing productivity per worker, which allows the\ncompanies to shed workers, creating a larger pool of labor going after a\nshrinking number of jobs, putting more downward pressure on wages\xe2\x80\x93an\nunbreakable cycle that will continue as far as the eye can see.  Add to\nthat corporate outsourcing of jobs overseas, and Bush\xe2\x80\x99s simplistic \xe2\x80\x9cwork\nmore hours\xe2\x80\x9d blather\xe2\x80\x93regardless of whether he meant what the Democrats says\nor his campaign says\xe2\x80\x93is shown up for the nonsense it is.\n\n\n\nBush needs to\xe2\x80\x93but certainly won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x93take a new approach. Rather than telling\nemployees that record workforce productivity needs to be even higher, he\nneeds to let his wealthy friends know that record-high income is enough.\nAlready, several of the super-rich have warned their compatriots that the\ntype of massive economic inequality being experienced in the United States\nhas never ended well throughout global history, and that policy changes are\nneeded before mobs start slamming heads on pikes. Unfortunately, with his\nrecent comment proving his feeble understanding of economics and his\nwillingness to attribute low wages to largely irrelevant issues, Jeb Bush\nhas proved he does not have the courage or the knowledge to lead that\npolicy transformation.\n\n\n\n*RUBIO*\n\n\n\n*Marco Rubio Calls Abortion Rights \xe2\x80\x98Indefensible\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 and Knocks Down\n\xe2\x80\x98Pro-Abortion\xe2\x80\x99 Straw Man\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-10/marco-rubio-calls-abortion-rights-indefensible-and-knocks-down-pro-abortion-straw-man>\n// Bloomberg // Sahil Kapur \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nAt the National Right to Life Convention on Friday, Florida Senator Marco\nRubio touted his opposition to abortion rights, long a prerequisite for\nbeing a viable Republican presidential candidate.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the crowd in New Orleans, he hit all the necessary notes \xe2\x80\x94\nlegal abortion is "the taking of innocent life on a massive scale"; Roe v.\nWade was an "egregiously flawed Supreme Court decision"; the case for\nabortion rights is "indefensible."\n\n\n\nIf an embryo is "not a person, what is it? Because if you left it alone,\nthat\'s the only thing it can become," he said. "It can\xe2\x80\x99t develop into a\npony!" Though he didn\'t mention it in his speech, Rubio has supported three\nexceptions to making abortion illegal\xe2\x80\x94in cases of rape, incest and if the\nmother\'s life is at stake.\n\n\n\nAlso notable was his message of respect for proponents of legal abortion,\nuncommon for a cause that has sparked ugly clashes and divisive rhetoric\nbetween the opposing sides for generations. He knocked down a straw man by\nsome of the more aggressive opponents of the cause, namely the notion that\nits supporters want more abortions.\n\n\n\n"You can judge a cause by the arguments made on both sides. For example, I\nrarely meet anyone who\'s willing to say they\'re pro-abortion," Rubio said.\n"They\'ll say they\'re pro-choice, but almost everyone I\'ve met says that\nthey personally disagree with abortion. That alone tells us a little about\nthe basic common sense the issue is built on."\n\n\n\nRubio\'s appearance at the National Right to Life Convention came fresh off\na three-day swing in Iowa packed with speeches, during which he didn\'t\nmention abortion. On Friday, he connected his abortion message to his\noverall pitch for the presidency\xe2\x80\x94about reviving a disappearing American\nDream. "And it is fundamentally impossible," he said, "for America to reach\nher destiny as a nation founded on the equal rights of all if our\ngovernment believes an entire segment of the human population doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have\na right to exist."\n\n\n\n*Marco Rubio: Roe v. Wade Was \xe2\x80\x98Egregiously Flawed Decision\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/10/marco-rubio-abortion_n_7772510.html?1436557719>\n// HuffPo // Laura Bassett \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) laid out his strong anti-abortion views in a\nspeech on Friday, calling the Supreme Court\'s landmark abortion rights\ndecision in Roe v. Wade a "historically, egregiously flawed decision" that\n"has condoned the taking of innocent life on a massive scale."\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is fundamentally impossible for America to reach her destiny as a\nnation founded on the equal rights of all if our government believes an\nentire segment of the human population doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a right to exist," the\n2016 presidential candidate said at the National Right to Life Convention\nin New Orleans.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court legalized abortion in the 1973 decision, ruling that\nstates cannot prevent women from obtaining the procedure up until the fetus\nwould be viable outside the womb, around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy. In\nthe years before abortion was legal, it was common for women to land in the\nhospital after seeking illegal, "back-alley" abortions or attempting to\nself-induce. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that\nin 1972, the year before Roe v. Wade, 130,000 women obtained illegal or\nself-induced procedures, and 39 of them died.\n\n\n\nRepublicans in Congress are currently trying to chip away at Roe v. Wade by\nbanning abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy. Rubio and nearly every other\nRepublican presidential candidate has endorsed the legislation. Ten states\nhave enacted similar abortion limits, and anti-abortion advocates hope one\nof the laws eventually makes its way to the Supreme Court and overturns Roe.\n\n\n\nRubio said Friday that the issue of abortion is "more than political or\npolicy-related. It is a definitional issue about the kind of country we\nwant to be."\n\n\n\nAccording to a recent Gallup poll, half of Americans consider themselves\n"pro-choice," while 44 percent identify as "pro-life." But Rubio said he\nbelieves that nearly every American is personally opposed to the procedure,\nregardless of whether they think it should be legal.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can judge a cause by the arguments made on both sides. For example, I\nrarely meet anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s willing to say they\xe2\x80\x99re pro-abortion,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll say they\xe2\x80\x99re pro-choice, but almost everyone I\xe2\x80\x99ve met says that\nthey personally disagree with abortion. That alone tells us a little about\nthe basic common sense the issue is built on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Rubio: Confederate Flag A \xe2\x80\x9cDeeply Painful Symbol\xe2\x80\x9d For Millions, Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nBe On Government Buildings\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/rubio-confederate-flag-a-deeply-painful-symbol-for-millions#.mbRoP2Qvg>\n// BuzzFeed // Andrew Kaczynski \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Marco Rubio on the Michael Medved Show\nThursday said that although for some the Confederate Flag is a symbol of\nheritage, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have to recognize that for millions of Americans, it is a\ndeeply painful symbol and that\xe2\x80\x99s why it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be over government\nbuildings, as it is not in Florida and it will now not be over in South\nCarolina.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s the full quote:\n\n\n\nIt was the right decision for South Carolina to make. I knew they would\nmake the decision that was best for them. I had trust and faith in their\nprocess and in their leadership. And I felt strongly that outsiders should\nnot be coming in and telling them what to do. That they knew what to do and\nthey would do it. And I thought it would be counterproductive. Look, I know\npeople who see the confederate flag as a symbol of their heritage, not as a\nsymbol of racism. But I also know people, many people, who see it as a\nsymbol of pain. For them, it\xe2\x80\x99s a reminder of an era in which in this\ncountry human beings were enslaved. And so, that\xe2\x80\x99s why in Florida and in\nmany parts of the country, people have decided that the time has come for\nthat flag not to be displayed in government buildings. And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s, you\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x94 it is possible to say you agree with that decision, as I do,\nand also say that we recognize, that, for many people, the flag \xe2\x80\x94 the\nreason that they\xe2\x80\x99re tied to it is not because of racism. They\xe2\x80\x99re not\nracist, it\xe2\x80\x99s a cultural attachment. But we have to recognize that for\nmillions of Americans, it is a deeply painful symbol and that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be over government buildings, as it is not in Florida and it will\nnow not be over in South Carolina.\n\n\n\n*As Donald Trump Riles GOP Race, Marco Rubio Begins to Connect With Voters\nIn Spanish\n<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-riles-gop-race-marco-rubio-begins/story?id=32357758>\n// ABC // Ines de la Cuetara \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nOn the campaign trail this week, Marco Rubio chatted with a woman from San\nSalvador. Claudia Steele, who is now an American citizen and a voter,\neagerly told him she would do everything she could to support his\npresidential bid. Rubio thanked her, and the two discussed politics and\nfamily \xe2\x80\x94 all in Spanish.\n\n\n\nWhen Steele told Rubio she was the only Latina member of her local\nRepublican organization, Rubio answered, smiling, "Hay que cambiar eso.\xe2\x80\x9d\n(Translation: \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to change that.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\n\n\nBut this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t downtown Miami. It was a western suburb of Des Moines, Iowa.\n\n\n\nWhile Republicans worry recent comments by Donald Trump comparing illegal\nimmigrants to rapists and drug dealers may harm the party\xe2\x80\x99s chances with\nHispanic voters during the 2016 election cycle, the 44 year-old Senator\nfrom Florida was welcomed with open arms \xe2\x80\x94 quite literally \xe2\x80\x94 by the Spanish\nspeakers who came to meet him over the course of his three-day swing in\nIowa. According to 2003 U.S. Census bureau, just 5.5 percent of the\npopulation of the Hawkeye State identifies as Hispanic or Latino, but more\nthan a few found Rubio this week.\n\n\n\nSteele said she thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s important Rubio speaks Spanish.

It says those things can only happen after\ncertain conditions have been met, none of which have been met. As\npresident, I will follow the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, has been the leading opponent in the US\nCongress of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s overtures to the island nation.\n\n\n\nEver since the president announced in December that the US would end a\nhalf-century diplomatic freeze with Cuba, Rubio has publicly castigated the\nadministration at every turn \xe2\x80\x93 be it the lifting of certain commercial and\ntravel sanctions, the removal of Cuba from a list of state sponsors of\nterrorism, and Obama\xe2\x80\x99s announcement last week on the reopening of embassies\nbetween Washington and Havana.\n\n\n\nIn addition to saying he would reverse those steps, Rubio also defended his\nsteadfast opposition to lifting the 50-year-old US trade embargo on Cuba \xe2\x80\x93\nwhich critics argue has taken a significant humanitarian toll on the Cuban\npeople while doing little to deter the grip on power of the Castro brothers.\n\n\n\nOpponents of the embargo, Rubio said, \xe2\x80\x9cfundamentally misunderstand\xe2\x80\x9d its\npurpose.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe purpose of the embargo was not to overthrow Fidel Castro \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s what\nthe Bay of Pigs was about, that\xe2\x80\x99s what Operation Mongoose was about, but\nnot the embargo,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio said, referring to the failed missions under\nPresident John F Kennedy in the early 1960s to help the Cuban people\noverthrow the communist regime.\n\n\n\nThe intent of the sanctions, Rubio argued, was to protect the property of\nAmericans and other private owners and prevent stolen goods from being\ntrafficked into the United States as well as to serve as leverage against\nthe Castros.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe could have used, and can use, economic sanctions through the embargo as\na leverage to gain democratic concessions and openings for the Cuban people\nin exchange for alleviating some of these conditions, especially the\ndiplomatic recognition and the removal of Cuba from the state sponsor of\nterrorism list,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cubans have basically achieved all of\nthose concessions and in return have done nothing to change \xe2\x80\xa6 The only\nthing that will change is the amount of money the regime will have access\nto.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nJeb Bush, regarded as one of Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s main rivals in a crowded pathway to\nthe Republican nomination for president, has similarly opposed the Obama\nadministration\xe2\x80\x99s Cuba policy but offered a less definitive response when\nasked if he would allow a US embassy in Havana to remain open.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably not,\xe2\x80\x9d Bush, a former governor of Florida, told the editorial\nboard of the New Hampshire Union Leader newspaper this week. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t\ngiven thought about undoing a work in progress.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRubio has pledged to oppose whoever Obama nominates as ambassador to Cuba \xe2\x80\x93\na post that must be confirmed by the US Senate, where he sits on the\ninfluential foreign relations committee. Republican lawmakers in Washington\nhave also refused to take up Obama\xe2\x80\x99s request to lift the trade embargo,\nwhich requires an act of Congress.\n\n\n\nRubio\xe2\x80\x99s unwavering position on US policy toward Cuba is a point of contrast\nin a presidential campaign built on the notion that he is a next-generation\nleader with fresh ideas to usher in what he has dubbed \xe2\x80\x9ca new American\ncentury\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\n\nIn seven stops this week through different parts of the early battleground\nstate of Iowa, the earliest-voting state in the primaries, the 44-year-old\nsenator sought to convince voters that he is the candidate of the future\nwhile declaring that \xe2\x80\x9cyesterday is over\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 an implicit dig both a Bush and\nat Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nBut those in favor of rapprochement in US-Cuba relations see the 50-year\npolicy upheld until Obama\xe2\x80\x99s reversal late last year as decidedly\nantiquated, and at odds with recent decades of bipartisan support for\nliberalizing international trade with the express purpose of expanding\npolitical and economic opportunity around the world.\n\n\n\nRubio himself referred to two such examples \xe2\x80\x93 China and Vietnam \xe2\x80\x93 in a\nWednesday op-ed in the New York Times, but to make a counterpoint: that\ndespite the opening up of economic pathways, both China and Vietnam remain\nnotorious violators of basic human rights.\n\n\n\nAsked if he believed the US should then no longer engage in trade with\nChina or Vietnam, Rubio conceded there was a \xe2\x80\x9cgeopolitical reality\xe2\x80\x9d that\nset the two apart from Cuba \xe2\x80\x93 especially with respect to China.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the second largest economy in the world, it has nuclear weapons, it\xe2\x80\x99s\nthe second largest military or the third largest on the planet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a reality there that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist with Cuba that we have to\naddress. It just is what it is \xe2\x80\x93 we have to balance geopolitical reality.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRubio added that concessions to China had nonetheless forced the US to go\nsilent on human rights abuses there, and his broader point was that China,\nVietnam and Burma disproved the argument that economic engagement will pave\nthe way for a political transformation.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is proof that economic engagement alone does not lead a reluctant\ntyranny to open up democratically,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio said, before identifying the\nbiggest difference, in his view, in the analogy. \xe2\x80\x9cChina\xe2\x80\x99s half a world\naway, Vietnam is half a world away \xe2\x80\x93 Cuba is 90 miles from our shores. It\nis not in the national security interest of the United States to have a\ncommunist, anti-American tyranny 90 miles from our shores.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe said prerequisites necessary for him to consider engagement with Cuba\nwould be free and fair elections, independence of the media, the right to\norganize political parties, freedom of assembly, and the release of\npolitical prisoners.\n\n\n\nRubio further referenced reports of a crackdown last weekend in which\nnearly a hundred peaceful activists were detained by Cuban authorities, and\nprominent activist Antonio G Rodiles was beaten, to underscore his point\nthat engagement at this juncture was futile.\n\n\n\nThe reports of the arrests were confirmed by the State Department earlier\nthis week. A spokesman expressed concern, but argued that such behavior\nfurther reinforced \xe2\x80\x9cthe need to move forward\xe2\x80\x9d with restoring diplomatic\nrelations.\n\n\n\nObama acknowledged in his own remarks last week that \xe2\x80\x9cvery serious\ndifferences\xe2\x80\x9d will continue between the two countries on freedom of speech\nand assembly, and access to information, while proposing engagement as the\nmeans through which change can occur.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody expects Cuba to be transformed overnight,\xe2\x80\x9d Obama said in his speech\non the reopening of embassies. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I believe that American engagement\nthrough our embassy, our businesses and most of all through our people, is\nour best way to advance our interests and support for democracy and human\nrights.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAlthough the president did not mention Rubio by name, he criticized\nRepublicans who have rejected his approach. Obama cited public opinion in\nboth the US and Cuba showing a majority support for re-establishing ties,\nand urged Republicans to \xe2\x80\x9clisten to the Cuban people, the American people\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\n\nAsked for his response to polling putting the public at odds with his view\n\xe2\x80\x93 which includes a majority of Americans, as well as Cuban Americans, and\nresidents of Cuba \xe2\x80\x93 Rubio was unfazed.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t ever believe a president should conduct foreign policy on the\nbasis of polls,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cA president\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to lead. A president\xe2\x80\x99s\nsupposed to do what\xe2\x80\x99s right for the country even if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t popular,\nparticularly when it comes to national security issues. A president needs\nto view things with a 20-, a 10- and a 5-year outlook, not what\xe2\x80\x99s\nimmediately gratifying. One of the biggest failures of this administration\nis that it\xe2\x80\x99s tried to use foreign policy for domestic political\nconsiderations.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRubio added that the opinion of Americans would shift if they were more\ninformed on the implications of opening up ties with Cuba, which he said\nwould be an \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic opening to the Cuban regime [that] controls the\nentire economy\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\n\nAlthough Rubio did not raise in detail his stance on Cuba while courting\nseveral packed rooms across Iowa this week, he drew heavily on his personal\nstory, as he has since declaring his candidacy for the White House. He\nrecounted how his parents left Cuba in the 1956 in search of a better\nfuture.\n\n\n\nTheir realization of the American Dream \xe2\x80\x93 Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s father worked as a\nbartender and his mother a maid \xe2\x80\x93 is what set the United States apart from\nthe place his parents once called home he said.\n\n\n\nThe senator launched his presidential campaign in April from the Freedom\nTower in Miami, Florida, which served for more than a decade starting in\nthe early 1960s as the first stop for Cuban exiles seeking asylum in the\nUnited States.\n\n\n\nCuban Americans living in Florida who are registered Republicans continue\nto overwhelmingly oppose Obama\xe2\x80\x99s new Cuba policy.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat combination has been steadfastly anti-Castro and pro-embargo,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nDr. Gregory Weeks, an expert on Latin America who heads the political\nscience department at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\nis how Cuban-American Republicans have been for many, many years and\nsomething that is very only slowly changing. That\xe2\x80\x99s how [Rubio has]\ndeveloped politically. He also sees that as part of a package that includes\nrelations with Iran, Russia and dealing with Isis, indicative of what he\nbelieves is a broader weakness of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut unravelling the steps the administration has already taken would be\npolitically risky, according to Richard Feinberg, a senior fellow at the\nBrookings Institution and an architect of the first Summit of the Americas.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLatin America as a whole would be outraged. It would be incredibly costly\nfor Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s US policies throughout the region,\xe2\x80\x9d Feinberg said. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo years\nfrom now it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be difficult for any Republican to completely\nreverse the initiative of this administration.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Marco Rubio: The American Dream Is Really A Universal Dream?\n<http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/10/marco-rubio-the-american-dream-is-really-a-universal-dream/>\n// Breitbart // Michelle Moons \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) addressed Freedom Fest attendees Friday night with\na message centered around the idea of the American Dream, the story of his\nparents\xe2\x80\x99 immigration, and his own success.\n\n\n\nRubio is one of two presidential candidates reaching out to a mix of about\n2,000 conservative and libertarian-leaning conference goers. The other\nattendee is the new Republican frontrunner, real estate mogul Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nRubio recalled the story of his hard-working Cuban parents who immigrated\nto the United States in 1956. His father worked as a bartender, his mother\nmainly as a maid. He made it a point that he lived in Las Vegas for six\nyears as a kid. The story, which he has told during many a speech,\ncontrasts his father\xe2\x80\x99s work at the back of a room to propel Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s later\nascension to a podium at the front of the room.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe call it the American dream, but it really is a universal dream,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio\ndeclared. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople all over the world have this dream, they\xe2\x80\x99ve had it for\nmillennia, the desire not just to be better off and to earn a better life,\nbut to leave their kids better off than themselves. Why they call it the\nAmerican dream is because so many millions of people have been able to\nachieve it here and not enough places. That\xe2\x80\x99s the real American Dream.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the spiritual principal. Every human being, not every human being\nborn in North America, every human being is born with certain rights, life,\nliberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe road to the American Dream has gotten narrower\xe2\x80\x9d because of two things,\nRubio said. He listed the globalization of the economy and advances in\ntechnology as those two obstacles.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe now compete with people half way around the world for the best ideas,\nthe best talent, the best innovations, the best jobs, the best companies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the relaxing of protections for American workers that has been\ncriticized, as American workers have been replaced by foreign H1B visa\nworkers in instances such as the Disney layoffs. Rubio has come under\ncontinual criticism for lax stances on immigration, including his role in\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cGang of 8\xe2\x80\x9d immigration reform bill.\n\n\n\nHe went on to note that today, even bartender and maid positions require\nmore advanced training and technology in the 21st century.\n\n\n\nHe seemed to pick up Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)96%\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccartel\xe2\x80\x9d terminology,\ncalling the traditional higher education system an \xe2\x80\x9cexisting and stagnant\ncartel.\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz has been emphasizing the idea of the \xe2\x80\x9cWashington Cartel\xe2\x80\x9d in\nhis speeches and new book.\n\n\n\nRubio touched on a complicated, burdensome tax system and regulatory system.\n\n\n\nHe closed with \xe2\x80\x9cI have a debt to America I will never repay,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the\njourney from the back of the room to the front of the room was the American\nDream. \xe2\x80\x9cWhether we remain a special country or not will be determined by\nwhether that journey is still possible for the people trying to make that\njourney now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*PAUL*\n\n\n\n*Rand Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Fake Flat Tax\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/opinion/rand-pauls-fake-flat-tax.html>\n// NYT // Editorial Board \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nEvery four years, Republican candidates for the White House denounce the\nfederal tax system \xe2\x80\x94 often advocating replacing it with a supposedly more\nequitable single tax rate \xe2\x80\x94 and this year is no exception. Senator Rand\nPaul has already come up with a flat-tax reform plan, and it shows clearly,\nonce again, that this is a fundamentally flawed idea.\n\n\n\nMr. Paul has pledged to \xe2\x80\x9cblow up the tax code\xe2\x80\x9d by replacing all federal\ntaxes with a flat 14.5 percent tax on personal and corporate income \xe2\x80\x94\nexcept, that is, when his plan exempts income from taxation altogether by\nretaining popular write-offs. Mr. Paul proposes to continue deductions for\nmortgage interest and charitable donations, which would gut the supposed\nsimplicity of a flat tax.\n\n\n\nThe Paul plan, like the flat-tax plans from previous campaigns, would fail\nto raise enough revenue to finance a modern government. Estimates by the\nconservative Tax Foundation found that it would reduce revenue to the\nTreasury by $1 trillion to $3 trillion over a decade. Citizens for Tax\nJustice, a more liberal advocacy group, estimates a 10-year loss of $15\ntrillion. Arguments about the proper role of government aside, a population\nand an economy that are growing in size and complexity cannot thrive with a\nshrinking government.\n\n\n\nRand Paul in Las Vegas last month, flanked by more than 74,000 pieces of\npaper meant to represent the size of the United States tax code. Credit\nEthan Miller/Getty Images\n\nThe Paul plan also fails the basic test of progressivity. It promises a big\ntax cut for everyone, but analyses show it would be a big tax cut for high\nearners and businesses and basically a wash for everyone else. And that\xe2\x80\x99s\nbeing generous. If Mr. Paul were to cut federal spending to offset the\nplan\xe2\x80\x99s revenue loss, as he has promised to do, middle-class and\nlower-income Americans would be much worse off, because programs that\nbenefit them would have to be reduced or ended. Contenders for the chopping\nblock would include Social Security, health care, education and\nenvironmental protection.\n\n\n\nMr. Paul might be on to something if he were willing to acknowledge that\nhis flat tax is essentially a value-added tax similar to those used in all\nmarket-oriented democracies except the United States. (With both a flat tax\nand a VAT, businesses deduct nonlabor expenses from gross receipts and pay\ntaxes on the difference \xe2\x80\x94 the value added.)\n\n\n\nMr. Paul doesn\xe2\x80\x99t call his flat tax a VAT because anti-tax conservatives are\nopposed to VATs. So he has taken a baffling approach that would be prone to\nevasion. But a carefully conceived VAT could be exactly what the United\nStates needs. Experience and research show that it can raise substantial\nrevenue, is relatively easy to administer and is minimally harmful to\neconomic growth. In fact, the reason it is loathed by anti-tax\nconservatives is that their real agenda is to hobble government.\n\n\n\nThe problem with a VAT is that it falls more heavily on lower-income\ntaxpayers, who spend all of or most of their earnings, than on\nhigher-income people, who can afford to save some or most of what they\nmake. To offset that disadvantage, a VAT must be part of a progressive\nfiscal system that includes a graduated income tax; adequate spending on\nSocial Security, Medicare and other government insurance programs; and\nample government investment in education, roads, scientific research and\nother public goods and services.\n\n\n\nMr. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s plan heads the wrong way on all those fronts, providing less\nprogressivity and more cuts to spending and investment. It is bad policy,\nand it does nothing to foster a meaningful debate about the economy or\ntaxes.\n\n\n\n*Rand Paul\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign raises $7 million\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/07/10/rand-pauls-presidential-campaign-raises-7-million/>\n// WaPo // Katie Zezima \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nSen. Rand Paul\'s presidential campaign has raised $7 million since its\nlaunch in April.\n\n\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Paul\'s contributions came through small-dollar\ndonations. Eighty-five percent of Paul\'s haul came from contributions of\n$50 or less, and 96 percent from people who gave $100 or less. Paul\'s\nfundraising totals were first reported by Breitbart.com and confirmed by\nhis presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nMore than 108,205 people gave to Paul\'s campaign, with the average donation\ncoming in at $65. Super PACs supporting Paul have not released their\nfundraising totals. The money was raised through the presidential campaign\nand a joint fundraising committee where a portion of the money goes toward\nPaul\'s presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nPaul, who has positioned himself as a grass-roots fundraiser, lags in the\nRepublican money race. Jeb Bush\'s campaign raised $11.4 million; his allied\nsuper PAC raised more than $103 million between January and June. Sen. Ted\nCruz\'s presidential campaign raised $14.2 million since Cruz announced in\nMarch; combined with his super PAC total, Cruz has raised more than $51\nmillion.\n\n\n\nPaul\'s campaign has raised, on average, $83,333.33 a day, putting him\nbehind the campaigns of Ben Carson and ahead of Carly Fiorina. Bush\'s\ncampaign has raised an average of $760,000 a day.\n\n\n\nPaul\'s campaign attempted to capitalize monetarily on a nearly 11-hour\nspeech he gave about surveillance on the Senate floor in May, peppering\ninboxes with fundraising pitches, and tried to focus his fundraising pitch\non small-dollar, grassroots donations.\n\n\n\n"When the media pores through my financial reports next week, they\'ll be\nscrutinizing every little detail. And that doesn\'t include just fundraising\ntotals. They\'ll also be looking to see how far and wide my base of\ngrass-roots support extends. If they discover my campaign has a grassroots\narmy of supporters in every state and every city across the country, it\'s\nsure to make their heads spin," Paul\'s campaign wrote in a fundraising\ne-mail days before the end of the June 30 reporting quarter.\n\n\n\n*Rand Paul pulls in $7 million for presidential run\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/rand-paul-rakes-in-7-million-for-presidential-run-119978.html?ml=tl_7>\n// Politico // Daniel Strauss \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nSen. Rand Paul pulled in $7 million for his presidential run during the\nlast fundraising quarter, his campaign reported on Friday.\n\n\n\nIncluded in that number are receipts from Paul\xe2\x80\x99s joint fundraising\ncommittee, and his campaign is able to point to a decently large number of\ncontributors (108,205) with an average donation of $65.\n\n\n\nThe $7 million figure doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, however, include the money raised by the\nlibertarian-ish candidate\xe2\x80\x99s super PAC, which is expected to significantly\nup his total haul.\n\n\n\nWhile that makes comparisons tough, the initial figure pales in comparison\nto the eye-popping numbers trotted out by his Republican rivals in recent\ndays. On Thursday, Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s super PAC that it had exceeded its\nfundraising target, and had brought in $103 million. On top of that, Bush\xe2\x80\x99s\ncampaign reported it had raised $11.4 million.\n\n\n\nAnd Sen. Ted Cruz announced last week that his campaign and super PACs had\nbrought in a total $51 million haul for the second quarter.\n\n\n\nDuring the same fundraising period in the 2012 cycle, Sen. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s father,\nRon Paul, raised $4.5 million.\n\n\n\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s overall fundraising numbers are expected to put him very much in the\ngame, and his polling numbers have him in the upper middle of the field. A\nrecent CNN poll found Paul with 8 percent support, tied with Ben Carson and\ntrailing Bush and Donald Trump.\n\nBreitbart.com first reported Paul\xe2\x80\x99s haul.\n\n\n\n*Rand Paul takes in $7 million in second quarter\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/10/politics/rand-paul-fundraising-numbers/> //\nCNN // Theodore Schleifer \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nRand Paul raised $7 million in the opening months of his presidential\ncampaign, sitting in the middle of the pack of Republicans who have so far\nreleased their fundraising numbers, his campaign said Friday.\n\n\n\nPaul, powered by low-dollar "moneybombs" that catapulted him to the Senate\nin 2010 and helped his father win delegates in his 2012 presidential\ncampaign, raised the millions from 108,000 donors who gave an average of\n$65.\n\n\n\nThe figures were first reported late Friday afternoon by Breitbart.\n\n\n\nPaul is also considering running for re-election to the Senate, and the $7\nmillion haul is split between the presidential bank account and a joint\nfundraising committee, which dedicates the first $2,700 of each donation to\nhis presidential run and the next $2,700 to a potential Senate run. A Paul\nspokesman, Sergio Gor, declined Friday to say how much of the $7 million\nwas raised by each committee.\n\n\n\nThe Kentucky senator\'s numbers show that he raised money at a slower clip\nthan his competitors, raising about $85,000 a day.\n\n\n\nPaul also has two major super PAC\'s backing him, one of which is led by\nseveral former Paul aides. But he reportedly has struggled to woo the big\nmoneymen who are choosing instead to line up behind former Florida Gov. Jeb\nBush, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. The Kentucky\nsenator has placed a particular emphasis on courting wealthy donors in\nSilicon Valley.\n\n\n\nUnlike some of his competitors, Paul has had almost the full quarter, which\nbegan April 1, to raise money for his official campaign. Bush, who\nofficially announced his candidacy about two weeks before the fundraising\nquarter closed, currently leads the Republican field in those hauls,\ngathering about $11 million. Cruz raised $10 million in the second quarter,\nretired neurosurgeon Ben Carson cashed in $8.3 million and businesswoman\nCarly Fiorina and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry trailed the field with\nbetween $1 and $2 million.\n\n\n\n*Rand Paul Raises $7 Million in Second Quarter with Overwhelming Grassroots\nSupport\n<http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/10/exclusive-rand-paul-raises-7-million-in-second-quarter-with-overwhelming-grassroots-support/>\n// Breitbart // Matthew Boyle \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)93% raked in an\nimpressive more than $7 million in the last Federal Election Commission\n(FEC) fundraising quarter which includes receipts through the joint\nfundraising committee, his campaign told Breitbart News exclusively.\n\n\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps more impressive than the dollar amount, however, is just how\nsuccessful Paul has been with grassroots supporters: the total number of\ndonations is comprised of 108,205 individual donors with an average of $65.\n\n\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s more, a whopping 85 percent of all donations were for either $50 or\nless, and 96 percent of all donations were for $100 or less. Those numbers\nprove that Paul has raw grassroots support nationwide, and hardworking\npeople who aren\xe2\x80\x99t part of the permanent political class\xe2\x80\x94the folks who can\xe2\x80\x99t\nmax out in thousands of dollars of donations to various political\ncandidates\xe2\x80\x94are doing whatever they can to help him out.\n\n\n\nThe numbers Paul\xe2\x80\x99s campaign released to Breitbart News exclusively also\nshow he is outpacing the contributions of almost every 2012 Republican\ncampaign and has the resources to build a national campaign capable of\ncompeting through the convention. The last quarter\xe2\x80\x99s $7 million of receipts\ncome from the time frame of between April and June of this year. Paul\nannounced he\xe2\x80\x99s running for president in April.\n\n\n\nAt this point in the 2012 Republican primary, Paul\xe2\x80\x99s father former Rep. Ron\nPaul (R-TX) raised only $4.5 million, and only former Massachusetts Gov.\nMitt Romney raised more. Paul is on pace to raise almost double what his\nfather and almost every other candidate garnered during the 2012 primary.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Paul\xe2\x80\x99s campaign\xe2\x80\x99s announcement of high levels of small dollar\ndonors means he has strong support from real primary voters, not political\ninsiders. His donors are activists who will continue to donate and, as\nengaged activists, they will drive others to give to and vote for Sen. Rand\nPaul (R-KY)93%.\n\n\n\nPolls continue to show Paul is the best-suited GOP candidate at this time\nwhen it comes to facing off against former Secretary of State Hillary\nClinton in a hypothetical general election. He leads the field against\nHillary Clinton nationally, according to Real Clear Politics\xe2\x80\x99 average of\npolls. Also, he is the only candidate who polls ahead of Clinton in polls\nfrom key states Republicans need to win the White House, including\nColorado, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\nPaul is running a grassroots campaign, unlike other candidates who must\nraise higher amount of funds to overcome monumental negatives. While donor\nclass candidates like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)80% or former Florida Gov. Jeb\nBush will pump millions into efforts to assuage Republican voters they\xe2\x80\x99ve\ninfuriated, grassroots insurgent candidates like Paul will continue outside\nefforts like he\xe2\x80\x99s been doing.\n\n\n\nIn the past two months, Paul has rolled out countless local and national\nendorsements, opened offices in New Hampshire and Iowa, and focused on\ncampaigning in areas where other Republicans dare not show up, such as\nliberal college campuses, minority areas throughout the nation, and Silicon\nValley. There\xe2\x80\x99s also hardly any other candidates as good as Paul at gaining\nearned media and driving the political narrative\xe2\x80\x94so he\xe2\x80\x99s able to, without\nhaving to purchase advertising, push the conversation he wants to talk\nabout.\n\n\n\nOne of the first real tests of any presidential campaign is building an\norganization that is deep enough in the early states to build momentum and\nwide enough around the country to sustain the long slog that is a national\ncampaign.\n\n\n\nPaul has surpassed such expectations as, in addition to his energized and\nlarge grassroots following of liberty supporters, his early state operation\nhas been flexing its muscle since the senator went on his five state\nannouncement tour, packing the house at each spot. Since then, the Senator\nhas announced 125 members to his New Hampshire leadership team, including\n25 state representatives and two state senators. He\xe2\x80\x99s been lauded for\noperational efficiency in Iowa and amassed hundreds of volunteers in South\nCarolina.\n\n\n\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s not to mention all the endorsements he\xe2\x80\x99s pulled together, from\npeople like Congressman Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI)95% of Michigan or Rep.\nThomas Massie (R-KY)92% of his home state of Kentucky. Paul also has the\nendorsement of Senate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY)52%, even\nthough the two have been somewhat at loggerheads with each other since\nearlier this year on issues like Obamatrade and government surveillance.\n\n\n\n*CRUZ*\n\n\n\n*Ted Cruz hits the jackpot: A book war with the New York Times\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/07/10/ted-cruz-hits-the-jackpot-a-book-war-with-the-new-york-times/>\n// WaPo // Philip Bump \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nPerhaps the only thing better for Sen. Ted Cruz\'s 2016 candidacy than\nseeing his book on the New York Times bestseller list is seeing the New\nYork Times refuse to include it.\n\n\n\nPolitico reported Thursday night that Cruz\'s (R-Tex.) new book, "A Time for\nTruth," would be left off of the paper\'s bestsellers list. It does appear\non the Publisher\'s Weekly list for the week, identifying that 11,853 copies\nwere sold, landing it in fourth place between books from former Playboy\nbunny Holly Madison and enthusiastic facial-expression-maker Aziz Ansari.\n\n\n\nAt first, the reason that Cruz wasn\'t being included weren\'t clear. A\nspokesperson for the Times simply told Politico that the paper has "uniform\nstandards that we apply to our best seller list, which includes an analysis\nof book sales that goes beyond simply the number of books sold. This book\ndidn\'t meet that standard this week."\n\n\n\nEventually, though, the Times told Politico that "the overwhelming\npreponderance of evidence was that sales were limited to strategic bulk\npurchases" -- in other words, someone bought a lot of copies of the book so\nthat Cruz would make it onto the bestseller list. Or, to put it more\nbluntly: Someone gamed the system.\n\n\n\nCruz\'s publisher denies that. In a statement to Buzzfeed, HarperCollins\nsaid that it had "investigated the sales pattern for Ted Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s book" and\n"found no evidence of bulk orders or sales through any retailer or\norganization." It went on to note that Nielsen Bookscan excludes bulk sales\nfrom its figures, which resulted in the 11,800 number above.\n\n\n\nYou will not be surprised to learn that the news of Cruz\'s omission was met\nwith either gloating or fury directed at the liberal media, depending on\nobservers\' political leanings.\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\nUpdate, 4:00 p.m.: Cruz joins the fight. In a statement to Politico,\nspokesman Rick Tyler said, "The Times is presumably embarrassed by having\ntheir obvious partisan bias called out. But their response \xe2\x80\x94 alleging\n\'strategic bulk purchases\' \xe2\x80\x94 is a blatant falsehood. The evidence is\ndirectly to the contrary. In leveling this false charge, the Times has\ntried to impugn the integrity of Senator Cruz and of his publisher Harper\nCollins."\n\n\n\nIf you\'re curious, that 11,800 in sales is substantially lower than the\n86,000 first-week sales of Hillary Clinton\'s "Hard Choices" -- though that\nwas backed up with a healthy public relations blitz. (It\'s closer to\nClinton\'s fourth week, when she sold 17,000 copies.) It\'s also lower than\nthe sales of Mitt Romney\'s 2012 book, "No Apology," which did 42,000 in\nsales in its first week.\n\n\n\nHere is a prediction! The Times will soon include Cruz\'s book on its list,\nin part because the negative (or, depending on how you look at it,\npositive) publicity will help goose sales. When Costco axed Dinesh\nD\'Souza\'s book from its shelves last summer for poor sales, the resulting\noutcry ensured so much demand that Costco quickly restocked it.\n\n\n\nIn which case Cruz gets the conservative cred of being blackballed by the\nTimes and the PR bonus of being a Times bestseller. Win-win.\n\n\n\n*The Daily Cruz\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/ted-cruzs-secret-weapon-breitbartcom-119935.html?ml=tl_27>\n// Politico // Hadas Gold, Katie Glueck, and Kenneth P. Vogel \xe2\x80\x93 July 10,\n2015 *\n\n\n\nTed Cruz has a media strategy. It\xe2\x80\x99s called Breitbart.com.\n\n\n\nThe Texas senator is firmly ensconced in the middle of the Republican\npresidential primary pack. But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to tell from\nBreitbart.com.\n\n\n\n>From reader polls and the conservative website\xe2\x80\x99s near cheerleading coverage\nof the Texas Senator, to donor connections behind the scenes, Cruz likely\nhas the Republican presidential field\xe2\x80\x99s deepest relationship with the\nBreitbart machine \xe2\x80\x94 a relationship he\xe2\x80\x99s seeking to parlay into more\nenergized grassroots support.\n\n\n\nBreitbart.com, which boasts of having 18.7 million unique users per month \xe2\x80\x94\nalmost all of them conservative firebrands \xe2\x80\x94 is funded in part by New York\nhedge fund manager Robert Mercer, whose family is bankrolling a pro-Cruz\nsuper PAC as well as a political data company called Cambridge Analytica\nthat is working with Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nBreitbart.com insists it\xe2\x80\x99s independent, though proudly conservative, and\nattributes its often-favorable assessments of Cruz to the fact that his\nindependent brand of conservatism is appealing to its readers.\n\n\n\nBut no one disputes the site\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm for Cruz.\n\n\n\nThe night before his campaign announcement, Cruz invited a Breitbart\nreporter to spend one-on-one time with him and his family \xe2\x80\x94 an item deemed\nan \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive\xe2\x80\x9d with photos of the \xe2\x80\x9cpotential first family\xe2\x80\x9d as they got\nready for bed.\n\n\n\nA recent story about an AP photo that appeared to position a gun at the\nsenator\xe2\x80\x99s head stated that while a Democrat would be incredibly offended by\nthe image, Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfeelings won\xe2\x80\x99t get hurt. He\xe2\x80\x99s a big boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd another blasted former President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s senior aide Karl Rove\nfor what the site characterized as \xe2\x80\x9clying\xe2\x80\x9d over an exchange Cruz and Rove\nhad during Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s run for Texas Attorney General.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKarl Rove should probably read what he wrote in his own emails before he\nattacks the integrity of a U.S. Senator and presidential candidate again,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe story\xe2\x80\x99s lead sentence reads.\n\n\n\nThe site, founded in 2007 by the now-iconic conservative journalist and\nactivist Andrew Breitbart, can be an important starting ground for driving\nthe conversation on the right \xe2\x80\x94 even if its reporting is not always on\nentirely solid ground. (The site has been known to misquote officials and\nmisidentify others.)\n\n\n\nIn June, the site\xe2\x80\x99s editors said their 18.7 million unique users\nrepresented a 56 percent increase over the year before. And nearly all of\nthe Republican presidential candidates regularly post op-eds and grant the\nsite interviews or certain \xe2\x80\x9cexclusives,\xe2\x80\x9d which can range from interviews to\nexcerpts of their forthcoming books.\n\n\n\nCruz\xe2\x80\x99s distaste for the mainstream media is well known. Last week, the\nTexas senator told conservative host Glenn Beck that he once rebuked a\nyoung staffer for calling one member of the mainstream media \xe2\x80\x9cnice,\xe2\x80\x9d\ntelling the staffer all the media want to do is \xe2\x80\x9cfilet\xe2\x80\x9d him across the\nfront page. He once told a New York Times reporter he was going to kick\naround the publication and never give the reporter access.\n\n\n\nBut conservative media is a different story. He has long used that avenue\nas a tool to engage conservative audiences. He even broke the news, in\n2011, that he was planning to run for Senate in a conference call with\nconservative bloggers. Just weeks after Andrew Breitbart died at the age of\n43 in 2012, a story on Breitbart.com said \xe2\x80\x9cThe late Andrew Breitbart saw in\nSen. Ted Cruz the future of the conservative movement,\xe2\x80\x9d alongside a photo\nof Breitbart holding a Ted Cruz for Senate sticker.\n\n\n\nAnd Cruz has gone to bat for Breitbart.com in the Senate. Cruz sent a\nletter to the IRS commissioner on Breitbart\xe2\x80\x99s behalf about the \xe2\x80\x9chighly\nquestionable\xe2\x80\x9d audit of the company the agency was undertaking last\nSeptember.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, he has offered toasts and remembrances to Andrew Breitbart and\nis a frequent guest at Breitbart.com events.\n\n\n\nHe nodded to Andrew Breitbart\xe2\x80\x99s legacy again when he endorsed Mike Flynn, a\nformer editor at Breitbart.com who was running in a GOP congressional\nprimary in Illinois (a race he lost on Tuesday), prompting puzzlement among\nobservers for the spending of political capital on a candidate that was far\nfrom viable.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Andrew Breitbart launched BigGovernment.com to expose ACORN and fight\nback against the institutional left and the political class, he chose Mike\nFlynn as his lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cFor six years, Flynn\nhelped expose the media\xe2\x80\x99s lies and led many fights against the Obama\nadministration.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCruz spokesman Rick Tyler said that the senator considers Breitbart.com a\nsource of \xe2\x80\x9cfair\xe2\x80\x9d coverage, its \xe2\x80\x9ccenter-right\xe2\x80\x9d perspective a corrective for\nthe mainstream media\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccenter-left\xe2\x80\x9d bias.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile most of the media covers the news from a center-left perspective,\nthey cover from a center-right perspective, and their readers have been\nvery supportive of Cruz,\xe2\x80\x9d Tyler said of Breitbart.com. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can be a vehicle\nto get covered fairly from a center-right perspective, to an audience that\nenjoys hearing from Sen. Cruz.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe love runs both ways. For the first time, the site is hosting its own\nregular online poll of its readers, and Cruz is far and away the favorite\ncandidate. Of the approximately 55,000 responses from June, Breitbart said\n33 percent voted in favor of Cruz, putting him in first place ahead of\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who garnered 23 percent, and Kentucky Sen.\nRand Paul who brought in 10 percent. It\xe2\x80\x99s hardly a scientific poll \xe2\x80\x94 anyone\ncan vote as often as they\xe2\x80\x99d like \xe2\x80\x94 but the results match up with the site\xe2\x80\x99s\nfavorable coverage of particular candidates.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is a surprise, the result that we have, based on sort\nof the voice of our site. It tends to favor the tea party grassroots type\nof conservatives, the independent-minded conservatives, people who don\xe2\x80\x99t\nidentify with the Republican establishment,\xe2\x80\x9d Alex Marlow, the site\xe2\x80\x99s\neditor-in-chief, said in an interview.\n\n\n\nBehind the scenes there is perhaps an even more important connection\nbetween Cruz and Breitbart.\n\n\n\nBreitbart executive chairman Steve Bannon has worked with Mercer on\npolitical projects including Cambridge Analytica, according to conservative\nfinance operatives. They describe Bannon as something of a gatekeeper for\nMercer, a New York hedge fund magnate who keeps a close circle of\nassociates and has not publicly advocated for Cruz. According to the New\nYork Times, Mercer is the main donor behind a network of four super PACs\nsupporting Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s bid for president. Mercer\xe2\x80\x99s daughter Rebekah Mercer, who\nhas helped steer the family\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly public investment in\nconservative politics, was an early Cruz supporter, hosting a fundraiser in\nApril for the Texas Senator.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for the Mercers decline to comment on their involvement in\nBreitbart.com or whether they have sought to shape the outlet\xe2\x80\x99s coverage of\nCruz. Breitbart editors refused to comment on the Mercer connection saying\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re a \xe2\x80\x9cprivate company and we don\xe2\x80\x99t comment on who our investors or\nbackers are.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreitbart is perfectly content letting these nameless/faceless \xe2\x80\x98multiple\nplaces\xe2\x80\x99 as you put it speculate, gossip and exhaust their imaginations\ntelling reporters tales of what they think they know,\xe2\x80\x9d a Breitbart\nspokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\n\nAnd Tyler, Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman, said that Mercer\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in Breitbart\nalso had no effect on the Cruz campaign\xe2\x80\x99s dealings with the outlet.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI answered the phone for you just like I would answer for Breitbart,\xe2\x80\x9d he\ntold a POLITICO reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t stop and look at who POLITICO\xe2\x80\x99s\ninvestors are. I think we have open access to all the media outlets except\nthe ones that have an agenda,\xe2\x80\x9d which aren\xe2\x80\x99t real outlets, he said.\n\n\n\nMarlow said Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s views often align well with those of the site\xe2\x80\x99s editors\nand readers, but that Breitbart.com been critical of him in the past.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[Cruz] tends to have a lot of ideas that are supported by a lot of our\nreaders \xe2\x80\xa6 but we\xe2\x80\x99ve been critical of him in the past particularly when he\nwent down to the border with Glenn Beck and brought soccer balls \xe2\x80\x94 we were\npretty brutal there,\xe2\x80\x9d Marlow said.\n\nBreitbart has published articles about how Cruz is \xe2\x80\x9cpoorly matched to\ndefeat Hillary.\xe2\x80\x9d The site also hammered Cruz over his initial support for\nfast-track authority on the trade deal, a position he later reversed \xe2\x80\x94\nthrough an op-ed posted at Breitbart.com. And, to be sure, Breitbart has\nalso showered favorable coverage on the likes of Walker, Ben Carson, Mike\nHuckabee and, in the past couple of weeks, Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nFor Breitbart, the attention from candidates like Cruz is nothing but\npositive.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a huge field in terms of Republican candidates who are vying for\nto become the nominee and this huge field has generated an intensity of\ninterest,\xe2\x80\x9d Breitbart News CEO Larry Solov said in an interview. \xe2\x80\x9cI think a\nlot of candidates realize our audience is the one that they will have to be\ncapture in order to win the nomination. That\xe2\x80\x99s why they\xe2\x80\x99re paying\nattention.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Ted Cruz feuds with the New York Times \xe2\x80\x93 and loves it\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/ted-cruz-feud-new-york-times-119981.html?ml=tl_5>\n// Politico // Dylan Byers \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nThe campaign gods are smiling down on Ted Cruz, gifting him a feud with\nconservatives\xe2\x80\x99 most despised news outlet at a time when most 2016 campaigns\nare gasping for Trump-free air.\n\n\n\nAt issue: The New York Times refuses to grant the Texas senator\xe2\x80\x99s memoir,\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Time for Truth,\xe2\x80\x9d a place on its powerful list of bestselling books,\ndespite his publisher\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that his numbers should vault him well\nahead of other titles in the top 10.\n\n\n\nNews of Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion broke this week after HarperCollins, the book\xe2\x80\x99s\npublisher, sent a letter to the Times inquiring about its omission from the\nlist, sources with knowledge of the situation told POLITICO, which first\nreported the story. The Times responded by telling HarperCollins that the\nbook did not meet their criteria for inclusion.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, a Times spokesperson said that the book was excluded because\nthe paper had found its sales to be mostly \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic bulk purchases\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a\ncommon practice among political authors, but a claim hotly disputed by\nCruz\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Times is presumably embarrassed by having their obvious partisan bias\ncalled out.\n\nBut their response \xe2\x80\x94 alleging \xe2\x80\x98strategic bulk purchases\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 is a blatant\nfalsehood,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz campaign spokesperson Rick Tyler said in a statement\nFriday. \xe2\x80\x9cThe evidence is directly to the contrary.

Not only is his book a success, giving him a second round of\npublicity after his May 23 launch, he also appears to be having little\ntrouble raising funds. His campaign announced this week that he had raised\nat least $51 million split between the official campaign and four super\nPACs, putting him in second place in the money race behind former Florida\ngovernor Jeb Bush and well ahead of Marco Rubio and Scott Walker.\n\n\n\nIn that sense, Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s feud with the Times is a happy bonus.\n\n\n\nEileen Murphy, the Times spokesperson, said Friday that the paper was\nstanding by her initial claim that the \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming preponderance of\nevidence was that sales [of Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s book] were limited to strategic bulk\npurchases.\xe2\x80\x9d Murphy did not respond to a request for comment regarding the\nCruz campaign\xe2\x80\x99s statement.\n\n\n\nIn her initial response, Murphy said the Times had \xe2\x80\x9cuniform standards that\nwe apply to our best seller list, which includes an analysis of book sales\nthat goes beyond simply the number of books sold.\xe2\x80\x9d She later added, \xe2\x80\x9cOur\ngoal is that the list reflect authentic best sellers, so we look at and\nanalyze not just numbers, but patterns of sales for every book.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Cruz campaign called Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s initial explanation \xe2\x80\x9ccryptic,\xe2\x80\x9d and her\nlater claims about bulk purchases \xe2\x80\x9cfalse.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir decision to blackball Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s book suggests that the Times very much\ndoes not want people to read the book,\xe2\x80\x9d the campaign said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were no\n\xe2\x80\x98strategic bulk purchases.\xe2\x80\x99 Cruz spent last week on a nationwide book tour,\nsigning copies of his book at multiple locations.

As the Post\xe2\x80\x99s\nPhilip Bump noted, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Costco axed Dinesh D\xe2\x80\x99Souza\xe2\x80\x99s book from its shelves\nlast summer for poor sales, the resulting outcry ensured so much demand\nthat Costco quickly restocked it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important to look at a book like a campaign, setting the groundwork\nearly and then seizing opportunities,\xe2\x80\x9d noted Urbahn. \xe2\x80\x9cThe New York Times,\nironically, offered us exactly that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*HarperCollins disputes N.Y.

It is on other lists, such as\nthe Wall Street Journal\xe2\x80\x99s and USA Today\xe2\x80\x99s. Cruz partisans have been quick\nto assume that the liberal Times is smothering the news that Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s book is\nselling well.\n\n\n\nTrust me, it\xe2\x80\x99s much, much weirder than that.\n\n\n\nNearly every news outlet that maintains a bestseller list uses a different\nmethodology. Some rely on Nielsen BookScan for their sales information.\nSome collect their own data.\n\n\n\nSome, like USA Today, mush everything into one list, so hardcovers and\npaperbacks and e-books all jostle for the same rankings. Others segregate\ntheir lists according to format (one for hardcovers, one for paperback,\netc.).\n\n\n\nThe Times slices and dices its list about as finely as anyone. There\xe2\x80\x99s a\nhardcover fiction list, an e-book fiction list, a paperback fiction list, a\nhow-to list, and on and on. After J.K. Rowling\xe2\x80\x99s Harry Potter books took\nover the number one fiction spot for months on end, the Times created a\nseparate list for children\xe2\x80\x99s fiction.\n\n\n\nThe kids\xe2\x80\x99 book list was in response, it was said at the time, to complaints\nfrom publishers that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t compete with Rowling\xe2\x80\x99s success. As long\nas she dominated the fiction list, no one else was ever going to have a\nnumber one adult bestseller again.\n\n\n\nAnd number-one bestsellers are important to publishers. A number-one\nbestseller gets pride of place in bookstores, and it gets better positioned\non Amazon. Just the name of a book on a bestseller list is that much more\nfree advertising. And down the road, a hardback\xe2\x80\x99s bestselling status means\nmore will be spent to promote the paperback edition when it comes out, and\nof course the paperback is bedecked with type proclaiming it a Times\nbestseller.  When the author\xe2\x80\x99s agent tries to sell the author\xe2\x80\x99s next book,\nthe bestselling status of the author\xe2\x80\x99s previous book completely changes the\nconversation.\n\n\n\nThe Times takes its role in all this very seriously, which is to say, it\nknows how important the list is to publishers, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like being\ngamed.\n\n\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve got deep pockets and want to make your book a best seller, you\ncan do that. You can buy up books in bulk and make the list. To counter\nthis, the Times weights the results of its tabulations from stores around\nthe country. It also does this to keep, say, New York City or other big\nbook markets from controlling the contents of the lists.\n\n\n\nSo, for example, if the Times sees that a significant number of the 11,854\ncopies of Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s book sold so far this week come from one place or a\nhandful of places, the newspaper does not give those sales the same weight\nit gives sales from other stores and online outlets.\n\n\n\nWhich is admirable, and also worrisome. Admirable because the Times wants\nits list to reflect what books readers actually bought, not what was\nsnapped up in bulk by some company in the employ of a conservative interest\ngroup (some other day we\xe2\x80\x99ll undertake an examination of the closed circle\nin which conservative writers publish books with conservative publishing\nimprints, which are then promoted by conservative Fox News commentators to\nconservative viewers who loyally buy the books\xe2\x80\x94if you doubt the\neffectiveness of such a loop, consider that nearly every mainstream\npublishing conglomerate has an imprint dedicated exclusively to books by\nand about conservatives). Worrisome because who ultimately decides what\nconstitutes a legitimate sale? And a sale is a sale is sale, or isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nWell, no, clearly at the Times it is not.\n\n\n\nOf course, however they are compiled, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s various bestseller lists\ndo roughly reflect reality. John Grisham and James Patterson and Doris\nKearns Goodwin really do sell a lot of books. Day in and day out, the books\non various lists are largely the same and in more or less the same order\nfrom list to list. But if a publisher or an author or an author\xe2\x80\x99s rich\nassociates want to \xe2\x80\x9ccreate\xe2\x80\x9d a bestseller, they can do that, too. So take\nwhat you see not as hard fact but as an approximation of fact.\n\n\n\nEvery few years some enterprising reporter exposes all the contradictions\nand problems associated with bestseller lists. And maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s some\nhandwringing, and maybe someone comes along with a new innovation that will\nset everything right. USA Today\xe2\x80\x99s one-size-fits-all list was supposed to\nresolve disparities and let you see what was really the most popular book\nin a given week. BookScan was supposed to make everything about sales\ntransparent. The changes get made, and yet essentially everything remains\nthe same, because all the players have too much invested in the status quo.\nThey know it\xe2\x80\x99s flawed. And yet \xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s like the joke Woody Allen tells in Annie Hall: \xe2\x80\x9cA guy walks into a\npsychiatrist\'s office and says, hey doc, my brother\'s crazy! He thinks he\'s\na chicken. Then the doc says, why don\'t you turn him in? Then the guy says,\nI would but I need the eggs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*NTU: Cruz tried to reduce federal spending by $169 billion per year, while\nHillary Clinton proposes $226 billion in new spending\n<http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/10/ntu-cruz-tried-to-reduce-federal-spending-by-169-billion-per-year-while-hillary-clinton-proposes-226-billion-in-new-spending/>\n// Breitbart // Alex Swoyer \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nThe National Taxpayers Union Foundation (NTUF) reports that GOP\npresidential candidate Sen.

The two-term governor is pushing his\ntough-talking image as he fights for one of the 10 slots at the first\nRepublican primary debate in August.

This is a particularly important\nconstituency for him because unlike every other Republican contender, he\nboasts bringing in about 21 percent of the African American vote in his\nlast re-election in 2014, a jump from only 9 percent in his first race in\n2010.\n\n\n\nAfrican Americans, a key constituency for any contender in 2016, have a\nspecial set of concerns and asks for anyone running for president that are\nseldom directly addressed. Throughout the 2016 campaign season NBCBLK will\nexamine the candidates\' statements, campaigns, and policies to find out\nwhat they have to offer the black community. Hopefully their campaigns will\nfeel compelled to respond.\n\n\n\n1. How will you implement criminal justice reform ?\n\n\n\nChris Christie has already been at the forefront of some criminal just\nreform measures in New Jersey. He fought for expanding drug courts that put\noffenders into treatment instead of prison (and this was over Democrats who\nactually wanted to delay the program). Governor Christie also dedicated a\nlarge part of his second inaugural address to criminal justice reform and\npledged to make that a key part of his second term. However, as president\nhe faces significant obstacles to such reform. African American voters\nshould ask Christie how he would plan to improve or change criminal justice\npractices in the DOJ or the DEA if he were elected with likely are\nRepublican Congress. This is especially important as Christie has remained\nsilent on cases like the Zimmerman trial, he deferred on the Eric Garner\ncase, and he pretty much gave a "no comment" on Ferguson.\n\n\n\n2. What is the Chris Christie version of Washington bipartisanship ?\n\n\n\nIn his announcement speech yesterday Christie was in full 2012 mode, by\nchastising both political parties and decrying the lack of leadership in\nthe Obama administration in foreign affairs. But within minutes he was back\nto talking about how he\'d reach across the aisle to work on ideas that he\nand Democrats could agree upon. All of this sounds nice until you think of\n"Bridgegate." While the scandal didn\'t result in the kind of major charges\nagainst Christie that some expected African American voters should be wary\nof any candidate who has a reputation for being particularly punitive to\nthose he disagrees with politically.\n\n\n\nBridgegate not only damages Christie\'s reputation as a straight shooter,\nbut also labels him as a bully who will punish opponents regardless of how\nthat may impact innocent citizen bystanders. Black folks are often\ncollateral damage in battles between political elites and Christie should\nexplain to voters how he won\'t let that happen under his presidency.\n\n\n\n3. What about the Jobs?\n\n\n\nDuring the last several years of the Great Recession, African American\nunemployment rates have slowly gone down to about 10 percent. (This is\nstill worse than the 8.7 percent it was before Obama took office.) African\nAmerican voters should ask Christie how effective he will be at helping to\nlift black voters out of poverty.\n\n\n\nNew Jersey has the fourth highest rate of long-term unemployment African\nAmericans in the nation at 48.7 percent. (Mind you, New Jersey also led the\nnation in White long term unemployed people at 41 percent for 2013-2014, so\nChristie doesn\'t seem to be doing a good job of lifting anyone\'s status in\nthe Garden State.)\n\n\n\nAn effective long term plan for getting America back to work would go a\nlong way in establishing Christie not only as a legitimate contender for\n2016 but also a viable competitor for African American voters.\n\n\n\n*Chris Christie releases first campaign ad for 2016 nomination: \xe2\x80\x98I mean\nwhat I say, and I say what I mean\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/chris-christie-releases-campaign-ad-article-1.2288008>\n// NY Daily News // Celeste Katz \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nNew Jersey Gov.

And that\xe2\x80\x99s what America needs\nright now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nChristie was once regarded as a major rising star in the GOP, with a\nfeatured speaking spot at the 2012 national convention and a 2014 turn as\nhead of the Republican Governors Association.\n\n\n\nBut his image and popularity took a turn for the worse as he battled the\nfallout of the Bridgegate lane closure scandal, and voters in his own state\nhave given him low marks for addressing unemployment and high taxes.\n\n\n\n*PERRY*\n\n\n\n*Rick Perry\xe2\x80\x99s super PAC haul: $16.8 million\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/rick-perrys-2016-fundraising-super-pac-16-million-119969.html?ml=tl_17>\n// Politico // Katie Glueck \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nThree affiliated super PACs supporting Rick Perry\xe2\x80\x99s presidential bid have\nraised nearly $17 million, a PAC official confirmed Friday, while his\ncampaign announced a $1 million fundraising haul.\n\n\n\nJordan Russell, a spokesman for the Opportunity and Freedom PAC, confirmed\nthat the organization and its two affiliated groups, all under the\nleadership of prominent Mississippi operative Austin Barbour, among others,\nhad raised $16.8 million for the former Texas governor.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks like we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have the resources to help Gov. Perry compete\nin the early states and beyond, so we feel good about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Russell said.\n\n\n\nHis official campaign said Friday afternoon that it had raised $1.07\nmillion since announcing last month, but in a statement noted the\nindependent super PAC figure, claiming close to $18 million in pro-Perry\nmoney.\n\n\n\nUnlike some campaigns, where nearly the entire brain trust is housed under\nthe super PAC, Perry has a robust campaign staff. But Opportunity and\nFreedom, led by Barbour and several longtime Perry advisers, has already\nbought up airtime in Iowa to run ads on behalf of the former governor and,\nas the better-funded arm, looks poised to play an active role in the race.\n\n\n\nPerry is a longshot for the GOP nomination after his disastrous 2012\npresidential run. Last time, he entered the race as a presumptive\nfront-runner but quickly flamed out amid a series of embarrassing missteps,\nincluding major fumbles on the debate stage.\n\n\n\nThis time around, he lags enough in the polls that it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely he\xe2\x80\x99ll\nqualify for the first debate. But he has spent the past year and a half\nseeking to rebrand himself, studying up on policy issues and spending\nsignificant time in the early states, particularly Iowa.\n\n\n\nThe super PAC haul, while far behind that of Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s and Ted Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s, is\nin line with other candidates\xe2\x80\x99 totals.\n\n\n\nThe news of the super PAC haul was first reported by CNN.\n\n\n\n*Rick Perry super PACs raise nearly $17M\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/10/politics/rick-perry-super-pac-fundraising-17-million/index.html>\n// CNN // Sara Murray \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nA trio of super PACs supporting former Texas Gov. Rick Perry has raised\nneared $17 million, according to a senior adviser for the groups.\n\n\n\nTwo pro-Perry groups -- Opportunity and Freedom PAC and Opportunity and\nFreedom PAC I -- raised $12.8 million in the first half of the year. A\nthird super PAC, which was created Thursday, collected a $4 million check\nfrom a single donor, bringing the full tally for the three groups to $16.8\nmillion as of July 10, said Austin Barbour, the senior adviser to all three\naffiliated entities.\n\n\n\nThe total falls far short of the $103 million Jeb Bush\'s super PAC has\nraised, but it is competitive with others in the GOP field. That\'s a\npromising sign for Perry who has faced questions from GOP voters and donors\nalike about whether he can mount a comeback after his embarrassing 2012\npresidential bid.\n\n\n\n"Look nobody\'s going to compete with Jeb Bush, it\'s impossible.\nCongratulations to them," Barbour said. But, "we have enough money now to\nkeep us competitive in this process for a long time."\n\n\n\nBarbour said their robust fundraising lends his candidate additional\ncredibility. It also gives bundlers an opening to circle back with hesitant\ndonors and pitch them on supporting Perry or writing larger checks.\n\n\n\nWealthy Texas donors helped fuel the fundraising for the pro-Perry groups.\n\n\n\nKelcy Warren, a Dallas billionaire and chief executive of an energy company\nwhose board of directors includes Perry, gave a $6 million contribution.\nWarren is also the finance chairman for Perry\'s presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nDarwin Deason, another Dallas billionaire who founded an information\ntechnology company that was later acquired by Xerox Corporation, gave $5\nmillion.\n\n\n\nBrint Ryan, chief executive of tax services firm Ryan LLC, is serving as\nthe finance chairman for all three groups, which have collected donations\nfrom dozens of contributors.\n\n\n\nBarbour said he and other Perry allies organized three super PACs because\nhigh-dollars donors want to have more input in the process this election\ncycle than they did in 2012. For instance, many of his biggest contributors\nare eager to tout Perry\'s record of job creation in Texas.\n\n\n\n"If they were going to give a million dollars or $5 million they really\nwant to be able to participate," Barbour said. "They know that the final\ndecisions on strategy and execution still lie with me and our team."\n\n\n\nThe super PACs still have most of their cash on hand, Barbour said,\nalthough they have spent more than $1 million already in paid television\nand digital advertising in Iowa.\n\n\n\n"We made this decision a long time ago that we were going to go early in\nIowa," Barbour said. "We feel like we have clean air," giving them an edge\nto reintroduce voters to the governor before the airwaves become too\ncrowded.\n\n\n\nThe Perry campaign and super PACs are all betting heavily on a strong\nshowing in Iowa and on the debate stage to carry the candidate further\nalong in the process.\n\n\n\nThat\'s why the super PACs have also spent a "significant amount" to reach a\nlarge conservative audience nationally to try to boost Perry\'s polling and\nensure he makes the debate stage, Barbour said.\n\n\n\nPerry comes in eighth place with 4% support among Republicans in the latest\nCNN/ORC poll. Averages of recent national polls indicate he will likely\nqualify for the first debate.\n\n\n\nAs for the recent Donald Trump mania, Barbour said Perry\'s exchanges with\nthe brash businessman over immigration policies are a welcome fight.\n\n\n\n"If the conversation is about border security, nobody knows it better than\nRick Perry," Barbour said.\n\n\n\n*New Super PAC Ad for Rick Perry Touts His Pro-Life, Gun Rights Record\n<http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/10/new-super-pac-ad-for-rick-perry-touts-his-pro-life-gun-rights-record/>\n// Breitbart // Sarah Rumpf \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nThe Super PAC supporting former Gov.

He backed the bill after former State Sen. Wendy Davis\nfilibustered it by calling the legislature back for a special session to\npass the bill. During a previous session, he signed a bill requiring\nparental consent for abortions.\n\n\n\nRegarding gun rights, Perry is well-known as a Second Amendment advocate,\nand has an A+ rating with the National Rifle Association.

Trump\xe2\x80\x99s average is 6.5 percent, though\nhe polled better in recent polls from CNN/ORC (12 percent) and Fox News (11\npercent).\n\n\n\nBrad Pitt would have a better chance getting in the debate at this point,\nGraham said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnybody with any celebrity would be in the debate. I think this is a dumb\nway to weed out the field. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind weeding out the field over time,\nbut a national poll tests celebrity, big states have an advantage versus\nsmall states,\xe2\x80\x9d the South Carolina senator and presidential candidate said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople who have run before have an advantage over those who haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s July, for god sakes. So a national poll is a lousy way, in my view,\nto determine who should be on the stage, and I quite frankly resent it,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid.\n\n\n\nGraham placed the blame on the Republican National Committee and Fox News\nfor the format, declining to name any other names.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would find a way for everybody who\xe2\x80\x99s filed and has got a viable campaign\nto be on the stage, and after a couple of debates, you could start weeding\npeople out. It\xe2\x80\x99s not about me. It\xe2\x80\x99s about destroying the early primary\nprocess of Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the end\nof the day, you\xe2\x80\x99re rewarding money and celebrity over the hard work in the\nearly states.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGraham said he would decide later whether he would participate in the\nearlier afternoon forum of candidates who don\xe2\x80\x99t make the cut.\n\n\n\n*SANTORUM*\n\n\n\n*Rick Santorum Wants to Be More Than Just a Pro-Life Candidate\n<http://www.nationaljournal.com/2016-elections/rick-santorum-wants-to-be-more-than-just-a-pro-life-candidate-20150710>\n// National Journal // Emma Roller \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nRick Santorum is tired of being pigeonholed.

"Every child at the moment of conception is both\nliving\xe2\x80\x94that embryo is metabolizing\xe2\x80\x94and it is a genetically completely\nhuman."\n\n\n\nHe went on to complain that as soon as he started advocating against\nabortion, media outlets began labeling him as "ultraconservative," and\nreporters stopped caring about his stances on the economy or foreign policy.\n\n\n\n"Because I led on this, and very few do, you get labeled, and you get put\nover there at the kids\' table," he paused. "By the media."\n\n\n\nThis is part of a larger strategy for Santorum\'s campaign to rebrand its\ncandidate as a populist reformer\xe2\x80\x94whom his allies say is the "real\nSantorum." When Santorum was first elected to the Senate, it was as a\ncandidate who appealed to Pennsylvania\'s blue-collar workers. But once he\nentered Congress, he began cementing his position as his party\'s champion\nagainst abortion and gay marriage. In 2003, he famously compared same-sex\nmarriage to "man-on-dog" relationships, and forever earned the ire (and\ndigital backlash) of gay-rights activist Dan Savage.\n\n\n\nSantorum has been out of political office for more than eight years, and\nduring that time, public opinion on social issues, particularly gay\nmarriage, has shifted substantially. The more Santorum is painted as a\nsocial-issues candidate, the more he risks being depicted as a relic of the\npast compared with his Republican competitors.\n\n\n\nThere is some dramatic irony to Santorum\'s insisting that he is not a\nsocial-issues candidate at a gathering of pro-life activists. If he were\nspeaking to the Atlantic Council or the American Enterprise Institute, his\nactions would reinforce his message. But so long as he continues to play to\nhis base\'s social activists, all the while insisting that he is more than\njust a social crusader, his message will continue to get muddled.\n\n\n\n*Rick Santorum: The Supreme Court Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Have the Final Say on Everything\n<http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/07/10/rick-santorum-the-supreme-court-doesnt-have-the-final-say-on-everything/>\n// The Blaze // Fred Lucas \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Rick Santorum reminded abortion opponents\nof two separate Supreme Court cases on partial-birth abortion bans as he\ntalked about the high court\xe2\x80\x99s recent decision legalizing gay marriage\nnationwide.\n\n\n\nIn 2000, the justice struck down a Nebraska ban on partial birth abortion.\nThen a U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, Santorum said he fought efforts\nwithin the Republican Party to move on.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe crafted a law and said the Supreme Court was wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d Santorum said to\napplause Friday at the National Right to Life Convention in New Orleans.\n\n\n\nA federal ban that Santorum led the way on was signed into law by President\nGeorge W. Bush in 2003 and then upheld by the high court in 2007.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did it become the law of the land because the Supreme Court had the\nfinal say on everything?\xe2\x80\x9d Santorum said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Supreme Court doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the final say on everything. The American\npeople have the final say on everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he added to a rousing ovation.\n\n\n\nSantorum was the runner-up to eventual Republican presidential nominee Mitt\nRomney in 2012, winning 11 states. However, in this election cycle, he is\nnot performing strongly in most polls ahead of the early-voting states.\n\n\n\nSantorum told the crowd that 2016 \xe2\x80\x9cis not a time for the faint of heart\xe2\x80\x9d\nbecause the nation is undergoing sweeping social change.\n\n\n\nSantorum admitted that in his early years in Congress, he never talked\nabout abortion, until finding out about the so-called partial birth\nabortion issue in the late 1990s. He became a leader on the issue,\nsponsoring a bill to overturn President Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s veto of the federal\nban.

Mike Huckabee on Friday repurposed the controversial\n"Daisy" ad from 1964 that ominously raised the specter of a nuclear bomb\nexplosion to warn about the dangers of the negotiations with Iran over its\nnuclear program.\n\n\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate\'s campaign released his version of\nthe ad on Friday, playing the ad almost in its entirety in a web video. A\nlittle girl slowly picks petals off a daisy, counting as she goes, but once\nshe picks all of the petals, a nuclear bomb explodes on screen.\n\n\n\nIn Huckabee\'s version, a message about the Iranian nuclear threat rolls on\nscreen following the explosion\n\n\n\n"A threat to Israel is a threat to America. Stand with Israel. Reject a\nnuclear Iran," reads the ad.\n\n\n\nHuckabee posted the video as negotiators once again extended a deadline on\nFriday to continue working toward a final deal that aims to cut off Iran\'s\npath to a nuclear bomb through restrictions on its nuclear activity and\nthorough inspections, in exchange for relief from international economic\nsanctions.\n\n\n\nHuckabee\'s ad is drawn from a campaign spot the Democratic National\nCommittee ran in support of President Lyndon B. Johnson\'s 1964 presidential\ncampaign. The ad only ran once because it was so controversial and it was\nwidely panned as a prime example of fear-mongering. But many credit the ad\nwith helping Johnson win that election.\n\n\n\nEven Huckabee\'s campaign acknowledged in a press release that the ad is\n"controversial," but it noted that "the video highlights the threat posed\nby a nuclear Iran."\n\n\n\nThe video also urges supporters to sign Huckabee\'s letter to Secretary of\nState John Kerry, urging him to "reject a deal with Iran that will spark a\nnuclear arms race in the Middle East, threaten Israel\'s existence and\nunleash a wave of terrorism around the world."\n\n\n\nKerry, President Barack Obama and other U.S. officials have insisted this\nweek that the U.S. will "walk away" from the negotiating table if Iran\ncannot meet the U.S.\'s demands for a good deal that would cut off Iran\'s\npathways to a nuclear bomb.\n\n\n\n*Huckabee: Trump can say what he thinks\n<http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/huckabee-trump-can-say-what-he-thinks/article/2568055>\n// Washington Examiner // Emilie Padgett \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nAt least one GOP candidate has no qualms about Donald Trump airing his\nopinions.\n\n\n\nMike Huckabee, a fellow Republican 2016 presidential candidate, made clear\non Friday that Trump should be able to say whatever he wants, despite the\nbacklash against Trump for his controversial comments about Hispanic\nimmigrants during his campaign kickoff speech.\n\n\n\nHuckabee called the real estate mogul "unique," but when asked whether he\nwas "hurting" the Republican name, he said, "I don\'t think so." The\nArkansas governor said the attention Trump has received could be a good\nthing.\n\n\n\n"He\'s capturing a lot of this space. My gosh, I wish I was getting as much\nattention as he is, because anybody getting that much attention certainly\nis going to soar in the polls," Huckabee said on Fox News Radio.\n\n\n\nAccording to a recent poll taken by Economist/YouGov, Trump is leading the\nGOP field. Fifteen percent of respondents preferred Trump, which puts him\nfour percentage points ahead of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Rand\nPaul, who are tied for second.\n\n\n\nHuckabee added that no one need worry about what Trump will say as the race\nfor the White House continues.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t think that people ought to wring their hands that Donald Trump is\nin there," he said. "He\'ll say things differently than most of us, he\'ll\nsay things that maybe some of us wouldn\'t say, but he has as much right to\nbe on the stage and speak his message as any of us."\n\n\n\nThe former Arkansas governor said that allowing candidates to speak their\nminds enables voters to reach their own conclusions, saying, "That\'s how\nthe process works." Huckabee emphasized that whether or not he agreed with\nTrump\'s rhetoric, getting the billionaire to change his ways would be\ndifficult.\n\n\n\n"This notion that we need to ask him to tone it down, well, first of all,\nhe\'s Donald Trump. He\'ll say what he wishes," Huckabee said. "And second of\nall, I think it\'s important for people to say what they really think. The\nvoters then get a chance to decide. \'Is that who I want to support?\'"\n\n\n\nDespite the attention, the Economist/YouGov poll found that registered\nRepublican voters believe Trump has a small chance of keeping his top spot\nas the race continues.\n\n\n\n"I hope when [the voters] hear me say what I want to say, they\'ll like it.\nThey\'ll want to support me," Huckabee said.\n\n\n\nHuckabee has been ranking fifth in most national polls. That support should\nqualify both candidates for a place among the 10 allowed to participate in\nthe first Republican debate next month.\n\n\n\n*CARSON*\n\n\n\n*N.H. fans feel the passion for Ben Carson\n<https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/07/10/ben-carson-brings-uncanny-appeal-campaign-trail/pnCWdgy6wArheCYG19DINK/story.html>\n// Boston Globe // Akilah Johnson \xe2\x80\x93 July 11, 2015 *\n\n\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s just something about Dr. Ben Carson, some Republican voters here\nsay.\n\n\n\nThey line up to buy copies of his books. They chase him down streets for\nphotos. Sometimes, they just continue to stare with awe after he speaks.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just kind of overwhelmed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter Rice, a retired volunteer\nfirefighter, his newly acquired \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m with Ben\xe2\x80\x9d button in hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThis guy is\na breath of fresh air.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s liking a candidate \xe2\x80\x94 and then there\xe2\x80\x99s the particular passion that\nCarson seems to incite, despite the sometimes unusual statements that make\nhim stand out among 2016\xe2\x80\x99s Republican White House hopefuls.\n\n\n\nSo what is it about the 63-year-old political neophyte, who often refers to\nhimself in the third person as \xe2\x80\x9cCarson\xe2\x80\x9d during stump speeches, advocates\nfor tax rates based on tithing, and compares the life-or-death plight of\nRevolutionary figures to today\xe2\x80\x99s politics?\n\n\n\nHe speaks with the aplomb of a superstar neurosurgeon and a highbrow\nhistory buff \xe2\x80\x94 yet also the raw candor overheard in a coffee klatch. While\ndescribing detractors\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to bring him down \xe2\x80\x94 including a reference to\na years-old paternity suit \xe2\x80\x94 Carson revealed to a packed town hall Tuesday\nthat, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew something they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. I knew that the only woman I\xe2\x80\x99d\never slept with in my life was my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSupporters gush over what they call his \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling personal story\xe2\x80\x9d and\n\xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense.\xe2\x80\x9d He is the only African-American candidate \xe2\x80\x93 Democrat or\nRepublican \xe2\x80\x93 and his resume is unlike the others. It includes his tenure as\ndirector of neurosurgery at John Hopkins University but no elected offices\nor previous flirtations with running for president.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x98So far, he hits the nerve in my body that says treat people fairly, be\nrespectable, do the right thing, love your country.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\n\nThere are pundits who say Carson\xe2\x80\x99s brand of religious conservatism will not\nwin in New Hampshire, which polls show is one of the least religious states\nin the country.\n\n\n\nA recent poll by the University of New Hampshire showed Carson barely\nregistered when voters were asked who had the best chance of winning, which\ncandidate best represented Republicans like themselves, and who would be\nthe strongest leader.\n\n\n\nStill, the university poll did show Carson had a high net favorability\nranking, coming in second after US Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. And\naccording to national polls, he would make the 10-candidate cut to be\nonstage if the first televised national debate were held today.\n\n\n\nSo the retired doctor and his supporters aren\xe2\x80\x99t worried about the naysayers.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in love with him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dianne Durkin, president and founder of an\nemployment loyalty company. \xe2\x80\x9cHis entire thing about . . . leadership is\nspot on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBen Carson greeted passersby as he campaigned in Portsmouth, N.H. earlier\nthis week.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far, he hits the nerve in my body that says treat people fairly, be\nrespectable, do the right thing, love your country,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doug Bates,\npresident of the Portsmouth Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\n\nBates estimates he has heard eight candidates speak but only wanted his\npicture taken with one \xe2\x80\x93 Carson.\n\n\n\nIn a speech Tuesday morning to about 50 business leaders at Pease\nInternational Tradeport, Carson called for \xe2\x80\x9cstopping all this silly\ndivisiveness\xe2\x80\x9d and class, race, gender, and age \xe2\x80\x9cwarfare\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 all\ndistractions, he said, from the \xe2\x80\x9cradical Islamic jihadists\xe2\x80\x9d targeting\nAmerica.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are falling for garbage. We are allowing ourselves to be colluded. You\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t just go through life worried about who\xe2\x80\x99s on \xe2\x80\x98Dancing with the Stars,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\nCarson said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you willing to fight for? What are you willing to\ndie for?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nCarson spent three days campaigning in New Hampshire, with its\nfirst-in-the-nation primary.\n\n\n\nLast month, Carson grabbed national attention by calling out some of the\nother candidates who, he said, were slow to criticize the massacre at the\nCharleston, S.C., church as rooted in racism.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there are people who are claiming that they can lead this country who\ndare not call this tragedy an act of racism, a hate crime, for fear of\noffending a particular segment of the electorate,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in an op-ed\npiece.\n\n\n\nIt was just two years ago that Carson burst into the political arena at the\nNational Prayer Breakfast. He used humor and his personal story of growing\nup in an impoverished Detroit home to give a conservative critique on the\ncountry\xe2\x80\x99s state of affairs as President Obama sat nearby.\n\n\n\nSome of his most scathing remarks focused on the Affordable Care Act, which\nhe wants to replace with a health care system that gives people\ntransferable health savings accounts.\n\n\n\nCarson\xe2\x80\x99s single mother was determined her two sons would rise above their\nstation in life, he said. She refused to accept public assistance and\nrequired regular book reports when he began doing poorly in school, even\nthough she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read them.\n\n\n\nHe would earn a scholarship to Yale University, where he met his wife,\nCandy, and continue to the University of Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s medical school.\n\n\n\nEchoes of that speech come through when Carson addresses a crowd from the\ncampaign trail \xe2\x80\x94 but not when he engages in retail politics. As he shook\nhands and greeted voters one-on-one along the streets of downtown\nPortsmouth with his wife of 40 years, she was talkative and personable\nwhile he was awkward and reserved.\n\n\n\nOnstage, though, he seems to capture voters. In Bedford, after one of the\nmust-stop \xe2\x80\x9cPolitics & Eggs\xe2\x80\x9d forums, a woman murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cLove his message. He\nsays it just right.\xe2\x80\x9d At a town hall in Barrington, he concluded his speech\nby invoking Nathan Hale, famous for saying \xe2\x80\x9cI only regret that I have but\none life to lose for my country.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe baton of freedom is in the hands of we the people,\xe2\x80\x9d Carson told the\ncrowd of about 150.\n\n\n\nIt was a speech that might have earned Donna Callmeyer\xe2\x80\x99s support. The\n72-year-old Milford resident said she, like so many Republicans, was\nlooking \xe2\x80\x9cfor one of the bazillion candidates that we can support.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nCarson\xe2\x80\x99s intellect \xe2\x80\x9ctotally impressed,\xe2\x80\x9d her, as did \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact that he\nanswers questions so thoroughly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, like, in your face about it,\xe2\x80\x9d interjected her 14-year-old\ngranddaughter Asia Hanson.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t walk away wondering what he thinks about immigration or the\neconomy,\xe2\x80\x9d Callmeyer continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt a genuine honesty.

As we destroy\nthem economically as we destroy them morally as we weaken our defenses as\nwe do all the things that are necessary to bring down our nation," Carson\nsaid.\n\n\n\nCarson\'s comments about government overreach came in reaction to the\nSupreme Court\'s recent decision upholding Obamacare subsidies for federal\nexchange customers. Carson said "the Affordable Care Act is the government\nsaying we don\'t care what we the people think."\n\n\n\nBut Carson, a famed pediatric neurosurgeon, reserved his harshest criticism\nfor people who support legal abortion. He said there are people who go to\n"great lengths to save spiders" but not fetuses between six and 10 weeks\nold.\n\n\n\n"The baby killers, that\'s what they do, manipulate you into thinking this\nis not a human being," Carson said, adding they "capitalize on people\'s\nlack of knowledge." He added that technology was making more people\npro-life, because ultrasounds showed them the truth about fetal development.\n\n\n\nMany people in attendance at the National Right to Life Conference were\nevangelicals, a large bloc of voters to which Carson appeals. Carson called\non them to speak up for their values.\n\n\n\n"I think it\'s us the American people who will make the difference," Carson\nsaid. "It was Thomas Jefferson said this would happen. That we would become\nrelaxed, and that the government would grow and it would infiltrate every\naspect of our lives. But just before we turn into another form of\ngovernment he said the people would waken and reassert themselves. I think\nnow is the time we must do that if we are to save our nation."\n\n\n\nIn the last election, 30 million evangelicals did not vote, Carson claimed.\nHe urged attendees to encourage their friends to go to the poll, saying\n"our strength is in unity and belief system."\n\n\n\n*JINDAL*\n\n\n\n*Bobby Jindal\xe2\x80\x99s obsession with \xe2\x80\x9ccolorblindness\xe2\x80\x9d is everything wrong with\nthe GOP\xe2\x80\x99s racial politics\n<http://www.salon.com/2015/07/10/bobby_jindals_obsession_with_colorblindness_is_everything_wrong_with_the_gops_racial_politics/>\n// Salon // Eesha Pandit \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nA few years ago, the members of the Republican National Committee gathered\nfor a retreat after the 2012 election, in which the Democrats held onto the\nWhite House and gained seats in both chambers of Congress. At that meeting\nin the winter of 2012, Bobby Jindal offered up some fiery words about what\nhis party needed to do to win, including a rejection of its obsession with\n\xe2\x80\x9cidentity politics,\xe2\x80\x9d which he deemed \xe2\x80\x9ccorrosive to the great American\nmelting pot.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must reject the notion that demography is destiny, the pathetic and\nsimplistic notion that skin pigmentation dictates voter behavior,\xe2\x80\x9d Jindal\nsaid to applause.\n\n\n\nTo milder applause that night, Jindal called on Republicans to \xe2\x80\x9cstop being\nthe stupid party\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cstop insulting the intelligence of voters.\xe2\x80\x9d And\nyet, just a few years hence we find Piyush \xe2\x80\x9cBobby\xe2\x80\x9d Jindal, a Rhodes scholar\nwho once led his state\xe2\x80\x99s university system, engaging in the most regressive\nof politics as he begins his bid for the presidency.\n\n\n\nJust days after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected bans on gay marriage,\nJindal\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman Mike Reed said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe believe the U.S. Constitution,\nLouisiana Constitution, Louisiana\xe2\x80\x99s Preservation of Religious Freedom Act,\nas well as our Executive Order prevents government from compelling\nindividuals to violate sincerely held religious beliefs. We will continue\nto fight to protect religious liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d In practice, this means that the\ngovernor\xe2\x80\x99s administration issued an executive order to protect clerks and\nstate employees who have moral objections to gay marriage and don\xe2\x80\x99t feel\ncomfortable handing out licenses to same-sex couples.\n\n\n\nAs Jindal runs for president in the Republican primary, he is resorting to\nthose very same regressive and divisive tactics that only a few short years\nago he inveighed against \xe2\x80\x94 so much so, in fact, that many observers were\ntaken in by a satirical article that quoted Jindal as saying, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\nConfederate Flag is part of my heritage.\xe2\x80\x9d (In fact, the governor has\nskirted the issue of the flag altogether, telling reporters that \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x99s the\ntime for mourning.\xe2\x80\x9d) Given Jindal\xe2\x80\x99s penchant for refusing to identify as an\nIndian American, saying that he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjust American,\xe2\x80\x9d while hanging a portrait\nof himself in his office looking remarkably white, and raging against the\nneed for hyphenated identities, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a stretch to imagine Gov. Jindal\nactually claiming the Confederate flag.\n\n\n\n(And that\xe2\x80\x99s before we even consider his new campaign slogan \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cTanned.\nRested. Ready.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 which has been met with hostility in recent days by many\nin the Indian American community.)\n\n\n\nIn an Op-Ed in February, Gov. Jindal called for \xe2\x80\x9cThe End of Race,\xe2\x80\x9d going\n\xe2\x80\x9call-in\xe2\x80\x9d on the melting pot idea of America and beseeching us all to give\nup on our racial identities for the sake of a singular American one. This\nis a very convenient solution for a party that refuses to address racial\ninequity and injustice, which are, in fact, bedrock values in America. We\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t ended up with a racialized system where black and brown residents\nand citizens of the U.S. suffer greater levels of violence, discrimination\nand institutionalized inequity simply by chance. Our country was founded\non, and is grounded in, the belief of a racialized American exceptionalism.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a deeply rooted racism that allowed the founders to displace and\nmurder so many of the Native and First Nations people here before them, and\nto uphold and entrench a system of chattel slavery while talking about\nAmerican freedom and independence. Today, Jindal\xe2\x80\x99s statements about\ncolorblindness are a disavowal of that legacy and its ongoing aftermath. We\nare a country in which your race, and gender, are key determinants in\nwhether you\xe2\x80\x99re paid fairly, whether you are likely to be unjustly\nincarcerated, whether you are likely to be killed by police officers,\nwhether your children will get a good education, whether you will get care\nwhen you get sick, whether your babies will be born healthy, and how long\nyou will live.\n\n\n\nWe do not live in a \xe2\x80\x9ccolorblind\xe2\x80\x9d country, no matter how much Gov. Jindal\nwishes it were so, nor how much many of us would like to. We live in a\nhyper-racialized one. Calling for \xe2\x80\x9ccolorblindness\xe2\x80\x9d is a ridiculous solution\nto a centuries-old racial hierarchy that has devastating results for\ncommunities of color. Colorblindness is anti-blackness. Colorblindness is\nracism. The solutions we need involve looking that truth in the eye and\nchanging racist systems and structures, not turning away and deriding the\nquestion itself.\n\n\n\n*TRUMP*\n\n\n\n*Event for Donald Trump in Phoenix Will Draw Thousands\n<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/07/10/republican-candidates-appeal-to-anti-abortion-groups/>\n// NYT // Nicholas Fandos \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nDonald J. Trump, the real estate mogul who has tied Republicans in knots in\nrecent weeks with his comments on immigration, will roll into Phoenix on\nSaturday to address the issue again, just after the head of the Republican\nParty supposedly asked him to tone down his words on the issue.\n\n\n\nThe planned speech is already attracting a storm of attention. Even as city\nleaders have asked Mr. Trump \xe2\x80\x9cto stage his hate-filled circus\xe2\x80\x9d elsewhere,\nticket requests have been so high the campaign has moved the speech from\nthe swank Arizona Biltmore hotel to the convention center downtown.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Trump certainly has a First Amendment right to bluster as much as he\nwants, and even to pander to our worst instincts in a sad attempt to win\nvotes at the expense of hard-working, honorable, law-abiding Latinos,\xe2\x80\x9d\nDaniel Valenzuela, a Democratic councilman and the city\xe2\x80\x99s vice mayor, said\non Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, we should draw the line at allowing him to use the\nPhoenix Convention Center \xe2\x80\x94 a public building funded by all of our\ntaxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMayor Greg Stanton, also a Democrat, issued a similar statement condemning\nMr. Trump and his remarks, but assured that the city would not try to\nprevent the candidate from speaking.\n\n\n\nMr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said on Friday that 4,500 tickets had\nalready been reserved for the speech, 3,500 more than initially expected.\n\n\n\nMr. Trump will appear onstage with Joe Arpaio, the long-serving sheriff of\nsurrounding Maricopa County, whose tactics to track down and deport illegal\nimmigrants have drawn national attention and a federal conviction for\nracial profiling in 2013.\n\n\n\nMr. Trump has attracted sharp criticism from business and political leaders\nsince asserting in his campaign announcement that those crossing the United\nStates-Mexico border illegally include rapists and criminals. The remarks\nled several businesses, including Macy\xe2\x80\x99s, Univision and NBC, to cut their\nties with the developer.\n\n\n\nRepublicans will be watching the weekend swing through the desert closely\nto see if Mr. Trump tempers his language on the issue. This week, Reince\nPriebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, was said to\nhave urged Mr. Trump in a phone call on Wednesday to soften his tone on\nimmigration.\n\n\n\nMr. Trump is expected to start the day on Saturday in Las Vegas, where he\nwill speak at FreedomFest, an annual libertarian-leaning gathering that\nbills itself as the \xe2\x80\x9cworld\xe2\x80\x99s largest gathering of free minds.\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Hicks\nsaid he will also hold a press conference after the event.\n\n\n\n*Donald Trump Lied to Us\n<http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/07/donald-trump-lied-to-us-119929.html?ml=tl_6#.VaAM6BNViko>\n// Politico // Antonio Rijerino \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nAs I protested Thursday afternoon in front of the Old Post Office Pavilion\non Pennsylvania Ave in Washington D.C.\xe2\x80\x94the building Donald Trump is turning\ninto a hotel a few blocks away from another historical building he wants to\ntake over, the White House\xe2\x80\x94I thought about a meeting I had with Trump at\nhis headquarters in New York two years ago to discuss my organization\xe2\x80\x99s\nprograms, including the Hispanic Heritage Awards.\n\n\n\nOnce the meeting was set, I called immigration activists Estuardo Rodriguez\nand Gaby Pacheco to gather some young DREAMers to crash the meeting and try\nand change The Donald\xe2\x80\x99s mind on immigration reform and the DREAM Act. I\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mention the tactic to his assistant coordinating the meeting, and\nfigured I\xe2\x80\x99d simply sneak the DREAMers in as my associates. We were met with\nbewildered and not-so-happy faces at the top floor of Trump Tower, but to\nhis credit, Trump waved off his concerned staff and graciously got up from\nhis desk, welcomed us individually, and proceeded to have a civil dialogue\nabout immigration reform and the important role immigrants have\nhistorically played in the United States.\n\n\n\nFor over an hour, Trump listened intently, asked thoughtful questions, and\ngave us examples of Latino employees he held in high regard. He then asked\neach of the DREAMers to describe their journeys, which were compelling and\nmirrored every value each American shares: education, work ethic,\ncommunity, faith and family. After I summed up the conversation with\n\xe2\x80\x9cimmigrants are a value proposition to America,\xe2\x80\x9d he stood up, waved his\nhands in dramatic Donald fashion and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve convinced me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt was a great moment, but that\xe2\x80\x99s what entertainers do. They know their\naudience and give them what they want.\n\n\n\nAnd now, this shameless opportunist is giving a very different audience\nwhat they want to hear\xe2\x80\x94hate speech. An audience that has made him a\ncultural icon, a viable candidate for president and what is most worrisome,\nan audience that is responding favorably to his message. The no-filter,\nin-your-face, celebrity billionaire is now in second place behind Wisconsin\nGovernor Scott Walker in Iowa according to a Quinnipiac University survey\nand in New Hampshire according to a CNN-WMUR poll. Apology from Trump? No\nway.\n\n\n\nYesterday, in defense of his now-infamous statement on Mexicans, Trump said\nhe was simply \xe2\x80\x9cdefending the people of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d I applaud\nUnivision for being the first to send a message to Trump by breaking off\ntheir relationship with the Miss Universe Organization. Then NBC, Macy\xe2\x80\x99s,\nNASCAR and others including this afternoon my friend Chef Jose Andres sent\na message. But the loudest message is being sent by many Americans who have\nsupported Trump\xe2\x80\x99s xenophobic diatribe. And that\xe2\x80\x99s my biggest concern - he\ncontinues to pander to an audience that can potentially take his hateful\nwords and turn them into hateful action.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\xe2\x80\x99re sending people that have lots of\nproblems and they\xe2\x80\x99re bringing those problems. They\xe2\x80\x99re bringing drugs,\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re bringing crime. They\xe2\x80\x99re rapists.\xe2\x80\x9d That was Trump talking about\nMexicans (let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, Latinos) taking over the country.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are raping our women and taking over the country.\xe2\x80\x9d That was Dylann\nStorm Roof, the 21 year-old racist who murdered nine worshippers in cold\nblood at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Sound familiar?\n\n\n\nHate speech is the gateway to hate action and at some point in his life,\nRoof heard hate talk. Did he take it seriously? Sounds like he did. His\nwords nourish myths of brown invaders crossing the border with hopes of\nruining America like an updated Orson Wells prank. Or in Roof\xe2\x80\x99s case, Black\nvillains. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t simply a case of the PC police attacking a spirited\nAmerican as Trump-backers Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas, and, yes, Rep. Steve\nKing of Iowa say. (Let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that King was the reigning champion of\nludicrous remarks about immigrants way before Trump when in 2013 he\nblustered, \xe2\x80\x9cThey weigh 130 pounds and with calves the size of cantaloupes\nbecause they\xe2\x80\x99re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.\xe2\x80\x9d King is\nstill a Congressman representing a district in America where the majority\nsupports his stances about immigrants.)\n\n\n\nAttacks against Hispanics have more than tripled in a year, according to an\nofficial report released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, The Hate\nCrime Victimization report. The Census-driven study shows an alarming rise\nin violent anti-Hispanic crime with anti-Hispanic crimes more likely in\nregions with higher immigration populations and new arrivals. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s words\nare dangerous not simply offensive and should be treated that way.\n\n\n\n*Trump: I\xe2\x80\x99m still a birther\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/donald-trump-birther-obama-119945.html?ml=tl_20>\n// Politico // Nick Gass \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nDonald Trump is still not sure whether President Barack Obama was born in\nthe United States.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with CNN\xe2\x80\x99s Anderson Cooper that aired Thursday night, the\nRepublican presidential candidate said he was not that interested in\ntalking about the issue, compared to other ones.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into it,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said.\n\n\n\nAsked whether he thought Obama was born in the U.S., Trump responded: \xe2\x80\x9cI\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know. I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t release his\nrecords.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn the interview, Trump also claimed that Hillary Clinton and John McCain\nwere both birthers, and mentioned how he got Obama to release \xe2\x80\x9csomething.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nObama released his long-form birth certificate in April 2011 after\nspeculation from Trump and others that he might have been born elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that Hillary Clinton was a birther? She wanted those records\nand fought like hell. People forgot. You know that John McCain was a\nbirther, wanted those records. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the records. Hillary\nfailed. John McCain failed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrump was able to get something. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the hell it was, but it\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Because I\xe2\x80\x99m off that subject. I\xe2\x80\x99m about jobs, I\xe2\x80\x99m about the\nmilitary, I\xe2\x80\x99m about doing the right thing for this country,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Trump signaled that his beef with the GOP establishment is far\nfrom over.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News\xe2\x80\x99 Sean Hannity on Thursday night, he\nspeculated that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus might\nhave leaked details of their call to The Washington Post.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just don\xe2\x80\x99t know how the story got out. Nobody called us for\nverification, and honestly, I can\xe2\x80\x99t blame him, unless he gave out the\nstory, which is possible. Probably, he did,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said.\n\n\n\nTrump also again declined to rule out a third-party bid on Thursday,\ntelling the Post that he \xe2\x80\x9cwould have to see who the nominee is\xe2\x80\x9d should he\nfail in his quest for the Republican nomination.\n\n\n\n*Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s immigration stance dividing GOP in Arizona\n<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/donald-trumps-immigration-stance-dividing-gop-arizona-32377961>\n// AP // Bob Christie - July 11, 2015*\n\n\n\nPHOENIX (AP) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is drawing\nlarger crowds as he continues to criticize immigration policies in stark\nlanguage that has revealed a deep divide between immigration hawks and\nmoderates who are trying to avoid alienating Hispanic voters.\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, Trump was scheduled to campaign in Nevada and then in Arizona,\na hub of immigrant and drug smuggling where the real estate developer and\nreality TV star has developed a large following. A rally in Phoenix was\nfirst planned at a posh resort that could handle about 1,000 guests, but\norganizers moved it to the city\xe2\x80\x99s convention center.\n\n\n\nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s descriptions of Mexican immigrants bringing drugs and crime to the\nU.S. and being rapists have been roundly denounced as offensive. But his\nmessage about the broken border has resonated with many in the GOP,\nespecially after an immigrant who was deported multiple times was accused\nof killing a woman on a San Francisco pier.\n\n\n\nIn Los Angeles for a rally Friday evening, Trump brought together people\nwho said their relatives had been killed by immigrants in the U.S.\nillegally. \xe2\x80\x9cThe illegals come in and the illegals killed their children,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we better get smart in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nArizona\xe2\x80\x99s major Chamber of Commerce group, both U.S. senators and a host of\nother GOP backers heaped their ire on Trump as the visit to Phoenix drew\nnear. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, who met presidential hopefuls Sen. Marco\nRubio of Florida and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker when they were in the\nstate, is snubbing Trump. Protesters like the ones who greeted Trump in Los\nAngeles were expected.\n\n\n\nMaricopa County\xe2\x80\x99s tough-on-immigration sheriff, Joe Arpaio, is set to speak\nbefore Trump at the convention center event.\n\n\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, who with Sen. John McCain sponsored a 2013 comprehensive\nimmigration reform bill that stalled when it reached the House, said\nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s views \xe2\x80\x9care coarse, ill-informed and inaccurate, and they are not\nrepresentative of the Republican Party. As an elected Republican official,\nI\xe2\x80\x99m disappointed the county party would host a speaker that so damages the\nparty\xe2\x80\x99s image.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMcCain, in a statement issued Friday, said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf the Republican nominee for\npresident does not support comprehensive immigration reform and border\nsecurity policy, we have no chance of defeating Hillary Clinton and winning\nthe White House in 2016.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut A.J. LaFaro, former head of the Maricopa County Republican Party,\nrejected those views. \xe2\x80\x9cWith regards to McCain, Flake and the chambers, I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t respect any of those people anyway, so why would I care?\xe2\x80\x9d Lafaro\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not representative of my conservative Christian values. I\nunderstand that Mr. Trump is saying what a lot of people here in the United\nStates, I would like to think a majority of the people here in the Unites\nStates, are thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s comments after a June 16 campaign kickoff speech helped revive\nimmigration as a campaign issue but also prompted a series of cancellations\nfrom companies that do business with him or his companies.\n\n\n\nTrump begins Saturday speaking in Las Vegas at the libertarian-minded\ngathering Freedom Fest. Nevada is 27 percent Hispanic and a key state for\nRepublican candidates. His appearance at the conference, which bills itself\nas an egalitarian event for free-thinkers to discuss and celebrate liberty,\nwas a recent addition to a lineup that includes Rubio on Friday night.\n\n\n\n*In Phoenix Speech, Donald Trump Won\xe2\x80\x99t Back Down On Immigration Comments\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-10/donald-trump-won-t-back-down-on-immigration-comments-in-phoenix-speech>\n// Bloomberg // Emily Greenhouse \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nOn the eve of a Phoenix rally that he predicts will draw 5,000 people to\nhear him speak about illegal immigration, Republican presidential candidate\nDonald Trump told Bloomberg\'s "With All Due Respect" that he has no\nintention of backing off the stands that have drawn him rebukes from some\ntop-ranking political figures. "We have to stop illegal immigration," the\nbillionaire businessman told interviewer Mark Halperin on Friday. "The\ncountry is being decimated by it.\n\n\n\nSpeaking about the wave of criticism he has received this week, he did not\nback down. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I can do is talk the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said. He declined to say\nthat he has made any mistakes, or that anything had hurt his feelings.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I\xe2\x80\x99m a big boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShortly after Trump made his comments, the senior senator of the state that\nhe will be visiting for his Saturday rally issued a statement that, without\nnaming the real estate mogul, clearly took issue with his rhetoric. "The\ncircus currently surrounding the debate over illegal immigration sows\ndivision within our country and damages the Republican Party," said Arizona\nSenator John McCain, the Republican Party\'s 2008 presidential nominee. "If\nthe Republican nominee for president does not support comprehensive\nimmigration reform and border security policy, we have no chance of\ndefeating Hillary Clinton and winning the White House in 2016."\n\n\n\nDonald Trump on Campaign: It Really Is Intense\n\n\n\nIn his interview with Halperin, Trump acknowledged that the intensity of\nthe presidential campaign had surprised him. When asked to name competitors\nin the Republican field whom he respects, he pointed to Texas Senator Ted\nCruz and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who have come out in defense of\nhis comments.\n\n\n\nAt one point, Trump said that he felt the week, in which he has been a\nmajor focus of national political coverage, had improved his chances of\nwinning, though later stated that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely sure.\n\n\n\nHe made much of an Economist/YouGov poll that placed him Thursday in the\nlead of the presidential field.\n\n\n\nTrump has received a spate of negative attention since his remarks on\nimmigrants coming from Mexico at his official presidential campaign\nannouncement on June 16th. Businesses including Univision, NBC, Macy\xe2\x80\x99s,\nplus a number of golf tournaments and celebrity chefs have moved to\ndistance themselves from him. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that\nReince Priebus, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, called Trump\nthat day to encourage him to tamp down inflammatory comments on\nimmigration. Trump has characterized the call differently.\n\n\n\nTrump stressed his maverick status, twice telling Halperin, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a\npolitician.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe politicians will never take us to the promised land,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas\nhe alone has the capacity to win the general election. \xe2\x80\x9cI am the only one\nthat can beat Hillary Clinton,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will win the Hispanic vote.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe said that he will speak without a prepared text in his Arizona speech\nSaturday\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI have a very great memory\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and stressed how high the attendance\nwill be in Phoenix, and at an event Friday evening in California.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe in winning,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said.\n\n\n\n*Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Arizona Speech on Illegal Immigration Could Attract Thousands\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-10/the-one-point-on-which-bernie-sanders-agrees-with-jeb-bush>\n// Bloomberg // Ben Brody \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nDonald Trump is still talking immigration. And, unlike some in the\nRepublican establishment, Arizona supporters seem to love it.\n\n\n\nA speech "on illegal immigration and numerous other topics" by the real\nestate mogul and Republican presidential candidate had to be moved from a\nhotel to the Phoenix convention center "to accommodate the thousands of\npeople expected to attend" the Saturday event.\n\n\n\nThe rally, which will also feature the city\'s anti-immigration Sheriff Joe\nArpaio, already had 3,500 committed attendees Thursday evening when the\ncampaign announced the venue change, according to the Arizona Republic\nnewspaper. Arpaio has faced condemnation for his hard-line rhetoric on\nimmigration and has been found by a federal judge to have violated the\ncivil rights of Latinos.\n\n\n\nTrump has faced weeks of fallout since he said in his presidential campaign\nannouncement that some Mexican immigrants are "rapists." He has repeatedly\ndoubled down on the assertion since then\xe2\x80\x94and seen his polling numbers rise\nto top positions\xe2\x80\x94even as he has lost business contracts and faced\ndenunciations from both Democrats and Republicans.\n\n\n\nThe possibility of a Republican presidential candidate continuing to attack\nimmigrants and stoking backlash among the large group of Latino voters\nangered Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, who said Trump\'s views don\'t reflect\nthose of his party, according to the Washington Post. An immigration-reform\nsupporter, Flake also asked the Republican Party of Maricopa County, which\nincludes Phoenix, to withdraw its sponsorship of Trump\'s event, the Post\nsaid, but the party told the paper it is "thrilled" about the speech.\n\n\n\nArizona, a border state with a large immigrant population, has become an\nevolving case study on the subject. Arpaio\'s actions, along with those of\nformer Governor Jan Brewer, who pushed through a tough anti-immigration law\nin 2010 only to have it struck down by the Supreme Court, have garnered\nnationwide attention. At the same time, the state\'s senators, Flake and\nJohn McCain, have supported immigration reform as Republican leaders worry\nabout alienating Latino voters whom they hope to court, especially in 2016.\n\n\n\nTrump\'s rhetoric was "offensive to not only Hispanic citizenry but other\ncitizenry," McCain told MSNBC Thursday. "I guarantee you the overwhelming\nmajority do not agree with his attitude that he has displayed towards our\nHispanic citizens. We love them."\n\n\n\nA spokesman for McCain also told Bloomberg that the senator and former\nRepublican presidential nominee agreed with Flake\'s stance on the rally.\n\n\n\n*Don\xe2\x80\x99t Cry for the Trump Brand\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-10/don-t-cry-for-the-trump-brand>\n// Bloomberg // Caleb Melby \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nJudging by discounts on Donald Trump-labeled mattresses on Amazon.com, the\nbillionaire\xe2\x80\x99s brand is hurting. But his overseas business partners don\xe2\x80\x99t\nseem to have noticed.\n\n\n\nTrump\'s Macy\xe2\x80\x99s deal, and others, are gone after his incendiary remarks\nabout Mexican immigrants. Still, selling shirts and ties was \xe2\x80\x9ca small\nbusiness in terms of dollar volume,\xe2\x80\x9d the real-estate mogul, reality TV star\nand Republican presidential contender said in a press release last week.\nHis partners in international property licensing deals, a more lucrative\nbusiness line, haven\xe2\x80\x99t joined in on the dog pile.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far as the Trump-Panchshil association is concerned, this stands\nunaffected and we will continue our association with the Trump\nOrganization,\xe2\x80\x9d Surbhi Gupta, a spokeswoman for Panchshil Realty, Trump\xe2\x80\x99s\ndevelopment partner in two condominium towers in Pune, India, said in an\ne-mail. The company declined to comment on Trump\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, \xe2\x80\x9csince we are\nunaware of the ground situation there, from a social and political\ncontext,\xe2\x80\x9d the e-mail said.\n\n\n\nDevelopers in the Philippines, Turkey, Panama, Canada, India, and Uruguay\npay Trump millions in licensing fees to put his name on buildings he\nneither built nor owns, with an aim to sell condominiums and hotel rooms at\nhigher prices. These deals provide nearly risk-less revenue streams for\nTrump, which, along with income from properties he owns, helps pay down\nexisting debts and fund new projects.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Trump is successful and wealthy and one of the great things about the\nempire he\xe2\x80\x99s built is that it\xe2\x80\x99s diverse\xe2\x80\x94both geographically and across\nnumerous business lines,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alan Garten, general counsel for Trump. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\ncan withstand situations like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nConstruction cranes stand above Trump Towers Istanbul in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\n\n\nIn the United States, Trump\'s presidential campaign has so far prompted a\nstampede of disassociation: ESPN, NBCUniversal, NASCAR, Univision Holdings\nInc. and Serta Inc. have cut ties with Trump after he described Mexican\nimmigrants as criminals and rapists. A television company controlled by\nMexican billionaire Carlos Slim, the world\xe2\x80\x99s second richest man, announced\nMonday it would cancel a project with Trump. Chef Jos\xc3\xa9 Andr\xc3\xa9s said\nWednesday that he\xe2\x80\x99d be backing out of a deal to open the flagship\nrestaurant at an upcoming Trump hotel in Washington. And even the Federal\nAviation Administration got in on the act, announcing Thursday that its\nrenaming three aerial navigation posts that had Trump-related monickers.\n\n\n\nThat Trump\xe2\x80\x99s remarks aren\xe2\x80\x99t registering outside of North America doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nsurprise Nick Andrews, a London-based senior partner and crisis management\nexpert at public relations firm Fleishman-Hillard Inc.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s better-known as a celebrity than as a businessman outside of the\nU.S.,\xe2\x80\x9d Andrews said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd outrageous things are exactly what celebrities\noften say.

But they\nhave also cost him a seemingly endless string of business relationships, as\nmajor brands like Macy\'s, NBC and others have broken off ties with him.\n\n\n\nSpeaking with CNN Wednesday, Trump could not say whether any illegal\nimmigrants were working on his new Trump Hotel being constructed just\nblocks from The White House. The Washington Post reported that many illegal\nimmigrants, as well as legal ones, were working on the project.\n\n\n\nArizona has been a hotbed for conservative anger over illegal immigration\nfor years, making political stars out of figures like Maricopa County\nSheriff Joe Arpaio.\n\n\n\nThe Republican Party of Maricopa County and Arpaio are hosting Trump on\nSaturday. But the state\'s Republican establishment is largely snubbing him.\n\n\n\nSen. John McCain, the party\'s 2008 nominee, Sen. Jeff Flake and Gov. Doug\nDucey are all skipping Trump\'s rally. Flake told The Arizona Republic that\nTrump\'s views are "coarse, ill-informed, inaccurate, and they are not\nrepresentative of The Republican Party."\n\n\n\nThe Republican Party, meanwhile, has struggled with the issue. Trump and\nRepublican Party Chairman Reince Priebus spoke on the phone Wednesday and\nwalked away with very different versions of what was actually said.\n\n\n\n*D.C.-Area Lawmakers Call For Boycott Of Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Businesses\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/10/donald-trump-protest-hotel_n_7770496.html?utm_hp_ref=politics>\n// HuffPo // Christine Conetta \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nLawmakers and dozens of protesters came to the site of the future Trump\nInternational Hotel in the nation\'s capital Thursday to protest racist\ncomments about the Latino community made by GOP presidential candidate and\nbusinessman Donald Trump and to call for a boycott of his businesses and\nproducts.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has put everyone into the category of rapists and drug dealers,\xe2\x80\x9d\nMaryland state Del.

But when America\'s narcissist in chief says he also wants\nto become commander in chief, the country pays attention. And that\'s what\nTrump wanted to have happen. Here is what Trump said in his announcement\nthat he is running to add the presidency to his list of successes:\n\n\n\n"When Mexico sends its people, they\'re not sending their best. ...They\'re\nbringing drugs. They\'re bringing crime. They\'re rapists. And some, I\nassume, are good people."\n\n\n\nWhen challenged on the inaccuracy, outrageousness and viciousness of his\nremarks, "The Donald" characteristically doubled down and claimed to be the\nnation\'s only truth-teller, then attacked everyone who dared to challenge\nhim.\n\n\n\nNice of Trump to assume, I thought, that some of the 11 million\nundocumented immigrants who live such vulnerable lives in this country\nmight be good people. But obviously Trump doesn\'t know any of them.\n\n\n\nJesus talks about immigrants when he refers to welcoming "the stranger,"\nand says that how we treat them is how we treat him (Matthew 25:31-46). But\neverything about Donald Trump\'s life indicates that Jesus is a stranger to\nhim, too. (Parenthetically, could somebody ask why Liberty University, a\nChristian school, asked this lover of money, luxury, and power -- and\nhardly an exemplar of sexual morality -- to deliver a convocation address\nin 2012? I still can\'t understand that.)\n\n\n\nIn a long and remarkable interview with Trump on Wednesday, NBC\'s Katy Tur\npointed out some real truths -- including that undocumented immigrants in\nAmerica actually have much lower crime rates that our natural born American\ncitizens. Trump just insulted her, telling the journalist that she was\n"na\xc3\xafve" and didn\'t know what she was talking about.\n\n\n\nIt was hard to keep count of the number of individual people Trump attacked\nduring this insane interview, including the other Republican presidential\ncandidates, conservative columnists who were embarrassed or dared to raise\nquestions about the facts of all his "truth-telling," or the businesses\nthat are severing ties with Trump one after another for his idiotic,\nvicious and divisive comments. Trump called all of his opponents "stupid"\nand kept saying that nobody else can compare to his astounding "success."\n\n\n\nTrump\'s ethics are very clear here -- or rather, his non-ethics. Trump\'s\npride in his own success literally "trumps" everything else -- shutting out\nreason, respect, experience, maturity, truth, civility and certainly any\nsense of human compassion or empathy.\n\n\n\nWhile it is unlikely that Donald\'s favorite word ("TRUMP") will ultimately\nbe painted on the side of Air Force One, there are some important political\nquestions to raise about the "success" Trump is having in the Republican\nand primary state polls -- second only to Jeb Bush at the latest reading.\n\n\n\nWhy did it take weeks for the other Republican presidential candidates to\ndistance themselves from -- much less denounce -- Trump\'s ugly words about\nMexicans? Late and tepid at first, Republican pushback is slowly growing\nstronger from some, while others like Ted Cruz are "saluting" Trump for\nfocusing on "illegal immigration" and smiling over his "colorful language."\n\n\n\nRepublican courage and conviction in response to Trump\'s clearly racial\ncomments has been sadly lacking, as has the party\'s alleged concern to\nbecome a bigger tent that can reach out to racial minorities and American\nHispanics in particular. Why?\n\n\n\nBecause Donald Trump is a salesman. And that\'s really all he is. And the\nonly product Trump really sells is the only thing he really believes in --\nhimself. He\'s made another calculation, another deal, that he can have\nsuccess with a certain political segment of America. I think Trump has\ndecided to reach down, and I do mean down, to the hard core of the\nRepublican base, which is white, angry, and very right-wing -- a\nconstituency that is especially active and indeed overrepresented in the\nprimary phase of every presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nTrump reached out to that same group in the last presidential election\ncampaign when he decided to lead the "birther" movement challenging whether\nBarack Obama was an American or was really an "other" and not one of "us."\nThat racial appeal against a black president was the very worst of American\nsentiments -- and is consistent with Trump\'s latest attack on immigrants\nfrom Mexico and other "foreign" people not like "us."\n\n\n\nTrump certainly acts and sounds like a racial bigot. But whether he really\nis or not, there is a much deeper issue here -- Donald Trump is a salesman\nwho sees that racial bigotry still works with a core base of the Republican\nParty.\n\n\n\nEver since the Democrats lost the south to the Republicans because of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Republican\nParty, which dominates the entire south, has faced a very deep ethical\ncrisis and has some difficult choices to make. That hardcore white southern\nbase of the Republican Party wants to be a white party, and the leadership\nof the Republican Party still panders to it. What\'s also clear is that\nRepublican presidential candidates are afraid of that hardcore right-wing\nwhite base of their party--especially in the primary season.\n\n\n\nThat is exactly what happened to immigration reform, which passed in a\nbi-partisan way in the Senate in 2013 but was vetoed in the House of\nRepresentatives by the many Republican districts that have now been\n"white-washed" -- meaning designed to have no significant minority voters.\n\n\n\nWhen members of the House Republican leadership met with several\nevangelical and Catholic leaders in 2014, they promised to our faces that\nthey would bring serious immigration reform to the House floor for a vote.\nThey failed to live up to that promise, deciding instead to cave to their\nwhite-washed right wing base. Some Republican members admitted to us that\nmany of their constituents were expressing clear racial biases.\n\n\n\nI believe Donald Trump is deliberately and directly appealing to that white\nracist core of the Republican Party, and that\'s why he is currently number\ntwo in the Republican polls. He is selling racism and he is winning.\n\n\n\nI know and trust Republicans and conservative friends who reject such\nracism -- want to purge it from their party -- and long for a wider, more\ndiverse Republican Party for the future. Indeed, the Republican votes, and\neven impassioned speeches, to take down the Confederate flag in South\nCarolina show a tale of two Republican parties -- and that is a hopeful\ncontrast to the racist elements of the party to which Trump is selling\nhimself.\n\n\n\nIt is time for them to stand up to Donald Trump and what he is selling.\n\n\n\nThey not only have my challenge -- they have my prayers.\n\n*Donald Trump Could Seriously Damage The Real Republican Efforts To Reach\nLatinos\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/adriancarrasquillo/donald-trump-could-seriously-damage-the-real-republican-effo#.igNwEyr0M>\n// BuzzFeed // Adrian Carrasquillo \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nNo Democrats are quoted in this story.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not that they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be. There is no topic that fills them more\nwith unbridled glee, outrage, or fake outrage than Donald Trump. His antics\nhelp Democrats who want the GOP to be seen as xenophobic and unable to\ndiscuss issues that deal with Hispanics, like immigration, in a respectful,\nmeasured manner.\n\n\n\nBut for those who have worked to improve the GOP brand with Hispanics, the\nlast month of the Trump comedy spectacular, in which he has called Mexicans\ncriminals and rapists and doubled down on those comments, has been deeply\nunsettling. More importantly, they worry it risks further damaging the\nparty with Latinos and eroding gains they\xe2\x80\x99ve already made \xe2\x80\x94 even as\ncandidates like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio put them in a potentially even\nbetter place.\n\n\n\nRepublicans have made real and concerted efforts, over a period of time, to\nengage Hispanics after 2012. The Republican National Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Growth and\nOpportunity project has been well-funded, successful in key 2014 races, and\nis ramping up for the presidential cycle, with the largest chunk of\nspending going toward Hispanic outreach.\n\n\n\nLatinos on the left worry about the LIBRE Initiative, a Koch-funded project\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s doing real on-the-ground work in Hispanic churches and communities,\nall while espousing conservative principles in literature and on Latino\nmedia. GROW Elect, an effort started in California and expanding to\nSouthwest states, helped dozens of Latino Republicans get elected in 2014,\noften in Hispanic districts.\n\n\n\nThe goal with these projects is clear: showing that the Republican Party is\nnot the enemy. And Trump, these Republicans worry, is ruining that.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe greatest harm is to Trump himself \xe2\x80\x94 he says he can win the Latino\nvote, he\xe2\x80\x99s kidding himself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruben Barrales, who leads GROW Elect and\nis the son of Mexican immigrants. \xe2\x80\x9cNow young Hispanics will be smashing\nDonald Trump pi\xc3\xb1atas at their birthday parties in celebration. He fails to\nrecognize the harm on the Trump brand. But it\xe2\x80\x99s damaging not just to\nRepublican Latino efforts, but to Republican efforts as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBarrales pointed to the campaign for California\xe2\x80\x99s Proposition 187, which\ntook aim at undocumented immigrants and featured harsh ads about Latinos,\nas a moment when Latinos decided the GOP was against them.\n\n\n\nTrump hasn\xe2\x80\x99t just dominated the mainstream media, but has been viewing\nnightly on Univision and Telemundo, the Spanish-language giants that reach\nHispanic homes across the country.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrump has turned out to be Sheriff Joe Arpaio\xe2\x80\x99s replacement as the\nprincipal villain in what has practically become a new nightly telenovela\non Univision and Telemundo,\xe2\x80\x9d said MRC Latino\xe2\x80\x99s director, Ken Oliver-M\xc3\xa9ndez,\nwhose organization monitors Spanish-language media\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion of\nconservative viewpoints.\n\n\n\nSince his announcement, Oliver-M\xc3\xa9ndez said, Trump has been mentioned at\nleast once or twice in practically every newscast with very few exceptions\non the three major networks MRC Latino monitors: Univision, Telemundo, and\nMundoFox.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a distraction, a major distraction,\xe2\x80\x9d said LIBRE\xe2\x80\x99s executive director,\nDaniel Garza. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the narrative you want driving the national news.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut he said Trump has created a realignment within the immigration debate,\nwhere the bombastic businessman represents the extreme fringe and other\npresidential candidates are able to emerge as the adults in the room.\n\n\n\nStill, Republicans have not just had to comment on Trump, but some have had\nto do so repeatedly. When Trump retweeted a comment by someone saying that\nJeb Bush has to like the \xe2\x80\x9cMexican illegals\xe2\x80\x9d because of his wife, Bush was\nforced to say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can love the Mexican culture, you can love your\nMexican-American wife and also believe that we need to control the border.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIzzy Santa, former director of Hispanic media at the RNC, said Trump is the\nonly person who disregards that tone, and rhetoric matters.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrump\xe2\x80\x99s comments hurt the Republican field for the next cycle because it\nportrays Republicans as out of touch when it comes to understanding\nHispanic culture and the immigration debate,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nRepublican officials have also pushed back against Trump. RNC Chair Reince\nPriebus reportedly called Trump and told him to \xe2\x80\x9ctone it down.\xe2\x80\x9d House\nSpeaker John Boehner condemned the use of immigration as a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical\nfootball.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nStill, people maintain all\xe2\x80\x99s not lost. A prominent Hispanic operative\nadvising a Republican campaign called Trump irrelevant and said he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nreflect the views of the party.\n\n\n\nA Latino at a different campaign said the good news for Republicans is that\nit\xe2\x80\x99s 2015, not 2016. The operative said candidates who have had to engage\nLatinos in the past, like Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Rick Perry, and Chris\nChristie, know that they have to speak to Hispanic voters, who will be\npaying attention to how they respond to Trump and the immigration issue. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nthink it\xe2\x80\x99s a defining moment for the Republican candidates on where they\nstand in regards to these comments,\xe2\x80\x9d the strategist said, adding that Ted\nCruz\xe2\x80\x99s embrace of Trump \xe2\x80\x9chas disqualified him as a serious general election\ncandidate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTrump, relishing his role as presidential troll, has made it clear that he\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere.\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, Trump will hold a \xe2\x80\x9cStand Up To Illegal Immigration\xe2\x80\x9d joint\nevent with Arpaio in Arizona. The question now for GOP presidential\ncandidates is even if they come out stronger to repudiate him, how can they\nstop Trump from being Trump, all the while representing their party?\n\n\n\nBarrales said just as Republicans were leaders most recently in South\nCarolina to help take down the Confederate flag, they need to be here with\nTrump as well.\n\n\n\nOne prominent Latino operative who advises campaigns laid out the stakes,\nsaying continued comments and a focus on Trump only endangers the work\nRepublicans have been putting in for the last few years.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrump\xe2\x80\x99s divisive rhetoric and harsh tone is undermining those efforts and\ncould potentially block Republican\xe2\x80\x99s path to the White House in 2016,\xe2\x80\x9d the\noperative said.\n\n\n\n*Donald Trump Wanted To Make Charlie Rangel HUD Secretary In 1999\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/christophermassie/donald-trump-wanted-to-make-charlie-rangel-hud-secretary#.wl8bo8Vyw>\n// BuzzFeed // Christopher Massie \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump said in November 1999 that,\nif elected president, he wanted to make Charles Rangel, the Democratic\nCongressman from New York, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n\n\nAt the time, real estate magnate was considering running for president as a\nmember of the Reform Party. Asked by CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer if he\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x9cgiven\nsome thought to a potential Trump Cabinet,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump mentioned Rangel as his\ntop choice to lead HUD.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let\xe2\x80\x99s go \xe2\x80\x94 like HUD,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think Charlie Rangel is a\nterrific guy. He\xe2\x80\x99s a congressman from New York. He has been a powerful guy.\nNow the Democrats are not in power, but I think he\xe2\x80\x99d be terrific at HUD.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRangel has been a member of the House since 1971 and is still in office.\nHis website touts his record promoting affordable housing in New York\xe2\x80\x99s\n13th Congressional District.\n\n\n\nOther Trump Cabinet picks would have included Colin Powell as secretary of\nstate and General Electric CEO Jack Welch as treasury secretary. Trump said\nthat John McCain would be \xe2\x80\x9ca very interesting candidate\xe2\x80\x9d for secretary of\ndefense.\n\n\n\nIn the interview, Trump also predicted that, if he won the Reform Party\xe2\x80\x99s\nnomination, he would \xe2\x80\x9ctake more votes away from the Democrats\xe2\x80\x9d than the\nRepublicans in the general election. He ended up withdrawing from the race\nin February 2000.\n\n\n\n*Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Got the GOP by the Balls\n<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/10/trump-s-got-the-gop-by-the-balls.html>\n// Daily Beast // Michael Tomasky \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nDeflating as it is, the likely Donald Trump scenario is this: He burns hot\nfor a little while longer; he says something really out there in the first\ndebate that roils up the base but makes Reince Priebus and Karl Rove break\nout in canker sores; but by the time of the baseball playoffs maybe, his\nact gets old, and somebody else becomes the Herman Cain of October. Then,\nnext year, the primaries will start, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get votes. He\xe2\x80\x99s not\ngoing to be all that competitive in Iowa, so it\xe2\x80\x99s New Hampshire where he\xe2\x80\x99ll\nneed to deliver something. And if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, he\xe2\x80\x99ll just go away.\n\n\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the pattern anyway. I seem to recall that at this point in 2011,\nMichele Bachmann had a pretty good head of steam going. So maybe we\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get too overheated about him.\n\n\n\nBut Trump is different from Bachmann, and even from fellow entrepreneur\nCain, in one major respect: He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give a crap about the Republican\nParty. He cares about Trump. And don\xe2\x80\x99t forget he has the power\nsinglehandedly to make Hillary Clinton president. He knows it, and you\nbetter believe Priebus knows it, and it is this fact that establishes a\npower dynamic between Trump and the GOP in which Trump totally has the\nupper hand and can make mischief in the party for months.\n\n\n\nHow does he have the power to elect Clinton all by himself? By running as\nan independent. Two factors usually prevent candidates who lose nominations\nfrom running as independents. One, they lack the enormous amount of money\nneeded to pursue that path (pay the lawyers to get them on 50 state\nballots, etc.). Two, they have a sense of proportion and decency, and they\nfigure that if primary voters rejected them, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to go home.\n\n\n\nWell, Trump has the dough and lacks the decency. In an interview this week\nwith Byron York, he left the door open a crack to such a candidacy. And\nthat would be all it would take. Given his fame and name recognition, he\xe2\x80\x99d\nlikely hit the polling threshold needed to qualify for the fall debates.\nAnd with that kind of exposure, he\xe2\x80\x99d do well\xe2\x80\x94enough. All he needs to get is\n5 percent of the vote in Florida, Ohio, Virginia, and Colorado, and the\nRepublican, whoever it is, is sizzled. Another electoral landslide.\n\n\n\nHow does he have the power to elect Clinton all by himself? By running as\nan independent.\n\nThe question is would he, and the answer is who knows? To York, he\nexpressed awareness of the obvious drawbacks, pointing to the spoiler role\nhe says Ross Perot played in 1992: \xe2\x80\x9cI think every single vote that went to\nRoss Perot came from [George H.W.] Bush\xe2\x80\xa6Virtually every one of his 19\npercentage points came from the Republicans. If Ross Perot didn\xe2\x80\x99t run, you\nhave never heard of Bill Clinton.\xe2\x80\x9d He is\xe2\x80\x94shocker\xe2\x80\x94wrong about this, but what\nmatters for present purposes is that he believes it, so maybe that means he\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t follow through.\n\n\n\nBut he is an unpredictable fellow. Suppose Priebus and the GOP piss him off\nin some way, and he thinks the hell with these losers. Suppose he\ndecides\xe2\x80\x94and don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt the importance of this\xe2\x80\x94that an independent run\nwould be good for the Trump brand in the long run. And suppose he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nactually mind so much the idea of Hillary Clinton being president. We\nalready know he retains a soft spot for old Bill. And he donated to Hillary\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s senatorial campaign.\n\n\n\nAll that\xe2\x80\x99s speculative. But even in the here and now this dynamic has\nconsequences. It means the GOP can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to offend Trump. This is why\nPriebus\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman characterized the chairman\xe2\x80\x99s Wednesday evening phone\nchat with Trump as \xe2\x80\x9cvery respectful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s why the other candidates\xe2\x80\x99 criticisms of him have been a little,\nah, restrained. Politicians aren\xe2\x80\x99t always real smart about any number of\nthings, but one thing in my experience that they almost always have a very\nkeen sense of is risk. Members of Congress, for example, generally know\nexactly what percentage of their electorate they\xe2\x80\x99re going to sacrifice by\ncasting X vote. Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Trump criticisms are muted because he has a lot\nto lose by offending Trump and his supporters. Chris Christie, who\xe2\x80\x99s little\nmore than an asterisk in the polls, has less to lose, so he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to be\na bit more blunt. Same goes for Rick Perry.\n\n\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see if Trump has developed that politician\xe2\x80\x99s sense of risk. If he\ngoes too far, one or certainly two more equivalents of \xe2\x80\x9cMexican rapists,\xe2\x80\x9d\nit\xe2\x80\x99ll be open season on him. He\xe2\x80\x99s at a point of maximum leverage right now,\nand if he wants to stay there, he\xe2\x80\x99s got to tuck it in about 10 or 15\npercent and start employing the kind of racialized euphemisms that are not\nonly tolerated but celebrated within the Republican Party\xe2\x80\x94build the damn\nfence, no amnesty, Al Qaeda is storming the mainland through Obama\xe2\x80\x99s porous\nborder, etc. That way, he\xe2\x80\x99ll hang around. And he\xe2\x80\x99ll build enough of a\nfollowing that the threat of a viable independent candidacy remains a real\none. And that is Trump\xe2\x80\x99s trump card. And it makes Reince Priebus a very\nnervous man.\n\n\n\n*Donald Trump, immigration and the GOP\n<http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-trump-immigration-bush-rubio-gop-rapists-edit-0712-jm-20150710-story.html>\n// Chicago Tribune // Editorial Board \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nMany of the candidates have been wary of staking out a position on an issue\nthat has divided Americans for decades. Too bad.\n\n\n\nThe trick for Republicans is to appeal to their conservative base in the\nprimary season without alienating the Latinos who are increasingly\nimportant in November. In 2012, Barack Obama got more than 70 percent of\nthe Latino vote.\n\n\n\nThe takeaway from that election, supposedly, was that Republicans needed to\nget serious about immigration reform, including addressing the status of\nthe 11 million \xe2\x80\x94 no, it\'s not 34 million, Mr. Trump \xe2\x80\x94 who are in the\ncountry illegally.\n\n\n\nBut here we are at the dawn of another presidential election cycle with no\nsolution in sight, and a lot of ducking and weaving from candidates who\ndon\'t want to take a position now that could hurt them later.\n\n\n\nThere\'s no ambiguity in Trump\'s stance, and so far it hasn\'t hurt him in\nthe polls. (His business dealings are another matter.) On Thursday, for\nexample, an Economist/YouGov poll had Trump first among 16 candidates, with\n15 percent of the GOP vote nationwide.\n\n\n\nThat emboldened the hardliners to chime in when Trump blamed lax border\nsecurity for the murder of a San Francisco woman. The man accused of\nshooting her had slipped into the country from Mexico and had been sent\nback five times.\n\n\n\nTo Trump, that\'s more evidence that the U.S. is a "dumping ground" for\nMexico\'s most violent criminals. He\'s promised to build an "impenetrable"\nwall along the border, and send Mexico the bill.\n\n\n\nThe candidates have been careful to distance themselves from Trump\'s\ninflammatory remarks \xe2\x80\x94 "They\'re bringing drugs. They\'re bringing crime.\nThey\'re rapists"\xe2\x80\x94 while calling for more border security or stricter\nenforcement of existing laws.\n\n\n\nSome have focused on the role of "sanctuary cities," such as San Francisco\n(and Chicago), where local law enforcement officials do not routinely\ndetain undocumented immigrants for the feds. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\nand former Texas Gov. Rick Perry both called for withholding federal\nfunding from cities with sanctuary policies.\n\n\n\nYou don\'t have to agree with Trump to welcome a discussion that will help\nsort the throw-them-all-out candidates from the ones who recognize that a\nbroader fix is in order.\n\n\n\nThe last thing Republicans need is a replay of the 2012 primaries, in which\none candidate (Herman Cain) called for a 20-foot electrified border fence\nand another (Perry) was scorned for suggesting that kids who were brought\nto the U.S. by their parents ought to be allowed to stay and go to college.\n\n\n\nMitt Romney, the eventual nominee, favored a policy harsh enough to\nencourage undocumented immigrants to "self-deport." Look what that got him.\n\n\n\nYou need a score card to keep up with the shifting positions of this year\'s\ncandidates.\n\n\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio was one of the authors of an excellent bipartisan\nmeasure that passed the Senate in 2013. The bill balanced border security\nwith a more flexible visa system and a path to earned citizenship for most\nundocumented immigrants. But Rubio backed away from that approach, which\ngot nowhere in the House.\n\n\n\nBush proposed a legal status short of earned citizenship as part of a\ncomprehensive fix in his 2013 book, "Immigration Wars: Forging an American\nSolution." Before and after that, he favored a path to citizenship.\n\n\n\nIt\'s frankly hard to tell where either of them stands at the moment, though\nwe\'d argue that they\'ve both been in the ballpark most of the time. We\'d\nalso argue that flexibility isn\'t such a bad thing if it gets us to a\nsolution.\n\n\n\nCompromise is one thing. Waffling is another. How are voters supposed to\ntell the difference?\n\n\n\nRepublicans have to find a way forward on immigration reform. The candidate\nwho can make that happen is the one who\'s willing to grab the megaphone\nfrom Trump, and lead.\n\n\n\n*Trump ups the ante on immigration, unfazed by criticism and protests\n<http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-donald-trump-immigration-20150710-story.html#page=1>\n// LA Times // Katie Linthicum, Richard Winton and Kurtis Lee \xe2\x80\x93 July 10,\n2015 *\n\n\n\nDonald Trump brought his Republican presidential campaign to Los Angeles on\nFriday, unrepentant over his inflammatory comments about Latino immigrants\nthat have drawn national ire and pushback from businesses, celebrities and\nfellow party members.\n\n\n\nIn two appearances Friday, Trump drew praise from fellow opponents of\nillegal immigration and criticism from protesters angered by his comments\nthat Mexican immigrants were drug dealers and rapists.\n\n\n\nThe business mogul seemed unfazed, even predicting he would win the Latino\nvote.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen it\xe2\x80\x99s all said and done, I will win the Hispanic vote,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said at\nhis first campaign stop at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. \xe2\x80\x9cI will win the\nHispanic vote because I\xe2\x80\x99m going to create jobs. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take them away\nfrom China.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nTrump appeared with several opponents of illegal immigration, including\nthose whose family members were killed in accidents and crimes by\nassailants alleged to be in the country illegally. One of them was Brenda\nSparks, who said her son was killed in a traffic collision with an\nimmigrant in the country illegally.\n\n\n\nShe praised Trump for having \xe2\x80\x9cthe guts to say what millions are thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n"My taxpayer dollars are paying for all these illegals and their children,\xe2\x80\x9d\nSparks said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve lost my child; how much more do I have to give?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDon Rosenberg, whose son was killed in 2010 by an immigrant from Honduras\nwho came to the country illegally but had been given temporary legal\nstatus, said his appearance at the event was not an endorsement of Trump\'s\ncampaign. But he said he appreciated the candidate putting immigration at\nthe center of the 2016 presidential race.\n\n\n\n"I think that what he said he could have articulated better, but the\ngeneral premise of what he said is true," Rosenberg said. "I\xe2\x80\x99m happy that\nhe brought the subject up because it needs to be talked about. Every crime\nan immigrant commits is an additional crime. Every crime they commit is a\ncrime they wouldn\'t have committed otherwise."\n\n\n\nTrump drew a decidedly different reaction in Brentwood, where he addressed\na group of entertainment industry conservatives at the Luxe Sunset\nBoulevard Hotel.\n\n\n\nHours before Trump\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, protesters began packing the corner of Sunset\nBoulevard and Church Lane, holding American flags and \xe2\x80\x9cDump Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x9d\nsigns. They yelled anti-Trump chants through megaphones in Spanish and\nEnglish as some drivers of passing cars honked in support.\n\n\n\nBy 7 p.m., the crowd had swelled to more than 120. Organizers with the\nCoalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles brought Trump pinatas\nstuffed with trash -- symbolizing, they said, the mogul\xe2\x80\x99s incendiary\nrhetoric.\n\n\n\nHilda Ramirez, a West Los Angeles resident, said Trump should keep his\nmouth shut. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you open your mouth, a mess spills out.... You talk\nnothing but trash. Don\'t back Donald Trump!" she yelled through a megaphone.\n\n\n\nJoshua Gonzalez, a 21-year-old Calabasas resident holding a sign depicting\nTrump in a pink wig, said he came to the protest to send a message that\nCalifornians won\'t put up with "his out-of-control antics."\n\n\n\nHe said Trump was hurting the Republican Party, which might otherwise\nappeal to conservative Latinos who believe in education and hard work.\n\n\n\n"Donald Trump creates division among the races in California and across the\nnation," Gonzalez said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is trying to exploit divisions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut about 20 feet away, about 40 Trump supporters gathered, many wearing\nred, white and blue and carrying signs reading, \xe2\x80\x9cTrump Tells the Truth.\xe2\x80\x9d A\nman in a megaphone yelled, \xe2\x80\x9cViva Donald Trump!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAt times protesters and supporters got in each other\'s faces. One man\njabbed his \xe2\x80\x9cTrump for President\xe2\x80\x9d sign at protesters as a woman yelled back,\n\xe2\x80\x9cRacist!\xe2\x80\x9d and "Trump isn\'t welcome here!" Protest organizers and a security\nofficer tried to keep the sides apart.\n\n\n\nBy 7:55 p.m., the protesters had disbanded -- missing Trump by a few\nminutes, as he was driven to the hotel entrance in a black SUV with two\nbodyguards. He was to speak to the Friends of Abe group, founded a decade\nago by Hollywood actors including Gary Sinise and Clint Eastwood, which\nholds monthly gatherings with Republican speakers.\n\n\n\nThis election cycle the group has hosted several GOP presidential hopefuls\nsuch as Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina and Mike Huckabee. The events are private\nand not publicly advertised.\n\n\n\nEven amid criticism from some party leaders and companies, such as NBC\nUniversal and Macy\'s, that have cut business ties with him, Trump has\nescalated his anti-immigrant rhetoric since his campaign announcement last\nmonth.\n\n\n\nIn recent days, Trump has focused his criticism on San Francisco\'s\nsanctuary policies, under which a Mexican immigrant in the country\nillegally was released and subsequently charged with murder in a\nhigh-profile shooting July 1.\n\n\n\nImmigration agents had asked the San Francisco Sheriff\'s Department to hold\nJuan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, but the county\'s policies prohibit law\nenforcement officers from transferring immigrants to federal authorities\nwithout a criminal warrant.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Trump repeated his accusation that Mexico is sending \xe2\x80\x9ccriminals\xe2\x80\x9d\nto the United States and pledged to build a wall along the southern U.S.\nborder to keep them out.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople came into the country illegally and killed their children,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump\nsaid, referring to the families who stood alongside him at the Beverly\nHills event. \xe2\x80\x9cThe illegals come in and the illegals kill their children.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe acknowledged he has become a lightning rod, saying the head of the\nRepublican National Committee called him recently and ask him to \xe2\x80\x9ctone it\ndown.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to tone down important issues,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so proud of\nmyself for bringing this issue to bear, to the forefront.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must be doing something right,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m No. 1 in the polls.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIndeed, several recent polls have showed Trump among the top GOP\ncandidates. This week his campaign announced that an event Saturday in\nPhoenix with controversial Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio was being\nmoved to a bigger location to accommodate more people.\n\n\n\nBut not all Republicans have embraced Trump\'s appearance. U.S. Sen. Jeff\nFlake (R-Arizona) called on the Maricopa County Republican Party not to\nhost Trump.\n\n\n\n"Donald Trump\'s views are coarse, ill-informed and inaccurate, and they are\nnot representative of the Republican Party," Flake said in a statement. "As\nan elected Republican official, I\'m disappointed the county party would\nhost a speaker that so damages the party\'s image."\n\n\n\nStill, some leaders of the local GOP have said they will welcome the\nreal-estate mogul.\n\n\n\n"In Maricopa County we believe deeply in Reagan\'s 11th commandment that\n\'Thou shall not speak ill of any other Republican,\'" the party said in a\nstatement. "It is disappointing when our Republican leaders do not share\nthat same commitment to party unity and teamwork."\n\n\n\n*UNDECLARED*\n\n\n\n*WALKER*\n\n\n\n*Did Scott Walker\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter Account Get Ahead of His Campaign?\n<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/07/10/did-scott-walkers-twitter-account-get-ahead-of-his-campaign/?ref=politics>\n// NYT // Patrick Healy \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nIn what appears to be either a premature presidential announcement or a\ntease of one to get attention, the Twitter account of Gov.

Turnout Data Raises Questions\n<http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/07/10/is-scott-walkers-crossover-appeal-real-turnout-data-raises-questions/>\n// WSJ // Dante Chinni \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nA major part of Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\xe2\x80\x99s appeal, he reminds\nsupporters in every stump speech, is his proven ability to win the\ngovernor\xe2\x80\x99s mansion in a highly-contested, Democratic-leaning state.\n\n\n\nBut with Mr. Walker set to launch his presidential candidacy on Monday, a\ncloser look at the numbers shows a more complicated picture.\n\n\n\nResults from four recent elections in Wisconsin suggest that while Mr.\nWalker can win in a low-turnout, off-year election, he could have more\ntrouble in a presidential year, when more voters \xe2\x80\x94 especially more minority\nand young voters \xe2\x80\x94 come to the polls.\n\n\n\nSince 2010, Mr. Walker has won three statewide elections, including the\nJune 2012 recall, in a state that has not voted for a Republican\npresidential candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1984. On the surface, that is\nan impressive accomplishment that Mr. Walker\xe2\x80\x99s supporters say points to his\nability to bring traditionally Democratic states into the Republican column\nin 2016. In fact, Mr. Walker\xe2\x80\x99s performance in the state looks a great deal\nlike Democratic President Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nBut those percentages only tell part of the story. Mr. Walker has never\nbeen tested by an electorate as large and diverse as that which turns out\nfor presidential elections.\n\n\n\nCompare the turnout in the races Mr. Walker won to the last two\npresidential races in the state.\n\n\n\nThose are big differences. The drop between 2012\xe2\x80\x99s presidential race and\nthe 2014 gubernatorial was more than 600,000 votes \xe2\x80\x93 about 20%.\n\n\n\nAnd there is more to the difference than simply the number of voters. Years\nof voter turnout data show Democrats are simply less likely than\nRepublicans to vote in non-presidential elections, and that has been a big\nadvantage for Mr. Walker. Look at Milwaukee County, the state\xe2\x80\x99s biggest\nDemocratic stronghold.\n\n\n\nIn Milwaukee since 2008, the average decline in turnout from presidential\nto non-presidential years has been more than 115,000 votes \xe2\x80\x93 24%. In the\nstate\xe2\x80\x99s biggest GOP stronghold, Waukesha County, the falloff has been far\nless dramatic \xe2\x80\x93 only about 37,000 votes, or 16%.\n\n\n\nThat trend carries across the state. The counties that went for Mr. Obama\nin 2012 saw a drop of about 23% in the number of votes cast in the 2014\ngovernor\xe2\x80\x99s race. The counties that voted for Republican Mitt Romney in 2012\nsaw a drop-off of just under 20%.\n\n\n\nIn total, the 35 Wisconsin counties that voted for Mr. Obama in 2012\naccounted for 57% of the vote drop-off between the presidential election\nand the 2014 gubernatorial campaign. And Mr. Walker won 20 of those\ncounties in 2014.\n\n\n\nTaken together, these numbers suggest Mr. Walker\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to Democratic\nvoters may be overstated, and that his ability to win in a\nDemocratic-leaning state may be more the result of his timing than his\nability to reach swing voters. His biggest advantage may have been that he\nwas facing a smaller electorate.\n\n\n\nShould he get the Republican nod in 2016, Mr. Walker would not have that\noff-year election advantage. He would be going against the bigger\npresidential voter pool, and his strength in Wisconsin and elsewhere could\nbe very different.\n\n\n\n*Scott Walker tweets his presidential run\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/scott-walker-tweets-his-presidential-run-119972.html?ml=tl_12>\n// Politico // Katie Glueck \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nScott Walker is running for president, he announced in what appeared to be\nan unintentional tweet on Friday.\n\n\n\nThe Wisconsin governor isn\xe2\x80\x99t expected to formally announce until Monday,\nbut on Friday afternoon, the Republican appeared to tweet a black-and-white\nimage of himself waving onstage that read, \xe2\x80\x9cScott Walker is running for\npresident.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe tweet was not available on his timeline later in the afternoon, but was\nstill viewable under his account.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay tuned for Governor Walker\xe2\x80\x99s announcement on Monday at 5pm CT,\xe2\x80\x9d\nspokeswoman AshLee Strong said in an email, when asked for comment.\n\n\n\nLate Friday, a Twitter spokesperson said, "We\'re looking into today\'s\nissue, and we\'ve determined the Walker team was not at fault."\n\n\n\nIf the tweet was unintentional, Walker wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the first candidate to\nscoop himself on his own announcement: Earlier this year, a video of\nRepublican presidential candidate Ben Carson saying that he was announcing\nhis candidacy aired the night before his announcement \xe2\x80\x94 something he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\nplanning on, he said at the time.\n\n\n\n*Scott Walker\xe2\x80\x99s timely abortion victory\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/scott-walker-abortion-20-week-ban-wisconsin-119960.html?ml=tl_4>\n// Politico // Kyle Cheney \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nWisconsin Republicans gift-wrapped an Iowa talking point for Gov. Scott\nWalker this week, sending abortion restrictions to his desk just days ahead\nof his presidential announcement.\n\n\n\nThe legislation, which would ban nearly all abortions after 20 weeks,\ncleared the state Assembly Thursday on a party-line vote, four days before\nthe governor intends to launch his presidential bid. Walker has indicated\nthat he\xe2\x80\x99ll sign the measure.\n\n\n\nWalker\xe2\x80\x99s win on the issue comes as he\xe2\x80\x99s introducing himself to Iowa\nRepublicans, who tend to favor social conservative candidates in their\nfirst-in-the-nation caucuses. It also comes amid questions Walker has faced\non the right about his commitment to conservative causes, like opposing\nsame-sex marriage and limiting abortions.\n\n\n\nProminent anti-abortion advocates and social conservatives signaled that\nWalker\xe2\x80\x99s signature on the measure, which could come as early as Friday,\nwould be a welcome gesture to kick off his campaign.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose things will basically give him that Good Housekeeping Seal, so to\nspeak,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob Vander Plaats, president of the Family Leader, an\ninfluential conservative group in Iowa.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s great timing to benefit him,\xe2\x80\x9d added Marilyn Musgrave, a\nformer congresswoman and a leader of the conservative Susan B. Anthony List.\n\n\n\nTwenty-week abortion bans have been enacted in 11 states, according to the\nGuttmacher Institute, though in at least two \xe2\x80\x94 Arizona and Idaho \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99ve\nbeen struck down by courts. Proponents contend the bans are meant to\nprevent abortions after the point at which an unborn baby can feel pain.\n\n\n\nAbortion rights advocates \xe2\x80\x93 backed up by the American Congress of\nObstetricians and Gynecologists \xe2\x80\x93 contend that the science on pain doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\njustify the 20-week cutoff. The bill awaiting Walker\xe2\x80\x99s signature makes no\nexception for babies conceived by rape or incest, but it does allow doctors\nto act \xe2\x80\x94 while attempting to save the life of the baby \xe2\x80\x94 if any immediate\nhealth risks to the mother arise.\n\n\n\nRepublican leaders in Madison insisted the bill\xe2\x80\x99s timetable had nothing to\ndo with Walker\xe2\x80\x99s ambitions. Yet, after Walker first publicly supported a\n20-week ban in March, the legislature raced the bill to the governor\xe2\x80\x99s desk\nusing a series of procedural shortcuts, from an expedited hearing process\nto an \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary\xe2\x80\x9d July session of the Assembly to ensure the bill got\nto Walker ahead of his July 13 announcement.\n\n\n\nState Sen. Mary Lazich, a Republican who said she used to carpool with\nWalker in the 1990s when Walker was in the Assembly, told POLITICO she led\nthe drive for the measure \xe2\x80\x93 knowing that Walker would support it but\nwithout explicitly coordinating with his office, though she said it did\noccasionally come up in conversation.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re on the same wavelength, the same plane,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nState Rep. Jesse Kremer, who sponsored an identical bill in the Assembly,\nacknowledged that legislative leaders may have sped up the timetable,\nthough he said he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t privy to any machinations on Walker\xe2\x80\x99s behalf. He\nadded, however, that Walker\xe2\x80\x99s sudden interest in the legislation seemed\nlike a shift.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA year ago, he actually wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really interested in something like this\nand he changed his mind,\xe2\x80\x9d Kremer said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have brought\nit up if we knew he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t [sign it].\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWalker has repeatedly pointed to his efforts to crack down on abortion \xe2\x80\x94\nfrom defunding Planned Parenthood to requiring women to receive ultrasounds\nbefore undergoing the procedure to toughening requirements for doctors who\nperform abortions \xe2\x80\x94 as he inches closer to a presidential bid. But\nconservatives were angered last year when, in the midst of a tight\nre-election fight, Walker aired an ad calling a woman\xe2\x80\x99s decision on\nabortion \xe2\x80\x9cagonizing. And he borrowed language from abortion rights\nadvocates in his message: \xe2\x80\x9cThe bill leaves the final decision to a woman\nand her doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the ad. You\xe2\x80\x99re using the other side\xe2\x80\x99s garbage and it\xe2\x80\x99s not\nhelpful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Penny Nance, president of Concerned Women for America, a\nconservative policy group.\n\nYet Nance said Walker\xe2\x80\x99s position on abortion was never in doubt. Though she\nand other conservatives still have issues with some of Walker\xe2\x80\x99s advisers\nwho don\xe2\x80\x99t hail from the most conservative corners of the party, she says\nthe governor has taken more steps to curb abortion than just about anyone\nelse in the GOP field. The 20-week ban, Nance said, would just be\nadditional confirmation.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re thrilled and happy that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\npolicy whose time has come.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Oops: Scott Walker Scoops Himself Via Twitter\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-10/scott-walker-tweets-that-he-s-running-for-president>\n// Bloomberg // John McCormick \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015*\n\n\n\nThe word broke late Friday afternoon on Scott Walker\'s official Twitter\naccount: \xe2\x80\x9cScott is in.

Scott Walker\'s famous brawls with Democrats and labor unions put him\non the political map.\n\n\n\nBut squabbles with fellow Republicans here at the Wisconsin Statehouse are\ntripping him up as he prepares to formally enter the 2016 presidential race\non Monday.\n\n\n\nRepublicans in Madison have worked overtime in recent weeks to find an\nelusive deal for the state\'s two-year, $73 billion budget. Just a few\nmonths ago, Walker optimistically said he would announce his White House\nplans after he finished all-important budget negotiations. But fights among\nRepublicans over road funding, cuts in higher education spending and a new\narena for the Milwaukee Bucks delayed talks to a point where Walker had to\ntamp down that expectation a few weeks ago.\n\n\n\nWith just five days left before the Walker announcement, the legislature\ninched toward a deal on Wednesday when the Senate narrowly backed the\nmeasure, sending it to the state Assembly for final approval.\n\n\n\nAnd in a rare move that has his fiscal conservative backers frustrated,\nWalker has been pushing hard to find $250 million for a new arena to keep\nthe Milwaukee Bucks from moving. That effort to include the Bucks deal as\npart of the bigger budget was scrapped amid concerns that GOP leaders in\nthe legislature would not be able to find enough support from their\nrank-and-file.\n\n\n\nFor any governor running for president, it\'s a vexing problem. Walker\'s\nbrand, like the other governors seeking the White House, is built on the\npromise that running their home state effectively makes them fit to lead\nthe nation in a way that no senator ever could. But the national focus on\nWalker, who is scheduled to formally announce his White House bid Monday in\nthe Milwaukee suburb of Waukesha, has shifted recently from what he\naccomplished between 2011 and 2014 to the intraparty struggles he has faced\nmore recently.\n\n\n\nCharles Franklin, a veteran Wisconsin pollster and director of the\nMarquette Law School Poll, said Walker might be a victim of his own success\nafter clearing a litany of top conservative goals from the shelf in\nWisconsin. The list includes starting a statewide school voucher program,\nprivatizing the state\'s economic development arm (albeit one plagued\nquestionable decisions currently) and making Wisconsin a concealed carry\nstate.\n\n\n\n"If you listed all of the things that have passed during Walker\'s tenure\nit\'s a long and impressive list," Franklin said. "The big and bold thing\nwas Act 10 (labor measures from 2011), but to me all of the small ball\nthings matter."\n\n\n\nWalker still sits atop most polls of Iowa Republican caucus-goers, but that\nearly lead has dwindled somewhat. The Koch brothers, who were among many\nbillionaire donors to Walker\'s 2012 recall battle, meanwhile have indicated\nthey will likely wait before throwing their resources behind a single\ncandidate (if they select one at all, this cycle.)\n\n\n\nWalker\'s meeting with state lawmakers this year hasn\'t carried the gravitas\nof the 2011 national labor fight. But he has pushed for some equally heavy\nconservative policies, many top priorities for the funders who could carry\nhim through a very crowded Republican field.\n\n\n\nIn March, Walker signed a controversial "right to work" ban on mandatory\nunion fees. In May, he announced he wanted to repeal the state\'s\n"prevailing wage," which establishes a minimum wage for construction\nworkers on publicly financed projects. And a few days later, Walker said he\nwould sign a new 20-week ban on abortions, even in cases of rape or incest.\n\n\n\nDemocrats are quick to point out that during the 2014 election, which\nWalker won by roughly 6 points, the governor made no mention of his support\nfor any of the explosive issues and was often obtuse, as in an ad where he\nsaid that abortion should be a decision between a "woman and her doctor."\n\n\n\nWalker\'s office points to myriad accomplishments he\'s had, both at the\nstart of his first term and in his latest budget proposal offered this\nyear. Spokeswoman Laurel Patrick pointed out a two-year freeze in student\ntuition at public universities, drug-testing for welfare recipients and\nother items this year.\n\n\n\n"Since taking office, Governor Walker has bucked the status quo in\nWisconsin. His bold, common-sense reforms are about empowering taxpayers\nand putting them in control. Giving Wisconsinites the freedom to control\ntheir own lives creates prosperity for our people, as well as our state,"\nPatrick wrote in an email.\n\n\n\nBehind the scenes at the Wisconsin Capitol, Walker has come under fire for\nspending too much time on the campaign trail, while major decisions linger.\n\n\n\nWalker\'s focus on the campaign trail, including high-profile trips abroad\nto Canada and Israel dubbed "trade missions," has left the state\nunattended, said the Wisconsin Assembly Democratic Leader Peter Barca, who\nhas scrapped regularly with Walker throughout his five year\'s in the\ngovernor\'s office.\n\n\n\n"You just add up the time he\'s been away over the course of the past couple\nof months, on trade deals, not even to mention his political visits. I bet\nyou he\'s been in 15-20 states in the last month alone," Barca said. "He\'s\njust obviously is not putting much attention here."\n\n\n\nIt\'s a different governor, Barca said, than the man who pushed through "Act\n10" and the major overhaul in labor laws that would eventually make him a\nnational hero among conservatives and Republican donors.\n\n\n\n"He was very much hands on, he was here all the time and working it hard\nand talking to anyone he thought could help him have success," Barca said.\n"Wisconsin\'s in the rearview mirror, and it\'s getting more and more distant\nby the day."\n\n\n\n*Twitter: Scott Walker Presidential Announcement Tweet Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t His Fault\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/katherinemiller/scott-walker-tweets-that-he-is-running-for-president#.jtm1MNDek>\n// BuzzFeed // Katherine Miller \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nOn Friday, a photo with the words \xe2\x80\x9cScott Walker Is Running For President\xe2\x80\x9d\nwas tweeted from Walker\xe2\x80\x99s account.\n\nOn Friday, a photo with the words "Scott Walker Is Running For President"\nwas tweeted from Walker\'s account.\n\nThe tweet, which did not appear in Walker\xe2\x80\x99s timeline for much of the day\nbut was still visible for hours at its permalink, was a weirdly timed\nsurprise: Walker wasn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to formally announce his candidacy until\nMonday in Wisconsin.\n\nA Twitter spokesman said Friday night that the tweet wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the Walker\ncampaign\xe2\x80\x99s fault:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re looking into today\xe2\x80\x99s issue, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve determined the Walker team was\nnot at fault,\xe2\x80\x9d the spokesman said in a statement.\n\nTwitter did not provide further information on what exactly happened.\n\nOn Monday, Walker is expected to announce his candidacy, which will be the\nculmination of a lot of early pre-official campaigning for most of the year.\n\n\n\nSince Iowa Freedom Summit this winter, he has aggressively campaigned in\nearly presidential primary states this year and is considered a top\nRepublican contender for the nomination.\n\nThe Wisconsin governor is best known for his battles with public unions.\nAfter he passed a budget that required public workers to contribute more\nmoney to their pension plans and limited collective bargaining in the\npublic sector, unions protested for weeks, and ultimately helped force a\nrecall election in 2013, which Walker won decisively. Because of the\nrecall, the Republican has won three statewide elections in a blue state.\n\nEarly on, Walker has focused on his conservative record and pitched himself\nas a slightly more populist alternative to many of the other prospective\ncandidates.\n\n\n\n*Scott Walker On Hillary Clinton: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Has She Accomplished?\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/scott-walker-on-hillary-clinton-what-has-she-accomplished#.jpQjRL4Qv>\n// BuzzFeed // Andrew Kaczynski \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker says he\xe2\x80\x99s the best person in the Republican\npresidential field to take on Hillary Clinton, who he says has no real\naccomplishments.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d Walker said when asked if he thought Clinton was going to be the\nDemocratic nominee on the Charlie Sykes Show Friday. Walker is set to\nofficially launch his presidential campaign on Monday.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that provides a great contrast,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Walker. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s\nall the more reason why as Republicans we need to nominate a new fresh\nface. Someone definitely from outside of Washington with big bold ideas. I\nthink most importantly someone who can more than talk who can actually\ndeliver.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWalker said he is from \xe2\x80\x9cthe future\xe2\x80\x9d but Clinton, who is from Washington\nD.C., is from \xe2\x80\x9cthe past.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCause that\xe2\x80\x99s the best contrast.

And\nso having someone who has real accomplishment I think is a great contrast.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Scott Walker Gets Schooled by His Neighbor\n<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/10/scott-walker-gets-schooled-by-his-neighbor.html>\n// Daily Beast // Eleanor Clift \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nWisconsin and Minnesota share a common cultural heritage that until\nrecently included a healthy Midwestern strain of progressive politics.\nElected in 2010, Governor Scott Walker upended a hundred years of liberal\npopulism, charting a conservative path for Wisconsin that made him a\ndarling of the Republican Right, but left his state with a serious budget\nshortfall and disappointing job growth.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, across the border in neighboring Minnesota, Governor Mark Dayton\nhas relentlessly pursued liberal policies, embodying the tax-and-spend\nDemocrat that Republicans love to caricature. The result, surprising to\nmany, is that the Minnesota economy is going gangbusters while Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s\njob growth has fallen to 44th among the 50 states.\n\n\n\nDayton\xe2\x80\x99s success steering his state\xe2\x80\x99s progressive course has been a\nsurprise. He was a middling senator at best, serving a single term from\n2001 to 2007 before returning to Minnesota disillusioned with the way\nWashington operated. Time named him one of America\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFive Worst Senators\xe2\x80\x9d\nin 2006, and he was known mainly for his inherited fortune as the\ngreat-grandson of the founder of Dayton\xe2\x80\x99s department store, which became\nTarget. As senator, he donated his salary to underwrite bus trips to Canada\nfor senior citizens buying low-cost prescription drugs.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMinnesota\xe2\x80\x99s gains are not because Mark Dayton has overpowered the state\nwith his political acumen,\xe2\x80\x9d says Lawrence Jacobs, a political science\nprofessor at the University of Minnesota. He describes the low-key Dayton\nas the \xe2\x80\x9canti-politician,\xe2\x80\x9d someone the voters trust because he\xe2\x80\x99s not smooth\nenough to fool them. \xe2\x80\x9cHis skill is he has a clear agenda, and he\xe2\x80\x99s\nunyielding. This is not pie-in-the-sky Great Society adventurism.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDayton has a majority Democratic legislature just as Walker has a\nRepublican controlled legislature, bolstering the ongoing policy experiment\nin their states. The two governors have pursued agendas that mirror their\nrespective party\xe2\x80\x99s core beliefs, and the results so far suggest that the\nstarve-the-government, tax-cutting credo of conservative orthodoxy has run\nits course.\n\n\n\nDayton has raised the minimum wage, and he\xe2\x80\x99s significantly increased taxes\non the top two percent of wage earners to close a budget shortfall and to\nraise money for investments in infrastructure and education. In the\nlegislative session that just ended, some Democrats joined with Republicans\nto block his goal of expanding universal preschool. But he did get more\nscholarship money to educate four-year-olds.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the largest tax increase we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Minnesota, over $2\nbillion,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jacobs. More than three-quarters of the new spending is on\neducation, compared to Wisconsin, where education is on the chopping block,\nand Walker is at odds with professors and administrators alike at his\nstate\xe2\x80\x99s flagship university system.\n\n\n\nMinnesota has also passed the state\xe2\x80\x99s version of the Affordable Care Act\n(MNsure), and while its implementation has been rocky, it is in place and\nserving tens of thousands of people.\n\n\n\nDayton ran for governor in 2010 on an unapologetically liberal agenda, and\nwon narrowly after a recount. He was reelected comfortably in 2014, and his\napproval rating in the latest Minneapolis Star Tribune poll is 54 percent.\nContrast that with Walker\xe2\x80\x99s 41 percent, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a clear picture of\nhow each is faring in the eyes of voters.\n\n\n\nDayton\xe2\x80\x99s idiosyncratic style is in tune with the times, and at 68, he has\nno ambition for national office. Walker is running for president and\ntouting hard right policies that play well with Iowa caucus goers. He\nopposed raising the minimum wage, has significantly weakened unions,\nreduced spending for education, cut taxes on the wealthy, and increased\ntaxes on the middle-class in part to pay for the tax cut.  According to the\nnon-partisan Wisconsin Budget Project, Walker gave tax breaks that\ndisproportionally favored upper income earners while cutting $56 million in\ntax credits for working families.\n\n\n\nFaced with a budget shortfall and no way to plug it without additional\nrevenue, Republicans in the Wisconsin legislature are rebelling against\nadditional spending cuts. But Walker shows no sign of softening his stance\nagainst raising taxes or fees. Other Republican governors, notably\nLouisiana\xe2\x80\x99s Bobby Jindal, are in the same quandary.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems like they\xe2\x80\x99ve been backed into a corner and are just going forward\nwith pure ideology and discounting any contradictory evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d says David\nMadland, author of Hollowed Out: Why the Economy Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Work without a\nStrong Middle Class.\n\n\n\nAs the Director of the American Worker Project at the Center for American\nProgress, a liberal think tank, Madland in his book takes on the premise\nthat inequality is good in the sense that helping the rich get richer is\ngoing to help everybody else, that a rising tide lifts all boats.\nTrickle-down economics has gotten a bad rap and is rarely invoked as a\nphrase anymore, but the belief that tax cuts are the engine of economic\ngrowth remains the core of GOP ideology.\n\n\n\nThe fact that Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s economy rallied under progressive policies while\nWisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s has struggled is \xe2\x80\x9cone more data point proving that trickle down\nis wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d says Madland. While it\xe2\x80\x99s tricky to attribute the wellbeing of a\nstate\xe2\x80\x99s economy solely to its political leadership, Minnesota is\nexperiencing much stronger growth than its neighbor. Dayton has also proved\nresponsive to the business community, easing early fears that his\nliberalism might go unchecked.\n\n\n\nWalker, on the other hand, has doubled down to the detriment of his state\non policies that are backfiring. And if voters in his home state aren\xe2\x80\x99t\nbuying what he\xe2\x80\x99s selling anymore, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bode well for his\npresidential campaign.\n\n\n\n*KASICH*\n\n\n\n*Pro-John Kasich group raises $11.5 million\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/john-kasich-fundraising-new-day-for-america-11-million-119966.html?ml=tl_16>\n// Politico // Adam B.

The total includes\nthirty checks of $100,000 or more. The source said millions in additional\ndonations are already in the pipeline.\n\n\n\nRaising more than $10 million in eight weeks suggests that the Ohio\nGovernor\'s backers can potentially compete on equal footing with the\ncommittees backing at least some of his rivals, which have raised more than\nKasich, but over longer periods of time. A nonprofit backing Florida\nSenator Marco Rubio, Conservative Solutions Project (501(c)(4)), announced\nrecently that it had raised $15.8 million to date since January. A group of\nTed Cruz affiliated super-PACs said they raised a combined $37 million\nsince early April. Yesterday, Jeb Bush\'s super-PAC, Right to Rise,\nannounced it had raised a whopping $103 million since the beginning of the\nyear.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn just over 10 weeks, we\xe2\x80\x99ve exceeded our initial fundraising goal by over\na million dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d said New Day for America Executive Director Matt Carle.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe response to Governor Kasich\xe2\x80\x99s message has been strong. Supporters are\nlooking for a record of accomplishment and someone who looks out for all\nAmericans.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAmong those major contributors who have raised money for the committees as\nwell as contributed were Phil Geier, former chairman and CEO of the\nInterpublic Group of Companies, and Gay and Stanley Gaines, longtime active\nRepublican donors from Florida.\n\n\n\nKasich has long rubbed elbows with the kind of megarich donors who can kick\nin big checks to these types of organizations, first as a prominent member\nof Congress for many years, then as an investment banker, and in the last\nfew years as the governor of one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most politically important\nstates. Since he began to seriously consider running for president several\nmonths ago, he has put a premium on determining if he could raise\nsufficient money to be competitive and has spent a good deal of time\ncourting wealthy backers.\n\n\n\nKasich\xe2\x80\x99s operation will also have to prove it can also raise money for the\ncampaign itself if he is going to thrive within the large field of\nRepublican candidates. Raising campaign money, with a limit of $2,700 per\nperson for the nomination fight, is an extraordinarily time-consuming\neffort, one which Kasich will have to engage in while continuing his day\njob as governor of Ohio and meeting voters around the country.\n\n\n\nKasich and his supporters are eager to convince political elites and voters\nthat he should be considered a top-tier candidate. With his meager poll\nstanding, fundraising success is one of his best talking points to date to\nsuggest the viability of his candidacy.\n\n\n\nIn the 2000 presidential cycle, when Kasich made a previous run, he proved\nto be an anemic fundraiser and withdrew from the race.\n\n\n\n*Kasich groups announce $11.5 million haul\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/10/politics/kasich-group-fundraising-total/index.html>\n// CNN // Tom LoBianco \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nTwo groups backing Ohio Gov.

The Ohio governor is not formally entering\nthe race until July 21, but he faces the possibility he might not make it\nonto the stage for the first Republican debate next month.\n\n\n\nTo forestall that possibility, Kasich supporters spent $1.7 million to go\non air in New Hampshire with the first major ad buy of the 2016 cycle.\n\n\n\nKasich\'s haul puts him near the middle of the Republican pack, based on\nannounced fundraising tallies so far. The Jeb Bush apparatus leads the pack\nwith an eye-popping $114 million and Sen. Ted Cruz drew in a surprising $51\nmillion with the help of a string of super PACs. On the Democratic side, a\nset of groups backing Hillary Clinton say they have raised $24 million and\nher campaign has raised $45 million.\n\n\n\n*OTHER*\n\n\n\n*Republican Candidates Appeal to Anti-Abortion Groups\n<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/07/10/republican-candidates-appeal-to-anti-abortion-groups/>\n// NYT // Jeremy W. Peters \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nA half dozen Republican candidates for president reassured members of one\nof the most influential anti-abortion groups on Friday that they favored\nfurther regulation and restriction of the procedure and, if elected, would\nbe strong leaders on the issue.\n\n\n\nSome, like Jeb Bush of Florida and Rick Perry of Texas, both former\ngovernors, pointed to the various laws they signed when in office that made\nobtaining an abortion more difficult for women. Praising the \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary\nwork\xe2\x80\x9d of the National Right to Life Committee, Mr. Bush, speaking via a\nproduced video that featured people testifying to his strong credentials on\nthe issue, listed his work as governor.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m strongly pro-life,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI expanded adoption. We increased\nregulation over abortion clinics. We abolished this horrific procedure of\npartial-birth abortion. We limited late-term abortions. We required\nparental notification for teenage children.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Perry assured the crowd that no one has a better record than his.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fact,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe passed a parental notification law. I signed\na parental consent law. I signed a sonogram law so mothers facing that\nagonizing choice can actually see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOne of those laws that Mr. Perry signed \xe2\x80\x94 it set a higher bar for standards\nthat govern things like medical equipment and staffing and required that\ndoctors have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital \xe2\x80\x94 has been put on\nhold while the Supreme Court decides whether to hear an appeal.\n\n\n\nWhile abortion is not likely to dominate the 2016 election, its potency as\nan issue that can stir passions and fears among both conservatives and\nliberals will no doubt be a factor. And wIth movement on several fronts,\nincluding in state legislatures and the courts, the fight over abortion\npolicy is already something that candidates of both parties are being\nforced to confront in more real and urgent ways compared with other recent\npresidential elections.\n\n\n\nIn Wisconsin this week, where Gov. Scott Walker is preparing to announce\nhis campaign for the Republican nomination, lawmakers passed a bill that\nwould ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Mr. Walker plans to sign\nit. But his shifting public statements on abortion illustrate how fraught\nthe issue is, and the differences in running for office in a swing state\nand in running for the nomination of a party that has shown little\ntolerance for ambiguous stances on social issues.\n\n\n\nWhen he was running for re-election last year, Mr. Walker insisted that\nmaking abortion illegal was out of his hands and a matter of settled\nSupreme Court precedent. He also produced an ad in which he said he\nsupported legislation that \xe2\x80\x9cleaves the final decision to a woman and her\ndoctor.\xe2\x80\x9d Then early this year, as he was starting to more aggressively\ncourt the social conservatives he believes he needs to win the White House,\nhe encouraged state legislators to send him a 20-week ban. Similar bans in\nseveral other states are now being challenged in the courts.\n\n\n\nAbortion rights advocates have pointed out that the bill Mr. Walker intends\nto sign in Wisconsin has no provisions exempting women who are victims of\nrape or incest.\n\n\n\nThe possibility that the Supreme Court could take up a major abortion case\nnext term forces the issue in another way that makes it very likely to\npersist well into 2016. The fact that the next president could appoint\nseveral new justices was never far from the minds of the speakers.\n\n\n\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida alluded to this when he condemned the\n\xe2\x80\x9cegregiously flawed\xe2\x80\x9d Roe v. Wade decision and told the crowd, \xe2\x80\x9cThe White\nHouse needs an occupant who values and prioritizes life. And so my pledge\nto you is this: if you help send me to that place, I will never forget this\nplace. And i will bring advocacy to the White House, and we will get things\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Could a 2012 Rule Change Upend the GOP\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 Nomination Process?\n<http://on.wsj.com/1grNIx0> // WSJ // Patrick O\xe2\x80\x99Connor \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nClose races can turn on small, often overlooked details. One detail getting\nsome attention from Republican campaign strategists in the runup to 2016 is\na rule requiring its presidential candidates to win more than half the\ndelegates in eight states to qualify for the nomination. In a field as\ncrowded as this one, that might prove trickier than usual.\n\n\n\nThe Republican National Committee adopted the rule ahead of its convention\nin 2012 at the insistence of allies to the last GOP nominee, former\nMassachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who wanted to insulate him from an\ninsurgent challenge. The previous requirement was that a candidate win five\nstates.\n\n\n\nSome have suggested this rule might help winnow the field, as a de facto\nshortcut to winning the nomination, if the delegate math becomes a little\nblurry. But critics have argued the rule might prevent some candidates with\na sizable share of delegates from qualifying for the nomination. Some go a\nstep further, suggesting the rule may upend the entire nominating process\nif no candidate claims more than half the delegates in eight states, or if\nmultiple candidates clear that bar.\n\n\n\nThe reality is that this rule, like just about every other rule in\npolitics, can be changed. Members of the RNC rules committee can simply\nvote to change the number of states needed to qualify when they meet the\nweek before next year\xe2\x80\x99s convention in Cleveland. They can raise or lower\nthe threshold of states in which the eventual nominee needs a majority of\nthe delegates. Or, they can  scrap the requirement entirely. The candidate\nwith the most delegates will control this process.\n\n\n\nOf course, it may not be that simple. As anyone who has witnessed an RNC\nrules meeting can attest, even small tweaks can provoke a spirited\nbacklash, especially if a presidential nomination is on the line. A small\ngroup of RNC agitators has been griping about this rule since the 2012\nconvention, with one committeeman vowing to use it to unravel the entire\nprimary process no matter the results.\n\n\n\nAnd, a fight over arcane procedural rules is the last thing party leaders\nor the eventual nominee wants a week before the 2016 convention, especially\nif the nomination remains up in the air.\n\n\n\nThese questions may seem a little silly and premature, but the smartest\ncampaigns are already trying to game out scenarios like this one as they\nlook for an edge in this historically crowded field that includes a\nhalf-dozen top-tier candidates but no obvious front-runner.\n\n\n\nJust as the Obama campaign corralled delegates in smaller states and\ncaucuses, don\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if the savviest Republican campaigns start\nsending allies to Guam, Puerto Rico or the other territories that award\ndelegates. For all the focus on Iowa and New Hampshire, the best-organized\ncampaigns are already taking steps to collect the signatures necessary to\nqualify for contests in the 10 or so states that require them.\n\n\n\nThis, of course, is all a byproduct of the size of the field and the\ncaliber of the candidates. Despite the heartburn this process may cause the\nparty if the contest stretches deep into next year and turns on RNC rules\nand delegate math, for many Republicans, it\xe2\x80\x99s a welcome break from the last\ntwo GOP primaries in which no candidate generated significant early\nenthusiasm.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen this rule change was made in Tampa, there was no way to anticipate\nfour years later that there would be the largest number of Republican\npresidential candidates running all being on the varsity team,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rick\nHohlt, a prominent GOP fundraiser. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a serious problem, but a good one\nto have, if you are the RNC chairman.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Once allies, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio in battle for Florida\n<https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2015/07/09/jeb-bush-and-marco-rubio-heading-for-florida-showdown-gop-primary-subplot/JhtrkpDuWJ62XDEXWXsAKL/story.html>\n// Boston Globe // Matt Viser \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nWith Florida\xe2\x80\x99s political elite gathered in the state Capitol, Governor Jeb\nBush welcomed the next House speaker with a flourish, presenting Marco\nRubio with a gold sword and a legend dredged from the annals of the Bush\nfamily.\n\n\n\nThe sword, Bush half-seriously explained to Rubio in the 2005 ceremony,\nonce belonged to a mystical (and mythical) warrior named Chiang, \xe2\x80\x9cwho\nbelieves in conservative principles, believes in entrepreneurial\ncapitalism, believes in moral values that underpin a free society.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 The\nstory was inspired by Bush\xe2\x80\x99s father, who used to joke about unleashing the\nwrath of the former anticommunist Chinese political leader Chiang Kai-shek\nagainst his opponents on the tennis court.\n\n\n\nA decade after that humorous moment, the two Floridians, who have described\ntheir relationship as mentor and protege, are now rivals, locked in an\nintense battle for the Republican nomination for president. Both are near\nthe top in national polls.\n\n\n\nThe battle for Florida \xe2\x80\x94 which votes March 15 and awards all 99 delegates\nto the winner \xe2\x80\x94 is shaping up to be one of the juiciest subplots of the GOP\nprimary. Both Bush, 62, and Rubio, 44, established their public identities\nin the state\xe2\x80\x99s diverse and sprawling political culture and are now seeking\nto use their experience and records to catapult to the pinnacle of national\npower.\n\n\n\nBut for Rubio to win the nomination, political observers say, he must\ndevelop a strategy to sabotage his onetime mentor, creating tensions that\nare beginning to seep into view.\n\n\n\nBush supporters contend that Rubio should have been more deferential to\nBush \xe2\x80\x94 waiting until he had more experience \xe2\x80\x94 while Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s supporters say\nhe is just the type of generational leader to challenge Democratic\nfront-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n\n\nAnd that sword that Bush gave Rubio so many years ago? In the minds of some\nBush supporters, the senator might as well be using it to stab his mentor\nin the back.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarco was supposed to be a good boy and wait his turn,\xe2\x80\x9d said one Florida\nRepublican with ties to both. \xe2\x80\x9cJeb people are not happy at all with Marco\ngetting into this race.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarco is a wonderful politician. He could very well someday make a decent\npresident. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that time is now,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 said Juan-Carlos Planas, a\nBush supporter who has known Rubio for decades and served with him in the\nstate Legislature. \xe2\x80\x9cMarco may be many great things. But he\xe2\x80\x99s not Jeb.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRubio is not-so-subtly suggesting the Bush name is a negative, talking up\nyoung new leadership and running against dynastic political families. In\nresponse, Bush allies are openly denigrating Rubio.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarco\xe2\x80\x99s four years into his first term in the Senate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mac\nStipanovich, an influential Florida lobbyist and longtime Bush supporter.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe biggest thing he\xe2\x80\x99s ever managed is a 10-person House staff.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nIt was 1998, and a 26-year-old Marco Rubio had just become the newest West\nMiami city commissioner. He was at City Hall celebrating when the phone\nrang. The man on the line had donated $50 to the campaign and wanted to\nshare in the joy.\n\n\n\nIt was Bush, the soon-to-be-governor.\n\n\n\n>From the beginning of Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s career in politics, Bush was there to help.\nAlthough one is the scion of a storied political family and the other the\nson of a bartender and a maid, the two developed a bond out of their\nexperiences in Miami.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid [Rubio] sit at Jeb\xe2\x80\x99s knee as Jeb taught him the way of the world? No,\xe2\x80\x9d\nStipanovich said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut was he someone who liked and admired and aspired to\nbe like Jeb, and probably learned a lot of his skills from watching Jeb? I\nthink yes.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\n\nIn an e-mail exchange with a supporter just after Rubio became speaker,\nBush wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cI am so proud of Marco.\xe2\x80\x9d In another, Bush called Rubio \xe2\x80\x9ca fine\nleader.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel that our party can renew itself, something that I fret about at the\nnational level,\xe2\x80\x9d Bush wrote.\n\n\n\nIn his memoir, Rubio called Bush \xe2\x80\x9cthe man I most admired in Florida\npolitics.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was most influenced by the creativity and daring of Governor Jeb Bush,\nwho was a one-man idea factory,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio wrote in the book, \xe2\x80\x9cAn American Son:\nA Memoir.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nSix years ago, during a high-profile race in Florida, Rubio was happy to\nwait his turn.\n\n\n\nIt happened two days before Christmas in 2008. News had just broken that\nSenator Mel Martinez was not going to run for reelection in 2010.\nSpeculation was rampant that Bush would run, so Rubio drove to his business\noffice at the Biltmore Hotel. Rubio, who was about to leave office because\nof term limits, wanted to run, too. But he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of challenging\nBush.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush was at the Biltmore Hotel when Marco Rubio won the US Senate seat.\n\n\n\nThey sat for an hour, and Rubio left convinced that Bush was going to seek\nthe seat, according to a recounting in Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s memoir.\n\n\n\nBut about two weeks later, Bush called Rubio to tell him, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to\ndo it.\xe2\x80\x9d Only then did Rubio begin planning to run himself in a race in\nwhich he started as the underdog. At one point, he was down by more than 50\npoints and contemplated getting out of the race. Jeb Bush encouraged him to\nstay in, according to a source familiar with their conversation.\n\n\n\nIn the end, Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s timing proved to be excellent. He burst onto the\nnational scene with his Tea Party conservatism in 2010, when a health care\nbacklash sweeping much of the country helped him pull an upset victory\nagainst Governor Charlie Crist, who ran as an independent, and Democratic\nCongressman Kendrick Meek.\n\n\n\nAnd just as he had been there for him on an election night for Miami City\nCommission a decade earlier, Bush was at the Biltmore Hotel when Rubio won\nhis US Senate seat.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so proud of Marco,\xe2\x80\x9d Bush told the crowd. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so proud of his\nhigh-voltage energy, I\xe2\x80\x99m so proud of his enthusiasm. I\xe2\x80\x99m so proud of his\neloquence. And I\xe2\x80\x99m so proud that he will be part of a next generation of\nleaders that will restore America. Marco Rubio is the right man at the\nright time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nThe Senate race placed Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s name near the top of many lists for\npresident \xe2\x80\x94 in 2012, Bush was publicly pushing Mitt Romney to tap Rubio as\nhis running mate. Not only did Rubio hail from a big and important general\nelection state, but his Hispanic heritage could help his party broaden its\nreach with a growing slice of the electorate.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Jeb Bush was publicly pushing Mitt Romney to tap Marco Rubio as\nhis running mate.\n\n\n\nRubio still feels like he is the right man at the right time. And this\ntime, there was little deference paid to Bush. His career has been marked\nby underdog races in which he displays a willingness to take political\nrisks. Like Obama, he also has shown that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to jump into a race\nwhen he thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s ready \xe2\x80\x94 but when others say it\xe2\x80\x99s not his turn.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like, \xe2\x80\x98I like Jeb. But not as much as I like the idea of being\npresident of the United States,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d said Steven Geller, who overlapped with\nRubio and Bush as the Democratic leader in the Senate.\n\n\n\nThe strategy for Bush is to portray himself as an experienced manager who\nhas a run the nation\xe2\x80\x99s third most populous state. Rubio, on the other hand,\nis presenting himself as a fresh face who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hail from a dynastic\npolitical family.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday\xe2\x80\x99s over,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared as he announced his campaign in April, a\nswipe he made at Clinton that could also be interpreted as aimed at Bush.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nAlthough Bush currently leads in most national polls, Rubio is seen as a\nlikely alternative. When asked whether they could vote for certain\ncandidates, 75 percent of probable GOP primary voters said they could vote\nfor Bush and 74 percent said the same for Rubio, according to a recent NBC\nNews-Wall Street Journal poll. Those results were significantly higher than\nany other candidate in the race.\n\n\n\nIn Florida, Bush leads with 20 percent of voters, followed by Rubio with 18\npercent, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released last month.\n\n\n\nA key battle will be waged over Florida\xe2\x80\x99s Hispanic voters, not just in the\nfight to win the state but also to demonstrate who can best attract Latinos\nto the Republican Party nationally.\n\n\n\nRubio often talks about his Cuban heritage, and he was the first to deliver\nthe State of the Union response in Spanish. Bush had a Cuban band playing\nduring his announcement speech. He toggles between English and Spanish, and\nhis friends are quick to point out that he speaks Spanish at home.\n\n\n\nOn some key issues, the two candidates offer a contrast.\n\n\n\nOn immigration, Rubio initially pursued a comprehensive overhaul that would\nboth strengthen border security and provide a pathway to citizenship for\nundocumented immigrants. But under withering conservative criticism he\nbacked away from that plan, saying changes should be done piecemeal.\n\n\n\nBush favors a comprehensive approach that would solve both issues at once,\na solution that immigration advocates support and consider more politically\nrealistic but also one that causes heartburn among conservatives.\n\n\n\nBush is also more steadfast in his support for Common Core and its national\neducation standards. Rubio has talked about eliminating the Department of\nEducation and in 2013 came out against Common Core.\n\n\n\nFor some Republicans in Florida and across the country, seeing one of their\nbrightest young stars and a scion of one of their party\xe2\x80\x99s most enduring\nfamilies compete is causing deep angst.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a friend of both, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it. I wish it weren\xe2\x80\x99t so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ana\nNavarro, a Miami-based Republican who is supporting Bush. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is a\nfact, and there\xe2\x80\x99s not a damn thing anyone can do to change it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*OTHER 2016 NEWS*\n\n\n\n*Presidential Race Takes Shape and Offers Hints of Things to Come\n<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/07/10/today-in-politics-presidential-race-takes-shape-and-offers-hints-of-things-to-come/>\n// NYT // Maggie Haberman \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nThe presidential race, slow-forming for much of the year, sprang clearly to\nlife this week with disparate events that could play a role in deciding the\nRepublican nominee and the contours of the general election.\n\n\n\nIn one sphere is Donald J. Trump, the bombastic real estate developer and\ntelevision personality. Skepticism remains about whether he\xe2\x80\x99ll stay in the\npresidential race through the fall, but he appears to be laser-focused on\nmaking it into the primary debates next month. And he is dominating the\ndiscussion in the Republican Party.\n\n\n\nThe slow reaction from party figures to his caustic remarks about Mexicans\nhas again highlighted divisions over an immigration overhaul, two years\nafter Republicans criticized Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x98s tone on the issue in 2012.\n\n\n\nMr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s remarks are already being used by Hillary Rodham Clinton to tar\nthe Republican field, including Jeb Bush, the one party candidate who has\nlong made overhauling immigration a cause.\n\n\n\nSeparately, Mrs. Clinton and her allies have pounced on a comment from Mr.\nBush about people needing to \xe2\x80\x9cwork longer hours\xe2\x80\x9d to improve the economy.\nThe Clinton team has said the comment defines him as a clone of Mr. Romney,\nwho was lampooned as out of touch by President Obama in the 2012 race.\n\n\n\nMr. Bush is certain to hear about that statement for weeks, but Mrs.\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign is signaling clearly that they see him as the likeliest\nnominee. And he will be able to make that point to Republicans to try to\ngalvanize support in a crowded field.\n\n\n\nFinally, the economic turbulence in Greece and in Puerto Rico is a familiar\npocket of uncertainty as the United States recovers from the Great\nRecession and moves toward a national election.\n\n\n\n*The Insiders: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are experts at manipulating\nthe media\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/07/10/the-insiders-donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton-are-experts-at-manipulating-the-media/>\n// WaPo // Ed Rogers \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nBesides the fact that they are both running for president in 2016, what do\nDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton have in common? They both play the media\nlike a fiddle. They use the mainstream media in the same way: They say\nsomething outrageous, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s an outright lie or a provocative\nstatement, then wait for the media to come after them.\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump gestures and declares\n"You\'re fired!" at a campaign rally in Manchester, N.H., in this file photo\ntaken June 17, 2015.

Trump relishes the chase, and it draws needed\nattention to his campaign. He knows perfectly well how to garner as much\nattention as possible with his incendiary comments.\n\n\n\nClinton throws down the gauntlet and intimidates the media into silence.\nShe regularly stiff-arms the press but is available just enough to allow\nher apologists and her enablers to say she is not hiding from the media.\nShe can say whatever she wants, true or not, and the media mostly go along\nwith it or feign disappointment that there is not more to say.\n\n\n\nThe media like to pretend they are forced to cover Trump; they act as\nthough he has thrust himself upon them and they wish they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to\ntalk about him. The media pretend they can\xe2\x80\x99t cover Clinton because she\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t let them; they ask the obvious questions but rarely show any zeal for\nfollow-up.\n\n\n\nSo what are we left with? The Trump coverage is forced and phony, yet it\xe2\x80\x99s\nexactly what he wants. Any substantive coverage of Clinton is practically\nnonexistent, which is exactly what she wants. The whole thing is a game,\nand we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend otherwise. Clinton and Trump are both manipulating\nthe media, but the media are proving all too willing to be manipulated.\nEveryone seems perfectly willing to play his or her role and be compliant.\nAs I have said before, the coverage of Campaign 2016 thus far has been a\nproduct of too much media chasing too little story.\n\n\n\n*The Truth Behind Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter Spat\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-10/the-truth-behind-jeb-bush-and-hillary-clinton-s-twitter-spat>\n// Bloomberg // Victoria Stilwell \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush and his Democratic rival Hillary\nClinton got into an economic spat yesterday via the noblest form of debate:\nthe Twitter argument.\n\n\n\nAs Bush campaigned in New Hampshire Wednesday, he bemoaned the nation\'s low\nlabor force participation rate, telling the New Hampshire Union Leader\neditorial board  "that people need to work longer hours" to help propel\nU.S. growth. The Clinton campaign quickly capitalized on the comment,\ntweeting:\n\n\n\nA few hours later, Bush struck back:\n\n\n\nNaturally, the issue is much more nuanced than either candidate is making\nit out to be. And harder to fit into 140-character dispatches.\n\n\n\nHere\'s the context of Bush\'s now-infamous quote at the Union Leader\neditorial board.\n\n\n\n"My aspirations for the country, and I believe we can achieve it, is for 4\npercent growth as far as the eye can see. Which means we have to be a lot\nmore productive. Workforce participation has to rise from its all-time\nmodern lows. It means that people need to work longer hours and through\ntheir productivity gain more income for their families. That\'s the only way\nwe are going to get out of this rut that we\xe2\x80\x99re in."\n\n\n\nWhile that may make the "longer hours" comment more palatable, a 4 percent\ngrowth rate is ambitious to say the least. The last time the nation saw\neconomic growth rates at that level or higher: 2000.\n\n\n\nBush is calculating that the growth rate can be goosed by upping labor\nforce participation, the share of working-age people who are employed or\nactively looking for a job. In June, the share of Americans in that\ncategory was 62.6 percent, the lowest level since 1977. That compares with\na peak of 67.3 percent in January 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\'s debatable, however, is just how much participation can rise in the\nfuture.  Much of the decline \xe2\x80\x94 about half by some estimates \xe2\x80\x94 has been\ndriven by the mass exodus of retiring baby boomers from the labor force.\nThere are also other long-term trends at play, such as more young people\nchoosing not to work when they\'re in school.\n\n\n\nAnd while there is a significant share of people who were sidelined from\nwork by the recession, it\'s unclear how many are left waiting in the wings.\nAt 5.3 percent, the unemployment rate is bumping up against the Federal\nReserve\'s estimates for what full employment looks like. The number of\ndiscouraged workers \xe2\x80\x94 those who say the dearth of job prospects has driven\nthem to give up looking \xe2\x80\x94 has been coming down steadily. And jobless claims\nare trending at levels consistent with a booming economy.\n\n\n\nStill, most economists agree there\'s some amount of slack left. For one,\nwages have been slow to accelerate out of the 2 percent band they\'ve\ntracked since the recovery started, which suggest employers aren\'t yet\nfeeling the pressure to offer fatter paychecks to attract the best talent.\n\n\n\nAnd, as Bush correctly notes (and Democratic-socialist presidential\ncandidate Bernie Sanders agrees), the number of part-time workers is still\nelevated compared to before the recession. While Americans worked 34.5\nhours on average per week in June, right in line with the trend for the two\nyears\' worth of Labor Department data that pre-date the recession,  there\nare 6.5 million people in part-time jobs for an economic reason, like\nhaving their hours cut or being unable to find full-time work. That\ncompares with an average 4.62 million in the 20 years leading up to the\nrecession.\n\n\n\nThis is something that others are worried about too, such as Fed Chair\nJanet Yellen. She\'s pointed to this measure as one of several signs there\'s\nstill room for the labor market to improve.\n\n\n\nBush says that\'s what he meant when he remarked "people need to work longer\nhours."  More people working more hours will boost productivity, he\nreasons, which will in turn help them make more money. While that may seem\nlike okay logic on the surface, it\'s more involved than that.\n\n\n\nProductivity is measured by how much stuff a worker can churn out for every\nhour of labor. While it\'s fluctuated over the years, lately it\'s been\npretty lousy since a decade-long boom ending in about 2004, according to\nWells Fargo Securities LLC. So recent productivity trends haven\'t really\nlooked as rosy as the chart that Clinton tweeted out, which dates to 1948\nand ends around 2010. It\'s also worth noting that it was supplied by the\nEconomic Policy Institute, which is partly funded by labor unions.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the anemic productivity numbers have economists concerned,\nincluding Yellen, who served in President Bill Clinton\'s administration.\nHigh productivity is the key to creating growth that doesn\'t spur rampant\ninflation. It boosts living standards for U.S. workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut simply having more people work more hours isn\'t enough to increase\nproductivity. They\'ve got to need to work more hours, for lack of a better\nword. If employees are working more hours, but there\'s not a commensurate\nincrease in demand for their goods and services, their output will stay the\nsame. That actually hurts productivity.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, there are long-lasting factors at work that have pushed down\nproductivity. Companies haven\'t been investing in new capital like they\nused to -- equipment that could help their workers do their jobs more\nefficiently. Some economists think the heydays of productivity are long\ngone because new technology has become less revolutionary. It\'s what they\ncall "secular stagnation."\n\n\n\nSo in summary, both Clinton and Bush left out really important details in\nthis debate, cherry-picking data points that support their agenda. But I\nsuppose we shouldn\'t be that surprised. That\'s politics, after all.\n\n\n\n*Republicans rename the GOP the \xe2\x80\x98Retrumplican Party\xe2\x80\x99\n<http://blogs.reuters.com/talesfromthetrail/2015/07/10/democrats-rename-the-gop-the-retrumplican-party/>\n// Reuters // Lena Masri \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nThe national Democratic Party has found a new nickname for the GOP: \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nRetrumplican Party\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nA video, released Thursday by the Democratic National Committee shows clips\nof Trump making defamatory statements about Mexican immigrants.

Bush agree on this: Learning leadership skills\nis crucial in just about every worthwhile endeavor in American life,\npolitical and otherwise.\n\n\n\nThat said, they couldn\'t disagree more on who, exactly, would have the\nright leadership skills in 2016 to warrant winning the White House job they\nboth have held.\n\n\n\nIn a rare joint interview, the two former presidents who share what may be\nthe most complicated political relationship in modern times sat down with\nUSA TODAY Thursday at the Bush Presidential Center. They were together for\nthe graduation ceremony of the inaugural class of Presidential Leadership\nScholars, a project sponsored by four presidential libraries that has\noffered leadership training for mid-career professionals who work for\nnon-profit groups, private-sector firms, state and local agencies and in\nthe military.\n\n\n\nThe participants aren\'t really politicians.\n\n\n\n"People hear this and they say, \'You\'ve got a Young Republicans Club\' or\n\'Clinton\'s got a Young Democrats Club,\' (but) that\'s not the intention at\nall," Bush said. "The intention is to take people who have shown good\npromise and let them learn some lessons about how decisions were made or\nhow people collaborated."\n\n\n\n"There might be nothing we can do anymore about how fractured America is\npolitically and ideologically," Clinton said. "But in the end, people have\nto get together and make decisions and do things \xe2\x80\x94 not just in Congress and\nthe White House, but I mean all over the country."\n\n\n\nIt was impossible to ignore the elephant in the room, or maybe the elephant\nand the donkey. That is: Clinton\'s wife, Hillary, is the clear front-runner\nfor the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. Bush\'s brother Jeb is\nin the top rank of contenders for the Republican nomination.\n\n\n\nFriends today, combatants tomorrow?\n\n\n\n"He loves his brother; I love Hillary," Clinton said. If they win their\nrespective presidential nominations, "he\'s going to vote for his brother;\nI\'m sure going to vote for Hillary, and something will happen. But we\'ll\nstill be friends."\n\n\n\n"I know Jeb will treat Hillary with respect, and I\'m confident Hillary will\ntreat Jeb with respect," Bush said. "I\'m not sure I can speak that highly\nof some of the surrogates they may have out there, but these two surrogates\nwill" do that as well.\n\n\n\nThe two men sat side by side on a couch in Bush\'s private office at his\npresidential center on the campus of Southern Methodist University. They\nhad just finished having a class photo taken with the program\'s scholars,\nand in a few minutes, they would head to the auditorium for a joint address\nto the group.\n\n\n\nThey seemed relaxed and at ease, friendly and deferential to one another.\nThey discussed a challenge they had shared: how to raise confident\ndaughters into adulthood. Bush reached over to touch Clinton\'s shoulder as\nhe made a point; at another time, Clinton tapped Bush\'s arm.\n\n\n\n"Sometimes the decisions we make have bigger consequences," Clinton said,\ndescribing how presidential leadership is in some ways different from other\ntop jobs. "No question," Bush chimed in.\n\n\n\nWhen Bush noted, "A president, it turns out, has to be prepared for the\nunexpected," Clinton nodded and said, "Yes," then enumerated the challenges\nBush faced when the 9/11 attackers struck during the first year of his\ntenure.\n\n\n\nThey said neither believes a 2016 Clinton-Bush campaign would be waged any\ndifferently because of their friendship and collaboration \xe2\x80\x94 nor do they\nthink it should.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t think it\'s going to be different," Bush said flatly. "I think it\'s\ngoing to be a political campaign."\n\n\n\n"If they win the nominations, it\'s going to be a very hard-fought campaign,\nand if it\'s like any other campaign, it\'ll be somewhat bruising, and the\nsurrogates will be really tough, and they\'ll have hard debates, and we\'ll\njust live with it," Clinton said.\n\n\n\nHis advice to the prospective candidates: "Make the choice clear: \'This is\nwhere I am; this is where he is.\' Be as accurate as you can, and let it\nrip."\n\n\n\nThe two got to know each other under hostile circumstances, during what\nBush called "the first Bush-Clinton race," which he wryly noted "didn\'t\nturn out that well" for his side. In 1992, Clinton defeated the elder\nGeorge Bush in his bid for a second term. In 2000, the younger Bush\ndefeated Clinton\'s vice president, Al Gore. Another contest between the\nfamilies in 2016 would break new ground.\n\n\n\nThough they differ in party registration and many policy positions, they\nshare some fundamental characteristics, Bush said. "First of all, we\'re\nBaby Boomers, and the only two Baby Boomer presidents. Secondly, we were\nboth governors of Southern states, Arkansas and Texas." He said both were\n"affable people; we\'re not zero-sum thinkers." And at this point, he said,\nboth were "like two old war horses, put out to pasture."\n\n\n\nClinton became so close to the elder Bush over the years after their\nelection showdown that the younger Bush jokes he is his "brother by another\nmother." Clinton made a similar reference when noting that Bush had turned\n69 this week, a month ahead of Clinton. ("For one month a year, I\'m the\nyounger brother," Clinton said.)\n\n\n\n"I just wrote him a birthday note because he just had a birthday," Clinton\nsaid. "So I said, \'Now we have a genuine family feud, maybe we ought to go\nget that guitar player from Deliverance and get him to play for us.\'\nRemember that movie? I mean, the banjo player, the dueling banjos."\n\n\n\n*OPINIONS/EDITORIALS/BLOGS*\n\n\n\n*The Gloria Borger \xe2\x80\x93 Hillary Clinton Watch: Waiting for Insight\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathleen-reardon/the-gloria-borger-hillary_b_7769486.html>\n// HuffPo // Kathleen Reardon \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nI\'ve written a number of times about journalists citing "some people say,"\n"some people think" and "it\'s been said" as support for their supposedly\nobjective reporting. What was once a desire to protect important sources\nhas deteriorated into a sign of journalistic laziness. When reporters\ncovering presidential politics employ words they fully know will disparage\nfemale candidates -- or when they purport to discern dishonesty by\nexamining candidates\' facial expressions -- they are taking journalistic\nprerogative another step too far.\n\n\n\n"Women are tested in ways that men are not," Senator Diane Feinstein\nrecently observed about Hillary Clinton. It will be harder for a woman to\nwin the presidency in 2016 than for a man and, Feinstein says, Secretary\nClinton knows this. Clinton has been the target of facile, disparaging\nlabels and categories -- ones that enter the general lexicon like lice on a\nhost, becoming firmly attached to women unless people recognize and reject\ntheir misuse.\n\n\n\nIn 2008 CNN\'s Gloria Borger wrote the following about then-presidential\ncandidate Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nBut there is no joy in Hillaryville. In its place are anger (at the press,\nfor being soft on Barack Obama), angst (at losing 11 straight contests),\nand apoplexy (at Obama, for daring to challenge a nomination that was\nsupposed to have been wrapped up by now).\n\nShe added:\n\n\n\nAnd so there is frost, not sun, in the Clinton campaign\n\n\n\nThe first line -- using the words "anger," "angst" and "apoplexy" -- is\ngratuitous, gender baiting alliteration. "Frost" used to describe Clinton\'s\ncampaign was not idly chosen. We\'re all familiar with the ice queen image\nand other versions of coldness attributed to competent, assertive women.\n\n\n\nThen there are Borger\'s "multiple faces" insults fanning the flames of the\ndistrust theme promulgated by Clinton\'s detractors:\n\n\n\nMultiple faces. But presidential choices are intensely personal. And so the\nClinton campaign has decided to play a game of the blind man and the\nelephant: Present the multiple faces of Hillary, as if somehow each\nidentity might attract a voter. Call it microtargeting her persona. Too bad\nthe result of the groupthink often morphs into caricature. One moment, it\'s\na scold ("Shame on you, Barack Obama"); the next, fuzzy praise ("honored to\nbe here with Barack Obama"). And at the Ohio debate, Clinton seemed more\nwhiny than presidential when she brought up a recent TV skit about\njournalists falling in love with Obama. "Well, can I just point out that in\nthe last several debates I seem to get the first question," Clinton\ncomplained, wearing a false smile.\n\n\n\nA "false smile" can be a tight smile, an unfinished smile, a sign of\npoliteness or simply a means of dealing with difficult situations without\nanger. "Scold" is another loaded word, to say nothing of "whiny." This is\nhow Borger and others like her surreptitiously attempt to poison Hillary\'s\nwell.\n\n\n\nIn an April interview with former Commerce Secretary and White House Chief\nof Staff Bill Daley, Borger did it again: "You know she comes with baggage.\nThere are negative perceptions about the Clintons as paranoid, too\nprotected, even arrogant." A woman who refrains from standing her ground on\nimportant issues is seen as lacking leadership potential. One who speaks\naffirmatively, risks being seen as difficult, arrogant -- a loose canon.\nBorger knows this. Such reliance on denigrating labels is cheap, shabby,\nsleight of hand "journalism."\n\n\n\nIf we ever hope to see a female shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling\nof the U.S. presidency, and give our daughters the same chance as our sons\nhave had to lead our country, we must reject efforts to slither into the\n"news" the easy, derogatory categories so often applied to women in the\nworkplace.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton is not perfect. If there is a shield" around her, it\'s been\nconstructed because any woman who gets ahead in her career knows that being\none of the guys doesn\'t work. There is much about Secretary Clinton we\ndon\'t know. Her communication style is occasionally stilted. But there is\nmuch we don\'t need to know of any candidate. Yet, Clinton will have to\nprove herself over and over and over because that is what\'s typically\nrequired of women who seek to break through professional barriers.\n\n\n\nI, for one, won\'t sit back and watch people like Gloria Borger try to shape\nHillary Clinton into a bitch, a brassy, bossy, distant, elusive woman\nsimply because Borger won\'t do the hard work of a real journalist. When was\nthe last time Borger gave us actual new information or a unique new insight\non any topic or person? C\'mon Gloria. Is the title of "Chief Political\nAnalyst" for Wolf Blitzer\'s CNN program a code word for someone who is\nentitled to cast personal aspersions without providing hard data or at\nleast hard-won reporting? Is it a code word for someone who relies on\nreadily available, gender-specific, disparaging labels to provide\n"analysis"? It\'s one way to make and keep a career going, but it isn\'t\njournalism.\n\n\n\nWhen Borger again dragged out the "Where\'s the real Hillary" theme in\nresponse to Clinton\'s recent interview with CNN correspondent Brianna\nKeilar, where was the "meat"? Nowhere to be found.\n\n\n\nWe see gratuitous excuses for reporting so often that the public has become\njaded. It\'s time to let the press know that a presidential election is\ndeserving of the best information and insights available from qualified\njournalists -- of whom a fair number are sitting on their hands thanks to\nthe personnel efficiencies of media oligarchy. Journalists come out of a\nproud tradition, and many of them place their lives on the line every day\nto bring insightful news and analysis. Certainly accurate, well-researched\nelection coverage can\'t be all that hard.\n\n\n\nKathleen also blogs about communication and politics here.

Nearly 20 years ago, New York Times columnist\nWilliam Safire wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cAmericans of all political persuasions are coming to\nthe sad realization that our first lady \xe2\x80\x94 a woman of undoubted talents who\nwas a role model for many in her generation \xe2\x80\x94 is a congenital liar.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nYounger folks probably have little to no memory of the lies Safire had in\nmind, though some might have heard about Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s infamously implausible\nexplanation for how she managed to make a 10,000 percent profit in cattle\nfutures simply by reading The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\n\nSuffice it to say that she\xe2\x80\x99s been honing her craft for decades. And that\xe2\x80\x99s\nturning into a problem for her, perhaps her biggest problem.\n\n\n\nAfter ducking the press for months, Clinton sat down for an interview with\nCNN\xe2\x80\x99s Brianna Keilar. It was a savvy choice. Keilar covers the Clinton\ncampaign and has every incentive not to offend her famously vindictive\nsources 16 months before the election.\n\n\n\nThe most discussed deception came in an exchange about her emails. Clinton\ndeclared emphatically that, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, you\xe2\x80\x99re starting with so many\nassumptions that are \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a subpoena. ... Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a deep\nbreath here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., chair of the committee investigating the Obama\nadministration\xe2\x80\x99s response to the Benghazi attack, promptly produced a copy\nof the subpoena.\n\n\n\nTeam Clinton says she was responding to a specific allegation that she\ndeleted emails that were under subpoena. It\xe2\x80\x99s a legalistically plausible\ndefense given Keilar\xe2\x80\x99s muddled question and Stakhanovite effort to avoid\nasking meaningful follow-ups.\n\n\n\nStill, it was a classically Clintonian way of lying: Make a sweeping,\ndefinitive-sounding statement, and then when called on it, release a fog of\ntechnicalities.\n\n\n\nOf course, the greatest example of this tactic was her husband\xe2\x80\x99s parsing of\nthe word \xe2\x80\x9cis\xe2\x80\x9d when called out for saying things like \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no improper\nrelationship\xe2\x80\x9d with a White House intern. Only under oath did he explain\nthat it was technically true if you understand \xe2\x80\x9cis\xe2\x80\x9d to be a statement about\nthe present moment, unlike \xe2\x80\x9cwas.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe rest of the CNN interview was a farrago of misleading statements,\nblame-shifting and deceptions. Hillary insisted she had only used \xe2\x80\x9cone\ndevice\xe2\x80\x9d for email, when we now know that\xe2\x80\x99s not true. Perhaps under oath she\nwould clarify that she meant \xe2\x80\x9cone device at a time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe proclaimed that she broke no rules by using a personal server and other\nemail chicanery. The Washington Post\xe2\x80\x99s Fact Checker column gave her \xe2\x80\x9cthree\nPinocchios\xe2\x80\x9d (out of a possible four) on those claims.\n\n\n\nClinton even flatly denied that voters distrust her when polls clearly show\nAmericans do, and \xe2\x80\x94 as usual \xe2\x80\x94 blamed all her problems on right-wing\nconspirators.\n\n\n\nReacting to the interview, Carl Bernstein, of Woodward and Bernstein fame,\noffered an odd analysis of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s deceptions, conceding on CNN that\nClinton has a \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult relationship with the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have to look at what politicians do generally in terms of fudging,\xe2\x80\x9d\nBernstein added. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s endemic in the profession. She\xe2\x80\x99s become a kind of\nspecialist at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe went on to explain that Clinton had to become a specialist because she\xe2\x80\x99s\na victim of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s peccadilloes \xe2\x80\x94 what Bernstein called the\n\xe2\x80\x9cpeculiarity of the Clinton situation.\xe2\x80\x9d Because Bill catted around, \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\nbeen in a difficult position.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt was a strangely forgiving argument from a reporter who made his career\nby exposing presidential deceit. And while it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly true Bill put\nHillary in some awkward predicaments, his philandering doesn\xe2\x80\x99t explain why\nshe lied on issues ranging from her cattle futures windfall to her stealth\nserver.\n\n\n\nBut Bernstein is right about one thing: Hillary is a specialist at lying.\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem for her. Her husband was \xe2\x80\x94 and is \xe2\x80\x94 a prodigy at\ndeceit, a renaissance man of lying. If football were a game of lies, he\ncould play every position on offense and defense.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton, alas, is more like a veteran coach \xe2\x80\x94 she\xe2\x80\x99s adept at\ntelling others how to lie on her behalf. But she\xe2\x80\x99s not a natural liar\nherself, and it shows. At a time when the Democratic base craves\nauthenticity (hence the mobs at Bernie Sanders rallies), Clinton seems\nutterly fabricated (hence her inability to get a capacity crowd at her\nannouncement speech last month in New York City). Her best hope now would\nbe to stop pandering to Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 fans and instead explain where she and\nSanders differ on policy. But that would require a level of political\nauthenticity she\xe2\x80\x99s forgotten how to fake convincingly.\n\n\n\n*Not Feeling the Bern\n<http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-blog/2015/07/10/bernie-sanders-2016-surge-isnt-threatening-hillary-clinton>\n// US News and World Report // Matthew Dickinson \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nCan you feel the Bern? Maybe not.\n\n\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\' presidential campaign is "surging", according\nto multiple media reports. His campaign events have been attracting huge\ncrowds, including 10,000 \xe2\x80\x93 the largest of the campaign season so far \xe2\x80\x93 at a\nBernie rally last week in Madison, Wisconsin, and another 7,500 this week\nago in Portland, Maine. He has also been raking in the cash \xe2\x80\x93 some $15\nmillion in the first three months of his candidacy \xe2\x80\x93 via small campaign\ndonations, a testament to his broadening appeal.\n\n\n\nThis surge has been reflected in his polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, the\nsites of the presidential campaign\'s first caucus and primary,\nrespectively. In Iowa, Sanders has closed to within 19 percent of the front\nrunner Hillary Clinton in the latest poll, up from a 40 percent deficit to\nher in earlier surveys. He\'s even closer to Clinton in New Hampshire, with\nthe most recent poll showing him trailing by 8 percent, prompting one\nenthusiastic headline writer to proclaim they were in a "dead heat" in the\nGranite state. Nationally, Sanders has consistently ranked second in polls,\nwith only Vice President Joe Biden, who so far has shown no evidence that\nhe is interested in running, challenging him for this spot.\n\n\n\nThe combination of large crowds, more money and stronger polls has prompted\nthe national media to give Sanders a second look. To their credit, this\ntime they are focusing less on essays he wrote four decades ago or his\naborted singing career and more on his stance on the issues. To be sure,\nthey still seem skeptical that he can win, but they are now at least\nwilling to acknowledge the possibility, however remote. In Sanders\' home\nstate, of course, belief that he is surging runs far deeper, with Vermont\nmedia outlets openly speculating whether (and no doubt secretly hoping) he\ncan maintain his presidential momentum. Apropos that sentiment, a local\nreporter asked me today why, if Bernie wasn\'t a viable candidate, she\ncouldn\'t find anyone in the state who wasn\'t supporting him!\n\n\n\nSo should Hillary Clinton be worried? The short answer is no. To be sure,\nas Clinton learned in 2008, it is wise never to take one\'s front-runner\nstatus for granted. Accordingly, she and her aides are saying all the right\nthings by publicly acknowledging that Sanders is a serious candidate who\nposes a potentially significant threat to her bid for the Democratic\npresidential nomination. The reality, however, is that rather than exceed\nexpectations, Sanders has done about as well as I expected he would to this\npoint, given where he has positioned himself within the Democratic field.\n\n\n\nMy expectations were predicated in part on the existing distribution of\npreferences among likely Democratic voters, and how they matched up with\nSanders\' ideological leanings, but also on previous efforts by progressives\nto win the Democratic nomination. As I wrote when Sanders first announced\nhis candidacy three months ago, he is not the first Vermont favorite son to\nset his eyes on the White House in recent years. In 2004, former Vermont\nGov. Howard Dean threw his hat in the ring, positioning himself, much like\nSanders, as the progressive Democrat amid a cast of more centrist opponents\nsuch as John Kerry and Richard Gephardt. In Dean\'s case, there was no\nClinton-like political heavyweight standing in his path to the White House\nand he initially attracted strong support in the polls and in media\ncoverage based in part on his imaginative use of the Internet to organize\nonline meetups of "Deaniacs" and to solicit small-dollar donations, much as\nBernie has done. And yet Dean was never able to attract much more than 30\npercent support in national polls and his candidacy peaked shortly before\nthe Iowa caucus, where he subsequently imploded.\n\n\n\nDespite the recent up swell in media coverage, the fact is that Sanders\'\nroad to the nomination is probably steeper than was Dean\'s. Keep in mind\nthat, as of today, Sanders is still drawing less than 20 percent support\nnationally, compared to Clinton\'s almost 60 percent. So he has a way to go\nto even match Dean\'s showing, never mind threaten Clinton. To be sure,\nthere are differences between Dean and Sanders. Although Dean attracted\nstrong support among progressive Democrats based largely on his opposition\nto the Iraq war, on economic issues, such as income inequality, his\nliberalism was never truly as authentic or as deeply-rooted as Sanders\'.\nBut the reality is that for Bernie to win the Democratic nomination, he is\ngoing to need to expand his support beyond his natural constituency of\naging Grateful Dead hipsters, environmentalists and professors.\n\n\n\nIn particular, he has to demonstrate some appeal among moderate and\nconservative Democrats. This includes the racial and ethnic minorities of\nlow-to-middle socioeconomic standing who proved so crucial to Obama\'s\nability to defeat Clinton in 2008. Right now Sanders is trailing Clinton by\n40 percent in the crucial state of South Carolina, which holds its primary\ndirectly after New Hampshire. Among African-Americans, who make up about a\nquarter of the registered Democratic vote there, he\'s polling at an anemic\n3 percent, compared to Clinton\'s more than 50 percent support.\n\n\n\nHe\'s not doing much better nationally among these key voting blocs,\nincluding racial minorities and older, more moderate Democrats. In the\nlatest Economist/YouGov national survey of registered voters, Bernie\nreceives only 10 percent support among African-Americans and 15 percent\namong Hispanics, compared to Hillary\'s 53 percent and 39 percent\nrespectively. Keep in mind that in past elections racial minorities\nconstituted more than a third of Democratic primary voters.\n\n\n\nPerhaps more worrisome is the fact that he trails Clinton among\nself-identified liberals by 44 percent to 32 percent. His strongest support\ncomes from those earning more than $100,000 a year, where he ties Clinton\nin support at 25 percent in the Economist poll, and among the18-29 year-old\ncrowd which, not incidentally, is the least likely to vote in national\nelections. These results are consistent with other national polls in the\nfield at approximately the same time. And while it is true that Sanders is\nattracting his fair share of campaign contributions, the fact remains that\nClinton is outraising him three-to-one. Perhaps most tellingly from the\nDemocratic Party\'s perspective, Clinton has taken an early lead in\nendorsements, including backing from Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin and the\nstate\'s senior Sen. Patrick Leahy.\n\n\n\nThe bottom line is that Bernie\'s recent "surge" is largely a case of a\ncandidate securing his natural coalition of support. But there\'s little\nevidence so far to suggest that he is going to expand his base beyond the\nBen and Jerry\'s crowd and significantly cut into Clinton\'s larger and more\ndiverse constituency. Of course, these facts won\'t stop pundits from\nengaging in the "what if" scenarios that are the staple of political talk\nshows, particularly if no other viable Democrat (Joe Biden, where are you?)\narrives on the scene. The media loves a horserace, after all, even a\nlopsided one, and the thought of Clinton running roughshod across a weak\nDemocratic field is not a particularly interesting narrative. So expect\npundits to tout the Sanders\' horse until a stronger ride appears. But the\nreality is that rather than exceeding expectations, Sanders, so far, is\ndoing about as well as one would anticipate given his stance on the issues\nand the configuration of preferences among likely Democratic voters. And,\nbarring an unexpected turn of events, that\'s probably not enough to secure\nthe presidential nomination.\n\n\n\n*TOP NEWS*\n\n\n\n\n*DOMESTIC*\n\n\n\n*Barack Obama to make historic visit to federal prison\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/obama-to-visit-federal-prison-oklahoma-119962.html?ml=tl_1>\n// Politico // Nick Gass \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama will become the first sitting chief executive to\nvisit a federal prison when he goes to El Reno, Oklahoma, next week to meet\nwith law enforcement officials and inmates as part of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s\npush for criminal-justice reform.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext week the president will underscore the administration\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the\nneed to reform and improve America\xe2\x80\x99s criminal justice system,\xe2\x80\x9d White House\nPress Secretary Josh Earnest said during Friday\xe2\x80\x99s news briefing.\n\n\n\nObama will speak to that on Tuesday when he addresses the NAACP conference\nin Philadelphia before stopping at the medium-security federal facility in\nOklahoma on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile there, the president will meet with law enforcement officials and\ninmates and conduct an interview with Vice\xe2\x80\x9d for a documentary set to air\nlater in the fall on HBO.\n\nVice founder Shane Smith, who will host the special, said the documentary\nis \xe2\x80\x9cgoing to be fascinating.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVisiting El Reno with President Obama \xe2\x80\x94 the first-ever visit to a federal\nprison by a sitting president \xe2\x80\x94 will give our viewers a firsthand look into\nhow the president is thinking about this problem, from the policy level\ndown to one on one conversations with the men and women living this\nreality,\xe2\x80\x9d Smith said in a statement.\n\n\n\nObama is also expected to issue executive orders next week commuting the\nsentences of non-violent drug offenders.\n\n\n\n*Confederate flag comes down for good at S.C.

Clementa Pinckney, in\nCharleston, when pictures emerged of the alleged shooter posing with a\nConfederate flag license plate and other racist symbols.\n\n\n\nThe lowering of the flag caps three weeks of soul-searching in the state\nthat culminated with a dramatic early-morning vote in the South Carolina\nHouse on Thursday to pass a bill mandating the flag\xe2\x80\x99s removal. Haley signed\nthe bill in a joyous ceremony at the Statehouse on Thursday afternoon.\n\n\n\nTwo other South Carolina governors, Republican David Beasley and Democrat\nJim Hodges, have attempted to take down the flag, which was first flown\nfrom the top of the Statehouse dome in 1962 in defiance of federal\ndesegregation efforts. Beasley failed to remove the flag after calling for\nit to come down in 1996, and lost his 1998 reelection as a result of\nbacklash from white voters.\n\n\n\nHodges helped broker a compromise that moved the flag from the dome to a\npole in front of a Confederate war monument on the building\xe2\x80\x99s north lawn,\nwhere it flew from 2000 until Friday morning.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, an ebullient Beasley, who had returned to Columbia for the\nbill signing, told POLITICO, \xe2\x80\x9cLove transcends division.

But as the official toll of the data breaches grew \xe2\x80\x93\nup from around 4 million records in a single attack revealed last month to\nmore than 22 million over two infiltrations \xe2\x80\x94 the bipartisan calls for\nArchuleta\xe2\x80\x99s ouster became overwhelming.\n\n\n\nArchuleta resigned of her \xe2\x80\x9cown volition,\xe2\x80\x9d White House Press Secretary Josh\nEarnest said Friday. \xe2\x80\x9cShe recognizes, as the White House does, that the\nurgent challenges currently facing the Office of Personnel Management\nrequire a manager with a specialized set of skills and experiences.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMembers of Congress cheered the move \xe2\x80\x93 even as experts in government\nmanagement and cybersecurity questioned whether removing Archuleta would\nactually help fix the problem, which originated well before her tenure\nbegan in 2013.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the right move for the agency and all those affected by the\nbreach,\xe2\x80\x9d said Senator Mark Warner, who became the most prominent Democrat\nto call for her removal on Thursday, in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cThe focus now needs\nto be on fixing the problem and protecting those impacted.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWarner\xe2\x80\x99s voice joined those of the top three Republicans in the House on\nThursday, as well as Senator John McCain, in demanding that Archuleta step\ndown after the administration revealed that hackers had gained access to\nbackground check information from almost everyone who has applied or taken\na job with the federal government over the past 15 years. They joined a\ngrowing chorus of officials that began in June, after Archuleta deflected\nblame for the situation during a House Oversight Committee hearing in June,\nsaying decades of neglecting government security systems was at fault.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am as distressed as you are about how long these systems have gone\nneglected,\xe2\x80\x9d Archuleta said, adding that she had made upgrading the systems\na priority and that the breaches were discovered as part of that upgrade\nprocess. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole of government is responsible and it will take all of us\nto solve the issue.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAs late as Thursday night, the White House agreed with her, maintaining\nthat the president still had confidence in her leadership.\n\n\n\nBut on Friday morning, Archuleta announced that she had \xe2\x80\x9cconveyed to the\npresident that I believe it is best for me to step aside and allow new\nleadership that will enable the agency to move beyond the current\nchallenges and allow the employees at OPM to continue their important work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHer interim replacement will be Beth Cobert, currently the chief\nperformance officer and deputy director for management at the Office of\nManagement and Budget.\n\n\n\nArchuleta had been popular with the bureaucratic rank and file, and the\npresident of a top federal employees union predicted that the upheaval\nwould make it more difficult to fix OPM\xe2\x80\x99s IT issues.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFederal employees are kind of in a critical state of uncertainty,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nNational Federation of Federal Employees President William Dougan in an\ninterview. \xe2\x80\x9cThe volatility of the situation has kind of been escalated.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCobert will take over as acting director Saturday.\n\n\n\n*INTERNATIONAL*\n\n\n\n*Greece\xe2\x80\x99s Parliament Approves Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s Bailout Plan\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/world/europe/greece-struggles-to-rally-support-for-its-proposals.html?ref=world>\n// NYT // Liz Alderman and Andrew Higgins \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nSetting the stage for a pivotal deal with Europe, the Greek Parliament\nearly Saturday approved Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for a\nthree-year, $59 billion rescue package with harsh austerity terms that was\nremarkably similar to the one Greek voters rejected in a referendum less\nthan a week ago.\n\n\n\nWith a Sunday deadline looming for a decision on the bailout, a crunch\npoint that all sides see as Greece\xe2\x80\x99s last chance to avoid bankruptcy and\nstay in the euro currency zone, the plan passed by an overwhelming margin.\n\n\n\nThe final vote showed that 251 lawmakers voted for the plan, while the rest\nof the body\xe2\x80\x99s 300 members opposed it, abstained or were absent. But because\n17 lawmakers from Mr. Tsipras\xe2\x80\x99s coalition did not support the plan \xe2\x80\x94 2\nvoted no, 8 voted present and 7 were absent \xe2\x80\x94 a shuffling of the prime\nminister\xe2\x80\x99s government seemed likely, and some analysts said that it was\npossible that Mr. Tsipras might resign.\n\n\n\nFears persist that creditors will still doubt that a government with such\ninternal rifts will be able to carry out the tough economic measures it has\nproposed.\n\n\n\nMr. Tsipras had said that he would resign if he lost the vote in\nParliament, which required the support of 151 lawmakers to pass.\n\n\n\nThe proposal must now win approval from European officials and institutions\nbefore negotiations can finally go forward on a comprehensive bailout\npackage.\n\n\n\nAlexis Tsipras. Credit Louisa Gouliamaki/Agence France-Presse \xe2\x80\x94 Getty Images\n\nLawmakers took up the measure after Mr. Tsipras decided to give in to most\nof the demands of Greece\xe2\x80\x99s creditors. In exchange, he won the chance to\nnegotiate for the new bailout money, on top of about $270 billion Greece\nhas received since 2010, and potential talks to reduce repayment terms on\nthe debt. It might also allow Greece to avoid a catastrophic exit from the\neurozone.\n\n\n\nYet even as the vote was debated in the Greek Parliament, influential\nvoices in Germany and Eastern Europe expressed skepticism about whether\nGreece would follow through on pledges to be more fiscally responsible. And\ncrowds gathered outside the Parliament building in Athens on Friday evening\nto protest Mr. Tsipras\xe2\x80\x99s abrupt U-turn, with many saying they felt betrayed\nafter he had urged them to reject the bailout in the referendum last Sunday.\n\n\n\nMr. Tsakalotos in Parliament on Friday. At least 250 of the 300 members\napproved a rescue plan. Credit Louisa Gouliamaki/Agence France-Presse \xe2\x80\x94\nGetty Images\n\nOne of the demonstrators, John Papageorgiou, 45, a math teacher, said he\nwanted Greece to drop the euro currency because he believed the euro\nbenefited certain countries, like Germany, while putting others, like\nGreece, at a disadvantage.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, he said, he did not feel betrayed by Mr. Tsipras\xe2\x80\x99s compromise\nefforts, and he thought that the European leaders would recognize that\nGreece\xe2\x80\x99s debt was illegal. His friend Maria Antonopoulou, 44, who works for\nan electric company, interjected: \xe2\x80\x9cWe love Tsipras. We needed him as\nGreeks. We have faith in him. Compared to what we had, he\xe2\x80\x99s clean.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe new proposal was given a swift thumbs-up by France and lifted hopes in\nBrussels that, after months of ill-tempered arguments and fruitless crisis\nmeetings, Greece and its creditors could reach a deal by midnight on Sunday\nto prevent a fracturing of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s currency union.\n\n\n\nThe goal is not to seal a deal that would immediately provide Greece with\nnew funding, but simply to get a formal green light to start what could be\nlengthy talks on a new bailout to replace one that expired on June 30. Just\nthe signal to start talks, though, could lift a dark cloud of uncertainty,\nat least temporarily, and give the European Central Bank cover to perhaps\nexpand recently frozen emergency cash for Greek banks, which have been\nclosed since June 29.\n\n\n\nThe economy has been in disarray. People have been out of work for years.\nThe banks have been running out of money. It sounds a lot like the Great\nDepression in the United States. But it is Greece \xe2\x80\x93 and in some ways, the\nsituation is worse.\n\n\n\nA final agreement is still far from a sure thing. A raft of actors \xe2\x80\x94 19\neurozone finance ministers; 28 European Union leaders, who have been called\nto Brussels to discuss the crisis on Sunday; and the bureaucracies in\nBrussels \xe2\x80\x94 need to examine the proposal before giving their approval. And\nthere is so much bad blood after months of insults, frustration and\nfailure, there is little faith in European circles in Greece\xe2\x80\x99s pledges to\ncarry out measures like tax increases and cuts in pension spending.\n\n\n\nRepresentatives of the main creditors \xe2\x80\x94 the International Monetary Fund,\nthe European Central Bank and the other European nations that use the euro\n\xe2\x80\x94 were poring over the Greek proposal on Friday. Their assessments will\nplay a critical role in any decisions by the Eurogroup, an assembly of\nfinance ministers from euro countries, which is to meet in Brussels on\nSaturday.\n\n\n\nEven Mr. Tsipras\xe2\x80\x99s party, Syriza, which drafted the proposals with help\nfrom French experts, seemed confused, with members voicing concern over\nmeasures that the culture minister, Nikos Xydakis, described on Friday as\n\xe2\x80\x9cvery tough.\xe2\x80\x9d Many lawmakers from Syriza, a coalition of left-wing groups,\nhad serious misgivings about the proposal. Mr. Xydakis said in an\ninterview: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a better deal. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough deal and the only one\nwe can get right now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSpeaking to members of Syriza on Friday, Mr. Tsipras said his government\nhad a \xe2\x80\x9cmandate from the Greek people to bring a better agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cwe\ndo not have a mandate to take the country out of the eurozone,\xe2\x80\x9d an event\nthat would follow a decisive rupture with creditors.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor six months we fought an uneven war. We suffered losses, but we gained\nground, too,\xe2\x80\x9d he told lawmakers later. But, he conceded, \xe2\x80\x9cnow a minefield\nlies ahead of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Tsipras, who last week vowed never to succumb to creditors\xe2\x80\x99 terms that\nhe had condemned as the work of \xe2\x80\x9cextreme conservative forces,\xe2\x80\x9d seems to\nhave calculated that it was worth making concessions to secure the proposed\nthree-year, $59 billion bailout loan and the possibility of negotiating\neasier terms for repayment of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s debt. When Syriza began\nnegotiations with creditors after it came to power in January, the\nobjective was a more modest unblocking of about $8 billion from an existing\nbailout program that has since expired.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is largely a capitulation on Tsipras\xe2\x80\x99s part to what creditors have been\nasking for, but is that enough?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Raoul Ruparel, co-director of Open\nEurope, a research group in London. \xe2\x80\x9cGermany and some others are very\nskeptical about anything the Greeks produce, and this goes back to the main\nproblem \xe2\x80\x94 a total lack of trust.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhile President Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande of France welcomed the new proposals as\n\xe2\x80\x9cserious\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccredible,\xe2\x80\x9d Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and her key\nministers kept silent on Friday, insisting that it was too soon to judge\nthe suggestions now being reviewed by the European Commission, the European\nCentral Bank and the I.M.F.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will wait until the institutions examine them and express their\nopinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for the German government.\n\n\n\nBut he repeated Germany\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding insistence that all 19 countries\nthat use the euro must follow the rules, a position that has made Berlin\nresistant in the past to pleas from Greece that demands for tight budgets\nmust be relaxed and debts restructured to prevent the country from\nsuffocating.\n\n\n\nMartin J\xc3\xa4ger, spokesman for the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\xc3\xa4uble,\nsaid the outcome of the Saturday gathering remained \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely open.\xe2\x80\x9d Both\nMr. Sch\xc3\xa4uble and Ms. Merkel have ruled out writing off any of Greece\xe2\x80\x99s debt\nunder what Ms. Merkel has called \xe2\x80\x9ca classical haircut,\xe2\x80\x9d or debt write-down,\nbut they have indicated they might be open to extending payment deadlines\nand reducing interest rates.\n\n\n\nSome of Ms. Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s political allies and the governments of Eastern and\nCentral European countries that have taken an even tougher line on Athens\nthan Germany raised doubts on Friday about Greece\xe2\x80\x99s readiness and ability\nto deliver on its new promises, delivered Thursday just before a deadline\nfixed by creditors expired.\n\n\n\nHans-Peter Friedrich, a member of the Christian Social Union, which is part\nof Ms. Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s conservative bloc, noted the similarities between the new\nproposal and the one rejected by the Greek people. \xe2\x80\x9cThat means there are\ntwo possibilities: Either the Greek government is tricking its own people,\nor us yet again,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Friedrich told Deutschlandfunk radio on Friday.\n\n\n\n*Turkey Arrests 21 Suspected of Ties to ISIS\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/world/europe/turkey-arrests-21-suspected-of-ties-to-isis.html?ref=world>\n// NYT // Ceylan Yeginsu \xe2\x80\x93 July 10, 2015 *\n\n\n\nUnder pressure from its Western allies to do more to combat Islamist\nextremists, the Turkish authorities arrested 21 suspected Islamic State\nmembers on Friday, the semiofficial Anatolian News Agency reported.\n\n\n\nAmong those arrested were three foreigners and two prominent Islamic State\nsupporters known to have recruited fighters in Turkey, the local news media\nreported.\n\n\n\nIn early-morning raids in Istanbul and Sanliurfa Province, which borders\nSyria, the Turkish police seized automatic rifles, large ammunition packs\nand military uniforms, the agency reported.\n\n\n\nTurkey is a NATO member and a longtime American ally, but it has been\nfrequently criticized for its reluctance to play a more active role in\ncombating the Islamic State. Western officials have accused Turkey of a\ndegree of ambivalence toward the militant group, which now controls large\nparts of Syria and Iraq, and the Turks sometimes give the impression that\nthey see Kurdish autonomy in Syria as a greater threat to their country\nthan the extremists.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have a strong stake in things, in stability to their south,\xe2\x80\x9d Defense\nSecretary Ashton B. Carter said on Tuesday in Washington. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe they\ncould do more along the border.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThousands of foreign fighters have joined the ranks of the Islamic State\nover the past year, many of them traveling through Turkey to reach the\nextremists\xe2\x80\x99 self-declared caliphate in northeastern Syria and northwestern\nIraq. Pressed by the West to stem the flow, the Turks have detained and\ndeported about 1,500 people trying to reach Syria and have barred more than\n14,000 others from entering the country, according to Turkish Foreign\nMinistry figures. And there have been at least seven smaller police raids\nacross the country in the past two weeks against suspected Islamic State\nfighters.\n\n\n\nTurkey has also stepped up its military presence along the porous Syrian\nborder, deploying additional tanks and troops. But much of that was done\nafter Kurdish forces took control of the Syrian border town of Tal Abyad\nfrom the Islamic State in June.\n\n\n\nMr. Carter\xe2\x80\x99s critique aside, other senior American officials said on Friday\nthat Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s recent actions demonstrated the government\xe2\x80\x99s new commitment\nto fighting the Islamic State, though they said it was too early to say\nwhether the Friday arrests were a major turning point or a symbolic gesture\nto fend off the Western criticism.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Turks are actually trying to do more, and our collective work with\nthem would be vastly aided if we\xe2\x80\x99d stop criticizing them in public,\xe2\x80\x9d said\none senior Obama administration official, who spoke on the condition of\nanonymity to discuss confidential assessments. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is a\nsymbolic offering.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnalysts said that the large-scale raids and arrests on Friday were\nsomething new, and were probably based on intelligence obtained from the\nUnited States. A delegation of American counterterrorism experts met with\nTurkish officials in Ankara this week to discuss the fight against the\nIslamic State.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurkey sees Daesh as a major threat, not just to our country but to the\nentire world,\xe2\x80\x9d a government official with knowledge of the issue said on\nFriday, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. The official spoke\non the condition of anonymity in line with government protocol.\n\n\n\nAddressing Western criticism that Turkey had been slow to act against the\ngroup, the official said, \xe2\x80\x9cAntiterrorist operations take time and require\ncomprehensive intelligence gathering and logistics. This is why.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAaron Stein, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council, a\nWashington-based analytical institute, said Turkey might be stepping up its\nefforts now because it was worried about an Islamic State drive toward the\nborder town of Azaz in northeast Syria.\n\n\n\nBut he was skeptical that the arrests signaled a major, new antimilitant\nresolve in Turkey. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ebu Hanzala detentions tell us that we have to be\ncautious,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Stein said, referring a cleric considered to be the\n\xe2\x80\x9cspiritual leader\xe2\x80\x9d of the Islamic State within Turkey, who has repeatedly\nbeen arrested and released.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch will be determined in the coming days, and whether those arrested\nface charges and are put behind bars,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Stein said of the latest raids.\n\n\n\nIn the Hacibayram neighborhood of Ankara, a known Islamic State recruitment\nhub, a resident said on Friday that two suspects who were arrested there\nlast week were freed the next day. The resident would not allow his name to\nbe used because he feared reprisals.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey came back and celebrated the fact that they were only charged for\ndrug abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of the two freed suspects. \xe2\x80\x9cThese arrests will only\nmean something if these men are locked up for good. They have gone and\nkilled in Syria, then they come back and roam our streets. It\xe2\x80\x99s terrifying.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'
