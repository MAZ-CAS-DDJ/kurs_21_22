They don\'t even get facts correctly. Cnn guessed Andrea Mitchell? Come on. That flies in the face of common sense.\n\nNot to mention I\'m following up on a topic last night where you yourself felt it enough of a problem to have warned the Secretary her people yap. I didn\'t whip you up. You took that into consideration when discussing a 24 hour delay. That never should have been a factor.\n\nLastly, if you think I\'m the only one on this chain bothered by this - and not because I whipped them up - then I have a bridge to nowhere to sell you. When I had dinner with Jim Margolis weeks ago, he broached with me that he is shocked by what he\'s reading, is sure it\'s close, and fears HRC is looking at him and the rest of them funny. I think that\'s a problem when her team is looking funny at each other.\n\nAnd for anyone to be justifiably upset to not be read in earlier on our current challenge, and then wonder why it\'s difficult to speak freely about something so sensitive in large in expanded settings, is a lack of self-awareness. This topic\'s a unique doozy, but it\'s not the last delicate one. That someone yapped about the lamest 10%\xfd of our conversations is better than the most sensitive 10% is besides the point. But either way we\'re going to have to agree to disagree on whether 10% is just the price of doing business.\n\nAgain, with all due respect, your reaction to me is unfair in that\'s it\'s stronger than any admonition anyone else has received who is actually doing something wrong.\n\nI agree though that being at each others\' throats will get us nowhere, and if you want me to keep it to myself, ok, done. But it\'s the underlying problem that\'s going to be the problem, not me stating the obvious.\n\nWith that, I\'m going to sit queitly in the corner until Cheryl calls me to admonish me for sending this reply and digging myself into an even deeper hole with you than I already was.\n\nFor those keeping score, that will be two more admonishment than the culprit(s) have received.\n\nPhilippe\n\n\nFrom: John Podesta\nSent: Monday, March 9, 2015 4:51 PM\nTo: Philippe Reines\nCc: Cheryl Mills; H\nSubject: Re: Leaks\n\n\n\nPhilippe,\nYou got to stop this. The press is trading in rumors that can easily originate in their own newsrooms. If someone wanted to leak juicy tidbits, they have a lot more to work with than our press planning. If we are going to be at each others throats before we start, we are going nowhere.\nJohn\n\nOn Mar 9, 2015 1:13 PM, "Philippe Reines" <pir@hrcoffice.com<mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com>> wrote:\nOk, this has gone too far.
