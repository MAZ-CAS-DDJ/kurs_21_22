I love Harold, but let's not put him in a position in which he might be taking heat. \r\n\r\n----- Original Message -----\r\nFrom: Susan McCue <susan@messageinc.com>\r\nTo: Begala, Paul; tom@zzranch.com <tom@zzranch.com>; john.podesta@gmail.com <john.podesta@gmail.com>\r\nCc: sgreenberg@gqrr.com <sgreenberg@gqrr.com>; agreenberg@gqrr.com <agreenberg@gqrr.com>; tara@campaigntodefendamerica.org <tara@campaigntodefendamerica.org>\r\nSent: Tue Feb 19 17:31:30 2008\r\nSubject: RE: DRAFT launch statement for progressive media\r\n\r\nTom - can u run the statement by Mark Elias in addition to sandler?

Let me nominate Jamal Simmons. He's young (to me) Af-Am and way smart. He worked in the Clinton White House and now does commentary with me on CNN.\r\n\r\nOther prominent African-Americans should be courted, like Donna Brazile.\r\n\r\nHow 'bout Dee Dee Myers?  Not African-American, but rumored to be a woman. Knows the media as well as anyone.\r\n\r\nHispanics, anyone?  Can we ask Maria Echaveste but not Chris Edley?  (I'm kinda pissed at Chris for telling the NY Times that the Clinton Admin had a mixed record on civil rights. Funny, he didn't say that when he was in the Clinton Admin).\r\n\r\nI will keep thinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Original Message -----\r\nFrom: tmatzzie@gmail.com <tmatzzie@gmail.com>\r\nTo: john.podesta@gmail.com <john.podesta@gmail.com>; susan <Susan@messageinc.com>; Begala, Paul\r\nCc: Stan Greenberg <sgreenberg@gqrr.com>; Anna Greenberg <agreenberg@gqrr.com>; Tara McGuinness <tara@campaigntodefendamerica.org>\r\nSent: Tue Feb 19 12:36:51 2008\r\nSubject: DRAFT launch statement for progressive media\r\n\r\ncould go with a short or long list of founders. it might be better to\r\ndo it with 10-12 people instead of 50. feedback needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAFT launch statement\r\nPROGRESSIVE MEDIA\r\n\r\nProgressive Media will serve as a communications and messaging nerve\r\ncenter for the progressive movement. We will create a robust echo\r\nchamber with messaging that spans from independent groups, to\r\nprogressive partisans, to grassroots organizers, to the netroots. We\r\nwill align messaging across broadcast and cable TV, radio, print,\r\nInternet, single-issue and advocacy organizations, progressive media,\r\nsurrogates and new media.  Through Progressive Media, during the 2008\r\nelection campaign we will focus on showing the public where John\r\nMcCain stands on key issues facing America and the world. We seek to\r\nbecome a part of the permanent progressive infrastructure to last\r\nbeyond the 2008 election. Breaking through the clutter of the modern\r\nmedia environment with a progressive message requires repetition of\r\ncommon themes from different sources organized by a central\r\napparatus--that is the organizing task of Progressive Media.\r\n\r\nFounders List (sample--need people outside the campaigns)\r\n\r\nTom Matzzie\r\n\r\nPaul Begala\r\n\r\nSusan McCue\r\n\r\nStan Greenberg\r\n\r\nJohn Podesta\r\n\r\nAnna Greenberg\r\n\r\nWes Boyd\r\n\r\nBrad Woodhouse\r\n\r\nEli Pariser\r\n\r\nDavid Brock\r\n\r\nJon Soltz\r\n\r\nRand Beers?\r\n\r\nArianna Huffington?\r\n\r\nWill Robinson?\r\n\r\nDavid Bennehaum?\r\n\r\nRand Beers?\r\n\r\nLarry Mishel?\r\n\r\nRobert Borosage?\r\n\r\nUnion folks?\r\n\r\nenviro folks?\r\n\r\nwho else? bloggers?\r\n\r\n"
