Do you\n> happen to know Cathy Zoi? She has been appointed to lead the rural electric\n> utility company that SunEdison is planning to launch to bring electricity\n> to remote areas of developing countries. It is an interesting idea and one\n> I would like to work on in the future. I have seen reading her profile that\n> she has been active in the US government and in various US no-profit\n> organizations, so I thought of dropping you a note to see whether you\n> worked with her in the past.\n>\n> All the best for all your work and warm regards from a hot, summery Italy.\n>\n> Filippo\n>\n> ------------------------------\n> Date: Sun, 17 May 2015 19:27:00 -0400\n> Subject: Re: A personal story from Filippo\n> From: john.podesta@gmail.com\n> To: filippo.chiesa@hotmail.it\n> CC: filippo.chiesa@srpcorp.com; esepp@equitablegrowth.org\n>\n> Filippo,\n> Thanks so much.
