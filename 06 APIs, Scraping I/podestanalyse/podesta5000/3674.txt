And in his new book, World Order, the\nformer secretary of state under Presidents Nixon and Ford gives a\nhistorian\'s perspective on the idea of order in world affairs.\n\n\n\nNations are always trying to establish systems to make the world a more\norderly place, but they rarely last for long. His book stretches from China\nunder the emperors, Rome surrounded by barbarians and Islam encircled by\ninfidels, to the treaties of Europe and the pivotal positions of Russia and\nIran.\n\n\n\nOn current affairs, Kissinger tells NPR\'s Scott Simon why a conflict with\nthe Islamic State, also known as ISIS, is more manageable than a\nconfrontation with Iran, what he would do about the Islamic State, and what\nhe thinks the best solution is for the crisis in Ukraine.\n\n\n\nInterview Highlights\n\n\n\n*On why he views Iran as a "bigger problem than ISIS"*\n\n\n\nThere has come into being a kind of a Shia belt from Tehran through Baghdad\nto Beirut. And this gives Iran the opportunity to reconstruct the ancient\nPersian Empire \xe2\x80\x94 this time under the Shia label \xe2\x80\x94 in the rebuilding of the\nMiddle East that will inevitably have to take place when the new\ninternational borders [are] drawn. Because the borders of the settlement of\n1919-\'20 are essentially collapsing.\n\n\n\nThat gives Iran a very powerful level from a strategic point of view. I\nconsider Iran a bigger problem than ISIS. ISIS is a group of adventurers\nwith a very aggressive ideology. But they have to conquer more and more\nterritory before they can became a strategic, permanent reality. I think a\nconflict with ISIS \xe2\x80\x94 important as it is \xe2\x80\x94 is more manageable than a\nconfrontation with Iran.\n\n\n\n*On what he would do about ISIS*\n\n\n\nThey have cut the throat of an American on television. This is an insult to\nthe United States, which requires that we demonstrate that this is not an\nact that is free. I would strongly favor a strong attack on ISIS for a\nperiod that is related to the murder of the American.\n\n\n\nThen, we have to go into the long-range problem. I think when we are\ndealing with a unit like ISIS, we should not get into a position where they\ncan lead us by establishing ground forces. But we should set strategic\nobjectives where we thwart any goal they set themselves, which we should be\nable to do by superior air power. And then, if we can enlist other\ncountries, or other more local groups to do the ground fighting, we might\nactually destroy them.\n\n\n\n*On the "Russian enigma" and what he thinks Putin\'s Russia wants*\n\n\n\nThe attitude of the West and of Russia towards a crisis like Ukraine is\ndiametrically different. The West is trying to establish the legality of\nany established border. For Russia, Ukraine is part of the Russian\npatrimony.\n\n\n\nA Russian state was created around Kiev about 1,200 years ago. Ukraine\nitself has been part of Russia for 500 years, and I would say most Russians\nconsider it of Russian patrimony. The ideal solution would be to have a\nUkraine like Finland or Austria that can be a bridge between these two\nrather than an outpost.\n\n\n\n*Kissinger\'s reaction to naysayers because of his role during the war in\nVietnam, especially the bombing of Cambodia and Laos*\n\n\n\nThey should study what is going on. I think we would find, if you study the\nconduct of [the military], that the Obama administration has hit more\ntargets on a broader scale than the Nixon administration ever did. And, of\ncourse, B-52s have a different bombing pattern.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, drones are far more deadly because they are much more\naccurate. And I think the principle is essentially the same. You attack\nlocations where you believe people operate who are killing you. You do it\nin the most limited way possible. And I bet if one did an honest account,\nthere were fewer civilian casualties in Cambodia than there have been from\nAmerican drone attacks.\n\n\n\nThe Vietnam War was a great tragedy for that country. And it is now far\nenough away so that one can study [it] without using the slogans to see\nwhat really happened. And I believe you would find \xe2\x80\x94 my position was that\nof the chief of staff of the president \xe2\x80\x94 that the decisions that were taken\nwould almost certainly have been taken by those of you who are listening,\nfaced with the same set of problems. And you would have done them with\nanguish, as we did them with anguish.\n\n\n\n*On whether he thinks Hillary Clinton would be a good president*\n\n\n\nI know Hillary as a person. And as a personal friend, I would say yes,\nshe\'d be a good president. But she\'d put me under a great conflict of\ninterest if she were a candidate, because I tend to support the Republicans.\n\n\n\n... Yes, I\'d be comfortable with her as the president.\n\n\n\nTranscript\n\n\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\n\n\nHenry Kissinger was a scholar before he became a mover and shaker. And in a\nnew book, he traces the idea of order and world affairs - how nations try\nto establish systems to make the world a more orderly place. It usually\ndoesn\'t work out that way for long. His new book, "World Order," stretches\nfrom China under to the emperors, the treaties of Europe to the pivotal\nposition of Russia and Iran today. We spoke with the former secretary of\nstate last week shortly after news that James Foley - the U.S. journalist -\nhad been beheaded by militants from the Islamic State also known as ISIS.\nMr. Kissinger said that in all the crises roiling the world, the U.S.\nshouldn\'t lose focus on Iran.\n\n\n\nHENRY KISSINGER: There have come into being a kind of a Shia-belt from\nTehran through Baghdad to Beirut. And this gives Iran the opportunity to\nreconstruct the ancient Persian Empire, this time under a Shia label. From\na geo-strategic point of view, I consider Iran a bigger problem than ISIS.\nISIS is a group of adventurers with a very aggressive ideology. But they\nhave to conquer more and more territory before they can become a\ngeo-strategic, permanent reality. I think a conflict with ISIS - important\nas it is - is more manageable than a confrontation with Iran.\n\n\n\nSIMON: What would you do about ISIS?\n\n\n\nKISSINGER: They have cut the throat of an American on television. This is\nan insult to the United States, which requires that we demonstrate that\nthis is not an act that is free. I would strongly favor a strong attack on\nISIS for a period that is related to the murder of the American. Then, we\nhave to go into the long-range problem. I think when we\'re dealing with a\nunit like ISIS, we should not get into a position where they can lead us by\nestablishing ground forces. But we should set strategic objectives where we\nthwart any goal they set themselves, which we should be able to do by\nsuperior air power. And then if we can enlist other countries or other more\nlocal groups to do the ground fighting, we might actually destroy them.\n\n\n\nSIMON: Let me ask you about a couple of other areas of the world. You spent\na considerable time in this book writing about what you call the Russian\nenigma. What\'s your reading of what Vladimir Putin\'s Russia wants?\n\n\n\nKISSINGER: The attitude of the West and of Russia towards a crisis like\nUkraine is diametrically different. The West is trying to establish the\nlegality of any established border. For Russia, Ukraine is part of the\nRussian patrimony. A Russian state was created around Kiev about 1,200\nyears ago. Ukraine itself has been part of Russia for 500 years, and I\nwould say most Russians consider it of Russian patrimony. The ideal\nsolution would be to have a Ukraine like Finland or Austria that can be a\nbridge between these two rather than an outpost.\n\n\n\nSIMON: Mr. Kissinger, every time we interview you, we hear from people who\nobject, who say they have no interest in your opinion because of your role\nduring the war in Vietnam, especially the bombing of Cambodia and Laos. How\ndo you answer that?\n\n\n\nKISSINGER: They should study what is going on. I think we would find, if\nyou study the conduct of guerilla-type wars, that the Obama Administration\nhas hit more targets on a broader scale than the Nixon Administration ever\ndid.\n\n\n\nSIMON: Is there not, though, a difference between a drone attack and carpet\nbombing?\n\n\n\nKISSINGER: Of course. When you - B-52s have a different bombing pattern. On\nthe other hand, drones are far more deadly because they\'re much more\naccurate. And I think the principle is essentially the same. You attack\nlocations where you believe people operate who are killing you. You do it\nin the most limited way possible. And I bet if one did an honest account,\nthere are fewer civilian casualties in Cambodia than there have been from\nAmerican drone attacks. The Vietnam War was a great tragedy for our\ncountry. And it is now far enough away so that one can study without using\nthe slogans to see what\'s really happened. And I believe you would find -\nmy position was that of the chief of staff of the president - that the\ndecisions that were taken would almost certainly have been taken by those\nof you who are listening, faced with the same set of problems. And you\nwould have done them with anguish, as we did them with anguish.\n\n\n\nSIMON: Mr. Kissinger, a future question - do you think Hillary Clinton\nwould be a good president?\n\n\n\nKISSINGER: I know Hillary as a person. And as a personal friend, I would\nsay yes, she\'d be a good president. But she\'d put me under a great conflict\nof interest if she were a candidate because I intend to support the\nRepublicans.\n\n\n\nSIMON: Well, I didn\'t ask it in a partisan way, just if she were to run and\nbe elected, would you be comfortable with her as president of United States?\n\n\n\nKISSINGER: Yes, I\'d be comfortable with that president.\n\n\n\nSIMON: Henry Kissinger. His new book - "World Order." Thanks so much for\nbeing with us.\n\n\n\nKISSINGER: You\'ve just lost me. I don\'t know how many friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Washington Post blog: In The Loop: \xe2\x80\x9cDid Kissinger endorse Clinton for\npresident?

They shared a stage at the\ngroundbreaking of the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s new Diplomacy Center, Clinton\nwrote a glowing review of Kissinger\xe2\x80\x99s new book, and then President Richard\nNixon\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy adviser on Saturday offered an (almost) endorsement\nfor a Clinton presidency.\n\n\n\nKissinger, a controversial figure in American diplomatic history, was asked\nduring an NPR interview whether Clinton would make a good president.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know Hillary as a person. And as a personal friend, I would say yes,\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d be a good president,\xe2\x80\x9d Kissinger said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she\xe2\x80\x99d put me under a great\nconflict of interest if she were a candidate because I intend to support\nthe Republicans.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNPR reporter Scott Simon asked whether, putting partisan politics aside,\nKissinger would be comfortable with a Clinton White House.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99d be comfortable with that president,\xe2\x80\x9d Kissinger said. But then he\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve just lost me I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhich begs the question, how many friends would it cost Clinton to have\nKissinger, reviled by the antiwar movement during the Vietnam War, as an\nadvocate?\n\n\n\nThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time that Kissinger has heaped praise on Clinton. In\n2008, when it was rumored that Barack Obama would pick her as his secretary\nof state, Kissinger was all in. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is a lady of great intelligence,\ndemonstrated enormous determination and would be an outstanding\nappointment,\xe2\x80\x9d he said during a speech in India.\n\n\n\nBut liberals, who worry that Clinton is too hawkish on foreign policy, have\nraised an eyebrow at the presumptive Democratic front-runner\xe2\x80\x99s cuddly\nrelationship with Kissinger. David Corn at Mother Jones described Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nembrace of Kissinger as evidence of \xe2\x80\x9chow low she can go\xe2\x80\x9d to win the White\nHouse.\n\n\n\nAnd the former diplomats\xe2\x80\x99 friendship adds fuel to the other end of the\npolitical spectrum occupied by libertarian Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). Paul is\nlargely anti-intervention and is eager to run for president against\nClinton, whom he has dismissed as a \xe2\x80\x9cwar hawk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhich leads to another question: If Paul is the GOP nominee against\nClinton, will Kissinger still vote Republican?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Atlantic: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary, Elizabeth Warren, and Israel\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/hillary-elizabeth-warren-and-israel/379721/>*\n\n\n\nBy Jeffery Goldberg\n\nSeptember 7, 2014, 9:05 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] Why Hillary Clinton\'s hawkish pro-Israel stance won\'t hurt her,\neven with the Democratic Party base\n\n\n\nShortly after I posted my interview with Hillary Clinton last month, I\nbegan hearing from liberal Democrats who were worried that her hawkish\ncomments\xe2\x80\x94on Syria, but especially on the Gaza war\xe2\x80\x94would somehow provoke a\nprimary challenge from her left (these conversations proceeded from the\nassumption that Clinton is running for president, which is a reasonable\nassumption). The Democratic Party base, the theory went, would be so\noffended by Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s vociferous pro-Netanyahu positioning that it would\nagitate on behalf of a primary challenge. Elizabeth Warren, the populist\nMassachusetts senator, was the most likely candidate for the role.\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, here is some of what Clinton said about Israel and Gaza:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsrael was attacked by rockets from Gaza. Israel has a right to defend\nitself. The steps Hamas has taken to embed rockets and command-and-control\nfacilities and tunnel entrances in civilian areas, this makes a response by\nIsrael difficult. Of course Israel, just like the United States, or any\nother democratic country, should do everything they can possibly do to\nlimit civilian casualties.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd this:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were the prime minister of Israel, you\xe2\x80\x99re damn right I would expect\nto have control over security [on the West Bank], because even if I\xe2\x80\x99m\ndealing with Abbas, who is 79 years old, and other members of Fatah, who\nare enjoying a better lifestyle and making money on all kinds of things,\nthat does not protect Israel from the influx of Hamas or cross-border\nattacks from anywhere else. With Syria and Iraq, it is all one big threat.\nSo Netanyahu could not do this in good conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nTough stuff, and not the sort of thing you would have heard from her\npublicly when she was yelling at Benjamin Netanyahu on behalf of President\nObama for the past several years. After the interview, I came to a few\nconclusions about these statements:\n\n\n\n1.       They were made on purpose, as was every statement she made in the\ninterview, including the line that got the most attention: \xe2\x80\x9cGreat nations\nneed organizing principles, and \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t do stupid stuff\xe2\x80\x99 is not an\norganizing principle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n2.       They were made with the knowledge that she faces no serious\nforeign policy-focused challenge from her left. She does face a more\nserious and sustained critique from the left on domestic issues, but she\nfelt that going hawkish on foreign policy would be low-risk.\n\n3.       They were made with knowledge that there are segments of the\npro-Israel community that still mistrust her for kissing Mrs. Arafat a\nmillion years ago.\n\n4.       She believes what she said. She is just naturally more hawkish\nthan the president she served as secretary of state.\n\n\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m now glad to report\xe2\x80\x94only because I\xe2\x80\x99d rather be right than wrong, all\nthings being equal\xe2\x80\x94that Elizabeth Warren has confirmed for us that, on\nquestions related to Israel, Clinton has nothing to fear from her, at least.\n\n\n\nAt a town-hall meeting on Cape Cod last month, Warren answered critics of\nher vote in favor of a Senate measure to send an additional $225 million in\nmilitary funding to Israel during the war. Here is a report on the\ntown-hall meeting from the Cape Cod Times:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I think the vote was right, and I\'ll tell you why I think the vote was\nright,\xe2\x80\x99 [Warren] said. \xe2\x80\x98America has a very special relationship with\nIsrael. Israel lives in a very dangerous part of the world, and a part of\nthe world where there aren\'t many liberal democracies and democracies that\nare controlled by the rule of law. And we very much need an ally in that\npart of the world.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWarren said Hamas has attacked Israel \xe2\x80\x98indiscriminately,\xe2\x80\x99 but with the\nIron Dome defense system, the missiles have \xe2\x80\x98not had the terrorist effect\nHamas hoped for.\xe2\x80\x99 When pressed by another member of the crowd about\ncivilian casualties from Israel\'s attacks, Warren said she believes those\ncasualties are the \xe2\x80\x98last thing Israel wants.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But when Hamas puts its rocket launchers next to hospitals, next to\nschools, they\'re using their civilian population to protect their military\nassets. And I believe Israel has a right, at that point, to defend itself,\xe2\x80\x99\nWarren said, drawing applause.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nEven if Elizabeth Warren chooses to run (unlikely), she won\xe2\x80\x99t run as a\ntough-on-Israel liberal. There\'s just no percentage in it. Hillary knew\nwhat she was doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Hill blog: Ballot Box: \xe2\x80\x9cRomney: \'No question\' I\'d be a better\ncandidate than Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/216875-romney-no-question-id-be-a-better-candidate-than-hillary>*\n\n\n\nBy Kevin Cirilli\n\nSeptember 7, 2014, 9:54 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nMitt Romney said Sunday that he\'d make a better president than Hillary\nClinton, although he is not planning on running.\n\n\n\nRomney, the former 2012 Republican presidential candidate, insisted that\nhe\'s not running for president in 2016.

Jeb Bush opts not\nto run.\n\n\n\nIn his Sunday appearance on Fox, Mr. Romney said there was \xe2\x80\x9cno question\xe2\x80\x9d in\nhis mind that he would make a better president than Mrs. Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 or the\nperson who beat him in 2012, President Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nThe 2012 Republican nominee also sought to cast doubts about Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nforeign-policy bona fides, linking the potential candidate to Mr. Obama,\nwhose support is sagging in most public-opinion polls, particularly for his\nhandling for foreign policy.\n\n\n\nIn his appearance Sunday, Mr. Romney didn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely rule out a bid, but he\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t leave the door open very wide either.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy time has come and gone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had the opportunity.

Rand Paul (R-KY) decided to pick a fight with Hillary Clinton over\nclimate change on Friday.\n\n\n\nThe sticking point was a speech the former Secretary of State gave on\nThursday to the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas. Her remarks\ncovered a wide range of issues, in particular foreign policy. But she also\nzeroed in on the need for the U.S. to tackle climate change, calling it\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe most consequential, urgent, sweeping collection of challenges we face.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThat was the part Paul pounced on. \xe2\x80\x9cFor her to be out there saying that the\nbiggest threat to our safety and to our well-being is climate change, I\nthink, goes to the heart of the matter or whether or not she has the wisdom\nto lead the country, which I think it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul\nsaid in a Friday appearance on Fox News, while discussing ISIS \xe2\x80\x94 the\nIslamic terrorist that\xe2\x80\x99s seized territory in parts of Iraq and Syria.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think we really want a commander-in-chief who\xe2\x80\x99s battling climate\nchange instead of terrorism,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul continued.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton is widely considered the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 main contender for the\npresidency in 2016, while Paul is one of several Republican front-runners.\nIn particular, the Kentucky Senator has distinguished himself as a voice of\nskepticism regarding American military intervention abroad, a position that\nhas both won him accolades and put him in the uncomfortable position of\nembodying one side in a growing rift within the GOP over foreign policy.\n\n\n\nThat side also appears to be losing, as polling of Republicans across the\ncountry suggests a convergence is happening in favor of foreign policy\nhawkishness . Recently, Paul himself has taken the rise of ISIS as an\nopportunity to push back at his reputation as an isolationist.\n\n\n\nThe trouble for Paul is that, by all accounts, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s characterization\nof climate change is perfectly sound. Multiple environmental groups \xe2\x80\x94\nincluding the League of Conservation Voters and NextGen Climate \xe2\x80\x94 shot back\nat Paul, many of them pointing out that the Defense Department\xe2\x80\x99s own\nQuadrennial Defense Review in 2014 pointed to climate change as a\n\xe2\x80\x9csignificant challenge for the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pressures caused by climate change will influence resource competition\nwhile placing additional burdens on economies, societies, and governance\ninstitutions around the world,\xe2\x80\x9d the report explained. \xe2\x80\x9cThese effects are\nthreat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty,\nenvironmental degradation, political instability, and social tensions \xe2\x80\x94\nconditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA 2014 study by a panel of 16 retired three- and four-star American\ngenerals and admirals also looked into the national security threats posed\nby climate change and concluded it is \xe2\x80\x9ca catalyst for conflict.\xe2\x80\x9d And\nRebecca Leber noted in The New Republic that the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s deputy\nassistant secretary of Defense for strategy and force development even\nexplained the situation to the Senate panel Paul himself sits on.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe effects of the changing climate affect the full range of Department\nactivities, including plans, operations, training, infrastructure,\nacquisition, and longer-term investments,\xe2\x80\x9d Daniel Chiu told the Senate\nForeign Relations Committee in July. \xe2\x80\x9cBy taking a proactive, flexible\napproach to assessment, analysis, and adaptation, the Department can keep\npace with the impacts of changing climate patterns, minimize effects on the\nDepartment, and continue to protect our national security interests.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBeyond national security threats, the threats posed by climate change to\nAmericans\xe2\x80\x99 well-being and economic security are also striking. A recent\nnational report entitled \xe2\x80\x9cRisky Business\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 arguably the most comprehensive\nanalysis done yet on the economic risks of climate change \xe2\x80\x94 noted that by\n2100 there is a one-in-twenty chance climate change will reduce national\nlabor productivity by three percent. \xe2\x80\x9cA decline of three percent in labor\nproductivity nationally is like losing all of Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s labor force,\xe2\x80\x9d\nKate Gordon, the study\xe2\x80\x99s executive director, told ThinkProgress. A big part\nof that reduction would come from heat: within the same time frame, the\neastern half of the country could begin seeing a few days a year where heat\nand humidity combine to such a degree that it literally becomes\nlife-threatening for people to be outside for an extended period.\n\n\n\nThe latest National Climate Assessment, meanwhile, projects rising heat\nwaves, more droughts, more floods, and even more insidious effects like\nocean acidification for every region of the U.S. \xe2\x80\x94 all of which in turn\nthreaten the stability of industries and infrastructure around the country.\nIf current projections for sea level rise pan out, it could wipe much of\nSouth Florida, including the city of Miami, right off the map by 2100.\n\n\n\nIn short, if climate change is not \xe2\x80\x9cthe most consequential\xe2\x80\x9d challenge\nfacing America, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine what issue could possibly qualify. And\npolling also indicates most Americans are aware of the problem, with\nmajorities of voters consistently labeling climate change a serious threat\nand saying government should move decisively to deal with it.\n\n\n\nThat stance is not uniformly distributed, however: Democrats, along with\nLatinos, and other minorities, tend to register the most concern with\nglobal warming. But Republicans and Tea Party voters tend to be the most\nskeptical. They\xe2\x80\x99ll also be the voters Rand Paul will need to court in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE FROM CTR RESEARCH, FACTS: Secretary Clinton engaged domestic and\nforeign leaders to secure and extract Americans from Benghazi. Secretary\nClinton was fully engaged in locating and extracting Americans from\nBenghazi that night. As detailed in her book Hard Choices, Clinton spent\nthe night coordinating rescue efforts with the White House, the National\nSecurity Council, the American Embassy in Tripoli, and Libyan President\nMohamed Magariaf. Additional accounts of that night note that Secretary\nClinton coordinated efforts with foreign leaders in Egypt, Yemen and\nTunisia.\n\n\n\n*Boston Herald column: Adriana Cohen: \xe2\x80\x9cBenghazi truth emerges\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://bostonherald.com/news_opinion/columnists/adriana_cohen/2014/09/adriana_cohen_benghazi_truth_emerges>*\n\n\n\nBy Adriana Cohen\n\nSeptember 7, 2014\n\n\n\nThree CIA military contractors who were in the fight for their lives when\nour consulate in Benghazi was attacked on Sept. 11, 2012, gave a riveting\nfirst-hand account in a bombshell interview with Fox News anchor Bret Baier\nof what really happened that night.\n\n\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans \xe2\x80\x94\nincluding Winchester native Glen Doherty \xe2\x80\x94 lost their lives in the brutal\nattack by Islamist terrorists who launched RPGs, mortars and heavy fire\ninto both the consulate and nearby annex \xe2\x80\x94 for 13 hours \xe2\x80\x94 while the White\nHouse and State Department ignored their cries for help.\n\n\n\nWhen our consulate was attacked, these three CIA first responders wanted to\nimmediately rush over to the compound to rescue Stevens and other personnel\nbut say they were repeatedly told to wait and \xe2\x80\x9cstand down\xe2\x80\x9d for nearly 30\nminutes by their CIA base chief, who was with them that deadly night. Their\nteam leader was a CIA official who got direct orders from Washington to\nwait multiple times.\n\n\n\nThis long delay cost Ambassador Stevens and Sean Smith their lives.\n\n\n\nBaier\xe2\x80\x99s report is based on a book coming out Tuesday, \xe2\x80\x9c13 Hours: The Inside\nAccount of What Really Happened in Benghazi,\xe2\x80\x9d written by Boston University\njournalism professor Mitchell Zuckoff along with the CIA contractors.\n\n\n\nBAIER: If I gave you that 30 minutes back, would Ambassador Stevens and\nSean Smith be alive today?\n\n\n\nKRIS PARONTO (CIA contractor): Yes, they would still be alive.\n\n\n\nBAIER: You in on that?\n\n\n\nJOHN TIEGEN (CIA contractor): I strongly believe if we would have left\nimmediately, they would still be alive today.\n\n\n\nNot only did the delay cost two Americans their lives, but these three CIA\nsecurity contractors and two others, Tyrone Woods and Doherty, were still\nfighting for their own lives as the attack continued. They requested air\nsupport and military back-up from the State Department \xe2\x80\x94 but Hillary\nClinton didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer that 3 a.m. phone call. No help came. And good\nAmerican men lost their lives because of it.\n\n\n\nThe Obama Administration \xe2\x80\x94 of course \xe2\x80\x94 denies they told anybody at the CIA\nannex to \xe2\x80\x9cstand down.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise they\xe2\x80\x99ve been playing word games on\nwhat \xe2\x80\x9clanguage\xe2\x80\x9d they used to order the CIA security team to wait. Former\nPresident Bill Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 when caught in a sex scandal which led to his\nimpeachment \xe2\x80\x94 spliced words during the investigation saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt depends\nwhat the meaning of \xe2\x80\x98is\xe2\x80\x99 is.\xe2\x80\x9d With an ongoing congressional Benghazi\ninvestigation and upcoming midterm elections, the White House and their\nspokesmen are doing the same.\n\n\n\nAnd America\xe2\x80\x99s not buying it. They know a cover-up when they see one.\n\n\n\nPrior to the Sept. 11 attack, Obama was selling the phony narrative that\nterrorism was \xe2\x80\x9con the run.\xe2\x80\x9d So instead of admitting he was wrong when\nIslamist terrorists attacked our consulate, his administration made up the\nphony story that protesters upset by a video attacked our consulate and\nmurdered these brave Americans. And then they went into cover-up mode. They\nput politics first and violated the \xe2\x80\x9cleave no man behind\xe2\x80\x9d military code.\n\n\n\nAnd with a complicit mainstream media they got away with it, and Obama got\nre-elected. Politics and personal career ambitions should never trump human\nlife. But in the Obama/Clinton regime, it does.\n\n\n\nMy heart goes out to the victims\xe2\x80\x99 families.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sec.
