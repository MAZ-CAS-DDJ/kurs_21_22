john.podesta@gmail.comb'Good morning,\n\nSee below for the papers and other analysis we\'re putting out to go along with today\'s launch of Romney U<http://www.americanprogressaction.org/projects/romney-u> here at the Center for American Progress Action Fund.\n\nIf you read just one thing, I\'d highly recommend the very detailed analysis of Romney\'s economic plan<http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2012/07/romneyu_econ.html> -- a plan that depends on the failed Bush strategy of enriching the wealthy at the expense of everyone else.\n\nClass kicks off at 9:30 this morning with a keynote speech from former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, with the rest of the day\'s panels to follow.  All of the details and a livestream can be found here:\n\nhttp://www.americanprogressaction.org/events/2012/07/romneyu.html\n\nLook for more papers and events in the weeks to come.\n\n-Josh\n\n\nNew Papers & Analysis Out Today:\n http://www.americanprogressaction.org/projects/romney-u\n\n-ECONOMY: The Romney Economic Agenda and Its Effect on the Middle Class and Growth<http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2012/07/romneyu_econ.html>\n\n\n\n-HEALTH CARE:\n-Romneycare vs. Obamacare<http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2012/07/romneyu_romneycare.html>\n\n-The Truth About Gov.
