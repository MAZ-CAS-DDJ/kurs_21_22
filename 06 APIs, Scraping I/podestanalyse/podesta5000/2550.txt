The radical Republicans have deep-pocketed special interest donors on their side \xe2\x80\x93 which is why we need to give everything we've got to keep Kirsten in the Senate.\n\nThe grassroots have always powered her campaign. Can Kirsten count on you to help us reach our goal of $25,000 by midnight May 31?\n*\nClick here to make a contribution of just $100, $150 or more and help us ensure Kirsten has the resources she needs to keep her campaign strong.

Seems like a good plan, right? \n\nApparently not.\n *\nWhen you're dealing with radical Republicans in Congress-who put deep-pocketed donors before middle class families, who put their ideology before health care for all, women's rights and the environment -even the best ideas get thrown out.*\n \nLast Tuesday, when Republicans blocked our proposal to end huge tax breaks for Big Oil, it only served to highlight how important it is that we prevent a GOP takeover of the Senate.\n \n* Republicans only need four seats to gain a majority, and one of the seats they've been eyeing is mine.* There's no way I'm going to give an inch. I'm counting on you, my grassroots supporters, to stand with me as I fight to keep my seat and protect the interests of the people I serve-not wealthy oil companies.\n\n*Click here to make a donation to my campaign today and help me raise $25,000 by midnight May 31. We need to keep the GOP from making any gains in next year's election.* [ https://secure.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/1097/p/wfc/dscc/senators/gillibrand/donate.sjs?donate_page_KEY=11300 ]\n \nRepublicans have used the last five months to make their extremist agenda perfectly clear. They want to abolish Medicare as we know it. They want to put the desires of corporate America above the needs of middle-class families. They want to keep chipping away at women's rights and access to health care.\n *\nUnfortunately, they're only four seats away from having the power to make these outrageous ideas a reality.*\n \nMy seat is one of the 23 Democratic seats up for grabs next year, and I'm vowing to do everything I can to make sure the GOP doesn't get it. *But of course, I can't do this alone. I need all of my supporters to stand up and support my campaign now, before the May 31 deadline. *We just need to reach $25,000 to make our goal.\n \n*Click here to contribute to my campaign and help me reach my goal of raising $25,000 by midnight May 31. It's up to us-you and me-to protect the Senate from a GOP takeover.* [ https://secure.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/1097/p/wfc/dscc/senators/gillibrand/donate.sjs?donate_page_KEY=11300 ]\n \nIt's disappointing when a bill to curb Big Oil subsidies doesn't go through. But I hate to imagine what will happen if the Republicans ever get their hands on the Senate.\n \nSincerely,\n \nKirsten Gillibrand \n\n [ https://secure.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/1097/p/wfc/dscc/senators/gillibrand/donate.sjs?donate_page_KEY=11300 ]\n  \n  \n \n\n\nThis message was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.
