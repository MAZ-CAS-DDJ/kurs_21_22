He claims that if he wants to be successful, he has to\ndifferentiate himself from his family. Many Republicans do not want Jeb\nBush. His logo does not say \xe2\x80\x9cBush\xe2\x80\x9d, it only says \xe2\x80\x9cJeb!\xe2\x80\x9d. Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s general\nelection argument is different than the base. He is more viable, more\ncenter right in the party. Jeb Bush claims that he will have his \xe2\x80\x9cbreakout\xe2\x80\x9d\nmoment. Reporters claim that it could be during one of the debates. HRC\nlaunched her campaign. Many reporters claimed that she needs to speak more\non trade policy and other policies. HRC claims that Obama should listen to\nPelosi. Bernie Sanders was still saying that he still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure what she\nwas trying to say during her speech. Reporters claim that it seemed as if\nshe was siding with Nancy Pelosi. Clinton claims she agrees with the\nPresident but she does not believe that troops should be in Iraq doing\ncombat. She claims that Obama is trying to use the unique skills that the\nU.S. military possesses. She claims that ISIS is a very serious threat, but\nshe claims that she would help Iraq in support mode, but not in combat.\n\n*MSNBC's Morning Joe:* New Hampshire poll numbers out. HRC at 44%, Sanders\nat 32%, Biden at 11%, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley at 2%, Webb at 1%. Said they aren\xe2\x80\x99t\nsurprised because \xe2\x80\x9cSanders is made for New Hampshire.\xe2\x80\x9d At HRC\xe2\x80\x99s first\nrally, she bashed the financial industry, outlined a populous domestic\nagenda and talked about the role model if her life, her mother. Showed\nfootage from her speech. Commentary on HRC\xe2\x80\x99s speech. Mika said the crowd\nwas enthusiastic and loved her speech but questions whether she is\ntruthful. Noted that if you talk to young people, especially young women,\nthey plan on voting for her. HRC is hitting populist issues and policy. One\nof her strengths if not barn burning is laying out competent policy. She\xe2\x80\x99s\ndesigning her campaign by evoking FDR and the New Deal. HRC needs to reach\nnew voters, young voters, voters of colors, and is doing so by talking\nabout economic policies that would help a lot of people in theory if she\ncould execute them. HRC is in Concord today. Andrea Mitchell reports on HRC\nin New Hampshire. Mitchell says big rallies are not her strength but she\ndid hit the notes about a populist economic agenda and now she\xe2\x80\x99s going to\nfill in the specifics. Yesterday in Iowa, she took a stance on trade with\nthe Des Moines Register. She is gradually becoming more available. Very\ndiverse audience in New York. Mitchell notes that the New Hampshire poll is\nonline so we should caveat it. Jeb vs. Hillary. Noted that they were first\nname candidates. It would depress turnout. It would be much better for HRC\ncampaign if she\xe2\x80\x99s running against someone else. It recalls too much of the\npast and makes HRC appear dynastic even though the circumstances of her\ndynasty are very different (not father/son and never had a woman president)\nbut having two familiar last names is a real problem. Who wins? Can\xe2\x80\x99t tell\nuntil we see how issues play out and enthusiasm builds. So far, Jeb has had\na bad half and HRC has done better than expected, very strong and very\npopulist, and campaign is better organized than it was in 08. We have a\nyear and a half to see how it all plays out and how people respond to them\nand how they respond to people. Joel Benenson was interviewed.\n"
