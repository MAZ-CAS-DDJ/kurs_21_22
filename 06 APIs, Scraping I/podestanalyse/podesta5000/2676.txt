I was also disappointed that the U.S. Senate failed to\n>>> adopt some very good amendments that would have significantly improved the\n>>> bill. Senator KOHL offered an amendment that would have limited the\n>>> practice of wealthy debtors shielding themselves from creditors in\n>>> bankruptcy behind State homestead exemption laws that allow them to shelter\n>>> large amounts of money in a new home. His amendment would have placed a\n>>> national cap on this exemption, and limited the abusive practice of\n>>> sheltering large amounts of money in large homes. I supported this needed\n>>> amendment, but it was rejected on the floor of the Senate. Several\n>>> amendments were also offered that would have restricted the marketing to\n>>> and use of credit cards by young people.
