But how much leverage she retains in\nthe 114th could come down to how she fits into the Republican-controlled\nCongress over the next two years.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone is irrelevant. We have leverage if they don\xe2\x80\x99t have\nthe votes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have leverage because they know we will be\nresponsible. And that allows them to be irresponsible to a certain extent.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd 2016? Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a whole new ballgame. By then, the country could see\nits first female president, said the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first female speaker.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me say this about Hillary [Rodham] Clinton: When she runs, she will\nwin. And when she wins, she\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the White House as one of the most\nprepared people in modern history to go there,\xe2\x80\x9d Pelosi said, stopping just\nshort of an endorsement that would be significant for Clinton, the former\nfirst lady and ex-secretary of State.\n\n\n\nA favorite parlor game of political observers and operatives, members and\naides is wondering when Pelosi might retire.\n\n\n\nFor the past 12 years, she\xe2\x80\x99s been her caucus\xe2\x80\x99s most senior leader, and\nduring that time she\xe2\x80\x99s cemented her legacy as a master vote-counter,\nconsensus-builder and fundraiser.\n\n\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s said she\xe2\x80\x99s continuing to serve because she does so at the pleasure of\nher members, and because she wants to protect the landmark, and perpetually\nembattled, health care legislation she helped draft and pass in 21010.\n\n\n\nCould 2016 be the year she steps aside, especially if Clinton runs and wins?\n\n\n\nPelosi, 74, offers no hints, but she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend she\xe2\x80\x99ll be around\nforever.\n\n\n\nReminded that she said she\xe2\x80\x99d stay on as leader as long as the caucus wants\nher, Pelosi joked, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, maybe not that long.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAsked whether anybody else could now do what she does, she drew in a breath\nand laughed: \xe2\x80\x9cI certainly hope so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTooting my own horn, \xe2\x80\xa6 the support I have in the country, originating in\nthe great state of California, is substantial, and enables me to amass\nresources because they believe in what I believe in and also want to see a\nDemocratic majority,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pelosi, who has raised more than $400 million\nsince she entered leadership in 2002.\n\n\n\nDespite some grumblings that she has an inner circle and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to\nexpand it, Pelosi insisted she is and has always been laying the groundwork\nfor a next generation of leadership to ascend when the time comes for her \xe2\x80\x94\nand Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer and Assistant Leader James E. Clyburn,\nalso in their mid-70s \xe2\x80\x94 to step aside.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s always a responsibility that we have,\xe2\x80\x9d Pelosi said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve probably\nappointed more women to be, where I had the discretion, to be chairs of\ncommittees, or place them in positions where they would become chairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe same is true, she said, for members of color, such as Rep. Bennie\nThompson of Mississippi, whom she tapped to be top Democrat on the Homeland\nSecurity Committee. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were people more senior who wanted that\nposition, but it was a new committee so I had the ability to put that\nlineup in place,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just about leadership,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cThis place is competitive in\nsome ways, but there\xe2\x80\x99s so much opportunity, and beyond having a role, it\xe2\x80\x99s\nwhat your standing is on the issue.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPelosi tried recently to help elevate a woman to serve as ranking member of\nEnergy and Commerce \xe2\x80\x94 a fellow Californian and her close friend, Rep. Anna\nG. Eshoo. Her endorsement ended up not being enough for Eshoo to defeat the\nmore senior Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, and it was one of a series of\npersonal obstacles Pelosi faced in the immediate aftermath of an Election\nDay drubbing, when members were looking for someone to blame and targeted\nthe minority leader for not taking ownership of the losses.\n\n\n\nShe regained some goodwill, however, when she surprised nearly everybody\nand selected New Mexico Democrat Ben Ray Luj\xc3\xa1n to be the next chairman of\nthe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\n\n\nWith members expecting Pelosi to promote someone already firmly installed\nin her circle, the gesture was met with enthusiasm. Even her critics saw it\nas a sign their leader was open to singling out lawmakers who were outside\nthe box, had put their heads down and worked hard and who didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nnecessarily have household names.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has a beautiful reputation,\xe2\x80\x9d Pelosi said of Luj\xc3\xa1n.\n\n\n\nPelosi said members would have to answer the question of what has earned\nher the loyalty she enjoys, but she described herself as \xe2\x80\x9ca weaver of a\nloom just \xe2\x80\xa6 pulling together all the threads of different opinion in our\ncaucus.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy job is to make sure that we have the strongest possible fabric woven\nfrom all those different threads,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I have to say to\npeople, \xe2\x80\x98This is a path that we have to go, to vote with the Republicans to\nget something done, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to vote for it, but I have to give it\nsome support,\xe2\x80\x99 then they understand that. If you\xe2\x80\x99re saying to people, \xe2\x80\x98This\nis terrible, but you have to vote for it,\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x99s a harder sell than if\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re saying, \xe2\x80\x98We just need to be helpful and you can \xe2\x80\xa6 make your own\njudgment.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they always do make their own judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*New York Times column: Frank Bruni: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary 2.0 Would Be Hillary XX\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/opinion/sunday/frank-bruni-hillary-2-0-would-be-hillary-xx.html?_r=1>*\n\n\n\nBy Frank Bruni\n\nDecember 6, 2014\n\n\n\nNovember 2016 is still a long way off, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine that the\npresidential campaign will provide any bit of advertising as strangely\nentertaining and revealing as a video put online recently by Stand With\nHillary, a new \xe2\x80\x9csuper PAC.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHaven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it? Oh you must. Right now. I give you leave from this column\nto go take a look, but hurry back. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to talk about.\n\n\n\nIt spotlights a man in a cowboy hat who croons in a country-and-western\ntwang about how darned much he adores that there Hillary Clinton.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHindsight\xe2\x80\x99s always right,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings, a clear dig at Barack Obama, the\ncandidate chosen over her in the Democratic primaries. There are images of\nconstruction work, a welder, a pickup truck, a tractor, a big red barn,\ncows. It\xe2\x80\x99s the unveiling of Hard-Hat Hillary. Rodeo Hillary. Hillary,\nPatron Saint of the Prairie.\n\n\n\nBut it positions her first and foremost as all woman. The references are\nincessant. The chorus goes like this: \xe2\x80\x9cThinking about one great lady like\nthe women in my life. She\xe2\x80\x99s a mother, a daughter and through it all, she\xe2\x80\x99s\na loving wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA man with a sledgehammer shatters a panel of glass \xe2\x80\x94 twice. And the cowboy\nexhorts his brethren: \xe2\x80\x9cPut your boots on and let\xe2\x80\x99s smash this ceiling.\xe2\x80\x9d\nJust in case there was any doubt about what that glass meant.\n\n\n\nThe video wasn\xe2\x80\x99t produced by Clinton or her aides. But the people who did\nput it together clearly followed the cues that they felt they were getting,\nand they read her intentions right. If she runs, she\xe2\x80\x99ll do so with more\nfocus on her gender and a greater emphasis on making history than she did\nin 2008.\n\n\n\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99ll be the smart move, because her gender is precisely what offsets\ncertain of her weaknesses as a candidate. To double down on the double X\nmay be her best way to mitigate several otherwise big vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nBack in 2008, \xe2\x80\x9cClinton seemed to develop a tortured approach toward her\ngender on the campaign trail, sometimes embracing it, sometimes dismissing\nit, sometimes appearing to overcompensate for it \xe2\x80\x94 but rarely appearing at\nease with it,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Anne Kornblut of The Washington Post in her 2009 book\nabout that race, \xe2\x80\x9cNotes From the Cracked Ceiling.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe observed that some of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s key advisers felt that partly because\nof her gender, she had to routinely assert toughness and be America\xe2\x80\x99s own\nIron Lady. There were boxing gloves at her events, along with music from\n\xe2\x80\x9cRocky.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nKornblut recalled the time when she was told by a proud Clinton adviser\nthat it was \xe2\x80\x9cas though his boss were running with a penis.\xe2\x80\x9d And at one\ncampaign event, a labor leader introduced her as \xe2\x80\x9cthe candidate with\n\xe2\x80\x98testicular fortitude,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Kornblut wrote.\n\n\n\nClinton never gave a gender speech that rivaled Obama\xe2\x80\x99s race speech.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Obama won the Iowa caucuses, everybody wrote and talked\nabout it as historic,\xe2\x80\x9d Kornblut told me last week. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Jesse Jackson had\nwon primaries. When Hillary Clinton won New Hampshire, it was historic. But\nthe coverage was, \xe2\x80\x98Hillary made a comeback. She\xe2\x80\x99s the comeback kid, just\nlike her husband was.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nKornblut said that, belatedly, a few members of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle came\nto believe that her frequently gender-neutral approach wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just \xe2\x80\x9ca big\nmistake of the campaign. That was the big strategic mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut with an even longer r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 now, Clinton could emphasize her\ntrailblazing womanhood for 2016 without the worry that many voters would\nmisinterpret it as the main qualification that she\xe2\x80\x99s claiming. And after\nfour years as a secretary of state more hawkish than the president she\nserved, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to push the image of a dauntless world leader.\n\n\n\nAmericans\xe2\x80\x99 economic anxieties will almost surely be at the center of the\nrace, and with the right language, Clinton might have \xe2\x80\x9cthe ability to talk\nas mom and grandmom about the need to make sure government is on the side\nof our families,\xe2\x80\x9d Chris Lehane, a Democratic strategist who recently\naddressed the group Ready for Hillary, told me.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeing a woman translates into great politics,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nClinton seemingly agrees. Over the last year she has weighed in strongly on\nissues like equal pay and child care. She has done women-themed events\ngalore.\n\n\n\nIn a speech at Georgetown University last week, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe know when\nwomen contribute in making and keeping peace, entire societies enjoy better\noutcomes. Women leaders, it has been found, are good at building coalitions\nacross ethnic and sectarian lines and speaking up for other marginalized\ngroups.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIT\xe2\x80\x99S possible that Clinton has noticed polls. In one by Gallup early this\nyear, when Americans were asked what about a Clinton presidency would be\nmost exciting, the answer given more than any other was that she would be\nthe first woman in the job.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s her \xe2\x80\x9cunique selling proposition,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Frank Newport, Gallup\xe2\x80\x99s editor\nin chief, in an analysis of those results.\n\n\n\nAnd that proposition is potentially an inoculation.\n\n\n\nYes, she\xe2\x80\x99s been around forever and isn\xe2\x80\x99t a fresh face. But she can\xe2\x80\x99t be\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s news when she\xe2\x80\x99s tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s precedent.\n\n\n\nYes, there\xe2\x80\x99s a whiff of dynasty about her. But maybe she gets some of the\n\xe2\x80\x9cnew car smell\xe2\x80\x9d that Obama said voters were looking for by promising a new\naltitude of female accomplishment.\n\n\n\nYes, a contest between her and Jeb Bush would be one of two surnames from\nthe past. But only she can claim to represent an uncharted future, at least\nin one sense.\n\n\n\nYes, detractors will say that she\xe2\x80\x99s a third term of Obama: business as\nusual. Her supporters can answer that she\xe2\x80\x99s history\xe2\x80\x99s unfinished business.\n\n\n\nYes, she\xe2\x80\x99s now wealthy and well-connected, and would be starting the race\nwith titanic advantages. But if she\xe2\x80\x99s willing to talk about her experience\nas a woman, she can talk about what it\xe2\x80\x99s been like to make her way in a\nman\xe2\x80\x99s world. She\xe2\x80\x99s a leader of the pack who can make some underdog noises,\nan ultimate insider who can potentially connect with outsiders \xe2\x80\x94 thanks to\ngender.\n\n\n\nLehane called it \xe2\x80\x9ca sword and a shield.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhen she ran the last time around, Rush Limbaugh asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWill Americans\nwant to watch a woman get older before their eyes on a daily basis?\xe2\x80\x9d It was\na sexist question, but this can be a sexist country, and even some\nDemocrats had that concern.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s more than six years later, and Ruth Marcus of The Washington Post\nrecently noted Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfull-on embrace of grandma-hood, tweeting out\npictures of her new granddaughter despite the twin pitfalls of gender and\nage.\xe2\x80\x9d For Clinton 2016, gender might not be a pitfall at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Hill blog: Ballot Box: \xe2\x80\x9cRepublicans tie Landrieu loss to Hillary\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/226237-republicans-tie-landrieu-loss-to-hillary>*\n\n\n\nBy Jonathan Easley\n\nDecember 6, 2014, 10:09 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nOn the heels of Sen.

If he runs, he might\nor might not emerge as a winner. But his formulation for how to think about\nwaging a successful presidential campaign suggests he already is ahead of\nsome of his potential competitors \xe2\x80\x94 in both parties.\n\n\n\nBush, the former governor of Florida, spoke last week at a Wall Street\nJournal conference in Washington. In an interview conducted by Jerry Seib,\nthe Journal\xe2\x80\x99s Washington bureau chief, he said that anyone running for\npresident should be prepared \xe2\x80\x9cto lose the primary to win the general\n[election] without violating your principles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhat Bush said is the opposite of the oft-stated idea that presidential\ncandidates run to the left or the right to win their party\xe2\x80\x99s presidential\nnomination and then scamper back to the center as best they can for the\ngeneral election. That prescription, while sometimes successful, can easily\ncontribute to cynicism among the voters, who watch and wonder whether their\npoliticians have any principles beyond the desire to win at any cost.\n\n\n\nBush offered a different concept, one grounded less to the machinations of\ntypical political campaigns and more dependent on the power of ideas and\nthe confidence to test them in the marketplace. At its core, what Bush was\nsaying is that the best candidates are those who know what they believe,\nare not afraid to take risks to articulate those convictions and, in some\nmeasure, use their campaign to help redefine their party rather than\nbecoming a prisoner of party orthodoxies and constituencies.\n\n\n\nBush said last week that he would decide \xe2\x80\x9cin short order\xe2\x80\x9d whether to run.\nAdvisers say there is nothing imminent, that his timetable is the same as\nit has been all year: get through the midterms and then sit down with his\nfamily before making a final decision.\n\n\n\nBush\xe2\x80\x99s strengths and weaknesses as a possible presidential candidate are\nwell known. He governed effectively and conservatively in a populous and\ndiverse state for eight years. But he\xe2\x80\x99s been out of office since early\n2007, in which time both his party and the nature of political campaigns\nhave changed. He\xe2\x80\x99s the son and brother of former presidents, so he\xe2\x80\x99s seen\nthe inside of two different presidencies. But the Bush name remains a mixed\nblessing with the general electorate.\n\n\n\nBush\xe2\x80\x99s major liabilities in the nomination battle would be his positions on\nimmigration reform and education reform. He is at odds with many\nconservatives because he supports a path to some kind of legal status for\nmillions of illegal immigrants and because of his advocacy for Common Core\neducational standards.\n\n\n\nBush sounded as if he knows what he would talk about if he ran \xe2\x80\x94 from\neducation reform and entitlement reform to an overhaul of the tax system\nand a paring of the regulatory apparatus to what he called an economically\ndriven reform of immigration laws \xe2\x80\x94 and what he thinks about them.\n\n\n\nBeing prepared to lose the nomination in order to win the general election\ndoes not necessarily mean an in-your-face campaign designed to poke his\nconservative critics unnecessarily. Instead, presumably it means a\nwillingness to stand his ground on issues where he believes he is closer to\nthe views of the broader electorate without, as he put it, violating his\nconservative principles.\n\n\n\nBush for a long time has been prodding his party to put its stamp on the\nfuture rather than looking to its past. He was an early debunker of the\nwave of Reagan nostalgia that took hold during the 2008 presidential\nprimaries \xe2\x80\x94 the notion that a return to Reaganism was the path to success\nin presidential elections. Bush argued that the party needed to adapt its\nconservative principles to a new time and a new America.\n\n\n\nRepublicans just won the majority in the House and Senate; they control 31\ngovernorships and have unified control in almost two dozen states. What\nthey lack is the White House. As Bush said last week, Republicans are past\nthe point of having to make a point. They need to show they know how to\ngovern. Some governors are doing that. But this has been particularly\nchallenging in Washington for a party that has come to power as the\nanti-Washington party.\n\n\n\nBush\xe2\x80\x99s comments provide a contrast to those of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who\nis going through the same decision-making process as he is. He has been\nmore open about his considerations and is seemingly farther along in\nknowing what he would make his campaign about and how it would conduct it,\nshould he decide to run.\n\n\n\nAt a time of political dysfunction and deep public dissatisfaction, neither\nparty needs to offer a nominee wedded to ideological orthodoxy. Being\nrespectful of a party\xe2\x80\x99s constituencies and coalition is not the same as\nbeing beholden to them. Nomination battles, however, tend to require\ncandidates to adhere even more closely to those orthodoxies. Clinton is\nbuffeted by the debate within her party about just how populist the\nDemocrats should be in 2016. If she runs, she owes voters an explanation of\nher true convictions.\n\n\n\nIn the establishment wing of the Republican Party, there is enthusiasm for\na Bush candidacy; in more conservative precincts, there will be opposition.\nSome Republicans believe that if Bush were to announce his candidacy, he\nwould become the front-runner for the nomination by dint of his name, his\nexperience and his presumed capacity to raise money.\n\n\n\nSurveys of Republicans suggest obstacles. Bush is hardly a dominant figure\nin those measures. The undeclared field of candidates is so fractured right\nnow that no one among the prospective candidates, save for Mitt Romney,\ncomes close to getting even a fifth of the GOP support.\n\n\n\nIn the exit polls from last month\xe2\x80\x99s midterms, voters were asked to rate\nvarious prospective presidential candidates. Bush did worse than Clinton\nbut better than any of the other Republicans tested \xe2\x80\x94 Chris Christie, Rick\nPerry and Rand Paul. Still, just 49 percent of Republicans who voted last\nmonth (and just 25 percent of independents) said they thought he would make\na good president. At least he had more positives than negatives from\nmembers of his own party \xe2\x80\x94 something the other three tested could not say.\n\n\n\nMany months ago, Bush said he would consider running if he could do it\n\xe2\x80\x9cjoyfully.\xe2\x80\x9d What he said last week was slightly different, that what would\nbe important would be to find a way to \xe2\x80\x9clift people\xe2\x80\x99s spirits and not get\nsucked into the vortex,\xe2\x80\x9d according to a Journal account of his appearance.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to believe that, in the often toxic environment of today\xe2\x80\x99s\npolitics, anyone could run for president joyfully. Avoiding the vortex of\nnegativity is a more realistic goal. Bush has clearly been thinking about\nall this as he nears a decision. He sounds almost ready for the next step.\nBut will he take it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*CNN: \xe2\x80\x9cThe \'Inside Politics\' forecast: Friends say Hillary leaning towards\na later 2016 decision\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/07/politics/ip-forecast-hillary-later/>*\n\n\n\nBy John King\n\nDecember 7, 2014\n\n\n\nWashington (CNN) -- Internal tensions in both political parties dominated\nthis week\'s final trip around the \'Inside Politics\' table.\n\n\n\nJohn King and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each\nSunday to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days,\nweeks and months ahead.\n\n\n\n1. Seething over Schumer\n\n\n\nLook for more open battles between the Obama White House and congressional\nDemocrats as we move into 2015.\n\n\n\nJulie Hirschfeld Davis of The New York Times described White House\nofficials as "privately still pretty angry" at New York Democratic Sen.\nChuck Schumer for saying the President was wrong to prioritize health care\nlegislation over other issues in his first term.\n\n\n\nAnd there is also bad blood after the White House pulled the plug on Senate\nMajority Leader Harry Reid\'s effort to negotiate a tax package with\ncongressional Republicans.\n\n\n\n"I think we\'re going to see in the weeks and months ahead a real sort of\ndivision starting to emerge, especially as the White House starts to really\npress on trade, which is an issue that divides Democrats," said Hirschfeld\nDavis. "I think we\'re going to see that daylight get even brighter."\n\n\n\n2. Boehner\'s secret weapon\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner makes clear he has no interest in shutting the\ngovernment down, and is no question in stronger political shape than he was\nin some past battles with the conservative grass roots.\n\n\n\nBut stronger doesn\'t mean he doesn\'t appreciate a little help, and Robert\nCosta of The Washington Post took us inside efforts by the newest member of\nthe leadership team to help keep the GOP troops in line.\n\n\n\nAt issue: the work of House Whip Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana.\n\n\n\n"He has been able to finagle this thing for the last few days and make sure\nthat conservatives feel like they are part of the process in the House\nleadership and that they\'re not looking for a showdown the way they did a\nyear ago when they got a shutdown over health care reform," said Costa.\n\n\n\n3. Room for a "nerd" in the GOP 2016 pack?\n\n\n\nThere are a half dozen GOP governors mulling 2016 presidential runs,\nincluding the CEOs of Texas, Indiana, Louisiana, Ohio, Wisconsin and New\nJersey.\n\n\n\nBut Jonathan Martin of The New York Times says keep an eye on the\nself-described "nerd" who was just re-elected in the blue state of Michigan.\n\n\n\nMartin talked to Snyder when he was in Washington this past week getting an\naward from Governing Magazine.\n\n\n\n"It\'s this great dance, John, as you know," said Martin. "You talk to these\npoliticians and they are waiting for you to ask the question and finally\nyou do: \'So do you want to run for president?\'"\n\n\n\n"And of course he has to answer that right now he is fully focused on\nMichigan and telling the Michigan story and chief in that is that the\nunemployment rate has dropped in that state that was so hard hit during the\nrecession. But he is someone that at the very least wants to be in the mix\nfor 2016."\n\n\n\n4. A 2016 litmus test for Christie?\n\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama\'s executive actions on immigration are not only\ninfuriating key conservatives in Congress -- they are triggering legal\nchallenges from many states, and in a way that could ripple into the 2016\npresidential race.\n\n\n\nNia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post notes that the governors of\nIndiana, Wisconsin and Louisiana are signatories to the suit, as is the GOP\ngovernor of South Carolina. All factor into 2016 talk of potential\ncandidates or maybe vice presidential picks on the GOP side.\n\n\n\nBut Henderson notes one glaring name not on the list: New Jersey Gov. Chris\nChristie.\n\n\n\n"Christie has said so far that he doesn\'t want to talk at all about\nimmigration reform -- he won\'t do that unless he decides to run," said\nHenderson. "But it is a question of whether or not this lawsuit will be\nkind of a litmus test going forward in 2016 and whether or not he is going\nto be pressured to sign on and how he\'s going to navigate that."\n\n\n\n5. Hillary 2016 announcement -- maybe later\n\n\n\nThere is nothing certain when it comes to Clintonland, but the safer bet\nappears to be later rather than sooner as to when we will get official word\nabout her 2016 intentions.\n\n\n\nThe timing debate has been going on for months. Some allies believe an\nearly announcement -- as in by the end of 2014 - is best, to end the doubts\nand bring early order to the organization.\n\n\n\nOthers say there is little reason to rush, noting the lack of a formidable\nopponent and the added scrutiny and requirements that come with being a\ncandidate in the eyes of the law.\n\n\n\nThe former secretary of state is holding meetings to discuss her team, but\nis described by friends as not in too much of a hurry to make a final\ndecision and then let it be known. So, for now anyway, the betting is she\nwill wait a bit into 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sec. Clinton\'s upcoming appearances as reported online.
