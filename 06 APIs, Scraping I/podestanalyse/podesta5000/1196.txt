Voter caging, however, is notoriously\nunreliable. If it is treated (unjustifiably) as the sole basis for\ndetermining that a voter is ineligible or does not live at the address at\nwhich he or she registered, it can lead to the unwarranted purge or\nchallenge of eligible voters. \x85Moreover, the practice has often been\ntargeted at minority voters, making the effects even more pernicious.\n[Brennan Center, \x93A Guide to Voter\nCaging<http://onewisconsinnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=u4BDvtyVviuLsXQOyXdpSA..>,\x94\n6/29/07]\n\nOne Wisconsin Now obtained an audio recording it has verified as authentic\nfrom a June 12, 2010 meeting between the leaders of the state\x92s Tea Party\nmovement, led by Tim Dake, head of the GrandSons of Liberty. Dake serves as\na regular spokesperson for Wisconsin\x92s Tea Party organizations and is widely\nviewed as the movement\x92s Wisconsin leader. The full audio, available at One\nWisconsin Now\x92s voter protection website, www.SaveWisconsinsVote2010.org,\ndetails the plans for a coordinated voter suppression efforts, which is\nanchored in challenging voter eligibility on Election Day this November 2.\n\n*THE PLOT*\nAccording to the statements made on the recordings, Dake lays out the plans,\ndetailing contact between himself and Reince Preibus, the Republican Party\nof Wisconsin Chair and Mark Block, state director of Americans for\nProsperity-Wisconsin:\n\n   - The Republican Party of Wisconsin will use its \x93Voter Vault\x94 state-wide\n   voter file to compile a list of minority and student voters in targeted\n   Wisconsin communities.\n   - Americans for Prosperity will use this list to send mail to these\n   voters indicating the voter must call and confirm their registration\n   information, and telling them if they do not call the number provided they\n   could be removed from the voter lists.\n   - The Tea Party organizations will recruit and place individuals as\n   official poll workers in selected municipalities in order to be able to make\n   the challenges as official poll workers.\n   - On Election Day, these organizations will then \x93make use\x94 of any\n   postcards that are returned as undeliverable to challenge voters at the\n   polls, utilizing law enforcement, as well as attorneys trained and provided\n   by the RPW, to support their challenges.\n\nAccording to the recordings, Dake told the assembled Tea Party members he\nleads:\n\nSo, what we\x92re hoping is that the various groups in the coalition plus\nAmericans for Prosperity and Mark Block, who has been in on this, and the\nRepublican Party, and this is coming all the way from the top: Reince\nPriebus has said, \x93We\x92re in.\x94 And there\x92s a reason why these guys are\nvolunteering to work with us. They have access to what they call Voter\nVault, you know the records of voting. They can go in there and look for\nlapsed voters. They can go in and compare lists of voters and say, \x93Oh look\nat this. This person is registered in this county, this county, this county,\nand this county.\x94 And do something about this. So we\x92re talking about a\nbroad based support behind this idea. What they\x92re offering is training.\n\nDake continues in the recording to outline the plan:\n\n[RPW is] offering to do the training; it\x92s not going to cost anything, but\nwhat we\x92re looking at is statewide getting our groups involved, getting\npeople, like my group has a 2,700 person email list. We want to hit that and\nsee how many of these people we can get involved in this one project. The\nidea being at some point to go in on September 14 and November 2 and have\nthese people involved and doing poll watching and checking. There are some\nconsultants that have offered to step up, \x93We\x92re Watching\x94 is stepping up;\nattorneys from the Republican Party.\n\nLater in his presentation, Dake adds:\n\nOkay, poll watchers what you can do is you can call in a lawyer. The\nRepublican Party, this is one of the things they\x92re offering, they\x92re saying\nthey\x92ll have their lawyers standing by so that if you call, let\x92s say you\x92re\npoll watching in say Hales Corners and you see something really fraudulent,\nthey will send a lawyer out right away and be able to say, \x93Here\x92s the deal,\nhere\x92s the law, this is what we expect.\x94 Bring the police in and make your\ncomplaint that sort of thing. So, we\x92ve got that. You can challenge voters\nthrough the precinct captains. This is one of the things they will teach you\nhow to do and anybody can challenge a voter. And since the voter law did not\nget passed this year that could hit you with $100,000 and three years for\nunsuccessfully challenging a voter, we can still do this.\n\nDake is interrupted at this point by an unidentified coalition member who\nshouts, \x93Hallelujah.\x94 Dake adds, \x93Yes, everybody gets to take credit for\nthat.\x94 He goes on to outline Americans for Prosperity-Wisconsin\x92s role and\nhow to target law enforcement:\n\nSo we\x92re talking about AFP is willing to fund doing a mass mailing to\nregistered voters on this, about getting them involved with this, making\nsure that their information is current, because people periodically need to\ngo back and check. I found, before we bought the house we lived in. Four\nyears ago I lived in a brand new condo, the first people to live in it. I\nwent to vote and found twelve people registered at my address. My wife and I\nare the only people to have lived there. Yet, there were twelve people\nregistered to vote. I couldn\x92t believe it. They said, \x93Wow, you must have a\nbig family.\x94 And I\x92m looking at names and going, \x93No, there\x92s nobody named\n\x91Nguyen\x92 and \x91Din\x92 and that sort of thing in my family.\x94 So that\x92s the kind\nof thing we need to clean up and people need to be aware of. Go in and check\nwho else is registered at your place and ask to have them tossed off. Work\nwith the media on this and district attorneys. Try to get them involved\nearly and fired up about this and say look, \x93We know you\x92re shorthanded,\nwe\x92re hands, we\x92re boots on the ground. We will help you, just bring the\nweight of the law behind us.\x94 One of the things we\x92re going to do is take\nthese addresses that people give and we want to send out a postcard that\nsays, \x93You need to call and confirm this. And if you haven\x92t called, well\nthen it could get tossed out.\x94 We\x92re also looking for when you send these\ncards out is they\x92ll come back if it is an undeliverable address.\n\n*THE QUOTES:* Among some of the discussion also captured on the audio:\n\n"[Y]ou run into the racial thing. You have people screaming, \x91Oh, you\x92re\ndenying the minorities the right to vote.\x92 No., we\x92re denying their right to\nvote multiple times." [Tim Dake, GrandSons of Liberty]\n\n"Work with the media on this and the district attorneys. Try to get them\ninvolved early and fired up about this and say look, \x91We know you\x92re\nshorthanded, we\x92re hands, we\x92re boots on the ground. We will help you, just\nbring the weight of the law behind us."[Tim Dake, GrandSons of Liberty]\n\n"I was a poll watcher from 2000 to 2006 and if you\x92ve got a university in\nyour county, or your city, students will come down in droves and then they\nwill all vouch for each other. I had this one kid come in five times with\nfive separate groups of people and this person brings in students, they\x92re\nusually from Minnesota or wherever up by Eau Claire, and you go, \x91Do you\nlive here?\x92 \x91Yes.\x92 \x91Well do you have anything that shows your address?\x92\n\x91No.\x92 Then that one student says, \x91I vouch for her, I vouch for him.\x92 And\nthey all vote." [Shane McVey, Eau Claire Tea Party]\n\n"This is apparently a very effective deterrent, just having people standing\nthere.  Poll watching tends to discourage people when they know someone is\nlooking." [Tim Dake, GrandSons of Liberty]\n\n"It\x92s just having people who have the courage and conviction because in our\nsociety we have been \x91wussified\x92....  [T]hey try to claim intimidation and\nthey\'ll bring a whole bunch of people.  If you do challenge a vote like\nthree people will surround you and they\x92ll all start getting in your face\nand threatening you with legal action and all that stuff.  You just have to\nbe strong willed and be able to take that stuff.\x94 [Shane McVey, Eau Claire\nTea Party]\n\n*THE REQUEST FOR INVESTIGATION*\n\nThe possible illegality of the RPW-AFP-WI-Tea Party plot that One Wisconsin\nNow lays out in the requests for investigation to law enforcement officials\nassert:\n\n   - Federal law prohibits racially targeted caging operations. Statements\n   made during the June 12 meeting make clear that race is a motivating factor\n   in the planned caging and challenge effort.  Any efforts to deter qualified\n   electors from voting based on their race must be immediately investigated\n   and, if substantiated, stopped. [42 U.S.C. \xa7\xa7 1973(a); 1973gg]\n   - The organizations\x92 Election Day plans could put the state at possible\n   risk of violating federal law. Federal law makes clear that elector\n   challenges cannot be based solely on returned mail. The organizations\x92 plans\n   to recruit individuals to become poll workers in order to conduct challenges\n   based on the returned mail would result in individuals acting unlawfully\n   under color of state law. [42 U.S.C. \xa7 1973gg; Tiryak v. Jordan, 472 F.\n   Supp. 822, 824 (E.D. PA 1979)]\n   - Federal law also makes clear that private actors are similarly\n   prohibited from challenging voters based solely on undelivered mail. Even if\n   a challenge comes from a volunteer election observer, the challenge is\n   unlawful if it is based on the voter\x92s failure to respond to the mailing.\n   Any challenge to an elector\x92s eligibility based on such unreliable grounds\n   is an abuse of the right to challenge and violates state and federal law,\n   subjecting the challenger to removal and other sanctions. [42 U.S.C. \xa7\n   1973gg]\n   - Disturbingly, the mail program described by the Tea Party members will\n   contain false and misleading information. The Tea Party plans to tell\n   certain voters that their name may be removed if they fail to call the\n   telephone number provided. It would be illegal to remove a voter from the\n   statewide database based on this reason. [42 U.S.C. \xa7 1973gg]\n   - The deceptive nature of the planned mailing is particularly troubling\n   because the mailing described would almost certainly would appear to be an\n   official governmental mailing. For the same reasons that it is unlawful to\n   use official attire to challenge a voter at the polls on Election Day, it is\n   unlawful to send a mailing that appears to be an official action of the\n   governmental. [18 U.S.C. \xa7 242; 42 U.S.C. \xa7 1973i(b)]\n\n\x93Based on our discussions with legal counsel, we believe certain statements\nmade at this Tea Party meeting clearly outline a plan by these organizations\nto engage in what may potentially be illegal conduct,\x94 said Ross. \x93The voter\ncaging and challenge plans outlined by the Tea Party could result in an\napparently illegal effort to deter qualified citizens from voting. As\ndescribed, their plan would deter qualified citizens from voting in a manner\nthat is coercive and without sufficient basis. All of these activities raise\nserious concerns and should be investigated further to determine whether\nillegal activity has occurred.\x94\n\nThe full recordings, as well as a transcript and other information, are\navailable at One Wisconsin Now\x92s voter protection website:\nhttp://www.SaveWisconsinsVote2010.org.\n\n# # #\n\nOne Wisconsin Now is a statewide communications network specializing in\neffective earned media and online organizing to advance progressive\nleadership and values.\n\nMedia Inquiries: (608) 204-0677 | Email: own@onewisconsinnow.org\n\nOne Wisconsin Now<http://onewisconsinnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=BlS6gTHQwe30pOhh5nXX3w..>|\nUnsubscribe<http://www.pnstate.org/site/CO?i=on4KMXn_xrbSvlK6PYPaxtFdD2rLHzH-&cid=0>\n\nOne Wisconsin Now. \xa9 2010 All rights reserved.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
