My job, pure and simple, is to make this community a better place to\nlive and work, by making it easier for the people of Surprise to support\ntheir families, put a roof over their heads, educate and care for their\nchildren, and access health care.\n\n\n\nIn a perfect world, this would be an easy task. Well-paying jobs would be\nwidely available, high-quality housing would be affordable to all, public\nschools would be adequately funded and provide a top-notch education for\nevery student, and proper health care would be accessible to anyone who\nneeds it.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, that is not the world we live in. The reality is that people\nare having a hard time finding good jobs, making ends meet, and paying for\nthe basic necessities like housing, education and health care. And while I\nwork day in and day out to fix these problems for the people of Surprise,\nthey are too complex to be solved by the government alone.\n\n\n\nAddressing these tricky issues requires an \xe2\x80\x9call hands on deck\xe2\x80\x9d approach. To\nreally make a difference, we have to put our heads together with members of\nthe community, business leaders and the government to come up with\ncreative, multi-faceted solutions.\n\n\n\nThat is what we are doing at the Greater Phoenix Economic Council, where I\nserve as a member of the board. We are a private-public partnership\nrepresenting 23 communities in the Maricopa County area and more than 160\nprivate investors. Our purpose is to attract businesses to the area to grow\nour economy, create jobs, and make Maricopa County a better place to live,\nby working on behalf of businesses looking to relocate and expand.\n\n\n\nAnd we are not in this alone. After the 2008 financial crisis, the Obama\nadministration made it a top priority to stimulate economic growth and\ncreate jobs. The most influential leaders in America \xe2\x80\x94 from the White House\nto the departments of State and Commerce \xe2\x80\x94 have become advocates on behalf\nof U.S. companies to create jobs here at home.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton dedicates a chapter of her newly released book, \xe2\x80\x9cHard\nChoices,\xe2\x80\x9d to her role as an advocate for American businesses while she\nserved as secretary of state, writing, \xe2\x80\x9cI was determined to do everything I\ncould to help American businesses and workers seize more of the legitimate\nopportunities already available.\xe2\x80\x9d As she explains in the chapter, \xe2\x80\x9cDuring\nmy travels I often made a pitch for an American business or product, like\nGE in Algeria. For example, in October 2009, I visited the Boeing Design\nCenter in Moscow because Boeing had been trying to secure a contract for\nnew planes with the Russians. I made the case that Boeing\xe2\x80\x99s jets set the\nglobal gold standard, and, after I left, our embassy kept at it. In 2010,\nthe Russians agreed to buy fifty 737s, for almost $4 billion, which\ntranslated into thousands of American jobs. And our efforts weren\xe2\x80\x99t just on\nbehalf of big companies like Boeing or GE \xe2\x80\x94 we also advocated for small and\nmedium-sized businesses across our country trying to go global.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe International Trade Administration\xe2\x80\x99s Advocacy Center, part of the\nDepartment of Commerce, also serves as an advocate for American businesses.\nLast August, the Advocacy Center helped Boeing win a $1.6 billion contract\nwith South Korea to sell them 36 Apache helicopters made right here in the\nPhoenix area in nearby Mesa. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker recently\nvisited the Boeing facility in Mesa to see this success story for herself.\n\n\n\nIn the Phoenix area, these efforts have been vital to our economy, with\nBoeing employing so many of our friends and neighbors. The Mesa facility\nalone employs 4,700 people.\n\n\n\nThis type of collaboration between the government and the private sector\nhas paid off for the people of Arizona. Here in Surprise, we have become a\nrecognizable presence at the state Capitol and a voice on economic\ndevelopment here at home, in the region and even in Washington D.C., thanks\nin part to Secretary Clinton and Secretary Pritzker and the work they have\ndone on behalf of one of the area\xe2\x80\x99s largest employers. Together, we are\nhelping improve the lives of the people of Surprise \xe2\x80\x94 just as I was elected\nto do \xe2\x80\x94 as well as people across the state and this great nation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*CNN: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton\'s unpaid warriors\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/08/politics/clintons-unpaid-warriors/>*\n\n\n\nBy Dan Merica\n\nAugust 8, 2014, 2:25 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nTaj Magruder has never voted for Hillary Clinton. He has no connection to\nher paid staff. And he is not collecting a paycheck from a cadre of groups\nanticipating a Clinton presidential run in 2016.\n\n\n\nAll of this bothers him.\n\n\n\nMagruder, a 23-year-old "Clinton-ologist" from Pennsylvania, devotes much\nof his online life to supporting, defending and responding to her every\nmove.\n\n\n\nIn what he calls his "own little war room" -- his computer and Twitter\naccount -- the Pennsylvania state Senate employee has carved out a space as\none of Clinton\'s most ardent unpaid supporters.\n\n\n\n"I have yet to vote for Hillary," said Magruder, who was too young to cast\na ballot the last time she was on one. "I am really looking forward to\nfixing that in the coming years."\n\n\n\nMagruder is an unsalaried Clinton warrior. And he isn\'t alone.\n\n\n\nAll over the Internet, bloggers and their circles of friends with no\nbacking from the Clinton orbit defend the former first lady from attacks.\n\n\n\nWhile their defenses don\'t have the weight of a Clinton spokesperson or a\nformer top aide, they are influential in their small community of friends\nand family. And they are standing up for the person they hope becomes the\nnext President.\n\n\n\n"I am very, very passionate obviously about Hillary," Magruder said, if\nthat wasn\'t already clear. "I just want to make sure that Hillary has, if\nshe does run, a kind of presence on social media that she hasn\'t always\nhad."\n\n\n\nMagruder is dogged and devout.\n\n\n\nHe regularly tussles with reporters.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t know if Maggie Haberman still hates me or not," he said referring\nto a Politico reporter he sparred with over a story.\n\n\n\n[TAJ MAGRUDER TWEETS]\n\n\n\nAnd he touts Clinton\'s many appearances.\n\n\n\n"She was so good last night," he tweeted after Clinton\'s sit-down on the\nColbert Report.\n\n\n\nWhy does he do this?\n\n\n\n"When I see a story that is like, \'yuck,\' I feel like I should just stick\nup for my girl," he said with a laugh.\n\n\n\nSince May 2012, Magruder has tweeted nearly 30,000 times. Most of them --\nespecially recently -- have been about Clinton.\n\n\n\nAnd while he only has 780 followers, many of those include reporters\nfollowing Clinton and representatives from the groups looking to help her\nif she runs again.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s unpaid army does far more than tweet. Some, like Still 4 Hill,\nhave devoted years to blogging about her every move.\n\n\n\nSince 2008, Still 4 Hill -- who keeps her identity private because of her\npaid employment -- has kept detailed records of Clinton\'s comings and\ngoings, including nearly every speech she delivered as secretary of state.\n\n\n\nThe process, is admittedly, consuming.\n\n\n\n"You have to find ways to squeeze it in," she said. "I cheat a little bit\n(and blog) during a lunch hour or something like that. But most of the time\nI do it at night."\n\n\n\nStill 4 Hill started her blog after Clinton ended her presidential campaign\nin 2008.\n\n\n\nShe began to write about Clinton\'s events at the State Department and once\nClinton stepped down as America\'s top diplomat in 2013, Still 4 Hill began\nwriting about Clinton on the paid speaking circuit.\n\n\n\n"I see it as documentation," Still 4 Hill said about her blog. "I want to\nbe able to go back and look at this speech or look at that speech."\n\n\n\nAmid all the glow for Clinton, there is also pushback against her critics.\n\n\n\nWhen the Washington Post\'s conservative blogger Jennifer Rubin wrote a\nlengthy critique of Clinton\'s time at State, Still 4 Hill responded to what\nshe called "repetitive and tiresome... empty bloviating" from Rubin.\n\n\n\nThere is more to the online response, though: People like Magruder and\nStill 4 Hill have received a little notoriety for their persistence.\n\n\n\nAsk people within the Clinton universe about Magruder and they laugh about\nhis exuberance.\n\n\n\nThough he was never paid, Ready for Hillary sent the Clinton devotee to a\nfinance meeting earlier this year to act as an example of a "grassroots\nsupporter."\n\n\n\nStill 4 Hill\'s blog receives upwards of 10,000 hits a week. As of late --\ngiven Clinton\'s book tour and regular appearances -- the blog can gets as\nmany as of 2,500 clicks a day.\n\n\n\nAnd when Still 4 Hill met Clinton at a New Jersey book singing this year,\nshe was sure to mention her blog.\n\n\n\nAccording to blogger, Clinton responded, "Still 4 Hill! I love it. Yeah, I\nlove it."\n\n\n\nThere is a downside to all of this, too.\n\n\n\nBoth Magruder and Still 4 Hill are building a online record of their\nthoughts and feelings about Clinton and that record -- at some point --\ncould come back to haunt them.\n\n\n\nWhat\'s more, in the anything goes nature of a campaign, comments made by\nClinton followers and fans can blow up into bigger stories.\n\n\n\nWhat happens when those fans have years of logs and comments that\nopposition groups could cull?\n\n\n\n"To the extent that the actors join Hillary\'s campaign or official groups\nthat support Hillary\'s campaign, their views and statements online become\nrelevant," Tim Miller, executive director of America Rising, an\nanti-Clinton super PAC, told CNN.\n\n\n\nStill 4 Hill\'s post-2008 actions seemed to recognize this.\n\n\n\nShortly after Clinton conceded defeat to Barack Obama after a bitter\nprimary battle, the blog took a negative, sometimes anti-Obama turn, Still\n4 Hill told CNN.\n\n\n\nAfter giving it some thought -- and after Clinton patched up her\nrelationship with him -- the blogger decided to delete some of those posts.\n\n\n\n"I am reading her book now and when I read the first chapter it was like\ntearing a scab off a wound of something," Still 4 Hill said, capturing how\nshe is still hurt over that campaign. "That primary season was so brutal.\n... I removed a lot of the pages from June 2008 to the general election\ncampaign."\n\n\n\nBut Clinton\'s previous run might not be her last. So what if she runs\nagain, how much work are these devotees willing to commit? And is all of\ntheir Internet devotion an audition for something bigger?\n\n\n\n"I would love it if a role is available for me. If there is one, I would\nlove it," Magruder said. "But whether or not I get an official role won\'t\nstop me from doing work on social media."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Capital New York: \xe2\x80\x9cThe (Hillary) Beat goes on\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/08/8549573/hillary-beat-goes>*\n\n\n\nBy Jeremy Barr and Alex Weprin\n\nAugust 8, 2014, 2:26 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nFormer Secretary of State, Senator and First Lady Hillary Clinton has not\ndeclared any sort of candidacy for 2016, but the group of reporters\ndedicated full-time by news outlets to follow her and report on her keeps\ngrowing every month.\n\n\n\nThe latest addition is Alex Seitz-Wald, who started at MSNBC digital this\npast month to cover \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton and any Dems who may run against her,\xe2\x80\x9d\nas he put it on Twitter.\n\n\n\nSeitz-Wald, a former reporter for National Journal and Salon, joins a long\nlist of reporters on the beat, like Annie Karni at the New York Daily News,\nJonathan Allen at Bloomberg, Maggie Haberman at POLITICO, Ruby Cramer at\nBuzzfeed, Amy Chozick at The New York Times, Maeve Reston at The Los\nAngeles Times and Brianna Keilar at CNN, among others.\n\n\n\nIn late May The Washington Post announced that Anne Gearan would be joining\nits politics desk to \xe2\x80\x9crenew her focus on covering Clinton and her seemingly\ninevitable second try for the presidency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nLanguage like \xe2\x80\x9cseemingly inevitable\xe2\x80\x9d seems to suggest that the decision to\ndevote a reporter full-time to Clinton is a calculation meant to put them\nahead of the curve when (or if) she declares her candidacy; and inevitably,\nthese announcements provoke \xe2\x80\x9ctsks\xe2\x80\x9d from politics-weary corners of the\nInternet: Why are you covering a candidate that isn\xe2\x80\x99t even running?\n\n\n\nBut the real reasons for the surge in the Hillary beat are more nuanced.\nFor one thing, publishers and broadcasters have long since learned to pay\nattention to what the audience does\xe2\x80\x94not what they say. And Clinton stories\nare still great business, whether her run is inevitable or not.\n\n\n\nRisa Heller, who handled communications for New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and\nformer Gov. David Patterson, suggested that intense reader interest in\nHillary Clinton, and a buzzing from the political press, is nothing new. As\nsuch, Heller said she\xe2\x80\x99s not surprised that so many news organizations have\ndesignated a reporter to cover her.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assume what these news organizations are saying is, \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re going to be\nat the front of this, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll write a bunch of interesting stories that\npeople are going to read, and if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run, then what do we have to\ndo lose?\xe2\x80\x9d Heller said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere seems to be a pretty large appetite for Clinton stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven if she decides not to run, Clinton is a great story on the merits,\nand she\xe2\x80\x99s at the nexus right now of the conversation about the future of\nthe Democratic Party,\xe2\x80\x9d Buzzfeed political editor Katherine Miller told\nCapital. \xe2\x80\x9cRuby\xe2\x80\x99s telling that story, and will follow it wherever it goes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMost importantly, the possibility of a Clinton run in the minds of the\npublic make her a central figure in determining the future of a party that\nwill have just come off a challenging two-term presidency.\n\n\n\nWashington Post senior politics editor Steven Ginsberg said it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csilly\xe2\x80\x9d to\nsuggest that the paper\xe2\x80\x99s Hillary coverage would be a wash if she decides\nnot to mount a campaign.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter what she decides, she is without question the biggest factor in\nthe race right now, for both Democrats and Republicans,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\nalso a major figure outside the presidential contest and of intense\ninterest to readers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nTimes reporter Amy Chozick has been covering Hillary Clinton and her famous\nfamily for just over a year now, which makes her the veteran of the H.R.C.\nbeat team.\n\n\n\nTimes political editor and Washington bureau chief Carolyn Ryan told\nCapital, it would be \xe2\x80\x9cderelict\xe2\x80\x9d not to assign someone to Clinton.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a formidable force in American politics and a part of an\nextraordinary political family,\xe2\x80\x9d Ryan said.\n\n\n\nAnd yet not everyone who fits that description gets covered. Why Hillary?\n\n\n\nThomas Edsall, long-time Washington Post politics reporter who now teaches\nat Columbia University, considered the question.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, but am not 100 percent sure, that the early assignment to full\ntime coverage of H.R.C. before she has announced is unprecedented,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the gamble that she will be the nominee after facing little opposition\nproves true, one plus is that she will get a fairly complete examination by\nthe press, a process that normally depends on opposition research by\ncompetitors for the nomination. She is, of course, already getting a\nthorough vetting by the R.N.C.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut Edsall also saw two ways the strategy could, potentially, backfire on\nthese outlets.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA reporter in this situation needs to balance the need for ongoing access\nwith the obligation to disclose negative findings,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is true\nof any assignment, but particularly true in the case of coverage of one\nperson and her entourage. Does this reporter pass on tips to colleagues or\ndoes the reporter do a negative story him or herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Newsmax: \xe2\x80\x9cClintons Support Brooklyn as Host of \'16 Democratic Convention\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/DNC-Democratic-Convention-2016-Brooklyn/2014/08/08/id/587789/>*\n\n\n\nBy John Blosser\n\nAugust 8, 2014, 6:23 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has picked up some heavy-hitter support\nin his drive to grab the 2016 Democratic National Convention for Brooklyn \xe2\x80\x94\nformer President Bill Clinton and current Democratic front-runner Hillary\nClinton.\n\n\n\nThe New York Times reports that insiders say the Clintons approve of\nBrooklyn for the major event. Onetime Clinton advisers, including Gabrielle\nFialkoff, finance director for Hillary Clinton\'s 2000 Senate campaign, and\nother Clinton backers, like financier Alan Patricof, have gotten onboard\nwith de Blasio in an attempt to sway the DNC to bring the convention to New\nYork.\n\n\n\nDe Blasio termed it a "perfect scenario" for Brooklyn to host the\nnominating event, given that the former first lady was once a senator from\nNew York, her husband accepted the Democratic nomination at Madison Square\nGarden in 1992, and, should Clinton score the nomination as many expect\nwill happen, it would serve as a "homecoming," insiders told the Times.\n\n\n\nShould Brooklyn win the convention, New York taxpayers would shell out $8.1\nmillion and the city has plans to raise another $132 million in donations,\naccording to a 49-page proposal de Blasio presented to the DNC.\n\n\n\nThe convention would be held at the Barclays Center, home of the Brooklyn\nNets, and has won the support of another prominent New Yorker, Nets center\nJason Collins, the first openly gay player in the NBA. who told Politico at\nan event Monday, "That\'d be awesome," Collins told Politico at an event\nMonday. "I think it\'d be a lot of fun to see the DNC there."\n\n\n\nNot so fast, New York.\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Michael Nutter wants the convention too, and told the\nDaily News, "There is only one city in this country where the Declaration\nof Independence was created. There is only one Liberty Bell. It\'s in\nPhiladelphia. Those are just facts."\n\n\n\nHe\'s citing the ease of transportation and number of hotel rooms readily\nclose to the Wells Fargo Center, where the convention could be held. Even\nde Blasio notes the difficulties of transporting delegates around New York,\nsince a dearth of hotel rooms in Brooklyn would mean that most delegates\nwould be housed in Manhattan and ferried to Barclay\'s.\n\n\n\nFormer Pennsylvania Gov. Edward Rendell told the Times, "How would you like\nto transport in the middle of rush hour thousands of delegates from midtown\nto Brooklyn?"\n\n\n\nAlong with Philadelphia, other cities in the running are Birmingham, Ala.,\nand Columbus, Ohio.

According to the New York Times, the mayor "made sure he had the\nClintons\' blessing" before throwing Brooklyn into the running (with this\ncorny video). It\'s almost like they expect to be there or something.\n\n\n\nMadison Square Garden hosted Bill Clinton\'s nomination in 1992, and one\ncould get the sense that Hillary feels \xe2\x80\x94 what\'s the word? \xe2\x80\x94 inevitable.\nBoth Clintons "are said to be encouraging Mayor Bill de Blasio\'s efforts to\nbring the convention back to New York City, this time to Brooklyn, that\nhaven of liberal cool," the Times reports, with the caveat "that Brooklyn\ncould come across to a national audience as a progressive parody." Really?\nBrooklyn?\n\n\n\nDe Blasio, a veteran of Hillary\'s campaign for Senate, has other Clinton\ninsiders working with him on the borough\'s pitch, and reportedly said it\nwould be a "perfect scenario" for Hillary to accept the nomination in New\nYork, referring to it as a "homecoming." One of Brooklyn\'s main rivals for\nthe convention? Former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, the Times says,\nanother Clinton ally, of course.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Bill and Hillary Clinton could possibly be that politically\nna\xc3\xafve,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Rendell, who also served as Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s mayor, said in an\ninterview. \xe2\x80\x98New York is a solidly blue state that never votes Republican.\nPennsylvania is a swing state whose margins are closer and closer. Where\nwould you go?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nEither way, the Clintons win ( ... they assume).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*New York Times: \xe2\x80\x9cFear of \xe2\x80\x98Another Benghazi\xe2\x80\x99 Drove White House to\nAirstrikes in Iraq\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/world/middleeast/fear-of-another-benghazi-drove-white-house-to-airstrikes-in-iraq.html?_r=0>*\n\n\n\nBy Mark Landler, Alissa J. Rubin, Mark Mazzetti, and  Helene Cooper\n\nAugust 8, 2014\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday evening, moments after finishing a summit meeting with African\nleaders at the State Department, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\ndelivered a stark message to President Obama as they rode back to the White\nHouse in Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s limousine.\n\n\n\nThe Kurdish capital, Erbil, once an island of pro-American tranquillity,\nwas in the path of rampaging Sunni militants, the chairman, Gen. Martin E.\nDempsey, told the president. And to the west, the militants had trapped\nthousands of members of Iraqi minority groups on a barren mountaintop, with\ndwindling supplies, raising concerns about a potential genocide.\n\n\n\nWith American diplomats and business people in Erbil suddenly at risk, at\nthe American Consulate and elsewhere, Mr. Obama began a series of intensive\ndeliberations that resulted, only a day later, in his authorizing\nairstrikes on the militants, as well as humanitarian airdrops of food and\nwater to the besieged Iraqis.\n\n\n\nLooming over that discussion, and the decision to return the United States\nto a war Mr. Obama had built his political career disparaging, was the\nspecter of an earlier tragedy: the September 2012 attack on the diplomatic\nmission in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans, including\nAmbassador J. Christopher Stevens, and has become a potent symbol of\nweakness for critics of the president.\n\n\n\nAs the tension mounted in Washington, a parallel drama was playing out in\nErbil. Kurdish forces who had been fighting the militants in three nearby\nChristian villages abruptly fell back toward the gates of the city, fanning\nfears that the city might soon fall. By Thursday morning, people were\nthronging the airport, desperate for flights out of town.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe situation near Erbil was becoming more dire than anyone expected,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of\nanonymity to describe the White House\xe2\x80\x99s internal deliberations. \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nwant another Benghazi.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFor weeks, intelligence officials had been watching the militant group, the\nIslamic State in Iraq and Syria, gain in strength, replenishing its\narsenals with weapons captured both in Syria and in Iraq. But interviews\nwith multiple officials at the White House, the Pentagon, the State\nDepartment and other agencies paint a portrait of a president forced by the\nunexpectedly rapid deterioration of security in Iraq to abandon his\nlongstanding reluctance to use military force.\n\n\n\nMr. Obama, in a speech late Thursday announcing his decision, insisted this\nwas not a return to war \xe2\x80\x94 that Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s fate still ultimately rested in the\nhands of its three main groups, the Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds. But he made\nclear that he would take action to protect Americans in Erbil and Baghdad.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have an embassy in Baghdad, we have a consulate in Erbil, and we have\nto make sure that they are not threatened,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama said in an interview\non Friday with Thomas L. Friedman of The New York Times. \xe2\x80\x9cPart of the\nrationale for the announcement yesterday was an encroachment close enough\nto Erbil that it would justify us taking shots.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nStill, his decision to order F-18 fighter jets from the aircraft carrier\nGeorge H. W. Bush to carry out bombing raids on militants dramatically\nraises the risks for Mr. Obama. Unlike other times when he has made the\ndecision to commit American forces \xe2\x80\x94 the 2009 troop surge in Afghanistan,\nfor example \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Obama acted within hours.\n\n\n\nWith nearly 50 African leaders converging on Washington, the president was\nfully occupied with a week of diplomacy and salesmanship on behalf of\nAmerican companies \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention a White House dinner featuring\nentertainment by Lionel Richie. On Saturday, he and his wife, Michelle,\nwere to leave town for two weeks of vacation on Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard.\n\n\n\nWhile Mr. Obama discussed security and governance with the leaders, his\nnational security aides were huddling in the Situation Room, getting\nincreasingly dire briefings from embassy officials in Baghdad and the\nPentagon\xe2\x80\x99s Central Command, which oversees Iraq.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings reached a tipping point on Wednesday,\xe2\x80\x9d said a senior official. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\nsaw that on the mountain, the Iraqis were not able to resupply and provide\nfood and water.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBack at the White House that evening, Mr. Obama and General Dempsey\ncontinued talking in the Oval Office, joined by the chief of staff, Denis\nMcDonough; the national security adviser, Susan E. Rice; and other\nofficials. The discussion moved toward military action, one official said,\nthough Mr. Obama had not yet decided on anything, beyond airdrops.\n\n\n\nAbout 8 p.m., the meeting broke up and Mr. Obama again left the White\nHouse, an hour late, for a dinner date with his wife and a close\nconfidante, Valerie Jarrett, at an Italian restaurant in Georgetown.\n\n\n\nSix thousand miles away, in Erbil, Thursday morning broke with news that\ntwo towns just 27 miles west of the Kurdish capital, Mahmour and Gwer, had\nfallen to the militants, and that Kurdish fighters, known as pesh merga,\nhad withdrawn. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a real problem,\xe2\x80\x9d said a former Kurdish official\nwho closely tracks security issues.\n\n\n\nIn villages and small towns outside the city, even places well north of\nErbil and farther from the militant forces, people were frantically piling\ninto cars to flee. The pesh merga were helping to evacuate hundreds of\npeople in large flatbed trucks. When people heard a gunshot, rumors would\nspread of an ISIS advance.\n\n\n\nAmericans officials on the ground said they feared that if Erbil emptied,\nthe city would be vulnerable to a militant attack. And if it fell, they\nfeared, not only would Americans be at risk, but it would be a second\nseismic event for the region \xe2\x80\x94 after the June 10 fall of Mosul, Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s\nsecond-largest city \xe2\x80\x94 with dangerous consequences for Turkey and a\npotential for enormous loss of life in Kurdistan.\n\n\n\nAs if that were not enough, the militants had seized a critical dam in\nMosul, which controls water levels on the Tigris River as far south as\nBaghdad. The capture of the dam shook Kurdish officials and fueled the\nsense of crisis during Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s meetings, with officials worried that the\nmilitants could either blow it up or use it to cut off water supplies or as\na bargaining chip in negotiating anything they wanted.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was one of the trip wires we looked at,\xe2\x80\x9d said another senior\nofficial. \xe2\x80\x9cWe look at that dam as a potential threat to our embassy in\nBaghdad.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAt a 90-minute meeting in the Situation Room on Thursday morning, Mr. Obama\nwas briefed again about the plight of the Iraqis stranded on Mount Sinjar.\nMembers of an ancient religious sect known as Yazidi, they were branded as\ndevil worshipers by the militants. The women were to be enslaved; the men\nwere to be slaughtered.\n\n\n\nOfficials told Mr. Obama there was a real danger of genocide, under the\nlegal definition of the term. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile we have faced difficult humanitarian\nchallenges, this was in a different category,\xe2\x80\x9d said an official. \xe2\x80\x9cThat kind\nof shakes you up, gets your attention.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAt 11:20 a.m., Mr. Obama left the meeting to travel to Fort Belvoir, Va.,\nwhere he signed a bill expanding health care for veterans. He had all but\nmade up his mind to authorize airstrikes, officials said, and while he was\naway, his team drafted specific military options.\n\n\n\nWhen the president returned to the White House barely an hour later, he\nwent back into meetings with his staff. By then, there were news reports of\nairdrops and possible strikes. But the White House \xe2\x80\x9chunkered down,\xe2\x80\x9d an\nofficial said, refusing to comment on the reports for fear of endangering a\nnighttime airdrop over Mount Sinjar.\n\n\n\nMr. Obama did not announce the operations until dawn had broken in Iraq, a\ndelay of several hours that added to the panic in Erbil. Reports of\nexplosions near the city at dusk on Thursday night sowed confusion after\nKurdish officials said the United States had begun airstrikes on the\nmilitants. The Pentagon flatly denied the reports.\n\n\n\nAmerican officials said the United States was closely coordinating with the\nIraqi Air Force, which has been carrying out its own strikes on the\nmilitants, though officials did not confirm that the explosions reported on\nThursday evening were from Iraqi raids. On Friday, an administration\nofficial said there had been no airstrikes the previous evening.\n\n\n\nStruggling to stanch the fear, keep the fighters at their posts and slow\nthe exodus out of the city, Kurdish officials put out a series of\nbrave-sounding but misleading statements.\n\n\n\nThe Kurdish prime minister, Necherven Barrzani, sent a letter to Kurdish\ncitizens, posted on a government website, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cThe pesh merga are going\nahead and terrorists are being beaten. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be skeptical.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAlso writing a letter to the Kurdish people was Kosrat Rassoul, deputy to\nPresident Massoud Barzani, who said: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are rumors among the people,\nwhich make citizens feel skeptical. Here I want to reassure everyone we in\nErbil are ready in the best way to defend the Kurdish territory.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhat they did not say was that the pesh merga were demoralized, uncertain,\nunderequipped and facing a formidable foe along several hundred miles of\nborder between the Kurdistan region and Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s Nineveh and Kirkuk\nProvinces, where the militants are now the dominant force.\n\n\n\nSeveral fighters who had fought ISIS said they were daunted when they\ndiscovered the militants were traveling in bulletproof vehicles that left\nthe pesh merga\xe2\x80\x99s bullets doing little more than pockmarking the metal.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s our business to see the faces of the soldiers and know how they\nfeel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Halgurd Hekmat, the head of media for the pesh merga fighters.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say they were afraid, but they were a bit nervous,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadmitted. Since the fall of Mosul, the pesh merga leadership had warned the\nAmericans and the Iraqi government that they were ill equipped to hold the\nmilitants at the border separating Nineveh Province from Kurdistan.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe told them: \xe2\x80\x98We cannot hold it for very long. We are not a country; we\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t have an army; we don\xe2\x80\x99t have aircraft,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d said Lt. Gen. Jaber Yawer\nManda, the secretary general of the pesh merga ministry. \xe2\x80\x9cI said: \xe2\x80\x98We are\nfighting in the front lines now. You have to help us.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn Thursday evening, after a long day in the West Wing, Mr. Obama had a\nmessage for Iraqis: \xe2\x80\x9cToday, America is coming to help.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*State House News Service (M.A.): \xe2\x80\x9cSen.

Elizabeth Warren on\nFriday stood by President Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s decision to authorize targeted\nairstrikes to help defend Americans in Erbil, Iraq, and provide aid to a\nreligious minority taking refuge in the Sinjar mountains.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated situation right now in Iraq and the president has taken\nvery targeted actions to provide humanitarian relief that the Iraqi\ngovernment requested, and to protect American citizens,\xe2\x80\x9d Warren told\nreporters. \xe2\x80\x9cBut like the president I believe that any solution in Iraq is\ngoing to be a negotiated solution, not a military solution. We do not want\nto be pulled into another war in Iraq.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRenowned for its financing strategies and media savvy and feared for its\nbrutality, a group of Sunni sectarian extremists that now calls itself The\nIslamic State has expanded out of war-torn Syria into Iraq, where it\nimposes taxes and kills people of other religions, according to news\naccounts.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday night, Obama announced he had authorized air strikes to protect\nAmerican diplomats, civilians and military personnel in Erbil, and\nhumanitarian air drops of food and water had already begun to assist\nYezidis, a religious minority, who fled to the Sinjar mountains.\n\n\n\nAn American-led invasion of Iraq was launched in March 2003, starting a war\nthat was divisive politically and costly. After Obama failed at reaching\naccord on a new status of force agreement with the Iraqi government, the\nU.S. stuck to an earlier timetable, withdrawing troops from the country by\nDec. 31, 2011.\n\n\n\nWarren said the actions announced by Obama will change the dynamic in the\ncountry, which has a Shi\xe2\x80\x99ite led government and an independent Kurdish\nregion in the north.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very complicated situation in Iraq. The president has now taken two\nvery targeted actions, and those two actions will change the mix of what\xe2\x80\x99s\nhappening in Iraq, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to just monitor it,\xe2\x80\x9d Warren said.\n\n\n\nWarren was in the State House for a closed-door meeting between state and\nfederal officials and Jorge Carlos Fonseca, the president of Cape Verde.\n\n\n\nAsked if she had a broader plan for dealing with the crisis in Iraq, Warren\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly these airstrikes are going to change the mix of what\xe2\x80\x99s\ngoing on, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to monitor it literally day by day, hour by\nhour.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhile calling for a negotiated solution, Warren said the Islamic State of\nIraq and Syria is a terrorist organization and the U.S. does not negotiate\nwith terrorists, while leaving open the possibility the U.S. could assist\nthe Iraqi government negotiating with ISIS.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe point is there has to be a negotiated solution in Iraq, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t\nnegotiate with terrorists,\xe2\x80\x9d Warren said. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is partially a\nquestion of whether the U.S. government negotiates or whether we have the\nIraqi government doing these negotiations, and how we help support them as\nthey try to maintain an integrated country, and a country that better\nrepresents all of the people who live there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA champion of those squeezed by big banks who toppled Scott Brown in a 2012\nelection for the seat, Warren is a favorite among liberals, and regularly\ndisavows any plans to seek the president.\n\n\n\nWarren said her caution not to entangle the United States in another\nmilitary conflict in Iraq is a viewpoint shared across the country.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am concerned that none of us want to be pulled into a war in Iraq. I\nthink that\xe2\x80\x99s clear across this country, and I feel very strongly about\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d Warren said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sioux City Journal (I.A.): \xe2\x80\x9cIowa trip: Huckabee thinking about 2016\ncampaign\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://siouxcityjournal.com/news/state-and-regional/iowa/iowa-trip-huckabee-thinking-about-campaign/article_fc1a9e13-70e8-54cc-88ae-592a74736c4a.html>*\n\n\n\nBy James Q.

He\'s scheduled to appear\nin Ames, Iowa, on Saturday.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would certainly start in a very different place if I were to run than I\ndid when I came here in 2007 and first launched the campaign and nobody\nknew who I was and even fewer people cared,\xe2\x80\x9d Huckabee said during a\nroundtable with reporters.\n\n\n\nThe winner of Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 first-in-the-nation precinct caucuses shied away\nfrom saying how certain he is that he\xe2\x80\x99ll run. He\xe2\x80\x99s maintaining a \xe2\x80\x9cdelicate\nbalance" because his radio and TV contracts preclude him from being a\ncandidate, Huckabee said.\n\n\n\nThose contracts don\xe2\x80\x99t prevent him from thinking about it.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not some real remote likelihood. This is something I\xe2\x80\x99m very\nseriously considering,\xe2\x80\x9d Huckabee said.\n\n\n\nPolls show that he\xe2\x80\x99s one of the top choices of Iowa Republicans for the\n2016 campaign. He attributed his frontrunner status to Iowans\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cgood taste\nin politics.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the polls are showing that I\xe2\x80\x99m leading in Iowa it\xe2\x80\x99s a clear indication\nand an affirmation of just how intelligent and insightful the people of\nIowa really are,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll see more Iowans Saturday when he addresses The Family Leadership\nSummit in Ames. Huckabee said that event and the \xe2\x80\x9cPastors & Pews\xe2\x80\x9d program\nhe was part of in Cedar Rapids are not part of a strategy to sew up support\namong the conservative Christian bloc of the Iowa GOP.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think there\xe2\x80\x99s great value in mobilizing people of faith who often sit at\nhome during the elections and don\xe2\x80\x99t show up to vote,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe called reporting on his comments about impeachment unfortunate, too.\nAlthough he believes President Barack Obama has committed impeachable\noffenses, Huckabee said he\xe2\x80\x99s never called for impeachment. Impeachment\n\xe2\x80\x9cshould be used in rare and most unusual circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and talk\nabout impeaching Obama is a distraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sec.
