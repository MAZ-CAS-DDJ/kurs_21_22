john.podesta@gmail.comb'>From my contact Nick at Apple. Looks good.  Just heard that Google is good\ntoo.\n\nHi Sara,\n\nThanks! Yes, this was great. I got the clip to Tim last night. Definitely\nstruck the right tone.\n\nAs an FYI, Tim is doing 60 min tonight and encryption does get mentioned.\nSimilar language - no backdoors, can\'t make them for just the good guys.\n\nThanks again.\n\nNick\n\nOn Dec 20, 2015, at 7:49 PM, Teddy Goff <tgoff@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\nadding john too, a fellow crypto hobbyist.
