Those were the words of a friend of mine, a left-leaning,\nprogressive Democrat and liberal. He was referring to my having been on\nteam Hillary back when she was up against current President Barack Obama\nfor the job of commander in chief; he was team Obama.\n\n\n\nOne of the reasons I had preferred Clinton over then-Senator Obama was I\nfelt she had more experience, especially in foreign policy matters, and I\nknew her being a "hawk" could come in handy.\n\n\n\nAfter the release of a second video by the Islamic State (also known as\nISIS or ISIL) that shows the beheading of American journalist Steven\nSotloff, and faced with a president who admitted that the U.S. did not have\na plan as to how to deal with the Islamic State, my friend seems to agree\nwith me now: Perhaps Clinton would have made a better president. It\'s times\nlike these that we need a hawk. And I agree with him, partially.\n\n\n\nLooking back, I agree with our former secretary of state when she said we\nshould have worked with the moderate faction of the Free Syrian Army. I\nalso feel that drone strikes earlier on in Syria would have been a better\nchoice; we have seen their effectiveness. First, we took out seven vehicles\nof the Islamic State\'s convoy in less than 48 hours. Second, we helped the\nKurds and Iraqi military to keep the Mosul Dam, a facility that provides\nenergy and water to millions of Iraqi people, out of the Islamic State\'s\nhands. Third, and most recent, U.S. airstrikes assisted in the success of\nthe taking back of Amerli, a key northern town in Iraq.\n\n\n\nBut for all the criticism of Obama\'s foreign policy, and most recently for\nthe beheading of Sotloff, the situation would have been the same for\n"President" Hillary Clinton. When Obama stood up to speak about Iraq and\nSyria, the world was focused on his tan suit. I\'m sure Clinton\'s hairstyle\nwould have been discussed if she were standing there.\n\n\n\nIn this situation, there is absolutely no good outcome. We don\'t negotiate\nwith terrorists (well, we have numerous times, but it\'s a good line\nAmerican presidents like to recite), and we are certainly not going to bow\ndown to terrorist\'s demands to stop the drone attacks and write a check for\nmore than $6 million to free numerous prisoners. Unlike al-Qaida, which\nafter murdering and beheading Daniel Pearl threatened to do the same to\nhundreds of Americans, the Islamic State has been following through on its\nthreats.\n\n\n\nSo what\'s a president to do? No matter who sits in the Oval Office, no\nAmerican president would stop using drones because the terrorists threaten\nto kill an American. Harsh? Yes. True? Yes.\n\n\n\nJulian Zelizer, a friend of mine who is also a professor at Princeton\nUniversity and a contributor to CNN.com, stated in an interview with The\nChristian Science Monitor, \xe2\x80\x9cThe second beheading is a brutal act, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\nalso a political act.\xe2\x80\x9d She continued, "[I]t\xe2\x80\x99s clearly meant to send a\nsignal that Obama\xe2\x80\x99s not in control, that the airstrikes that have taken\nplace are not really doing anything and that [the Islamic State] will\ncontinue to act aggressively and to kill.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nI could not disagree more, and I am not alone in this opinion. I have\ninterviewed Navy SEALS, counterterrorism experts, former marines and other\nmembers of the armed forces, people who have been to Iraq, dealt with\nterrorists and intelligence operations, and all feel that these are\nmurderers with a mindset that we Americans and the rest of the Western\nworld just do not understand.\n\n\n\nThese terrorists would have cropped up even if we had stayed in Iraq for\n100 years, as Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., once suggested. The Islamic State\nwill continue to behead hostages whether we continue our drone attacks,\nincrease them, back off or cease using them entirely. They were murdering\nand beheading people, both Muslims and Christians, before we started the\ndrone attacks. For the Islamic State to threaten to take American lives\nbecause of U.S. airstrikes further proves the success of these missions.\n\n\n\nWhether we continue and step up the attacks, whether we strike the Islamic\nState in Syria, whether we have our boots on the ground, or our allies\' and\nothers\' in the Middle East, the only way to stop the Islamic State is to\ndestroy the Islamic State. And the only way to destroy the Islamic State is\nfor the Iraqi people to stop the divisions between Sunni, Shite and Kurd\nand become one, united Iraq. The only to destroy the Islamic State is for\nthe Iraqi people and their military to be motivated to do so. We can write\na check, but we can\'t buy their motivation. We can send them weapons and\ntrain them, but we cannot train them to be motivated.\n\n\n\nSo, although I may have been right that a President Hillary Clinton would\nhave been more of a hawk, and as much as I am hoping that she is our next\npresident in 2016, I am confident in my belief that her or any U.S.\npresident\'s actions could not have prevented the madness of these murderers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Hill blog: Ballot Box: \xe2\x80\x9cWill Md. governor challenge Clinton?\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/216480-will-omalley-run-against-clinton>*\n\n\n\nBy Mario Trujillo\n\nSeptember 3, 2014, 9:02 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nMaryland Gov. Martin O\'Malley is preparing to run for the Democratic\npresidential nomination in 2016 whether or not Hillary Clinton enters the\nrace, according to three Democratic fundraisers quoted in the Wall Street\nJournal.\n\n\n\nThe newspaper quotes two anonymous fundraisers who said the governor\nalready told them flat out he would run for president in 2016.\n\n\n\nWhen asked directly whether he would run regardless of Clinton\'s decision,\nO\'Malley said he is "not inclined to talk about it that at this point."\n\nAn aide to the governor said the fundraisers could have been mistaken that\nthe governor had already decided on a run, but noted his decision would\ncome regardless of who else enters the race.\n\n\n\nDoug Goldman, a campaign bundler for President Obama in 2012, told the\nnewspaper, "Martin O\'Malley is making it pretty clear that his ultimate\ngoal is president of the United States."\n\n\n\nHe added that the governor indicated during a spring meeting that, "Yes,\nthat\'s the next step for him, that he is running."\n\n\n\nClinton is a huge frontrunner in early polling for the nomination. Most\npeople having never heard of O\'Malley.\n\n\n\nIn a July interview with the Los Angeles Times, the governor said he was\n"seriously considering" a run. When asked how Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s decision would\naffect his own, he responded, "It\'s not at all at this point."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Los Angeles Times: \xe2\x80\x9cAl Franken takes Senate job seriously (he\'s still\nfunny in private)\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-franken-profile-20140903-story.html#page=1>*\n\n\n\nBy Michael A. Memoli\n\nSeptember 2, 2014, 7:04 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nIt must be said at this point: Sen. Al Franken is just dull.\n\n\n\nHow dull is he? He says the most memorable conversation he\'s had as a\nsenator \xe2\x80\x94 "hilarious" even \xe2\x80\x94 was a wonkish discussion with former President\nClinton about how to finance energy retrofits.\n\n\n\nDuring travels throughout the state, he stops at Dairy Queen and always\norders the same thing: a plain vanilla cone.\n\n\n\nThe former "Saturday Night Live" writer and actor generally shuns the\nnational media unless it\'s to talk about one of his obscure pet issues,\nsuch as corporate media mergers or net neutrality.\n\n\n\nEven his reelection is a little bit boring. More than five years after the\nMinnesota Supreme Court upheld his razor-thin 312-vote margin of victory,\nthe Democratic senator is low on the list of endangered incumbents this\nyear, even as several other Democrats are fighting to hold their seats.\n\n\n\nApparently dull is good politics for Al Franken.\n\n\n\nIt\'s not that Franken is no longer funny \xe2\x80\x94 he is, though it\'s mostly out of\npublic view. But one of the more noteworthy aspects of the former comic\'s\nfirst Senate term has been his effort to avoid the spotlight and to play\nagainst type.\n\n\n\n"I\'m in a different job," he said in an interview. "My old job was being\nfunny, basically. And that\'s not my new job."\n\n\n\nThe transformation from comic and political commentator to one of the most\nunderstated members of Congress\' upper chamber is often attributed to the\nso-called Hillary Clinton model, a reference to how the former first lady\nstrove to lower her profile and focus on constituents\' needs after she was\nfirst elected as a senator from New York.\n\n\n\nFranken also faced the prospect of filling the shoes of political giants\nwho\'d held the seat: Hubert H. Humphrey and Walter F. Mondale \xe2\x80\x94 and his\nfriend and political inspiration, the late Paul Wellstone.\n\n\n\nIndeed, Franken says he went to Washington "to be the workhorse and not a\nshow horse." The acerbic comedian who once declared the 1980s as the "Al\nFranken Decade" has been hesitant to exploit his celebrity status in the\nnew post. "I had years in show business and had plenty of camera time," he\nsaid. "By being perceived as someone who was rushing to the camera all the\ntime, it can undercut your effectiveness in the body."\n\n\n\nHe may be stone-faced in the halls of the Capitol, but there\'s one thing\nFranken cannot suppress: that laugh.\n\n\n\nHis cackle, notorious among lawmakers, often pierces the din of\nconversations on the Senate floor during votes. He credits his distinctive\nlaugh with helping him develop relationships across the aisle.\n\n\n\n"If you talked to almost any senator, they would say, \'Yeah, Al laughs a\nlot and really loudly,\'" he said.\n\n\n\nHe acknowledges that as a comic he once used his humor "very pointedly"\nagainst the GOP. Among Franken\'s several left-leaning political books are\n"Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations" and "Lies and the\nLying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right."\n\n\n\nBut as he has spent time getting to know Republicans, he has worked to give\nthem a better understanding of his commitment to issues, Franken says.\n\n\n\n"I\'ve always considered myself a serious person," he said. "And I don\'t\nthink there\'s any contradiction between being funny and being serious. I\ndon\'t think of them as being opposites."\n\n\n\nHe quickly found that humor can be an effective tool in legislating. "It\'s\nthe great bridge-maker," he said.\n\n\n\nColleagues agree that a little sense of humor can go a long way in\nWashington\'s hyper-polarized climate.\n\n\n\n"He has a great laugh, a disarming laugh. It\'s very genuine," said Sen. Tom\nHarkin (D-Iowa), a 30-year Senate veteran. "The one thing I always notice\nabout Franken is that when we go into the Senate for a vote \xe2\x80\xa6 more often\nthan not you find him on the Republican side. Once in a while you can see\nthem laugh together. Maybe Al says something funny or something like that.\nThat does a lot to break the ice, believe me."\n\n\n\nThose close to Franken, and Franken himself, often seem exhausted by the\ncontinued discussion of his past job as it relates to his current one.\nThat\'s one reason he\'s tended to refuse media interviews to non-Minnesota\noutlets. At the start of a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times, he\nasked skeptically, "The headline won\'t have \'No Joke\' in it?"\n\n\n\nThough he may keep his colleagues laughing in private, his brand of comedy,\nwhich always tended to be dry, is now basically arid in public. Anyone\nhoping for a chuckle from reading Franken\'s Twitter account or an\noccasional "daily affirmation" offered by Franken\'s sickeningly positive\nStuart Smalley character will be sorely disappointed.\n\n\n\nIt\'s even something of a running joke in Washington. At the 2013 Gridiron\nClub dinner in Washington, President Obama dubbed Franken "the\nsecond-funniest senator in Minnesota," behind dinner co-headliner Amy\nKlobuchar, the state\'s senior senator.\n\n\n\nOn a recent trip through rural western Minnesota, Franken touted his work\non a trio of agenda items that have generated little buzz in Washington: a\nnew farm bill, legislation that overhauled federal worker training\nprograms, and clean energy infrastructure projects. Despite gridlock in\nCongress, Franken emphasized where he had delivered results, and seemed to\nrevel in discussing them at the most granular level.\n\n\n\nIt was Bill Clinton\'s similar mastery of minute details of energy retrofits\nthat impressed Franken so much, he says. Launching into a spot-on\nimpersonation of the former president, Franken recalled how Clinton even\noffered to walk through the finer points with Franken\'s staff. "I said,\n\'Wow, Mr. President,\'" Franken recalled. "It was hilarious just being on\nthe phone with him for an hour and getting into local bonding issues."\n\n\n\nAt another stop, at a manufacturing company in Willmar, Franken had a\nfriendly debate with the company\'s conservative president, who was opposed\nto using taxpayer funds to support job training programs. After some\nback-and-forth about the merits of a law Franken backed, the two joked\nabout how they wished Franken could stay longer to continue the discussion.\n"We could sit down and watch some Fox," Franken quipped.\n\n\n\nFranken\'s campaign is highlighting a list of relatively modest proposals\nthat Franken helped turn into law: food safety and drug compounding bills,\na provision of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street overhaul bill that dealt with\ncredit rating agencies. He also played a key role in ensuring that the\nso-called 80-20 rule was included in the Affordable Care Act. It requires\ninsurers to spend a large portion of premium payments on actual healthcare\nservices and is seen as one of the more widely accepted components of\nObama\'s healthcare law.\n\n\n\n"Working Hard for Minnesota" is Franken\'s rather unflashy slogan as he runs\nfor a new term. And in the campaign ahead, it appears that both parties are\ncontent to focus on Franken\'s legislative resume rather than his comedic\npast.\n\n\n\nFranken\'s Republican opponent makes clear he\'d rather highlight Franken\'s\nvotes to support Obama policies than what he\'d done before going to the\nSenate.\n\n\n\n"I have no interest in what Al Franken did 25 years ago, absolutely no\ninterest," businessman and GOP candidate Mike McFadden said. "I do have an\ninterest in terms of what he\'s done over the last 5 1/2 years in\nWashington."\n\n\n\nRepublican colleagues who have worked with Franken were reluctant to say\nmuch about their partnership. Former GOP Sen. Norm Coleman, whom Franken\nnarrowly defeated in 2008, scoffed at the idea that Franken had\naccomplished much since replacing him.\n\n\n\n"He\'s touting the fact that he\'s got a few provisions [passed] in six\nyears," Coleman said. "That\'s not a workhorse. That\'s an invisible horse."\n\n\n\nIf anyone is playing for laughs, it\'s McFadden. His most recent ad employs\na Franken impersonator struggling to launch his boat in one of the state\'s\n10,000 lakes. (The message: Franken votes with Obama 97% of the time.)\nAnother ad ends with the Republican on the receiving end of a football to\nthe groin, prompting him to voice the "I approve this message" disclaimer\nin a high pitch.\n\n\n\nFranken supporters say the focus on his accomplishments is an implicit\nacknowledgment of how successful he\'s been at being accepted by all sides\nas a credible legislator.\n\n\n\n"They spent so much money in his first campaign making him look like a\nbuffoon," said Rep. Tim Walz (D-Minn.). "You\'re with him for five minutes\nand you see that\'s not true."\n\n\n\nSo far Franken doesn\'t seem threatened by his opponent\'s attempts to\nencroach on his comedy turf. But the campaign has opened the door \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps\nbriefly \xe2\x80\x94 to some of Franken\'s signature humor.\n\n\n\n"Good oral hygiene is important \xe2\x80\x94 and so is our grass-roots fundraising,"\nFranken wrote in one campaign missive, which had the subject line, "Not a\nmessage from your dentist."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Peoria Public Radio: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Voices Behind Campaign Ads\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://peoriapublicradio.org/post/voices-behind-campaign-ads>*\n\n\n\nBy Alex Keefe\n\nSeptember 3, 2014, 7:23 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nThink of radio and TV campaign ads as the soundtrack of an election season\xe2\x80\xa6.\n\n\n\nDeep and ominous voices sound the attack; sugary and optimistic voices\nsignal support.  As part of our series on the \xe2\x80\x9cdark arts\xe2\x80\x9d of the campaign\nbusiness, we meet the people behind the voices trained to influence the\ndemocratic process.\n\n\n\nAs Illinois Public Radio\'s Alex Keefe found, some of the most famous\npolitical ads in recent American history may have been voiced in a closet\nnear you.\n\n\n\nReally: a closet.\n\n\n\nWOODEL: "So, when I do voices for political campaigns, or for anybody, I do\nthem out of my closet here in the house."\n\n\n\nKEEFE: "This is literally a closet."\n\n\n\nWOODEL: "Yeah."\n\n\n\n...a closet lined with heavy, velvet drapes to soak up any echos - and a\nhigh-end super-sensitive microphone at which stands 64-year-old Norm\nWoodel- portly, gray polo, camo shorts, sandals. This is where the magic\nhappens.\n\n\n\nKEEFE: "Are there famous political campaigns that have had their work\nvoiced in this little closet here in Lakeview?"\n\n\n\nWOODEL: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s 3 AM and the phone is ringing in the White House.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nKEEFE: "That was you?!?"\n\n\n\nWOODEL: "Yeah."\n\n\n\nKEEFE: "You did the Hillary Clinton one?"\n\n\n\nWOODEL: \xe2\x80\x9c3AM.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree A-M\xe2\x80\x9d - if you don\xe2\x80\x99t recall - was arguably THE political ad of the\n2008 Democratic presidential primaries. Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign ran it\nto underscore this idea that she was seasoned, reliable - and to suggest\nher rival Barack Obama was not.\n\n\n\nAD TAPE: "It\xe2\x80\x99s 3AM and your children are safe and asleep. But there\xe2\x80\x99s a\nphone in the White House, and it\xe2\x80\x99s ringing. Something\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the\nworld. Your vote will decide who answers that call."\n\n\n\nOkay - but then - just a few hours AFTER the Clinton ad airs - just\n1-point-6 miles away from Norm Woodel\xe2\x80\x99s closet - ANOTHER guy, gets ANOTHER\nphone call in HIS makeshift home studio - and the voice on the other end of\nthe line is frantic.\n\n\n\nPRICE: "And they said, \xe2\x80\x98Have you heard what\xe2\x80\x99s on the air right now? Hillary\njust ran the red phone ad.\xe2\x80\x99 Which, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if people heard it, it\xe2\x80\x99s\nsomething like \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s 3AM - the phone\xe2\x80\x99s ringing in the White House.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRight, so this is Bill Price - another Chicago campaign voiceover talent -\nand now he\xe2\x80\x99s getting an earful from HIS client - Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\npresidential campaign - saying they gotta respond to this 3-A-M phone ad -\nRIGHT NOW.\n\n\n\nPRICE: "So we literally had 20 minutes for me to do a commercial, right\nhere...and they wanted it on the air for the evening news cycle."\n\n\n\nAD TAPE: "It\xe2\x80\x99s 3AM, and your children are safe and asleep."\n\n\n\nThese dueling ads epitomized the experience versus change narrative in the\nDemocratic primaries. Pundits gobbled this up - SaturdayNight Live even did\na parody of the ad.\n\n\n\nSuch are the big political debates ignited - in part - merely by the power\nof a human voice. The men and women behind those voices aren\xe2\x80\x99t just people\nwho read stuff into a microphone. They think of themselves as actors -\nartists - who use their voices like instruments to manipulate your emotions\n- which, in turn, can influence your vote. Also - they don\xe2\x80\x99t sleep much.\n\n\n\nHUDSON: "When you\xe2\x80\x99re doing voiceover work, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost as though you have\nno life, when you\xe2\x80\x99re doing political campaigns."\n\n\n\nWanda Christine Hudson has been doing voiceover work for more than four\ndecades. And she says working campaigns is a lot different than her usual\ncommercial or video game voiceover gigs. Political season means abruptly\ncanceled lunch plans, sleeping by your phone and voicing ads in the dead of\nnight.\n\n\n\nHUDSON: ..."and your voice has got to be awake and alert and up on your\ntoes!"\n\n\n\nBut Wanda Christine - as she goes by - says she likes the fast pace, the\nfickle campaign staffers, the challenge of using her full palette.\n\n\n\nHUDSON: ..."because maybe the candidate didn\xe2\x80\x99t like that word, or maybe\ntheir campaign manager thought, maybe we want more smile in her voice, or\nmaybe we want it to sound a little bit more serious, or maybe we want her\nto sound younger, or maybe we just want her to sound natural."\n\n\n\nThese vocal acrobatics may SOUND easy. But imagine having to talk like this\nON DEMAND - with short notice - on a tight deadline.\n\n\n\nNorm Woodel - the original 3 A-M phone call guy - will say a little phrase\nto himself to get the right tone - he calls it a ramp.\n\n\n\nWOODEL: "So I have a ramp that I use to get into my NFL voice: To the men\non the field it\xe2\x80\x99s a battle."\n\n\n\n...then later, Woodel says they\xe2\x80\x99ll edit out that little bit he says at the\nbeginning...or, at the end.\n\n\n\nWOODEL: "The all new Chevy Silverado. The most dependable, longest-lasting\ntrucks on the road...(expletive)."\n\n\n\nKEEFE: (laughs)\n\n\n\nWOODEL: "Just thinking that half-cuss word we put on the end, as a guy talk\nkinda thing, would get you to the toughness you need."\n\n\n\nBut sometimes finding your voice takes more than just a little ramp. When\nBill Price was voicing political ads for Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 campaign, he invented\nthis whole character.\n\n\n\nPRICE: "Like being the doctor who walks in the room, and there\xe2\x80\x99s parents\nthere, and they\xe2\x80\x99re distraught \xe2\x80\x98cause their kid\xe2\x80\x99s really sick and think he\xe2\x80\x99s\nmaybe gonna die. And then you\xe2\x80\x99re the doctor that gets to say, There\xe2\x80\x99s one\nlast hope."\n\n\n\nFor Wanda Christine - a black woman in a business where she says there\naren\xe2\x80\x99t many - there\xe2\x80\x99s also personal history in her political voiceovers.\n\n\n\nHUDSON:  "My great-grandmother was not allowed to vote. My grandmother was\nnot allowed to vote. Um, so I think about the things that they had to do to\ntry to make a difference so that I could vote. That means something to me.\nAnd because it means something to me, uh, excuse me - I want it to mean\nsomething to whoever is making that decision based upon my voice."\n\n\n\nWOODEL: "Oh, come on. \xe2\x80\x98Please try to refresh your browser\xe2\x80\x99?!? So let\xe2\x80\x99s look\nat this ad."\n\nAD: "I\xe2\x80\x99m Barack Obama and I approve this message."\n\n\n\nBack at Norm Woodel\xe2\x80\x99s home studio computer - he shows me how all this\nemotion and character and subtext is crafted to influence voters. He\xe2\x80\x99s\ndissecting a TV attack ad he voiced for President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 campaign\nagainst Republican Mitt Romney.\n\n\n\nHe cues up the video...\n\n\n\nAD: "Tough on China? Not Mitt Romney. When a flood of Chinese."\n\n\n\nJust a couple seconds in - he pauses - to explain that throaty, leathery\nvoice.\n\n\n\nWOODEL: "Well, first I wanna be credible, reliable, dependable. That\nhappens here. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen like, Tough on China?"\n\n\n\nAD: "When a flood of Chinese tires threatened a thousand American jobs, it\nwas President Obama who stood up to China."\n\n\n\nWOODEL: "Okay, so what do we wanna build into Obama?"\n\n\n\nWoodel stops it again - looks at me - and smiles.\n\n\n\nWOODEL: "President Obama. That guy. We have to sense a smile when you say\nhis voice."\n\n\n\nAD: ..."stood up to China, and protected American workers."\n\n\n\nWOODEL: "Okay, so"\n\n\n\nHere, Woodel actually walks over from the desktop...\n\n\n\nWOODEL:"No no, you can sit there."\n\n\n\nKEEFE: "Oh, okay."\n\n\n\n...and he puts his arm around my shoulder - looks me square in the eye...\n\n\n\nWOODEL: ..."and protected American workers. D\xe2\x80\x99you hear what happened to the\nvoice?"\n\n\n\nKEEFE: "It was intimate. It was close. You\xe2\x80\x99re like whispering in my ear,\nalmost."\n\n\n\nWOODEL: "It\xe2\x80\x99s just you and me. Me talking to you. Reassuring you."\n\n\n\nThese messages - individual words, even - have been poll-tested and\nfocus-grouped to find out which will hit YOU in the most personal way\npossible. Wanda Christine says it\xe2\x80\x99s also personal for many voiceover\nartists.\n\n\n\nKEEFE: "Do you only work for one party now?"\n\n\n\nHUDSON:  "Uhhhhhh.....yeaaaah."\n\n\n\nKEEFE: "Are you allowed to say which party that is?"\n\n\n\nHUDSON: "Naw."\n\n\n\nBut the folks behind the other two voices we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard in this story made a\npersonal political choice only to read for Democrats. Bill Price thinks he\njust SOUNDS more...Democratic.\n\n\n\nPRICE: "I think within my voice is more - second chances, and hope\nand...even small miracles...than it is about justice. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s more of\na Republican thing. I\xe2\x80\x99m more, uh...you know....sentimental."\n\n\n\nAnd for Norm Woodel - there is a bit of a gee-whiz factor.\n\n\n\nWOODEL: "After the President of the United States of America says, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m\nBarack Obama and I approve this message,\xe2\x80\x99 I come on. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that wonderful?"\n\n\n\nKEEFE: "Um, I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to help me end my story in a much more interesting\nway than we normally could. So, could we do scary first?"\n\n\n\nWOODEL: "For WBEZ, this has been Alex Keefe."\n\n\n\nHmm - okay, give me more wholesome now.\n\n\n\nPRICE: "For WBEZ, he\xe2\x80\x99s Alex Keefe."\n\n\n\nOkay - I want confidence.\n\n\n\nHUDSON: "This interview has been brought to you by WBEZ and the handsome\nAlex Keefe."\n\n\n\nKEEFE: Ok, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that one. All right, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good spot to end.\n'
