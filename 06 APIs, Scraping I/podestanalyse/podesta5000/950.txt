Kay Henderson\n>> Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke with Radio Iowa this afternoon following her rally in Des Moines.\n>> AUDIO of interview, 21:00\n>> The conversation began with a discussion about trade and the Trans Pacific Partnership. What follows is the sequence of questions and some of her responses.\n>> Did President Obama mishandled it in his negotiations with Republicans?\n>> \xe2\x80\x9cAny trade agreement is going to be fraught with all sorts of problems,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n>> Is it time for a rethink, time to send US troops to do combat-type maneuvers in Iraq?\n>> \xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe that U.S. troops should be on the ground in Iraq doing combat,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n>> Your Republican friends have already cited (universal preschool) as one example of a big government approach as opposed to their view. What would you say to that criticism?\n>> \xe2\x80\x9cI think investing in early childhood and pre-kindergarten is good for our economy. It\xe2\x80\x99s good for our democracy. I make absolutely no apologies for believing that,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cI also notice that many Republican governors are beginning to institute preschool programs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>> In your husband\xe2\x80\x99s administration you had a significant policy role. In a Hillary Clinton administration, what role would Bill Clinton play in regards to policy?\n>> \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to think about what might happen unless it does happen,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n>> In 2008, members of the Clinton team, including Bill Clinton, had some concerns about the Caucus process\xe2\x80\xa6Are you comfortable with the process\xe2\x80\xa6and how does this feel different than it did eight years ago?\n>> \xe2\x80\x9cI am very committed to competing in the Caucus system and I do think that the Democratic Party in Iowa has made some changes that will provide some greater opportunity for people who wish to express themselves in the Caucuses to be heard,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n>> There are sort of two Americas\xe2\x80\xa6it seems as if in one America you\xe2\x80\x99re well respected, your admired. In the other America, you\xe2\x80\x99re hated and your vilified. How in presenting what many are describing as a progressive agenda do you then govern for the two Americas as president when maybe the proposals you\xe2\x80\x99re presenting don\xe2\x80\x99t appeal to that sector of the country?\n>> \xe2\x80\x9cI will work with anybody anywhere anytime to find common ground,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6I think a lot of the political heat that is directed at me is kind of a strange form of respect and even flattery because if they weren\xe2\x80\x99t so concerned about me, they\xe2\x80\x99d leave me alone, but they get up every day you know worried that the case I\xe2\x80\x99m making will break through.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>> In 2007 when I covered you, you to paraphrase said I\xe2\x80\x99m not running for president because I\xe2\x80\x99m a woman but because I\xe2\x80\x99m the most qualified, Now you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about breaking the glass ceiling. Why the change?\n>> \xe2\x80\x9cThere is an eagerness that I find now in crowds here in Iowa and elsewhere, not just to support me because they\xe2\x80\x99d think I\xe2\x80\x99d be a good president because of X, Y, or Z\xe2\x80\xa6but because we would shatter that highest and hardest glass ceiling,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n>> One of the things I hear from Iowa Democrats at (Sanders & O\xe2\x80\x99Malley) events is that they\xe2\x80\x99re unsure about your commitment to Wall Street reform or going after the big banks. How do you reassure skeptics?\n>> \xe2\x80\x9cI will have to do a better job of explaining my record,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n>> Some of them use the phrase Clinton fatigue as well. Is that something that can be cured?\n>> \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I ran for the Senate the first time in New York I heard all of this,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m going to work hard to earn every vote and then the voters will decide. I understand what my opponents in both the Democratic Party and Republican Party are trying to do. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame them. That\xe2\x80\x99s their campaign, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to set forth what I believe, what I think will work\xe2\x80\xa6and then people will make their own decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>> Your mother was here in December before the Caucuses. You talked in your speech yesterday about going home from work and talking about your travails with your mother. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the Caucuses came up. What was her advice to you?\n>> \xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t immerse herself in the political details. She was there to support me and to be there in that wonderful way she had of kind of reminding me of what\xe2\x80\x99s mportant in life,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n>> \n>> \n>> \n>> ---------\n>> Lily Adams\n>> cell: (202) 368-4013\n>> \n>>> On Jun 14, 2015, at 3:43 PM, Lily Adams <ladams@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n>>> \n>>> http://www.radioiowa.com/2015/06/14/clinton-says-trade-deals-are-fraught-with-all-sorts-of-problems-audio/\n>>> \n>>> \n>>> ---------\n>>> Lily Adams\n>>> cell: (202) 368-4013\n'
