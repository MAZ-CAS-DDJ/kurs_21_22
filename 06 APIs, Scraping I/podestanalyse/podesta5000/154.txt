You\n> helped push the administration\xe2\x80\x99s climate policies into high gear when you\n> were in the White House, and I\xe2\x80\x99d be interested in your perspective on this\n> case of odd bedfellows, and what happens next. We can do it on background\n> if you prefer\xe2\x80\xa6. Also, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to establish a line of communication with\n> you before you decamp to NY and take over the reins of the Clinton\n> campaign, and things get crazy.  My direct line at the Beast is\n> 202-626-2030; my cell is 202-257-6388 \xe2\x80\x93 Please let me hear from you,\n> Thanks so  much, Eleanor Clift, DB, Washington\n>\n>\n'
