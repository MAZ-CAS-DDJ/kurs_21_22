john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear all,\n\nHere is the Debate Book -- this document is exactly what HRC currently has\nin hard copy.  (We swapped in updates for about 5 sections this morning;\nthe rest of the book was printed for her on Wednesday).  Also attached are\na few additional background pages that HRC asked for yesterday.\n\nThe yellow highlights on the table of contents are the sections we told her\nto focus on.  Kristina and I will bring 7-10 hard copies of those\nquestions, to Detroit tomorrow.\n\n*One thing that HRC asked for a good response on, is Bernie\'s claim that\n"he is the one who can beat Trump, because he is still doing better than\nher against Trump, in national polls."*  She wanted a smart reply --\nwhether it is saying that polls always change; or pointing to other polls;\nor whatever.  *Do people on this chain have any good ideas about that, as\nshe will likely bring it up tomorrow?  *Finally, below are a few final\nthings Kristina and I are running down, for prep tomorrow.   She also\nwanted some good Trump hits, and we\'ve thought of the fact that he opposed\nthe auto bailout, and Trump University.  Please let us know if you have\nother ideas.\n\nThanks so much,\nSara and Kristina\n\n\xc2\xb7         Sunday \xe2\x80\x93 remind her that Sunday is Bloody Sunday\n\n\xc2\xb7         New riff on \xe2\x80\x93 problems Detroit are not just due to trade\n\n\xc2\xb7         2-3 Trump hits \xe2\x80\x93 he opposed auto bailout, Trump University\n\n\xc2\xb7         New answer on -- Bernie will be Trump/polls\n\n\xc2\xb7         Corporate tax point\n\n\xc2\xb7         Pull trade stats (deficit, surplus)\n\n\xc2\xb7         Examples of his Wall Street pivots/mentions \xe2\x80\x93 specifics\n'
