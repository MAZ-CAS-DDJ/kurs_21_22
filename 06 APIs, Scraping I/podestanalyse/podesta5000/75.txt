Scott Walker watches the Republican debate at the Milwaukee Theatre on Tuesday night. (AP Photo/Jeffrey Phelps)\nTHE BIG IDEA:\xc2\xa0\nJohn Kasich made a remarkable observation at the start of Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s Republican debate. Of the eight candidates on stage for the main event, he pointed out that he was the only sitting governor.\nThe Ohioan\xc2\xa0proceeded to have the worst night of anyone, and conservatives widely panned his performance.\nKasich&#8217;s struggle is emblematic of something bigger:\xc2\xa02015 has been\xc2\xa0a terrible time to be a current or former governor running for president.\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who led in some\xc2\xa0polls\xc2\xa0this spring, and ex-Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who briefly led in the polls during his first run four years ago, were the first two candidates to drop out of the 2016 contest.\nOn the Democratic side, ex-Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee\xc2\xa0quit\xc2\xa0after the first debate\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley remains an afterthought. Two years ago, if you\xe2\x80\x99d done a survey of insiders, few would have predicted that the democratic socialist from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, would be faring so much better than the two-term Maryland governor against Hillary Rodham Clinton. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s campaign never got off the ground after his lieutenant governor was defeated in last year\xe2\x80\x99s election to succeed him, and then the Baltimore riots case his record as mayor of that city in a dark light.\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and ex-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who were both relegated\xc2\xa0to the kid\xe2\x80\x99s table on Tuesday because of their drop in the polls, found themselves defending their records in Trenton and Little Rock against attacks from\xc2\xa0Bobby Jindal.\xc2\xa0The outgoing Louisiana governor, at the\xc2\xa0kid&#8217;s table in all four debates, has struggled to raise cash and his unpopularity back home has become a drag on David Vitter, the Republican nominee in next week\xe2\x80\x99s runoff to determine who will succeed him in Baton Rouge.\nIn many ways, governors are better equipped to become president than legislators. They\xe2\x80\x99ve balanced budgets. They\xe2\x80\x99ve led in moments of crisis, from hurricanes to terrorist attacks. They\xe2\x80\x99ve forged coalitions. They\xe2\x80\x99ve faced far more press scrutiny. They\xe2\x80\x99ve commanded a national guard.\nJeb Bush, who left Tallahassee nine years ago after two terms as Florida\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, started the year as a presumptive frontrunner. But he\xe2\x80\x99s found many voters uninterested in the long list of accomplishments he rattles off during his stump speech. He played the governor card in Iowa yesterday when he was asked about Marco Rubio, who is 18 years younger than him and has no\xc2\xa0executive experience.\n&#8220;I&#8217;m a better bet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a proven record \xe2\x80\xa6 I&#8217;ve been vetted. I&#8217;ve been tested.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut, so far, that argument doesn&#8217;t\xc2\xa0resonate with the restive and angry Republican base. The two leaders in the polls, Ben Carson and Donald Trump, have never even run for office. At least Rubio, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul have cast votes in the Senate, though\xc2\xa0none of the trio has\xc2\xa0even served a full six-year term.\nFormer Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore and New York Gov. George Pataki didn\xe2\x80\x99t even make the cut for the undercard debate, despite leading two of the country\xe2\x80\x99s biggest states. They\xe2\x80\x99re not even trying to run serious campaigns. Neither filed to appear on the primary ballots in Arkansas and Alabama before deadlines this week.\nThis is historically unusual: Barack Obama was the first sitting senator elected president since 1960. George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter all came to the White House from governor\xe2\x80\x99s mansions. Each ran against Washington and the status quo.\nMitt Romney foreshadowed this trend four years ago when he downplayed his record as governor of Massachusetts in favor of emphasizing his experience as a businessman who could create jobs. He did that to contrast himself with Obama but also because his signature achievement in office was Romneycare, which included an individual mandate and helped inspire Obamacare.\n&#8212; Why is this happening? So far, this campaign has not really been about policy. It\xe2\x80\x99s been all about personalities.\nThe\xc2\xa0bigger issue is that governors are also no longer seen as outsiders. They\xe2\x80\x99ve made compromises, and it is very difficult to stay ideologically pure when you\xe2\x80\x99re leading a state. For example: From a conservative perspective, Walker had a very impressive record of achievements, aided by GOP majorities in both chambers of his state legislature. But many big donors, including the Koch brothers, zeroed in on his support for offering taxpayer help to build a new sports stadium, which Walker did to keep the Milwaukee Bucks from leaving town. That\xe2\x80\x99s part of a governor\xe2\x80\x99s job. But, in this climate, it is apostasy.\nOf course, it is still possible that a governor will emerge to claim the nomination. Dan Balz, explaining that no one is dropping out of the Republican contest because it remains so unsettled, argues in a column today that Kasich and Christie are \xe2\x80\x9con a collision course.\xe2\x80\x9d They are \xe2\x80\x9ctwo alpha personalities whose hopes are kept alive by their conviction that those above them are no more capable than they are of leading the party,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes.\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\nSmoke from an airstrike billows over the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar today. (AP Photo/Bram Janssen)\n&#8212; Kurdish forces, backed by U.S. airstrikes, have launched an offensive to\xc2\xa0retake control of a town in Iraq that ISIS seized in summer 2014. The Post&#8217;s Loveday Morris reports that ISIS captured thousands of women in last year\xe2\x80\x99s raid and has been using them as sex slaves for the past 13 months. About 7,500 Kurdish forces on Thursday swooped in from three different fronts in the campaign delayed by several weeks because of\xc2\xa0poor weather and tactical disagreement among Kurdish fighters.

(Andy Starnes/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette via AP)\n&#8212;\xc2\xa0Ben Carson profits from ties with convicted felon. Breaking from the Associated Press: \xe2\x80\x9cCarson has maintained a business relationship with a close friend convicted of defrauding insurance companies and testified on his behalf, even as the candidate has called for such crimes to be punished harshly. Pittsburgh dentist Alfonso A. Costa pleaded guilty to a felony count of health care fraud after an FBI probe into his oral surgery practice found he had charged for procedures he never performed, according to court records. Though the crime carries a potential sentence of up to 10 years in federal prison, Costa was able to avoid prison time after Carson helped petition a federal judge for leniency. That&#8217;s different from the position Carson took in 2013 as he prepared to launch his presidential campaign, saying those convicted of health care fraud should go to prison for at least a decade and be forced to forfeit \xe2\x80\x98all of one&#8217;s personal possessions.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n(AP Photo/Paul Sancya)\n&#8212;\xc2\xa0Smoking would be banned in all public housing, including common areas and administrative offices, under a new federal proposal to be unveiled today\xc2\xa0by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The other candidates have not figured out how to deal with what some are calling \xe2\x80\x98the Marco moment,\xe2\x80\x99 hinting at critiques and possible anti-Rubio ads to come but hesitating to make Rubio their main target.\xe2\x80\x9d\nYesterday, Jeb said his Right to Rise super PAC should not attack Rubio over his opposition to abortion in all instances, including in the cases of rape and incest.

But first, the party must resolve its own identity crisis on the subject, which erupted into view in the fourth Republican debate Tuesday night and flowed quickly onto the campaign trail the next day. Many in the GOP had been relishing the opportunity to vigorously prosecute the former secretary of state\xe2\x80\x99s role in what they have disparagingly dubbed the \xe2\x80\x98Obama-Clinton foreign policy legacy.\xe2\x80\x99 The large GOP field\xe2\x80\x99s muddled positions have shown that it won\xe2\x80\x99t be easy. Unlike abortion and same-sex marriage, on which the Republican candidates mostly agree, there are deep divisions on foreign policy and national security, highlighting how President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s agenda abroad, and by extension Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s, have become difficult to assail from a consistent posture.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWAPO HIGHLIGHTS:\nAllison Corona, in the bedroom of her family home in Glen Head, N.Y., was born legally blind.

As it evolves from experimental to applied medicine, gene therapy might soon find itself steeped in a new controversy: soaring drug prices. No therapy is approved yet in the United States, so discussions about price \xe2\x80\x94 as well as crucial questions about how much patients will pay directly \xe2\x80\x94 are hypothetical.

But Emilio Sturla, a public relations consultant who worked closely with gay Catholic groups and was helping Charamsa, strongly suggested he reconsider, both men recalled.
