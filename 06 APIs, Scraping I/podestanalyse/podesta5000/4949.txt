While it\nclearly does not say President/COO so she's not being replaced - she may\nread it that way.\n\nI still think on balance it should be said but then she should get a heads\nup; alternatively, you could delete this recommendation and save for when\npersonnel announcements are made an assuming she takes the COS position, it\nwill look like she is moving to something rather than pushed from something.\n\ncdm\n"
