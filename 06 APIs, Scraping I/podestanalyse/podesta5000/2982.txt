His face is tanned, his back is straight, his speech is firm.  It would seem that the reports of his imminent retirement and of the collapse of the Palestinian Authority, willingly or involuntarily, have filled him with fighting spirit.  Ariel Sharon used to say that every time he thought of retiring, he looked at the line of people waiting to succeed him, and changed his mind.  Abu Mazen may be undergoing a similar process.  His retirement announcement given a few weeks ago gave rise to an ugly succession war among top Fatah members.  The collateral damage, from our point of view, was the competition among the candidates as to who could be more hostile and more bellicose towards Israel.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am not retiring,\xe2\x80\x9d Abu Mazen told us last night.\nHe invited a group of journalists from the Israeli media outlets to his office in the mukataa.  As usual with the Palestinians, it was difficult to decipher the message, to determine what the media spin was, and why now of all times.  It is reasonable to assume that the assessment by Israeli officials that the Palestinian Authority might soon collapse had reinvigorated Abu Mazen.  You say that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to collapse?  In your face.\nAnd perhaps all he wants is to return the PA to the Israeli agenda, and Palestine to the international agenda.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no negotiations between me and Netanyahu,\xe2\x80\x9d he clarified, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there are daily talks between the bureaus.\xe2\x80\x9d  He refused to say who maintained the relationship on the Israeli side; he was probably referring to Attorney Yitzhak Molcho or to Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai.  But he insisted that talks were being held.  The only name he mentioned was the name of former minister Silvan Shalom.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe would call from time to time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  When we reminded him that Shalom had resigned, he added with a smile: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the past.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe purpose of the talks, Abu Mazen said, was to arrange a meeting between him and Netanyahu, and perhaps beforehand a preparatory meeting at a lower level.  \xe2\x80\x9cTwo months ago I approached Netanyahu, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get back to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s bureau denied last night in response to Abu Mazen\xe2\x80\x99s statements that talks were being held.  \xe2\x80\x9cNetanyahu,\xe2\x80\x9d his bureau stated, \xe2\x80\x9cwants to renew the negotiations without preconditions.  Abu Mazen refuses.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAbu Mazen confirmed that he was posing two conditions: a construction freeze in the settlements and implementation of the fourth phrase of the prisoner release.  \xe2\x80\x9cThese are not preconditions,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe entire international community says that construction in the settlements is illegal and is opposed to UN resolutions.  As for the prisoner release, there is an agreement and the Israeli government has to uphold it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe announced two foreign policy objectives for the near future: firstly, convening an international peace conference to discuss the conflict, in the format of the Annapolis conference of 2007.\nThe conference would promote the Saudi peace initiative, which Abu Mazen supports.  Secondly, an application to the UN institutions, which will be made if and when the committee appointed by the Arab League decides to do so.  The committee consists of Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League secretary general.\nWe asked about the things that trouble the Israelis: The wave of terrorism, the security coordination, the incitement, the assistance that the PA grants to families of terrorists, Abu Mazen\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to recognize Israel as the Jewish nation-state.\nHe did not justify the wave of terrorism; he interpreted it.  He said that the terrorism had broken out now because of: 1. The lack of a political horizon; 2. Settler attacks, such as the murder of the Dawabshe family; 3. The el-Aksa Mosque affair.  At this point, he accused Israeli ministers of staging provocations on the Temple Mount, which turn the conflict from political into religious.  The ministers\xe2\x80\x99 statements serve the goals of global terror organizations, which seek to take el-Aksa under their wing, he said.\nThe PA honors the security coordination agreement, he stressed.  We take a lot of criticism over this, but don\xe2\x80\x99t pay attention to it.  \xe2\x80\x9cToday the coordination exists in full,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe prevent terrorism in our territory and prevent the spillover of terrorism into Israel.  What will be tomorrow I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d  The tone he used was free of a veiled threat.  As for the substance, I am less sure.\nHe insisted that he was not inciting.  There was a joint committee on the battle against incitement, he said.  We want to renew its activity but Israel refuses.  As for the salaries he pays to families of terrorists and the commemoration of shahids, he explained these by a law from Arafat\xe2\x80\x99s time and Palestinian culture.  Along the way, he related that the PA was paying a salary to the family of a Palestinian who was executed during Arafat\xe2\x80\x99s time on charges of spying for Israel.  Like the Israelis, Abu Mazen knows that there is always a previous government that can be blamed.\nThe demand to recognize Israel as a Jewish state is an invention of Netanyahu, he argued.  The fact is that Israel did not pose such a demand to Egypt and Jordan when it signed peace agreements with them.\nRamallah by night is a peaceful city, as peaceful as Tel Aviv.  The main streets are filled with cars.  The neon signs of the stores are filled with writing in English.  Like Tel Aviv, but without the terror attacks.  That too is an interesting message that came out of the meeting with Abu Mazen.\n\nNahum Barnea is a leading Israeli journalist for Yedioth Ahronoth.

At the time, former Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi was mentioned as someone who could pull the party out of its morass and lead it back to power (http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/05/netanyahus-new-rival-for-premiership.html) .\n\nProponents of the idea included former minister and then-Knesset member Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and the Chairman of the Histadrut Labor Union Ofer Eini. Both Eini and Ben-Eliezer were close to Ashkenazi, who ranked high in popularity polls. They both believed that he could extract himself from the public imbroglio he had gotten into as a result of his fierce disagreements with Minister of Defense Ehud Barak. Eini and Ben-Eliezer were supposed to be Ashkenazi\xe2\x80\x99s turbo engines, when he ran in the primaries for head of the Labor Party. They planned to present the former chief of staff as an updated version of Yitzhak Rabin in 1992 and of Ehud Barak in 1999 \xe2\x80\x94 former generals appointed chair of the party who managed to bring the party back to power.\n\nAt the time, Eini and Ben-Eliezer also claimed, and rightly so, that the Harpaz scandal (http://www.timesofisrael.com/gabi-goes-down/) (allegedly involving Boaz Harpaz, an associate of Ehud Barak, and forged documents concerning Ashkenazi\'s successor) was only of interest to the press. The story was too convoluted to interest the public and affect its attitudes toward Ashkenazi. Polls conducted at the time, including polls immediately following the release of the first draft of the State Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s serious report (http://www.jpost.com/National-News/State-Comptroller-distributes-draft-Harpaz-report) about Ashkenazi in March 2012, proved that his popularity barely suffered as a result of the scandal. On the contrary, the public remembered him fondly for rehabilitating the Israel Defense Forces after the Second Lebanon War in 2006, with its controversial results. In other words, even after he got himself entangled in the Harpaz affair, Ashkenazi was still a hot political\nitem. He had the reputation of a folksy figure who was not afraid of conflict, but also as someone with moderate political views. In the leadership vacuum in the center-left, Ashkenazi stood out (http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/08/israel-politics-ashkenazi-labor-yesh-atid-lapid-galant-rival.html) .\n\nEven with the law requiring military brass to have a \xe2\x80\x9ccooling off\xe2\x80\x9d period before they enter politics, Ashkenazi would have been eligible to run in February 2014. Nevertheless, he was in no hurry. He enjoyed being courted by politicians, and explained that he would not take any action until the entire Harpaz affair was over. That finally happened (http://www.timesofisrael.com/ashkenazi-pleased-harpaz-affair-over-but-regrets-years-long-probe/) Jan. 20, more than five years after it all began. Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein announced that he would not be indicting Ashkenazi over the Harpaz affair.\n\nNevertheless, it is not at all certain that the former chief of staff will indeed enter politics, and even if he does, it is still not certain that he will do so as part of the Zionist Camp (previous the Labor Party). Eini and Ben-Eliezer are no longer there to pave the way for him, and current Chairman Isaac Herzog has no intention of giving up his seat without a fight. Meanwhile, Herzog made do with tweeting congratulations (https://twitter.com/HerzogMK/status/689819771852963841?lang=he) to Ashkenazi now that the case against him has been closed.\n\nChairman of Yesh Atid Yair Lapid also took to Twitter to congratulate Ashkenazi (http://twitter.com/yairlapid/status/689855054698905601?lang=he) , though in his case it is more than highly likely that a personal conversation was also involved. He has been courting Ashkenazi for months.\n\nLapid is offering him the No. 2 spot in the party in the next elections and naming him as Yesh Atid\xe2\x80\x99s candidate for defense minister. But as we have already noted, Ashkenazi is in no hurry. The very fact that Lapid is so interested in him shows that he is still popular with the public and, therefore, a valuable asset. This is especially true since Lapid suffers from a dearth of security credentials. He needs people like Ashkenazi to draw voters from the moderate right. Then there is the fact that Ashkenazi is of Middle Eastern origin (Mizrahi in Hebrew) on his mother\'s side \xe2\x80\x94 a factor that could help Lapid shatter Yesh Atid\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as a party of Israeli Jews of European origin (Ashkenazi in Hebrew).\n\nThe bottom line is that the Harpaz affair did not destroy Ashkenazi\xe2\x80\x99s public career. He can even use it now to his political advantage by claiming that Ehud Barak and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tried to eliminate him out of fear that he might threaten their status. Furthermore, the attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s decision to close the criminal case against him could become a badge of integrity. Even after the authorities listened to 100,000 recordings of phone calls he made as chief of staff, they found no evidence to indict him. Nevertheless, it is also worth noting that the report released by Weinstein this week refers to a behavior that was allegedly harmful to national security. This means that if Ashkenazi does decide to enter politics, he will need the skin of an elephant to withstand all sorts of artillery attacks. The big question is whether the former chief of staff has what it takes.\n\nCan he contend with a brutal, highly focused campaign against him? The way things seem now, the answer is no. Ashkenazi\xe2\x80\x99s actions over the past few years indicate that he lacks this ability. He is easily insulted, extremely sensitive to criticism and wary of every word written about him. These particular traits only grew more pronounced as a result of the Harpaz affair. In many ways, the former chief of staff is now an exhausted man. It is not at all sure if he still has the appetite needed to wage a campaign for the office of prime minister.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAshkenazi neither looks nor sounds like someone with an urgent need to get into politics and prove something. He needs time,\xe2\x80\x9d a political figure who spoke with him told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity. Fortunately for Ashkenazi \xe2\x80\x94 and for the politicians courting him, too \xe2\x80\x94 there are no elections on the horizon. In other words, he is under no pressure to decide right now.\n\nGiven the current leadership crisis within the political center-left, Ashkenazi will likely be courted by these parties up until the next election. His name will come up again and again as a potential partner in all sorts of political alliances, whether it is with Yair Lapid, Isaac Herzog or even Gideon Saar of the Likud. After all, they all share one main objective: removing Netanyahu from power.\n\nMazal Mualem is a columnist for Al-Monitor\'s Israel Pulse and formerly the senior political correspondent for Ma\xe2\x80\x99ariv and Ha\xe2\x80\x99aretz.
