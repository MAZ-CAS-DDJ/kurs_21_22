To quickly retrieve and display your mobile boarding pass, you should save the image on your mobile device.\n\nOnce at the airport, show this mobile boarding pass:\n - at Curbside where available, Self-Service Kiosks or the American Airlines counter if you are checking baggage,\n - at the security checkpoint,\n - during the boarding of your flight.\nIf you forget your cell phone or mobile device, or delete the link to your boarding pass by mistake, you can print a paper boarding pass at a Self Service Machine or American Airlines Ticket Counter.\nFor your convenience, a paper boarding pass has also been attached to this email. If you have access to a printer, you can print your paper boarding pass(es) before proceeding to the airport. The attached document is not a mobile boarding pass and will not be accepted at the security checkpoint if displayed from your mobile device.\n\nThank you for choosing American Airlines.'
