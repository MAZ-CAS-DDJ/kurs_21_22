Are there any goods or services that should not be bought or sold? Are there any market activities that should be prohibited because they undermine human dignity? Are there certain types of transactions that are by their nature immoral?\nThe Georgetown Institute for the Study of Markets and Ethics has invited leading philosophers, political scientists, and legal theorists to give us their thoughts on these questions. All are welcome to come and hear what they have to say.\n\nFriday, November 21, 2014\nLohrfink Auditorium, Rafik B.
