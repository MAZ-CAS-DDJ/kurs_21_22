Shear; A06\nIt seemed like a great way to counter Obamamania. Sen. John McCain would\nboard a helicopter in New Orleans today, skim quickly over the Gulf of\nMexico and land on an oil rig -- a made-for-TV moment to highlight his call\nfor offshore drilling, an issue that Republicans believe will be a big\nwinner in November. Then came Hurricane Dolly, a Category 2 storm that made\na helicopter ride impossible. And then, improbably, a 600-foot oil tanker\ncollided with a barge on the Mississippi River, creating a 12-mile oil slick\nand causing diesel fumes to waft over the city\'s French Quarter. The trip\nwas off.\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/23/AR2008072303653.html\n*See NYT\'s "McCain Event Is Thwarted by Hurricane*":\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/us/politics/24mccain.html\n\nMcCain and the Safety of Offshore Drilling (Washington Post blog 7/24/08)\nBy Michael D. Shear\n...In an energy speech recently, McCain said that: "As for offshore\ndrilling, it\'s safe enough these days that not even Hurricanes Katrina and\nRita could cause significant spillage from the battered rigs off the coasts\nof New Orleans and Houston." In fact, Katrina and Hurricane Rita caused\ndamage to oil rigs and storage facilities in the Gulf, according to press\nreports and government studies.\nhttp://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/07/23/mccain_and_the_safety_of_offsh.html?sid=ST2008072400049&pos=list\n\nWith Arizona Changing, McCain Focuses on Home (NYT 7/24/08)\nBy JENNIFER STEINHAUER\n...In the sea of uncertainty that defines American politics, presidential\ncandidates have generally been able to count on the residents of their home\nstate, Al Gore\'s loss of Tennessee in 2000 being a notable exception.
