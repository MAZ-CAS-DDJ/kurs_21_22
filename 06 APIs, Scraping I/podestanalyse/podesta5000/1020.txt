After all the help you've given us, and after all of the ads we've run, the knocking on doors we've done, and the mail we've sent, none of it matters unless you get out and vote tomorrow.\n\nThe stakes are far too high for you to sit at home. Imagine, for a moment, that extreme candidates win, who've advocated either cutting the budget for, or downright privatizing the Department of Veterans Affairs. What's that mean to the millions of veterans who depend on VA services? Just the other day, it was revealed that the VA has treated 594,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. More are on the way. Where will they go, if Tea Party candidates like Rand Paul in Kentucky and Ken Buck in Colorado win, and start pushing for a drastic roll back in VA services? \n\nWhat will happen to our troops, if candidates like Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania win, who voted against a $1500 combat bonus for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, but wants to let Wall Street executives escape with their bonuses? Who will speak for veterans, if we lose Senator Patty Murray or Senator Harry Reid, who have always been there for us and fought for us? Or, if we lose our Iraq and Afghanistan veterans in Congress, like Patrick Murphy in Pennsylvania and John Boccieri in Ohio?\n\nYou have the power to determine the course of our nation, and who will help lead it. But, if you sit at home, you're only helping out the extremists who would shred apart government services, even if that means leaving veterans out in the cold.  Is that really a price you're willing to pay?\n\nThose of us who formed VoteVets.org fought to preserve our freedoms, including the right to vote. We know many who have died on the battlefield for that cause, as many have done before us. Please, don't waste your chance to have your say. Don't dishonor those who fought in uniform to protect that right. *Tomorrow, go vote, and please forward this message on to everyone you know.*\n\nSincerely,\nJon Soltz\nIraq War Veteran\nChairman, VoteVets.org \n\n\nPaid for by VoteVets.org Action Fund\nNot Authorized By Any Candidate or Candidate's Committee\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n\nVoteVets.org \n\n [ http://www.facebook.com/pages/VoteVetsorg/8501031021 ]  [ http://www.twitter.com/votevets ]  [ http://www.youtube.com/votevets ] \n\nYou are subscribed to this list as john.podesta@gmail.com.
