I\xe2\x80\x99m pasting\nit below.  As you\xe2\x80\x99ll see, it strongly backs up what Secretary Clinton will\npropose, and say, today.  I\xe2\x80\x99m also attaching a polling memo that delves\ninto the findings a bit more.\n\n\n\nWe have gotten intel that Neil Cavuto plans to ask a veterans question of\nthe GOP candidates tonight.  As you can guess, the candidates are very\nlikely to attack the Secretary in their answers.\n\n\n\nYour press team, therefore, may find it useful to get this to reporters, as\nindependent, scientific evidence that veterans are closer to the Secretary,\nthan Republicans, on these issues.\n\n\nNow that the poll is public I have attached the polling memo below.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nJon\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/benefits/veterans/2015/11/10/vetvoice-poll-privatization-va-services/75506102/\n\n\n\n\n\n*Poll: Veterans oppose plans to \'privatize\' VA*\n\n\n\n\n\nVeterans like choice.\n\nBut they don\'t like privatization.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the bottom line from a new poll out Tuesday from the Vet Voice\nFoundation, designed to counter recent proposals that left-leaning\nadvocates say would move Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals to an\noutsourced, privatization model.\n\nThe poll of 800 veterans, conducted jointly by a Republican-backed firm and\na Democratic-backed one, found that almost two-thirds of survey respondents\noppose plans to replace VA health care with a voucher system, an idea\nbacked by some Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVeterans overwhelmingly feel that health care was a promise made for their\nservice and oppose vouchers that may not cover all costs,\xe2\x80\x9d group officials\nsaid in their report. \xe2\x80\x9cVeterans worry that private insurance companies care\ntoo much about profit and would make decisions for the care of veterans\nbased on money.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe results push back poll numbers released by Concerned Veterans for\nAmerica last month that found nearly 90 percent of veterans surveyed\nbelieve officials need to increase health care choices for VA patients,\nincluding expanded access to private care physicians.\n\nThey also point to a larger fight between Republicans and Democrats over VA\nreform efforts, and how each side is labeling moves to expand health care\nofferings for veterans in the private sector, but still at government\nexpense.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis poll confirms what nearly every veterans service organization has\nalways said \xe2\x80\x94 privatization and voucherization of the VA is a nonstarter\nfor veterans,\xe2\x80\x9d said retired Army Maj. Gen. Paul Eaton, managing director of\nthe Vet Voice Foundation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a lot of debate about \xe2\x80\x98choice\xe2\x80\x99 in veterans care, but when\npresented with the details of what \xe2\x80\x98choice\xe2\x80\x99 means, veterans reject it,"\nEaton said. "They overwhelmingly believe that the private system will not\ngive them the quality of care they and veterans like them deserve.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe new Vet Voice poll also hints that the issue could be a factor in the\n2016 elections, with 57 percent of those surveyed stating they would be\nless likely to vote for candidates who support "privatizing the VA health\ncare system.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOnly one in four said that stance would strengthen their support for a\ncandidate.\n\nMajor veterans advocates have long opposed proposals for privatization, but\nhave been more cautious in their use of the term in recent years, as\nlawmakers have backed initiatives to increase private care access, like the\nChoice Card program.\n\nFull details of the poll are available on the foundation\xe2\x80\x99s website\n<http://www.vetvoicefoundation.org/press/VVF-Polling-Memo-151109-Veteransv2.pdf>\n.\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n[image: Avast logo] <http://www.avast.com/>\n\nThis email has been checked for viruses by Avast antivirus software.\nwww.avast.com\n'
