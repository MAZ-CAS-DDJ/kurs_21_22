Choose well. There is\nmuch at stake.\n\n[some straight talk:] These are hard times. Our economy is in crisis.\nFinancial markets are collapsing. Credit is drying up. Your savings are in\ndanger. Your retirement is at risk. Jobs are disappearing. The cost of\nhealth care, your children\'s college, gasoline and groceries are rising all\nthe time with no end in sight. While your most important asset -- your home\n-- is losing value every day.\n\nAmericans are fighting in two wars. We face many enemies in this dangerous\nworld, and they are waiting to see if our current troubles will permanently\nweaken us.\n\nThe next President won\'t have time to get used to the office. He won\'t have\nthe luxury of studying up on the issues before he acts. He will have to act\nimmediately.  [cheers] And to do that, he will need experience, courage,\njudgment and a bold plan of action to take this country in a new direction. We\ncannot spend the next four years as we have spent much of the last eight:\nwaiting for our luck to change. The hour is late; our troubles are getting\nworse; our enemies watch. We have to act immediately. We have to change\ndirection now. We have to fight. [And you and I know how to do that]\n\nI\'ve been fighting for this country since I was seventeen years old, and I\nhave the scars to prove it. If [you elect me] President, I will fight to\ntake America in a new direction from my first day in office until my last.\nI\'m not afraid of the fight, I\'m ready for it.\n\nI\'m not going to spend $700 billion dollars of your money just bailing out\nthe Wall Street bankers and brokers who got us into this mess. I\'m going to\nmake sure we take care of the people who were devastated by the excesses of\nWall Street and Washington. I\'m going to spend a lot of that money to bring\nrelief to you, and I\'m not going to wait sixty days to start doing it.\n\nI have a plan to protect the value of your home and get it rising again by\nbuying up bad mortgages and refinancing them so if your neighbor defaults he\ndoesn\'t bring down the value of your house with him.\n\nI have a plan to let retirees and people nearing retirement keep their money\nin their retirement accounts longer so they can rebuild their savings.\n\nI have a plan to rebuild the retirement savings of every worker.\n\nI have a plan to hold the line on taxes and cut them [cheers] to make\nAmerica more competitive and create jobs here at home.\n\nRaising taxes makes a bad economy much worse. Keeping taxes low creates\njobs, keeps money in your hands and strengthens our economy.\n\nThe explosion of government spending over the last eight years has put us\ndeeper in debt to foreign countries that don\'t have our best interests at\nheart. It weakened the dollar and made everything you buy more expensive.\n\nIf I\'m elected President, I won\'t spend nearly a trillion dollars more of\nyour money, on top of the $700 billion we just gave the Treasury Secretary,\nas Senator Obama proposes. [crowd boos, chants "Nobama! nobama!] Because he\ncan\'t [spend that much] without raising your taxes or digging us further\ninto debt. I\'m going to make government live on a budget just like you do.\n\nI will freeze government spending on all but the most important programs\nlike defense, veterans care, Social Security and health care until we scrub\nevery single government program and get rid of the ones that aren\'t working\nfor the American people. And I will veto every single pork barrel bill\nCongresses passes. [i\'ll make them famous, you\'ll know their names]\n\nIf I\'m elected President, I won\'t fine small businesses and families with\nchildren, as Senator Obama proposes, to force them into a new huge\ngovernment run health care program [boos, someone shouts get your ??? out of\nhere!] , while I keep the cost of the fine a secret until I hit you with it.\nI will bring down the skyrocketing cost of health care with competition and\nchoice to lower your premiums, and make it more available to more Americans.\nI\'ll make sure you can keep the same health plan if you change jobs or leave\na job to stay home.\n\nI will provide every single American family with a $5000 refundable tax\ncredit to help them purchase insurance. Workers who already have health care\ninsurance from their employers will keep it and have more money to cover\ncosts. Workers who don\'t have health insurance can use it to find a policy\nanywhere in this country to meet their basic needs.\n\nIf I\'m elected President, I won\'t raise taxes on small businesses, as\nSenator Obama proposes, and force them to cut jobs. I will keep small\nbusiness taxes where they are, help them keep their costs low, and let them\nspend their earnings to create more jobs.\n\nIf I\'m elected President, I won\'t make it harder to sell our goods overseas\nand kill more jobs as Senator Obama proposes. I will open new markets to\ngoods made in America and make sure our trade is free and fair. And I\'ll\nmake sure we help workers who\'ve lost a job that won\'t come back find a new\none that won\'t go away.\n\nThe last President to raise taxes and restrict trade in a bad economy as\nSenator Obama proposes was Herbert Hoover. That didn\'t turn out too well.\nThey say those who don\'t learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat\nthem. Well, my friends, I know my history lessons, and I sure won\'t make the\nmistakes Senator Obama will.\n\nIf I\'m elected President, we\'re going to stop sending $700 billion to\ncountries that don\'t like us very much. I won\'t argue to delay drilling for\nmore oil and gas and building new nuclear power plants in America, as\nSenator Obama does. We will start new drilling now. We will invest in all\nenergy alternatives -- nuclear, wind, solar, and tide. We will encourage the\nmanufacture of hybrid, flex fuel and electric automobiles. We will invest in\nclean coal technology. We will lower the cost of energy within months, and\nwe will create millions of new jobs.\n\n[btw, next time obama says nuclear plants need to be made safe, take him\nover to one of our nuclear-powered navy ships and ask those men and women.]\n\nLet me give you the state of the race today. We have 22 days to go. We\'re 6\npoints down. The national media has written us off. [boos] Senator Obama is\nmeasuring the drapes, and planning with Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid to\nraise taxes, increase spending, take away your right to vote by secret\nballot in labor elections, and concede defeat in Iraq. [boos] [my friends, i\nwont concede defeat in iraq, i\'ll bring them home in victory and honor] But\nthey forgot to let you decide. My friends, we\'ve got them just where we want\nthem.\n\nWhat America needs in this hour is a fighter; someone who puts all his cards\non the table and trusts the judgment of the American people. I come\n[proudly] from a long line of McCains who believed that to love America is\nto fight for her. I have fought for you most of my life. There are other\nways to love this country, but I\'ve never been the kind to do it from the\nsidelines.\n\nI know you\'re worried. America is a great country, but we are at a moment of\nnational crisis that will determine our future. Will we continue to lead the\nworld\'s economies or will we be overtaken? Will the world become safer or\nmore dangerous? Will our military remain the strongest in the world? Will\nour children and grandchildren\'s future be brighter than ours?\n\nMy answer to you is yes. Yes, we will lead. Yes, we will prosper. Yes, we\nwill be safer. Yes, we will pass on to our children a stronger, better\ncountry. [crowd chants: Yes! Yes! yes! yes!] But we must be prepared to act\nswiftly, boldly, with courage and wisdom.\n\nI know what fear feels like. It\'s a thief in the night who robs your\nstrength.\n\nI know what hopelessness feels like. It\'s an enemy who defeats your will.\n\nI felt those things once before. I will never let them in again. I\'m an\nAmerican. And I choose to fight.\n\nDon\'t give up hope. Be strong. Have courage. And fight.\n\nFight for a new direction for our country.\n\nFight for what\'s right for America.\n\nFight to clean up the mess of corruption, infighting and selfishness in\nWashington.\n\nFight to get our economy out of the ditch and back in the lead.\n\nFight for the ideals and character of a free people.\n\nFight for our children\'s future.\n\nFight for justice and opportunity for all.\n\nStand up to defend our country from its enemies.\n\nStand up, stand up, stand up and fight. America is worth fighting for.\nNothing is inevitable here. We never give up. We never quit. We never hide\nfrom history. We make history.\n\nNow, let\'s go win this election and get this country moving again.\n*\n\n\n\n-- \nSara DuBois\nTracking / Communications Manager\nProgressiveAccountability.org\nsara@progressiveaccountability.org\n202-609-7681 (office)\n410-967-7306 (cell)\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
