john.podesta@gmail.comb'How\'s this for a streamlined version of the barriers section (helpful for those of us who might cut an ad from it) -- starting at the top of page two\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\xe2\x80\xa6..In America, no bank should be too big to fail and no executive should ever be too powerful to jail.\n \nBut we can\xe2\x80\x99t stop there.\n \nWe need to get jobs growing and incomes rising.  Too many Americans can\xe2\x80\x99t find a good-paying job, no matter how hard they try.  People haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a raise in 15, 16 years. \n \nWe need a bold national mission to create millions of jobs in clean energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure. \n \nWe need to deal with high student debt and high college costs.\n \nSo, yes, Wall Street has too much influence \xe2\x80\xa6and so do drug companies, insurance companies and big oil \xe2\x80\xa6and I will hold them accountable.\n \nBut if we were able to get rid of all of their influence tomorrow, there would still be too many barriers for people.  We would still have discrimination in all its forms. \n \nI\xe2\x80\x99m talking about African-American families who [, after generations of discrimination,] have just a fraction of the wealth of white families \xe2\x80\x93 just $11,000, compared to over $141,000 for the typical white household.\n \nI\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the crisis of so many young black people dying after encounters with police \xe2\x80\x93 like Jamar Clark, shot and killed a few months ago, not far from where we sit tonight. \n \nI\xe2\x80\x99m talking about immigrant families lying awake at night listening for a knock on the door, working in the shadows, vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous employers.\n \nI\xe2\x80\x99m talking about women still fighting for equal pay.  Still struggling to get access to reproductive care, while Republicans go after Planned Parenthood again and again.\n \nThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t a single-issue country.  And we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford a single-issue President.\n \nThere are so many barriers holding Americans back \xe2\x80\x93 and we have to break all of them down.\n \nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think our country can live up to its potential unless every single American gets a chance to live up to theirs.\n \n\n\nMandy Grunwald\nGrunwald Communications\n\n202-973-9400\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com>\nTo: Megan Rooney <mrooney@hillaryclinton.com>; Alexandra Fetissoff <afetissoff@hillaryclinton.com>\nCc: Corey Ciorciari <cciorciari@hillaryclinton.com>; Scott Hogan <shogan@hillaryclinton.com>; Speech Drafts <speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com>; Speech Book <speechbook@hillaryclinton.com>\nSent: Fri, Feb 12, 2016 3:37 pm\nSubject: RE: REVISED DRAFT: tonight\'s dinner in MN\n\n\n\nOn page 2 after We can\xe2\x80\x99t stop there --- We do need to DEAL with the Banks and Wall Street ---   I would rather not have the word \xe2\x80\x9ctalk\xe2\x80\x9d associated with Wall Street.

Governor Mark Dayton\xe2\x80\x99s paid parental leave proposal is a progressive step forward and we need more leadership like it across the country. As President, I will work to achieve paid family and medical leave in America so families are no longer forced to choose between a paycheck and caring for a loved one, be it a new baby or sick parent. Policies like the one I have proposed will help families balance the demands of work and family, and help strengthen our economy."\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nOn Fri, Feb 12, 2016 at 1:25 PM, Corey Ciorciari <cciorciari@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\nRe today\'s announcement, would change this:\n\n \n\n\n"We need to create more jobs for young people, because being out of work at the start of your career can have lifelong repercussions \xe2\x80\x93 and today I shared my plan to create jobs for more than 36,000 unemployed young people here in Minnesota."\n\n\n \n\nTo this:\n\n \n\n\n"We need to create more jobs for young people, because being out of work at the start of your career can have lifelong repercussions \xe2\x80\x93 and today I shared my plan that could help create jobs for the more than 36,000 unemployed young people here in Minnesota."\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nOn Fri, Feb 12, 2016 at 2:01 PM, Megan Rooney <mrooney@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\nLatest attached.\n\n\n \n\nOn Fri, Feb 12, 2016 at 2:00 PM, Alexandra Fetissoff <afetissoff@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\nCan someone attach the draft?
