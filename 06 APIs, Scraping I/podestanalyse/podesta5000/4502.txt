In a letter to the Chairman and\nRanking Member, the lawmakers urged the subcommittee to provide\nassistance to households this winter that are facing hardships due to\nrapidly escalating energy costs by increasing emergency funding for the\nLIHEAP program by $1 billion for a total of $3.412 billion for FY 2008.\nIn addition, Senator Clinton today cosponsored the Keep Americans Warm\nAct of 2007, a bill that would provide for the critical $1 billion in\nemergency funding.\n\n \n\n"With oil prices hovering near record levels and energy prices reaching\nall time highs, the emergency funding for LIHEAP would provide critical\nrelief for New Yorker\'s and other Americans who cannot afford to keep\ntheir families warm this winter," Senator Clinton said. "Low-income\nhouseholds disproportionately endure the burden of rising energy costs,\nand we must act now to supply them with the appropriate assistance so\nthat no one has to suffer through the frigid winter temperatures without\nheat."\n\n \n\nBetween FY2003 and FY2007 the number of households receiving LIHEAP\nassistance increased by 26 percent from 4.6 million to about 5.8 million\nor about 15.6 percent of the eligible population.  During this same\nperiod, the federal appropriation increased by only 10 percent with the\nresulting average grant declining from $349 to $305, significantly\ndecreasing the program\'s purchasing power.  Unfortunately, with oil\nprices nearing $100 per barrel, energy prices are not decreasing\nproportionally. In other words, while the cost of heating one\'s home\ncontinues to rise; federal heating assistance will be significantly\nlower. This is why it is essential that the Labor, Health and Human\nServices, and Related Appropriations Subcommittee include an additional\n$1 billion in emergency funding for LIHEAP. \n\n \n\nSenator Clinton has worked tirelessly to increase LIHEAP funding to make\nsure low income New Yorkers are able to heat their homes in the midst of\nrecord energy costs. As early as this November, Senator Clinton called\non President Bush to make available the remaining $20 million in the\nLIHEAP contingency fund (See- \nhttp://clinton.senate.gov/news/statements/details.cfm?id=287872&&), and\njoined several of her senate colleagues in calling on the Office of\nManagement and Budget (OMB) to support a funding level of $5.1 billion\nfor LIHEAP for the FY 2009 (See - \nhttp://clinton.senate.gov/news/statements/details.cfm?id=287040&&).\n\n \n\nA copy of the letter to Senators Harkin and Specter is attached - \n\n \n\nDecember 3, 2007\n\n \n\nThe Honorable Tom Harkin, Chairman                                      \n\nThe Honorable Arlen Specter, Ranking Member\n\nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \n\nand Education, and Related Agencies\n\nCommittee on Appropriations\n\nWashington, DC  20510\n\n \n\nDear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Specter:\n\n \n\n          We are writing to request that you include an additional $1\nbillion in emergency funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance\nProgram (LIHEAP) in fiscal year 2008 to provide for a total of $3.412\nbillion.  We recognize the difficult budget constraints that the\nSubcommittee faces and appreciate your support for additional funding\nfor the LIHEAP program in FY2008 Labor, Health and Human Services, and\nRelated Appropriations Conference Report that was vetoed.  \n\n          \n\n          With the price of oil hovering near $100 per barrel, and the\nEnergy Information Administration (EIA) estimating that households can\nexpect to pay between 10 to 26 percent more for heating fuels than\nduring the 2007-2008 winter, states need additional funding immediately\nto reduce the energy burden of families, individuals with disabilities,\nand senior citizens and ensure their health and safety this winter. \n\n \n\n          Between FY2003 and FY2007 the number of households receiving\nLIHEAP assistance increased by 26 percent from 4.6 million to about 5.8\nmillion or about 15.6 percent of the eligible population.  During this\nsame period, the federal appropriation increased by only 10 percent with\nthe resulting average grant declining from $349 to $305.  Unfortunately,\nenergy prices are not decreasing proportionally, but instead continue to\nrise.  As a result, there has been a significant decrease in the\nprogram\'s purchasing power.  According to the National Energy Assistance\nDirectors Association, states are planning to reduce the number of\nhouseholds served by about 15 percent in the absence of additional\nfederal and supplemental state funding.  The result would be a decline\nin the number of households served from about 5.8 million in FY2007 to\n4.9 million.  For these reasons, we believe an additional $1 billion in\nemergency funding is warranted.\n\n \n\n          LIHEAP is vital to protecting the public health and safety of\nlow-income families. According to the Children\'s Sentinel Nutrition\nAssessment Program (C-SNAP) out of Boston Medical Center, babies and\ntoddlers who live in energy insecure households are more likely to\nsuffer poor health, require hospitalization, manifest developmental\nproblems, and lack adequate food. C-SNAP found that when families do not\nhave access to sufficient energy, they may resort to unsafe heating\nmethods and do not have the proper means to refrigerate or prepare food\nfor their children.  In addition, without a sufficient LIHEAP benefit,\nseniors living on fixed incomes often have to decide between buying\nlife-saving prescriptions and paying utility bills.  For individuals and\nhouseholds that may have to face these difficult choices, LIHEAP makes a\nreal difference in their ability to cope with adverse circumstances.  \n\n \n\n          Moreover, the program helps low-income homeowners weatherize\ntheir homes to save energy and lower their energy burden.\nWeatherization, on average, reduces heating bills by 31 percent and\noverall energy bills by $200 to $250 per year. \n\n \n\n          Thank you for your consideration.  We look forward to working\nwith you to increase funding for the LIHEAP program to ensure that\nlow-income seniors, individuals with disabilities, and families have the\nresources that they need to stay warm this winter.  \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\n \n\n###\n\n\t\n\t\n\t \t \t\n'
