Surely this could not be the case. \n\nLow and behold a recent poll of presidential candidates (and some current and former office holders) by Pulitzer Prize-winner PolitiFact bore this out, as the leading liars were Ben Carson, Donald Trump, and Ted Cruz (the top three GOP candidates according to most of the polls) \xe2\x80\xa6then came Dick Cheney, Rick Santorum, Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, and so on \xe2\x80\xa6. The most honest candidates by far were the Democrats \xe2\x80\xa6 Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, and Bill Clinton.\n\nSo I decided to put together my own list of what I consider to be lies told by Republicans, as well as significant policy positions \xe2\x80\x94 most of which involved outright lies \xe2\x80\x94 that turned out to be very wrong. Some are worse than others. Some are more important than others. Almost all are simply out and out lies that are told again and again by not just these candidates but also Fox News (which each year heads the list of news organizations that lie the most), Limbaugh, the Drudge Report, etc.\n\nContinue\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nBuilding Our Democratic Message for 2016\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nAssumed Guilty: Driving while Black\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nGovernor & Legislators need to show some Political Courage\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe facts from a proud Planned Parenthood Family Member\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nParis Climate Deal: A win for President Obama, Democrats and the World\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nIowa Daily Democrat (\xe2\x80\x9cIDD\xe2\x80\x9d) is published by the Clarion News Service, LLC.
