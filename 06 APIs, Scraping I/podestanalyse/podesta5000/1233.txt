john.podesta@gmail.comb"John - \n\nAs an Iraq War veteran and Colorado resident, I was happy to see over 90% of VoteVets supporters choose to fight back against the NRA-backed recalls and stand up for State Senator John Morse in Colorado.\n\nSo that's what we're going to do.\n\nElection Day is in three weeks, and we're on the air in a big way in Colorado defending John Morse, who has been a champion for veterans throughout his time in office.\n\nWatch the ad and help keep us on the air.\n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/recall\n\nThese recall elections are a chance to show legislators across the country that we'll stand with those who take action to reduce gun violence.\n\nIf we beat the NRA here, we'll send a message that begins to dismantle the culture of fear the NRA has fostered in Congress and state capitals around the country. That's why we're asking people to vote NO on this recall.\n\nThank you for standing with us,\n\nGarett Reppenhagen\nIraq War Veteran\nVoteVets.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/unsubscribe\nPaid for by VoteVets Action Fund\n\n"
