This evening, IRS disclosures reveal that News Corporation gave another check, time for $250,000<http://thinkprogress.org/2010/10/07/murdoch-shareholder/>, bringing his total donation amount to $1,250,000. Other donors include Bill Koch, who donated $100,000, Swift Boat-funder Bob Perry, who gave $3.5 million, and right-wing casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who gave $1 million to the Republican campaign group.\n\nNews Corporation chief Rupert Murdoch recently stated that he directed his company\'s donation in order to help his friend John Kasich, the Republican nominee for governor in Ohio. As ThinkProgress\' Ian Millhiser noted, there actually<http://thinkprogress.org/2010/10/07/murdoch-shareholder/> are laws against corporate managers treating a publicly-traded corporation as if it were their own personal bank account. Although News Corporation was founded in Australia, it was recently reincorporated in Delaware and thus must comply with key Delaware court decisions. Significantly, the Delaware Supreme Court determined over 70 years ago that "[c]orporate officers and directors are not permitted to use their position of trust and confidence to further their private interests."\n\n\nJosh Dorner\nCommunications Director, Progressive Media\ntel 202.481.8153\ncel 202.679.7570\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
