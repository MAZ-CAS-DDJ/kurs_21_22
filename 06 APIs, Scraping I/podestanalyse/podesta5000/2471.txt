Professor Anthony Clark Arend will examine the current state of U.S. policy toward the group and alternatives for a U.S. strategy.\n\n\x93Bitcoin and the Payment Revolution\x94 with Professor Jim Angel \n\nBitcoin is not really a currency, but a payment system and an open ledger that can be used for many things. There is a revolution going on in payments, and Bitcoin and Apple Pay are just some of the innovations. Although Bitcoin 1.0 may go the way of Esperanto, blockchain technology has many valuable applications. This session, led by Professor Jim Angel, will explore the payment revolution along with the exciting new applications of blockchain technology.\n\n3-3:50 p.m.\n\n\x93Changing Minds or Just Your Profile Picture: The Role of Social Media as a Source of Political Information\x94 with Professor Leticia Bode\n\nUse of social media has exploded in the past decade. Political campaigns are trying to capitalize on this new medium, but is it working? Who sees political information on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or other platforms? And how does that matter for modern American politics? Professor Leticia Bode will discuss the state of political information on social media and its implications.\n\n\x93Flourishing in College and Community\x94 with Professor Sarah Stiles\n\nA student culture of excellence and ambition can become counterproductive when it escalates to the extent students seriously compromise their health in the name of grades and resume-building. A recent report released by Gallup indicates a person's undergraduate experience has a huge impact on their post-graduate well-being. Professor Sarah Stiles examines the reasons why Hoyas are happier than most and how we can all flourish over the course of our lives.\n\n4-4:50 p.m.\n\n\x93Francis Comes to America: Debriefing the Papal Visit\x94 with Reverend Kevin O\x92Brien, S.J. and John Carr\n\nJoin Kevin O\x92Brien, S.J., Vice President for Mission and Ministry, and John Carr, Director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life, for an animated conversation about Pope Francis\x92 recent visit to the U.S. What did we learn about the Pope and his priorities? What message and challenges did he leave us? What impact will the visit have on the Church in the U.S.? How can we personalize what we saw and heard so that the visit makes a lasting impact on our lives?\n\n\x93The Supreme Court: Law or Politics?\x94 with Professor Michael Bailey\n\nThe Supreme Court plays a central role in vast swaths of U.S. public policy, ranging from criminal justice to gay marriage to environmental policy. Are the justices following the law? Or are they simply using legal language to justify policy outcomes they most prefer. Professor Michael Bailey will discuss the role the Supreme Court plays in U.S. public policy.\n\n\n\nGeorgetown University Office of Advancement | PO Box 571253 | Washington, DC 20057\n\nPlease contact us at alumnirelations@georgetown.edu with any questions or comments.\n\nhttp://alumni.georgetown.edu/olc/pub/GTW/blastmailopt/blastmailopt.cgi?FNC=optout___BR___48126___GTW-20150911163700___VfdCA1/iik2asMCAqpdpG1/EdJQ Unsubscribe/Manage Office of Advancement email preferences | http://alumni.georgetown.edu/links/link.cgi?l=6728953&h=48126&e=GTW-20150911163700 Privacy Policy\n\nThis Homecoming email was sent to podesta@georgetown.edu.
