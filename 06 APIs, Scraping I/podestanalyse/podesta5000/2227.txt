john.podesta@gmail.comb'I was on the plane and late to all this, so if this has been hashed through, i\'ll quiet down.\r\n\r\na few points:\r\n\r\n1.  I think this is too long, which makes getting to the news is harder. We\'re also in a roundtable so i don\'t think you want her going on at this length.  My view.\r\n\r\n2.  I would prefer not to have a wide open statement like this:  And I will never back down from defending President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions.\r\nI think we might see that in a spot.  We should tie her support to  THIS Exec action of the President.\r\n\r\n3.  I would like a clearer, cleaner bite for the big news.\r\n\r\nCurrently it reads:\r\n"So I will never stop fighting for comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship.  And I will never back down from defending President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions.  Not in this campaign.  And certainly not when I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting in the Oval Office.\r\n\r\nIf Congress refuses to act, as President I will do everything possible under the law to go even further.  To expand and enhance protections for families and communities.  To reform immigration enforcement and detention practices so they\xe2\x80\x99re more humane, more targeted, and more effective.\r\n\r\nThere are still too many people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t covered by the recent executive actions who deserve to stay -- like so many parents of Dreamers.  We can fix that."\r\n\r\n\r\nI would suggest something like this ( make sure i\'m okay politically on language, and on policy):\r\nAmerica needs comprehensive immigration reform.  America needs a responsible path to citizenship for the many families who make our country stronger every day.  So not only will i stand with President Obama in support of his executive actions on immigration, but if elected President and Congress refuses to act, i will do everything possible under the law to go further, like covering the parents of  Dreamers.  We can get this done.  We must get this done.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\'m sure i\'m off base on some of the content, but i\'d really like to punch it up and get the bite to jump out a bit more.\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Dan Schwerin [dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com]\r\nSent: Monday, May 04, 2015 7:10 PM\r\nTo: Joel Benenson; John Podesta; Kristina Schake; Mandy Grunwald; Robby Mook; Huma Abedin; Jennifer Palmieri; Jake Sullivan; Brian Fallon; John Anzalone; David Binder; Margolis, Jim; Teddy Goff; Oren Shur; Tony Carrk\r\nCc: Marissa Astor\r\nSubject: Re: Immigration remarks\r\n\r\nHere\'s a revised topper for tomorrow.
