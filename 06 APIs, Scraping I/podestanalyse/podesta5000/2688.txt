john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John,\n\nThis has been another exciting month in the  world of climate\npolitics, so I wanted to send a quick note with a few key  highlights.\nThank you for your continued partnership in this work. As you will\nread from the update below, your investment in LCV continues to help\nbuild real political power for the environmental movement.\n\nOnward,\n\nGene\n\nGina  McCarthy Confirmed to Lead Environmental Protection Agency\n\nAfter the longest  wait for a permanent EPA Administrator in the\nagency\'s history, Gina McCarthy  was finally confirmed with a\nstrong bipartisan vote in the Senate. This is a big, positive step\nforward. We are looking  forward to working closely with her to help\nrealize President Obama\'s vision  for making meaningful progress\non climate change, starting with setting common  sense limits on\nindustrial carbon pollution from power plants.

The investigation,\ndriven by Cuccinelli\'s extreme anti-science agenda, was deemed\nbaseless by the  Virginia Supreme Court.\n\nThe ad also touts McAuliffe\'s endorsement by\xa0the Virginia League\nof Conservation  Voters. They support him for his commitment to\nprotecting and restoring  Virginia\'s natural resources, his dedication\nto a strong renewable energy  future for the Commonwealth, and his\nsupport of Virginia\'s science and research  communities. The new ad,\n"Witch\xa0Hunt," can be viewed here:\xa0http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=5VYHojX4ybRMdoEmgxacaA .\n\nVirginia LCV PAC has  also built the first state LCV online bundling\nsite  GiveGreen Virginia -- to  support candidates in Virginia\nstarting with Terry McAuliffe.

Moreover, young voters overwhelmingly\ndescribe climate change deniers  as "ignorant" and\n"out-of-touch," reflecting the generational divide and\nunderscoring  the disconnect between their real world experience and\nthe politically charged  views of deniers.\n\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=1cyi5DL2xX0fLsXAXcmEgQ\n\nOver the next  several years, LCV and our allies plan to aggressively\nexpose climate deniers  and those opposing any action on the\nissue-a message that our data indicates  will resonate well with\nvoters.\n\nPolitico\'s  "50 Politicos to Watch" Features LCV Staffer\n\nOur  own Navin Nayak, Senior Vice President of Campaigns, made the\nPolitico\'s 2013  list of "50 Politicos to Watch"!\nThe glowing profile of Navin also points out  that "no group has\nplayed a bigger part in [climate change\'s return to  prominence]\nthan the League of Conservation Voters."\xa0We\'re very\nproud of  Navin and our entire team for this well-deserved\nrecognition.

During  a call with the press, they highlighted how the\ndangerous project does not meet  the climate standard set by President\nObama in his sweeping climate change  speech last month and should be\nrejected by the administration.\n\nYou may listen to the recording of the call by going here (http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=nb0TwWAeY27JERh-ILA3Lw ) and I\nrecommend reading their detailed letter to the State Department by\nclicking here: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=6WXTWIr-ed4XbrJEQtik1A\n\nLCV\'s  Capital Dinner a Huge Success\n\nThanks to your  support, LCV\'s annual Capital Dinner in\nWashington, D.C. this past June was a  huge success.
