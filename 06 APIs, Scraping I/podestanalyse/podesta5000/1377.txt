Is it unreasonable to invest 200 millions in a single giant plane if you aren't in War having virtually no enemies on your threshold! I have been trying for latest five years persuading US Administration to attack Narcotic Vegetation in Afghanistan as well as in Central America stopping that way permeation of Drugs into its territory. To my very great astonishment, none of my letters to US Agencies (including the White House) has been responded! Watching TV Program dedicated to US Arsenal Size I learned that many thousands of  Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (very cheap by comparison) are stored Idled in Magazines instead of launching a vehement strike on the Cruel Nine Eleven Enemy preemptively. Several hundreds of UAV could have transmuted world's entire Narcotic Vegetation that supply Heroine and Cocaine for Terror Organizations( for their Enormous Armament Acquisition) to Arid Deserts by Chemical Defoliation from the Air .To my great surprise no response has come meanwhile to my mail box against the interests of the US and Entire Civilization! Could you Intercede US Senators?\nl\n\nGideon Rodeh\n \n\n"
