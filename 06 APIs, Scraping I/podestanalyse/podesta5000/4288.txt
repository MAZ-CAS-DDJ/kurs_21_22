The meeting will begin promptly at 8:00 am and will end at 9:15.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe have invited a select group of leading New York progressives to join us for a strategy discussion about the Role of Media in the 2008 Election.  As you well know, despite significant improvements, progressives still have a tremendous structural disadvantage in this area.  And over the next several months even our best efforts will only reach a fraction of Americans individually.  Most of the information about this election will be seen through the \xe2\x80\x9clens\xe2\x80\x9d of the mainstream media.  The bias of the media is well documented (Eric Alterman\xe2\x80\x99s What Liberal Media or David Brock\xe2\x80\x99s The Republican Noise Machine).  Mitigating this bias is critical to our efforts and doing so now before the 08 \xe2\x80\x9cnarrative\xe2\x80\x9d has been set is one of the most important tasks of the weeks ahead.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to take a look at the Progressive Media USA website - www.progressivemediausa.org <http://www.progressivemediausa.org> .  In the coming weeks, more of their work will be showing up online, but in the meantime, you can check out their latest television advertisement tying together John McCain and George Bush\xe2\x80\x99s economic policies <http://www.progressivemediausa.org/feature/multimedia/#tv> .  Or you can watch one of our web ads, \xe2\x80\x9cPop-Up DoubleTalk <http://www.progressivemediausa.org/feature/multimedia/#web> \xe2\x80\x9d which we just released last week.\r\n\r\nI hope you will make every effort to join us for this discussion.  Rsvp is required and the invitation is non-transferable.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at (212) 868-4080.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAll my best, \r\n\r\nJill\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n************************\r\n\r\nJill S.
