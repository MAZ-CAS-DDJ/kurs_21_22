It was wonderful that you were willing to make such an exhausting trip, given everything else you're doing.  I can tell you we all left revved up to work for Hillary.As I explained, I was a Hillary-pledged delegate to the 2008 National Convention.  But I had been a Hillary advocate since at least 2000, when she was elected to the Senate for the first time in an otherwise disappointing election.  I thought then, and still think, that she was and is the best-qualified candidate in either party to become President.Also, as we discussed, the issue about which I feel most strongly is one that apparently is dear to your heart:  energy, climate change, global warming, and freeing the US from dependence on foreign sources of fossil fuels.I am attaching a position paper I wrote a couple of years ago outlining a national energy policy advocating that energy self-sufficiency be our goal, and that we pursue all alternatives of renewable energy to free ourselves from this addiction, thereby, at the same time, helping to dry up the funding swamp for terrorists.I think this issue is the most important one the US faces, or will face, in the 21st century.  It affects everything we do.I appreciate your interest in my paper, and I hope you'll have time to read it.  It's a bit out of date, I realize, but I believe the basic thrust is still valid.I look forward to working for Hillary's election and to being part of your team.All the best,Chip Seward (resident in Paris as of now) \t\t \t   \t\t  "
