john.podesta@gmail.comb'PIR and I working on draft Q&A now.   Should have to you all to review shortly.\n\nFrom: cheryl.mills@gmail.com<mailto:cheryl.mills@gmail.com>\nSent: ?Saturday?, ?March? ?7?, ?2015 ?9?:?13? ?PM\nTo: Turner, Katherine<mailto:KTurner@wc.com>, Kendall, David<mailto:DKendall@wc.com>, Heather Samuelson<mailto:hsamuelson@cdmillsGroup.com>\nCc: john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>, Philippe Reines<mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com>\n\nHRC is not free until 11pm at the earliest.\n\nIf we have everything done and circualted to her, she would like to do a call tonight.\n\nThat means the 930pm call John/PIR is doing to touch base with the consultants will be a call to say that we are still working through content with her and what time should we do a call with them all tomorrow once we have content she is comfortable with rather than anything more until we have something to share.\n\nIf you all can be free for a call with her between 11pm - 12am, I am inclined to make sure we send her updated material by 1030pm and tell her we will get on with her at 1130pm.\n\nWill that work for you all?\n\ncdm\n'
