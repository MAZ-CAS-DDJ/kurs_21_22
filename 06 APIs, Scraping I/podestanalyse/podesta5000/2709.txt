But with the National Journal naming Sean one of the party's MOST VULNERABLE INCUMBENTS, if we don't raise $15,000 by Thursday at midnight, Congresswoman Hayworth will be back in Washington pushing John Boehner's reckless agenda. Here's what we need to do:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 We need $2,000 to put our volunteers on the ground and convince voters at their doors. Click here to contribute $250 for voter contact.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20141008am-ld&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 We need $3,000 to send mailers to every voter in the district. Click here to donate $500 towards mailers.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20141008am-ld&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 We need $10,000 to counter the Chamber ads and keep our ads on air. Click here to contribute $1000 towards ads.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20141008am-ld&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\nI hate to say it, but if we don't get this done THIS WEEK, we will lose this race. Roll Call says this race is tightening, and we need your help. Let's give 'em everything we've got!\n\nClick here to contribute so we can win.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20141008am-ld&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\n- Maura\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com. \n\nTo unsubscribe from the Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress email list, please click here:\n\nhttp://action.seanmaloney.com/page/unsubscribe/?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\n\n\nPaid for by Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n\n\n"
