john.podesta@gmail.comb'Following up on yesterday\'s conversation below are our top softs asks.  We\nneed to start hitting the traveling network reporters before we do the\nnational entertainment shows.  To make this proposed schedule work, need to\ndo traveling reporters on the August trips (ABC, CBS, NBC, Univision,\nTelemundo).\n\n1.  Top ask:  SNL season opener on Oct 3 - surprise guest spot doing a skit\nto open the show.  Talked to the producers - they will write a skit for her\nand want to confirm asap.  Would need to skip the HRC Gala in DC that\nnight, but this opportunity seems more important given the impact it would\nhave.\n\n2.  Tonight Show in September in NYC.
