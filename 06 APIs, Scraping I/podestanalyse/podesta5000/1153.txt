However, I was\nstruck by his talk on the economy. Similar messages & themes.\n\nThank you. I was born five years after the end of a global war that killed\nmore than 60 million people.\n\nI am the son of a veteran of that war, who flew 35 missions over war-torn\nEurope as a tail gunner on a B-17.\n\nWhen dad returned home, he married mom, and they started a life together.\n\nThey were tenant farmers.\n\nThey were raised during a time of great hardship, and had little\nexpectation beyond living in peace, putting a roof over our heads and\nputting food on our table.\n\nHome was a place called Paint Creek. Too small to be called a town, but it\nwas the center of my universe.\n\nFor years we had an outhouse, and mom bathed us in a number two washtub on\nthe back porch. She also hand-sewed my clothes until I went off to college.\n\nI attended Paint Creek Rural School, grades one through 12. I played 6-man\nfootball. I was a member of Boy Scout Troop 48, became an Eagle Scout, and\nwent off to Texas A&M where I was a member of the Corps of Cadets and an\nanimal science major.\n\nI was proud to wear the uniform of our country as an Air Force officer and\naircraft commander.\n\nAfter serving, I returned home to the rolling plains and big skies of West\nTexas, and I returned to farming.\n\nThere is no person on earth more optimistic than a dryland cotton farmer.\nWe always know a good rain is just around the corner, no matter how long\nwe\xe2\x80\x99d been waiting.\n\nThe values learned on my family\xe2\x80\x99s cotton farm are timeless: the dignity of\nwork, the integrity of your word, responsibility to community, the\nunbreakable bonds of family, and duty to country.\n\nThese are enduring values. Not the product of some idyllic past, but a\ntouchstone of American life in our small towns, our largest cities, our\nbooming suburbs.\n\nI have seen American life from the red dirt of a West Texas cotton field,\nfrom a campus in College Station, from the elevated view of a C-130\ncockpit, and from the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s office of the Texas Capitol.\n\nI served a small rural community in the Texas Legislature, and I led the\nworld\xe2\x80\x99s 12th largest economy.\n\nI know that America has experienced great change, but what it means to be\nan American has never changed: we are the only nation in the world founded\non the power of an idea that all \xe2\x80\x9care created equal, that they are endowed\nby their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are\nlife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOur rights come from God, not from government, and our people are not the\nsubjects of government, but instead government is subject to the people.\n\nIt has always been the case that there has been a social compact between\none generation of Americans and the next: to pass along an inheritance of a\nstronger country full of greater promise and possibility.\n\nAnd that social compact has been protected at great sacrifice. This was\nnever more clear to me than when I took my father to the American cemetery\nthat overlooks the bluffs at Omaha beach.\n\nOn that peaceful, wind-swept setting, there lie 9,000 graves, including 45\npairs of brothers, 33 of whom are buried side by side, a father and a son,\ntwo sons of a president. They all traded their future for ours in a final\nact of loving sacrifice.\n\nIn that American Cemetery, it is no accident each headstone faces west:\nwest over the Atlantic, towards the nation they defended, the nation they\nloved, the nation they would never come home to.\n\nIt struck me as I stood in the midst of those heroes that they look upon us\nin silent judgment. And that we must ask ourselves: are we worthy of their\nsacrifice?\n\nThe truth is we are at the end of an era of failed leadership.\n\nWe have been led by a divider who has sliced and diced the electorate,\npitting American against American for political purposes.\n\nSix years into the so-called recovery, and our economy is barely growing.\nThis winter, it actually got smaller.\n\nOur economic slowdown is not inevitable, it is the direct result of bad\neconomic policy.\n\nThe president\xe2\x80\x99s tax and regulatory policies have slammed shut the door of\nopportunity for the average American trying to climb the economic ladder,\nresigning the middle class to stagnant wages, personal debt, and deferred\ndreams.\n\nWeakness at home has led to weakness abroad.\n\nThe world has descended into a chaos of this president\xe2\x80\x99s own making, while\nhis White House loyalists construct an alternative universe where ISIS is\ncontained and Ramadi is merely a \xe2\x80\x9csetback\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 where the nature of the enemy\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be acknowledged for fear of causing offense, where the world\xe2\x80\x99s\nlargest state sponsor of terrorism, the Islamic Republic of Iran, can be\ntrusted to live up to a nuclear agreement.\n\nNo decision has done more harm than the president\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal of American\ntroops from Iraq.\n\nLet no one be mistaken, leaders of both parties have made grave mistakes in\nIraq. But in January, 2009 \xe2\x80\x93 when Barack Obama became Commander-in-Chief \xe2\x80\x93\nIraq had been largely pacified.\n\nAmerica had won the war. But our president failed to secure the peace.\n\nHow callous it seems now as cities once secured with American blood are now\nbeing taken by America\xe2\x80\x99s enemies, all because of a campaign slogan.\n\nI saw during Vietnam a war where politicians didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep faith with the\nsacrifices and courage of America\xe2\x80\x99s fighting men and women, where men were\nordered into combat without the full support of their civilian commanders.\n\nTo see it happen again, 40 years later, because of political gamesmanship\nand dishonesty, is a national disgrace.\n\nBut my friends, we are a resilient country. We have been through a Civil\nWar, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through two world wars, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made it through a Great\nDepression \xe2\x80\x93 we even made it through Jimmy Carter. We will make it through\nthe Obama years.\n\nThe fundamental nature of this country is our people never stay knocked\ndown. We get back up, we dust ourselves off, and we move forward. And we\nwill again.\n\nI want to share some important truths with my fellow Americans, starting\nwith this truth: we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to settle for a world in chaos or an America\nthat shrinks from its responsibilities.\n\nWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have to apologize for American exceptionalism, or western values.\n\nWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have to accept slow growth that leaves behind the middle class,\nand leaves millions of Americans out of work.\n\nWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have to settle for crumbling bureaucracies that target taxpayers\nand harm our veterans.\n\nAnd we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to resign ourselves to debt, decay and slow growth.\n\nWe have the power to make things new again. To project American strength\nagain, to get our economy going again.\n\nAnd that is why today I am running for the presidency of the United States\nof America.\n\nIt is time to create real jobs, to raise wages, to create opportunity for\nall. To give every citizen a stake in this country. To restore hope, real\nhope to forgotten Americans, millions of middle class families who have\ngiven up hope of getting ahead, millions of workers who have given up hope\nof finding a job.\n\nYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for a reset, time to reset the relationship between\ngovernment and citizen.\n\nThink of the arrogance of Washington, DC, representing itself as some\nbeacon of wisdom, with policies smothering this vast land with no regard\nfor what makes each state and community unique. That\xe2\x80\x99s just wrong.\n\nWe need to return power to the states, and freedom to the individual.\n\nToday our citizens and entrepreneurs are burdened by over-regulation and\nunspeakable debt.\n\nDebt is not just a fiscal nightmare, it is a moral failure. Let me speak to\nthe millennial generation: massive debt, passed on from our generation to\nyours, is a breaking of the social compact.\n\nYou deserve better. I am going to offer a responsible plan to fix the\nentitlement system, and to stop this theft from your generation.\n\nTo those forgotten Americans drowning in personal debt, working harder for\nwages that don\xe2\x80\x99t keep up with the rising cost of living, I come here today\nto say your voice is heard.\n\nI know you face rising health care costs, rising child care costs,\nskyrocketing tuition costs, and mounting student loan debt. I hear you, and\nI am going to do something about it.\n\nTo the one in five children in families on food stamps, to the one in seven\nAmericans living in poverty, to the one in ten workers who are unemployed,\nunder-employed or given up hope of finding a job: I hear you, you are not\nforgotten.\n\nI am running to be your president.\n\nFor small businesses on Main Street struggling to just get by, smothered by\nregulations, targeted by Dodd-Frank: I hear you, you\xe2\x80\x99re not forgotten. Your\ntime is coming.\n\nThe American People see a rigged game, where insiders get rich, and the\nmiddle class pays the tab.\n\nThere is something wrong when the Dow is near record highs, and businesses\non Main Street can\xe2\x80\x99t even get a loan.\n\nSince when did capitalism involve the elimination of risk for the biggest\nbanks while regulations strangle our community banks?\n\nCapitalism is not corporatism. It is not a guarantee of reward without\nrisk. It is not about Wall Street at the expense of Main Street.\n\nThe reason I am running for president is I know for certain our country\xe2\x80\x99s\nbest days lie ahead. There is nothing wrong in America today that cannot be\nfixed with new leadership.\n\nWe are just a few good decisions away from unleashing economic growth, and\nreviving the American Dream.\n\nWe need to fix a tax code riddled with loopholes that sends jobs overseas\nand punishes success.\n\nWe have the highest corporate tax rate in the western world. It is time to\nreduce the rate, bring jobs home and lift wages for working families.\n\nBy the time this Administration has finished with its experiment in big\ngovernment, they will have added more than 600,000 pages of new regulations\nto the Federal Register.\n\nOn my first day in office, I will issue an immediate freeze on all pending\nregulations from the Obama administration. That same day, I will send to\nCongress a comprehensive reform and rollback of job-killing mandates\ncreated by Obamacare, Dodd-Frank and other Obama-era policies.\n\nAgencies will have to live under strict regulatory budgets. And health\ninsurers will have to earn the right to your money, instead of lobbying\nWashington to force you to hand it over.\n\nOn day one, I will also sign an executive order approving the construction\nof the Keystone Pipeline.\n\nEnergy is vital to our economy, and to our national security. On day one, I\nwill sign an executive order authorizing the export of American natural gas\nand oil, freeing our European allies from dependence on Russia\xe2\x80\x99s energy\nsupplies.\n\nVladimir Putin uses energy to hold our allies hostage. If energy is going\nto be used as a weapon, I say America must have the largest arsenal.\n\nWe will unleash an era of economic growth, and limitless opportunity. We\nwill rebuild American industry. And we will lift wages for American workers.\n\nIt can be done because it has been done in Texas.\n\nDuring my 14 years as governor, Texas companies created almost one-third of\nall new American jobs.\n\nIn the last seven years of my tenure, Texas created 1.5 million new jobs.\nWithout Texas, America would have lost 400,000 jobs.\n\nWe were the engine of growth because we had a simple formula: control taxes\nand spending, implement smart regulations, invest in an educated workforce,\nand stop frivolous lawsuits.\n\nTexas now has the second highest high school graduation rate in the country\nand the highest graduation rates for African-American and Hispanic students.\n\nWe led the nation in exports, including high-tech exports. We passed\nhistoric tax relief, and I was proud to sign balanced budgets for 14 years.\n\nWe not only created opportunity, we stood for law and order.\n\nWhen there was a crisis at our border last year and the president refused\nmy invitation to see the challenge that we faced, I told him, \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\nPresident, if you won\xe2\x80\x99t secure the border, Texas will.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBecause of the threat posed by drug cartels and trans-national gangs, I\ndeployed the Texas National Guard.\n\nThe policy worked. Apprehensions declined by 74 percent. If you elect me\nyour president,\nI will secure this border.\n\nHomeland security begins with border security. The most basic compact\nbetween a president and the people is to keep the country safe.\n\nThe great lesson of history is strength and resolve bring peace and order,\nand weakness and vacillation invite chaos and conflict.\n\nMy very first act as president will be to rescind any agreement with Iran\nthat legitimizes their quest to get a nuclear weapon.\n\nNow is the time for clear-sighted, proven leadership. We have seen what\nhappens when we elect a president based on media acclaim rather than a\nrecord of accomplishment.\n\nThis will be a \xe2\x80\x9cshow-me, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me\xe2\x80\x9d election, where voters look past\nthe rhetoric to the real record.\n\nThe question of every candidate will be this one: when have you led?\nLeadership is not a speech on the senate floor, it\xe2\x80\x99s not what you say, it\xe2\x80\x99s\nwhat you do.\n\nAnd we will not find the kind of leadership needed to revitalize the\ncountry by looking to the political class in Washington.\n\nI have been tested. I have led the most successful state in America. I have\ndealt with crisis after crisis \xe2\x80\x93 from the disintegration of a space\nshuttle, to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Ike, to the crisis at the border,\nand the first diagnosis of Ebola in America.\n\nI have brought together first responders, charities and people of faith to\nhouse and heal vulnerable citizens dealing with tragedy.\n\nThe spirit of compassion demonstrated by Texans is alive all across America\ntoday. While we have experienced a deficit in leadership, among the\nAmerican People there is a surplus of spirit.\n\nAnd among our great people, there is a spirit of selflessness \xe2\x80\x93 that we\nlive to make the world better for our children, and not just ourselves.\n\nIt was said that when King George the Third asked what General Washington\nwould do upon winning the war, he was told he would return to his farm and\nrelinquish power. To that, the monarch replied, if he did that, he would be\nthe greatest man of his age.\n\nGeorge Washington lived in the service of a cause greater than self.\n\nIf anyone is wondering if America still possesses the character of selfless\nheroes, I am here to say, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am surrounded by such heroes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey are of different generations, but they are woven together by the same\nthread of selfless sacrifice.\n\nThey are heroes like Medal of Honor Recipient Mike Thornton, who survived\nan ambush by enemy forces in Vietnam, and made it back to the safety of a\nwater rescue, only to find out a fellow team member had been left behind,\npresumed dead.\n\nHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave though, he returned through enemy fire and retrieved\nLieutenant Norris who was still alive \xe2\x80\x93 and then swam for two hours keeping\nhis wounded teammate afloat until they were rescued.\n\nHeroes like Marcus Luttrell, who survived a savage attack on the side of a\nmountain in Afghanistan, losing his three teammates and 16 fellow warriors\nshot down trying to rescue him.\n\nHe is not just the lone survivor, to Anita and me he is a second son.\n\nAnd Taya Kyle, who suffered the deep loss of her husband Chris, an American\nhero. When I think of Taya Kyle, I think of a brave woman who carries not\njust the lofty burden of Chris\xe2\x80\x99 legacy, but the grief of every family who\nhas lost a loved one to the great tragedy of war, or its difficult\naftermath. Anita and I want to thank her for her tremendous courage.\n\nAmerica is an extraordinary country. Our greatness lies not in our\ngovernment, but in our people.\n\nEach day Americans demonstrate tremendous courage. But many of those\nAmericans have been knocked down and are looking for a second chance.\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s give them that chance. Let\xe2\x80\x99s give them real leadership. Let\xe2\x80\x99s give\nthem a future greater than the greatest days of our past.\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s give them a president who leads us in the direction of our highest\nhopes, our best dreams and our greatest promise.\n\nThank you, and God bless you.\n"
