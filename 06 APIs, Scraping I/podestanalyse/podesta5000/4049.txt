On another front, there were some articles at the time of states\npursuing constitutional amendments to ban same sex marriages.\n\n*December 1996: Rev. Lou Sheldon, Head Of Traditional Values Coalition,\nCalled For A Federal Constitutional Amendment To Protect Marriage. *\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98They\nhave stolen marriage,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Rev. Lou Sheldon, head of the Traditional\nValues Coalition, calling opposition to gay union \xe2\x80\x98the central moral issue\nof our civilization.\xe2\x80\x99   Marriage is equally central for many gay men and\nlesbians as a symbol of the one thing they most seek: public acceptance of\nwho they are. Sheldon and other conservatives promised Wednesday to fight\nback with legislation, ballot measures or federal constitutional amendments\nif necessary to protect what he called the \xe2\x80\x98sanctity of marriage.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d [San\nJose Mercury News, 12/5/96]\n\n\xc2\xb7         *Sheldon Said Amendments Would be Necessary To Prevent Same Sex\nMarriage From Being Legalized In States. *\xe2\x80\x9cIf legislative efforts to head\noff same-sex marriage are unsuccessful in California, Sheldon said,\nconservatives will launch a constitutional amendment drive or a ballot\ninitiative designed to withstand judicial scrutiny. The Family Research\nCouncil in Washington, D.C. - calling \xe2\x80\x98activist judges\xe2\x80\x99 like Chang\n\xe2\x80\x98dictators\xe2\x80\x99 - said it would begin a push for judicial term limits to curb\njudicial power. Chang has been a judge for only three years.\xe2\x80\x9d [San Jose\nMercury News, 12/5/96]\n\n\n\n*Hawaii Lawyer Dan Foley: Circuit Court Ruling For Same Sex Marriages Could\nGalvanize Voters To Pass A State Constitutional Amendment. *\xe2\x80\x9cFoley also\nsaid the case, because it is so important, is certain to be appealed to the\nHawaii Supreme Court regardless of the outcome. A Supreme Court hearing\nwould begin in August 1997, Martin said. Another scenario is that a Circuit\nCourt ruling for same-sex marriages could galvanize voters to call for\na constitutional\namendment to ban them. A poll last month by a Honolulu newspaper and\ntelevision station found that 71 percent of those surveyed opposed\nlegalizing same-sex marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d [Denver Post, 3/7/96]\n\n*Louisiana Lawmaker Said He Would Propose A Constitutional Amendment\nBanning Same Sex Marriages. *\xe2\x80\x9cIn the just-completed session of the\nLouisiana Legislature, lawmakers passed a resolution supporting "traditional\nmarriages" between a man and a woman. The measure does not have the force\nof law but is intended to express the will and opinion of the Legislature,\nwhich was limited to considering fiscal issues this year. Sen. Phil Short,\nR-Covington, said he will come back next year with a proposed constitutional\namendment to ban same-sex marriages.\xe2\x80\x9d [Times Picayune, 6/16/96]\n'
