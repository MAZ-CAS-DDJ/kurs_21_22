john.podesta@gmail.comb'Danielle, please clarify one thing, and please share this with Ms. Ryan, your bureau chief in\r\nWashington. CNN just reported that Schweizer is "partnering with the New York Times" for his book, but your reply stated only that the Times had access to some material in the book."  Is the "partnership" limited to Schweitzer giving the Times the equivalent of a review copy of the book, i.e. an advance copy?  Or is there something more that comprises this "partnership"?\r\n\r\nHere is my problem with this that I will write about, once I get the facts correct.  I have no\r\nproblem with a partisan Republican writer/operative writing a book about "Clinton cash";\r\nnor do I have a problem if his sources include Republican oppo research teams; nor do I\r\nhave a problem with Amy Chozick writing a story that cited the book and repeated old news\r\nthat was known before her story which included no new "news" except for the fact there\r\nis a book, even if Chozick\'s story was a de facto book promotion story.  I do have a\r\nproblem with Chozick opining in her news story that the Schweitzer book takes on some\r\ntheoretical importance because he is "partnering" with the Times, Fox News, etc.\r\n\r\nMy problem would be if the NYT has some sort of partnership, relationship, with such a\r\nhard-core partisan book that makes the NYT an effective agent of, or collaborator with,\r\na partisan political operator or operation seeking to influence an election.  The places\r\nthe NYT reputation and clout on the side of a partisan political project, as opposed to\r\nmerely receiving an advance copy and then doing independent news stories.  \r\n\r\nPlease note, a) while I am a columnist who supports Hillary Clinton I have publicly written\r\ncritically of foreign donations to the Clinton foundation, and b) while I am a columnist in the\r\nopinion section of the paper I have higher standards for fact-checking than many beat\r\nreporters in the news sections that cover politics, which is why I am investing the time to\r\nget this story right.\r\n\r\nI am trying to resolve the contradiction between your response yesterday, and Chozick\'s\r\nsuggestion in her story that the Times, Fox News, etc have some "exclusive" arrangements\r\n(Chozik\'s description) with Schweizer  and that these relationships make the book "more\r\nunsettling" (Chozik\'s description).  In law school we called this the "ipsi dipsi", that a\r\npartisan book should have more credibility because of an exclusive relationship with a\r\nnonpartisan newspaper that denies to me that such a relationship exists, which puts\r\nthe NYT in the position of giving its imprimatur to the credibility of a partisan attack, which\r\nI can understand with Fox News but not the New York Times.\r\n\r\nFor now I am simply trying to ascertain one fact: what beyond an early copy of the book\r\nconstitutes the relationship that exists between the NYT and the author?\r\n\r\nMy thanks.\r\n\r\nBrent \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSent from my iPad\r\n\r\n> On Apr 20, 2015, at 1:51 PM, Rhoades Ha, Danielle <danielle.rhoades-ha@nytimes.com> wrote:\r\n> \r\n> Hi, Brent -\r\n> \r\n> Eileen forwarded your query.  \r\n> \r\n> I can confirm that there was no payment of any sort.

In her story about this book dated April 19, your\r\n> reporter Amy Chozick includes the following:  "But \'Clinton Cash\' is potentially more unsettling, both because of its focused reporting and because major news organizations including The Times, The Washington Post and Fox News have exclusive agreements with the author  to pursue the story lines found in the book."\r\n> \r\n> My question to the New York Times is: exactly what is this exclusive agreement between\r\n> Mr. Schweizer and the New York Times?  Is their any compensation to be offered by the New\r\n> York Times to Mr. Schweizer or his publisher, or any compensation offered to the New York\r\n> Times, by Mr. Schweizer or his publisher, in any form?
