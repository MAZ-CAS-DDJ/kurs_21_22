Not even close.\n\nThis year alone, over 15,000 individuals chipped in over 35,000 times online to our Arizona campaign. If that's not grassroots power, I don't know what is!\n\nJohn, we're on the verge of doing something special -- something nobody thought possible -- but I need your help to finish strong.\n\nIf you're able to make one last donation, or even your first, please do it today.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/kirkpatrickq42014?refcode=em_FR_2014.10.31_b2_ak_ldnd&amp;recurring=auto&amp;amount=25&amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=DC&amp;zip=20016&amp;phone=2162818851&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=\n\nThank you so much,\n\nAnn Kirkpatrick\n\nP.S. One more thing. I've lived in Arizona my whole life. I grew up here, I raised my family here, and I've committed my adult life to helping out folks who live here in the first district. I want nothing more than to keep working for you and the issues you care about most.\n\nIf you can help me continue this journey, please send a small contribution today.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/kirkpatrickq42014?refcode=em_FR_2014.10.31_b2_ak_ldnd&amp;recurring=auto&amp;amount=25&amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=DC&amp;zip=20016&amp;phone=2162818851&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis message was emailed to: podesta@law.georgetown.edu\n\nTo unsubscribe from this email list, please paste this URL into your browser: \nhttp://action.kirkpatrickforarizona.com/unsubscribe\n\nPaid for by the Kirkpatrick for Arizona\n\n"
