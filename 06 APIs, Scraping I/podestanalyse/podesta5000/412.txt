john.podesta@gmail.comb'I sent a correction yesterday to what the policy wason foreign contributors\n- it was not a blanket no foreign contributions (though that is what\nhappened in practice); i*t was no foreign contributions for CGI; for other\ninitiatives like CHAI (Aids), CCI (climate change), CHDI (development in\nAfrica), it required approval by DOS/WH to accept NEW contributions (or\nsignificant increase in an existing one)*.\n\nSo question would be - if a country like Germany decides to contribute to\nfunding aids drug that the foundation facilitates through a low-cost\nconsortium, is answer no, the Foundation wouldn\'t do it or yes, it would\nand would immediately disclose it - that is more likely situation facing\nFoundation.\n\ncdm\n\ncdm\n\nOn Thu, Feb 19, 2015 at 7:50 AM, John Anzalone <john@algpolling.com> wrote:\n\n>  regarding the last sentence, does this mean it is the foundation\'s\n> intention is to refuse foreign contributions and adhere to the same policy\n> as when she was SofS or some other hybrid policy?  if it the same policy I\n> would lay that out more starkly and say  the same policy would be\n> implemented refusing foreign gov\'t money so there is no confusion.\n>\n> John Anzalone\n> Anzalone Liszt Grove Research\n> 334-387-3121\n>\n>  PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS: john@ALGpolling.com\n> www.ALGpolling.com\n>\n>  twitter: @AnzaloneLiszt\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> On Feb 19, 2015, at 1:42 AM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com> wrote:\n>\n>    Based on our conversation earlier this evening, below is the statement\n> with the Clintons\' feedback that we can start to push out in the morning.\n> Thanks again to everyone for talking this through today.\n>\n>  "Like other global charities, the Clinton Foundation receives support\n> from individuals, organizations and governments from all over the\n> world.
