In 1996, Mr. Myers helped to found the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and has been with the Campaign since its inception. Initially, he served as its Executive Vice President and Legal Counsel and oversaw the Campaign's legal and advocacy efforts. On January 1, 2000, Mr. Myers became the Campaign's President. In his position at the Campaign Mr. Myers helped to lead the Campaign's effort to defend FDA's assertion of jurisdiction over cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products in 1996. Mr Myers then served as a close advisor to the State Attorneys General in the 1990s when they sued the tobacco industry. He participated in the 1996 negotiations that led to the first ever settlement with a tobacco company, Liggett and Myers, an agreement that broke the tobacco industry's unity and resulted in the release of a massive amount of previously secret tobacco industry documents. In 1997, at the request of the State Attorneys General and the White House, Mr. Myers participated in the negotiations that led to the unprecedented agreement between the tobacco industry and the states in June 1997. He then served as one of the leading spokespersons for the legislative debate related to that settlement that followed in Congress.
