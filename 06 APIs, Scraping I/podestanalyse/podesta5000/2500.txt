Megan is serving on the Board, having been picked through a merit selection process to fill a vacancy. She is doing a great job and is sort of running for re-election, but this is her first time before the voters.  Of course, we are super proud of her and the work she is doing. While you probably aren\'t too vested in the outcome of local California school board races, we hope you can support her candidacy, even at a modest level, as she begins her career as an elected official. Good to get in on the ground floor.\n\nHope to see you at Tony\'s--please let Heather Kliegman know if you plan to attend.\n\nJohn and Mary\n\n\n\n\n----\nPLEASE JOIN\nMARY & JOHN PODESTA AND TONY PODESTA\nFOR A RECEPTION FOR OUR DAUGHTER AND NIECE\n\nMEGAN ROUSE\nCANDIDATE FOR\nDUBLIN, CA SCHOOL BOARD 2014\nAT\n 2438 BELMONT ROAD NW\nWASHINGTON, DC 20009\n\n\nTUESDAY, JULY 15\n6:00 PM - 8:30 PM\n\nHOSTS WRITE/RAISE $500\nSPONSORS WRITE/RAISE $250\nGUESTS WRITE/RAISE $100\n\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION OR TO RSVP\nPLEASE CONTACT HEATHER KLIEGMAN\nHKLIEGMAN@PODESTA.COM<mailto:HKLIEGMAN@PODESTA.COM>\n\nP.
