This pivotal moment led to campaigns across the United States and beyond, demanding an end to police violence and a recognition that Black Lives Matter.\n\nSadly, it takes events like these to draw into focus the sharp contrast between real events and the reports of the mainstream media. The former are deftly obscured by the latter when a specific narrative needs to be woven to uphold the status quo.\n\nBeing bombarded by the willful misinformation of popular news agencies and the uninformed opinions they spread has hammered home to me the importance of a news source like Truthout. Without a second voice or dissenting opinions, we may as well be totally uninformed.\n\nIt's because of Truthout's importance, especially now, that we need your support. The US deserves to know the whole truth of what goes on in our country, paired with empowering calls to action to change our future for the better. Truthout still needs to raise at least $33,000 more to continue our work: We can't do it without you.
