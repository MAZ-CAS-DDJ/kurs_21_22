"Barack Obama, in particular,\r\nhas made it clear that  investing in cleaner energy will be "priority\r\nnumber one" in his plans for economic recovery."\r\n\r\n"Even with the economic crisis rightly dominating the national\r\nconversation, candidates are touting investment in renewable energy and\r\nenergy efficiency technologies as the answer that would jumpstart our\r\neconomy, create millions of jobs, new industries and opportunities,"said\r\nCathy Duvall, Sierra Club Political Director.  "And for the first time in\r\nAmerican electoral history, presidential candidates aren\'t debating the\r\nexistence of global warming but discussing instead the policies they would\r\npursue to curb climate change."\r\n\r\nClean energy has become a defining issue in all of the major battleground\r\nSenate races as well as dozens of House contests. The issue is working to\r\ndraw distinctions between candidates who favor politics as usual candidates\r\nwho took money from Big Oil and voted to give the oil companies tax breaks\r\nand candidates who promise to deliver change in the form of an increased\r\nreliance on renewable power and energy efficiency.  Candidates around the\r\ncountry are introducing voters to the new lexicon of "green jobs", "clean\r\nenergy future,"and "cap and auction."\r\n\r\nFor several years the Sierra Club has been working to build momentum and\r\nsupport among the public and office-holders for clean energy as a solution\r\nto both the economic and environmental problems Americans face.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Club Political Committee\xe2\x80\x99s ran a number of programs focused on\r\ncontrasting endorsed candidates including Barack Obama and his job-creating\r\nclean energy investment plan, with John McCain\xe2\x80\x99s continuing of the Bush\r\nadministration\xe2\x80\x99s energy and environmental policies .  The Sierra Club\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprogram included:\r\n\r\n*A national TV ad and scorecard through an independent program highlighting\r\nthe stark difference between McCain\xe2\x80\x99s proposals to continue rewarding Big\r\nOil while Obama\xe2\x80\x99s plan stops corporate giveaways.  Radio ads were also run\r\nin Ohio and in Spanish in Nevada.\r\n\r\n*An independent direct contact program that\xe2\x80\x99s reached tens of thousands of\r\ntargeted swing voters in key battleground states.  Efforts to promote\r\nBarack Obama and his job-creating plans for clean energy focused in NH, CO\r\nand OH have included 140,248 phone contacts and 478,540 pieces of mail.\r\n\r\n*Our independent canvass knocked on 60,000 doors in PA, OH and VA to\r\ndiscuss Obama\xe2\x80\x99s plans for 5 million new green jobs in the U.S. through\r\nclean energy and fair trade.\r\n\r\n*The Sierra Club is also engaged in an extensive independent canvass on\r\ncampuses in Denver, Colorado educating young voters on Barack Obama and key\r\nballot initiatives in the state.\r\n\r\n*Organizers for the independent program are conducting outreach and voter\r\neducation about the Presidential and targeted Senate candidates NH, NM, CO,\r\nPA, OH, MN, WI, NV and OR.\r\n\r\n*Separately, Sierra Club\xe2\x80\x99s largest-ever grassroots program coordinated with\r\ncampaigns deployed 55 staff and thousands of volunteer Sierra Club members\r\nto the Obama campaign and targeted Congressional races  in 15 states--5\r\nsenate races and 33 house races.\r\n\r\n*Members have also employed their greatest strength the ability to recruit\r\nmore grassroots supporters to engage in the election, by using a\r\ncombination of online organizing tools and existing volunteer structure to\r\nrecruit Sierra Club members from non-battleground states to phone, e-mail,\r\nand travel into swing states to get out the vote.\r\n\r\n*Activists will also be reminding their friends and neighbors to vote using\r\ntext message, via an innovative new website that allows you to "bank"\r\nfriend\'s cell phone numbers for an election day text reminder.\r\n\r\n*An allied organization, the Sierra Club State Action Fund, is engaged in a\r\nnumber of ballot initiatives and issue advocacy campaigns including energy\r\ninitiatives in Colorado, Missouri, Utah as well as development and\r\ntransportation ballot measures in South Dakota and Nevada.  The Sierra Club\r\nState Action Fund provided voter education on energy and water issues.  The\r\nprogram included a total of one million pieces of mail sent, over 200,000\r\ncalls made and, in Colorado, over 190,000 doors knocked.\r\n\r\n*As part of our continuing and growing collaboration with the American\r\nlabor movement, earlier this month the Sierra Club and Working America, the\r\ncommunity affiliate of the AFL-CIO, held conference calls with their\r\nrespective members in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Governor Ted Strickland,\r\nSecretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka, and Carl Pope, Sierra\r\nClub\'s Executive Director joined on a conference call with Ohio members to\r\ndiscuss the importance of good jobs and clean energy in this year\'s\r\nelection. In Pennsylvania a similar call was lead by Pope, Governor Ed\r\nRendell and United Steelworkers President Leo Gerard. Carl Pope and Cathy\r\nDuvall also joined Working America reaching out to their members in Oregon\r\nand Virginia.\r\n\r\n*The Sierra Club is also fighting against Amendments 47, 49 and 54 in\r\nColorado, Amendment 47 is a so-called \xe2\x80\x9cRight-to-Work\xe2\x80\x9d initiative that would\r\nthreaten workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights, workplace safety, and would lower wages;\r\nAmendment 49 would weaken the rights of workers to spend their own money as\r\nthey see fit and make it harder to bargain for better wages; and Amendment\r\n54 would silence the voices of people who work for state and local\r\ngovernment who want to participate in the political process.\r\n\r\n*Sierra Club and its student arm, the Sierra Student Coaltion (SSC)\r\nsupported and engaged in Power Vote\xe2\x80\x94an effort spearheaded by the Energy\r\nAction Coalition to unite young "climate voters" behind a platform centered\r\non combating global warming pollution, creating millions of new green jobs,\r\nand ensuring our nation\'s energy independence by transitioning to a dynamic\r\nnew clean energy economy.  The SSC has been active with this effort on over\r\n50 campuses.\r\n\r\n###\r\nOn Wednesday, November 5th, Sierra Club will join with other environmental\r\ngroups to discuss the election results and what this election means for\r\nmoving forward with clean energy solutions with a new administration and\r\nCongress.  The press conference will be at 2 PM at the National Press Club\r\nin Washington, DC.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Willett\r\nNational Press Secretary\r\nSierra Club\r\n(202) 675-6698 (w)\r\n(202) 491-6919
