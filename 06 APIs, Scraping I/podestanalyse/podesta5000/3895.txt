Alex.\n\nJust to refresh, Catsimatidis is a billionaire here in the City whose\nwealth is derived from real estate, refineries, supermarkets and airlines,\nand these days he also has a radio program which airs on Sunday mornings.\nDetails below.\n\nI am not quite sure how or if you can help with this, but John told me to\ncontact you.  As you can see from the attached list I have call-in guests\nfrom every walk of life and elected office, but I have not been able to get\nanyone from the administration, largely because I don't know anyone from\nthe administration.\n\nI have calls into almost every cabinet office and agency but so far no luck\nand I would seriously like to balance this program with a few\nrepresentatives of President Obama.\n\nWe tape during the week at the convenience of the guests.  The program airs\non Sunday mornings.  To everyone's surprise the program is growing in\npopularity.\n\nSo I will leave it at this.  If there is anyway you can help, or extend\nsome credibility to his call, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\n9-10am EST Sundays\n\nJohn Catsimatidis radio\n\n970AM Radio dial New York\n\nStream: http://am970theanswer.com\n\nLinks: Cats\xe2\x80\x99Rountable past programs <https://soundcloud.com/catsroundtable>\n\nCall in #: 877-970-2999\n\n\n\nDr.  Anthony Fauci, Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious\nDiseases\n\nVice President Richard Cheney\n\nGovernor Rick Perry  R-TX\n\nGovernor Bill Richardson\n\nRabbi Shmuley Israel\n\nU.S. Senator Charles Schumer\n\nGovernor David Paterson\n\nGovernor George Pataki\n\nDonald Trump\n\nGovernor Mitt Romney\n\nGovernor Ed Rendell\n\nUS Senator Bob Portman\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz\n\nVP Dan Quayle\n\nMort Zuckerman\n\nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal\n\nCongressman Paul Ryan\n\nAmbassdaor John Negroponte\n\nFormer Florida Governor Governor Charlie Crist\n\nRev.
