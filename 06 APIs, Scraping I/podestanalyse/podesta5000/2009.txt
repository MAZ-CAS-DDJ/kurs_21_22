The\n> former senator attended a press event Monday afternoon with L.A. Mayor\n> Antonio Villaraigosa on the topic of how to combat homelessness.\n>\n> But a months-long NATIONAL ENQUIRER investigation had yielded information\n> that Rielle and Edwards, 54, had arranged to secretly meet afterward and for\n> the ex-senator to spend some time with both his mistress and the love child\n> who he refuses to publicly acknowledge as his own.\n>\n> The NATIONAL ENQUIRER broke the story of Edwards\' love child scandal last\n> year, when Rielle was still pregnant and Edwards was still considered a\n> strong candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n> Both parties denied the NATIONAL ENQUIRER report and a close friend of\n> Edwards\' came forward and said he was the father of Rielle\'s baby. But\n> sources told the NATIONAL ENQUIRER a far different story - they revealed\n> that Edwards was engineering a massive cover up of his shocking infidelity.\n>\n> Sources came forward after that story appeared and told The NATIONAL\n> ENQUIRER that Edwards and Rielle had met secretly several times, so that he\n> could see his baby and continue his relationship with Rielle.\n> The NATIONAL ENQUIRER learned that one such meeting was set for yesterday\n> and observed the secret meeting.\n> At 9:45 p.m. (PST) Monday Edwards appeared at the *hotel*<http://www.nationalenquirer.com/sen_john_edwards_caught_with_mistress_and_love_child_in_la_hotel/celebrity/65193>,\n> and was dropped off at a side entrance. NATIONAL ENQUIRER reporter Alan\n> Butterfield witnessed the ex-senator get out of a BMW driven by a male\n> companion and stroll into the hotel.\n> Said Butterfield: "Edwards was not carrying anything. He walked in alone.\n> He was wearing a blue dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up. He was looking\n> around nervously before he entered the hotel.\n>\n> "Once inside, he interestingly bypassed the lobby and ducked down a side\n> stairs to go to the bottom floor to catch the elevator up - rather than\n> taking the elevator in the main lobby. He went out of his way not to be\n> seen."\n> Meanwhile, Reille had reserved rooms 246 and 252 under the name of the\n> friend who had accompanied her from Santa Barbara, Bob McGovern. Reille was\n> in one room and McGovern was in another with her baby. This allowed her and\n> Edwards to spend time alone, a source revealed.\n>\n> Edwards went out of the hotel briefly with Reille, was observed by the\n> NATIONAL ENQUIRER and then went back to her room, where he stayed until\n> attempting to sneak out of the hotel unseen at 2:40 a.m. (PST). But when he\n> emerged alone from an elevator into the hotel basement he was greeted by\n> several reporters from the NATIONAL ENQUIRER.\n>\n> Senior NATIONAL ENQUIRER Reporter Alexander Hitchen asked Edwards why he\n> was visiting Rielle and whether he was ready to confirm that he was the\n> father of her baby.\n> Shocked to see a reporter, and without saying anything, Edwards ran up the\n> stairs leading from the hotel basement to the lobby. But, spotting a\n> photographer, he doubled back into the basement. As he emerged from the\n> stairwell, reporter Butterfield asked questioned him about his hookup with\n> Reille.\n>\n> Edwards did not answer and then ran into a nearby restroom. He stayed\n> inside for about 15 minutes, refusing to answer questions from the NATIONAL\n> ENQUIRER about what he was doing in the hotel. A group of *hotel security*<http://www.nationalenquirer.com/sen_john_edwards_caught_with_mistress_and_love_child_in_la_hotel/celebrity/65193>men eventually escorted him from the men\'s room, while preventing the\n> NATIONAL ENQUIRER reporters from following him out of the hotel.\n>\n> Said reporter Hitchen: "After we confronted him about seeing Rielle,\n> Edwards looked like a deer caught in headlights!\n>\n> "He was clearly surprised that we had caught him at this very late hour\n> inside the hotel.\n>\n> \\ "Some guests up at this late hour watched the spectacle in amusement from\n> a staircase nearby."\n>\n> Meanwhile, Rielle\'s friend McGovern also refused to answer any questions\n> from the NATIONAL ENQUIRER or offer any explanation for her meeting with\n> Edwards.\n> The Edwards "love child" scandal drew international press attention after\n> the NATIONAL ENQUIRER published a blockbuster investigation about the\n> politician in our Dec. 31, 2007 print edition.\n> We reported that Rielle, a woman linked to Edwards in a cheating scandal\n> earlier last year, was more than six months pregnant - and we reported that\n> she told a close confidante that Edwards was the father of her baby!\n> Edwards denied the affair and that he was the father, and in a bizarre\n> twist, a close friend of his, Alexander Young, said he was the father.\n> Young, 41, was married at the time with three children. The NATIONAL\n> ENQUIRER has learned he still is married.\n> Sources told the NATIONAL ENQUIRER exclusively that Edwards had engineered\n> a massive cover up of the affair and love child scandal and that Young was\n> taking the blame for his good friend. At the time Rielle had been relocated\n> from the *New York*<http://www.nationalenquirer.com/sen_john_edwards_caught_with_mistress_and_love_child_in_la_hotel/celebrity/65193>area to Chapel Hill in Edwards\' home state of North Carolina, where she was\n> living in an upscale gated community down the street from Young. Strangely,\n> Young even had Rielle to his house for dinner with his wife and kids, the\n> NATIONAL ENQUIRER has learned.\n>\n> Young has been extremely close to Edwards for years and was a key official\n> in his presidential campaign.\n>\n> Rielle is a self-described filmmaker whose company was hired by a\n> pro-Edwards group called One America Committee. She was paid $114,000 to\n> produce videos for Edwards\' campaign and worked with him on those videos.\n> Reporters from other media outlets asked Edwards about The NATIONAL\n> ENQUIRER report during a campaign stop in Columbia, S.C.\n> Edwards responded: "The story is false. It\'s completely untrue,\n> ridiculous," adding: "Anyone who knows me knows that I have been in love\n> with the same woman for 30-plus years."\n> Rielle issued her own statement, saying in part: "The innuendos and lies\n> that have appeared on the Internet and in the NATIONAL ENQUIRER concerning\n> John Edwards are not true, completely unfounded and ridiculous."\n> But a source told the NATIONAL ENQUIRER: "Now that it seems to have blown\n> wide open, Rielle may get her wish - all she wants is for John to marry her\n> and for them to live happily ever after with their baby. She\'s tired of\n> running and living a lie."\n>\n> A representative for Reille had no comment on last night\'s meeting with\n> Edwards.\n>\n'
