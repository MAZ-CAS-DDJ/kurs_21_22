Last year the room was overflowing, with CSPAN broadcasting it live.\n\nToday Ebola is still present in West Africa, but we have realistic hopes of bringing an end to the crisis. Currently, no less than four global commissions are proposing fundamental reforms of global health security and the World Health Organization, including a High Level United Nations Panel. (I sit on two of these Commissions). Please join us tomorrow for a serious conversation with global health leaders about the lessons learned from Ebola and how to keep America and the world safe from pandemic threats.\n\nWith warm wishes, Larry\nJoin us for the O'Neill Institute Colloquium Wednesdays this semester from 1:20-3:20pm\n\nIs this email not displaying correctly?\nView it in your browser<http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=4f05dfd600&e=3596deea0c>.\n\n\n\n[O'Neill Institute]<http://georgetown.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=b66ae30f20&e=3596deea0c>\n\nO\x92Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law Colloquium:\n\nEbola Post-Crisis: Lessons for Improving Global Health Security\n\nWednesday, September 16, 2015\n1:20 \x96 3:20 p.m.\n\nGeorgetown University Law Center\nFaculty Dining Room, Hotung Room 2001\n550 First Street, NW\nWashington, DC 20001\n\nThe Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa ultimately spurred an unprecedented response, yet also revealed the incoherence and inequity of the global health system. During a roundtable conversation, panelists will discuss the current state of the epidemic; the weaknesses in the preparedness of national governments, international organizations, and civil society organizations to detect and respond to the epidemic; the critical factors that explained these failures; and the reforms that are needed to keep populations secure against future epidemic threats.\n\nPanelists will include:\n\nJ.

The 2015 Colloquium will address two themes. First, at a time of increasing inequality, economic uncertainty, and evolving health and other threats, how can health law and public health be used to foster security\x97personal, community, national, and ultimately global security that leads to healthier populations the world over? And, second, what are the roles of different stakeholders in effecting policy change and how can lawyers and others advance change through different roles, whether as government policymakers, community advocates, researchers, or litigators?\n\nThe O\x92Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University is the premier center for health law, scholarship, and policy. Its mission is to contribute to a more powerful and deeper understanding of the multiple ways in which law can be used to improve the public\x92s health, using objective evidence as a measure. The O\x92Neill Institute seeks to advance scholarship, science, research, and teaching that will encourage key decision-makers in the public, private, and civil society to employ the law as a positive tool for enabling more people in the United States and throughout the world to lead healthier lives.\n\nThe O'Neill Institute Colloquium is open to all students, faculty, staff, and interested members of the public.\n\nThe hashtag for this event is #oneillcolloquium.\n\nFor more information on O\x92Neill Institute events, please visit http://www.law.georgetown.edu/oneillinstitute/<http://georgetown.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=21cf1417dd&e=3596deea0c>.\n\n\n\n\n[Blog]<http://georgetown.us5.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=f9fe7c4a39&e=3596deea0c>  [Facebook] <http://georgetown.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=e4405018f6&e=3596deea0c>   [Twitter] <http://georgetown.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=af6f607946&e=3596deea0c>   [RSS] <http://georgetown.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5556647df8c0be7cf0da07db2&id=5fc52f6439&e=3596deea0c>\n\nCopyright \xa9 2015 The O\x92Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.
