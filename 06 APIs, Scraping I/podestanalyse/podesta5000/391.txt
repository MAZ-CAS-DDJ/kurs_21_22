(AHN) - Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Barack Obama (D-IL)\nwill both be participating at a forum on volunteerism and community service\nset for Sept. 11.\n\nThe candidates will discuss separately their plans and thoughts about "the\nrole of citizenship and service in post-9/11 America" on the first night of\nthe forum. The two-day summit, called "A Nation of Service," will coincide\nwith the the seventh anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, and the\nannual "Tribute in Light"ceremony near Ground Zero. It will be moderated by\nTime magazine managing editor Richard Stengel.\n\n"The Summit will be an important remembrance of those that made the ultimate\nsacrifice serving their country and others as we focus on how to inspire\nothers to serve causes greater than their own self-interest through national\nand community service," McCain told WNBC.\n\n"After Sept. 11, Americans of every age, race, region and walk of life were\nready to step up and answer a new call of service for their country...\nMaking that call to service will be a central cause of my presidency, "Obama\nis quoted by the NY Daily News.\n\nBoth candidates have pledged to stop running negative campaign ads on the\nanniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks after a non-profit group,\nMyGoodDeed.org, asked them to impose a moratorium to mark the day, according\nto ABC.\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Sep 4, 2008 at 12:04 AM, Adam Jentleson <\nAjentleson@americanprogress.org> wrote:\n\n>\n> Aren\'t both candidates speaking at a service forum on 9/11?\n>\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: bigcampaign@googlegroups.com on behalf of Eric Schmeltzer\n> Sent: Wed 9/3/2008 11:57 PM\n> To: \'Jacob Roberts\'; pbarry122@gmail.com\n> Cc: \'big campaign\'\n> Subject: [big campaign] Re: Insulting Community Organizers?\n>\n> I\'d find how many community organizers in the RELIGIOUS community there\n> are, and tie that to the "no responsibility" line.
