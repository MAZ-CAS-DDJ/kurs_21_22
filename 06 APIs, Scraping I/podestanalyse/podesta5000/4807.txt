Silly us; turns out that money\nisn\'t all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the\nelectoral process.  Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats\nand repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas,\nfree-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we\'re off and\nrunning. JFK, Jr would be delighted by all this as his "George" magazine saw\ncelebrity politics coming.  The magazine struggled as it was ahead of its\ntime but now looks prescient.  George, of course, played the development\npretty lightly, basically for charm and gossip, like People, but what we are\ndealing with now is dead serious.  How does this get handled in the general?\nSecretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump,\nKardashian mold; what can she do to offset this?  I\'m certain the\npoll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the\nconventions are over, but I think not.  And as I\'ve mentioned, we\'ve all\nbeen quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire\nto produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.  The unawareness remains\nstrong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly.  This problem demands\nsome serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven,\ndemographically-inspired messaging.\n\n \n\nRubio\'s press conference yesterday AM was good and should be repeated in its\nentirety, not just in nibbles.  I will attend the Clinton fundraiser here\nnext week but as I can only afford the low level of participation may just\nget to wave without a "hello."\n\n \n\nI fear we are all now trying to navigate a set of forces that cannot be\nsimply explained or fully understood, so it is and will reamin interesting!\n\n \n\nSent with a handshake,\n\n \n\nBill\n\n'
