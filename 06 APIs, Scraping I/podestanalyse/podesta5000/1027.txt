john.podesta@gmail.comb'Since 1994, I have, after each election cycle was over, written a long\nanalysis of the election results, going intensely into exit polls,\nturnout numbers, pre- and post-election polling, and other data and\nanalyses I was able to track down. The first time I did it, it was for\nmy fellow White House staffers and a few other friends and political\nallies, but since I know a lot of intense political junkies, the list of\npeople getting it kept expanding cycle-by-cycle to now include several\nhundred of you. I was looking forward to digging into this year\'s happy\nnumbers, and writing another 30-40 page tome for you again this year,\nbut what I have realized is that the election cycles since 1994 have had\none thing in common: none of them had a Democratic Presidential\ntransition to deal with.\n\n \n\nHappily, however, this one does. And because I am honored to be a part\nof it, serving as an adviser to the transition team in the area of\npublic liaison, I won\'t be able to do my usual post-election analysis.\nIf you are looking for great places to read to get your numbers\ncrunching, political junkie fix, I highly recommend the following\nsources.\n\n \n\nCampaign For America\'s Future/Democracy Corps Polling Report\n\nhttp://www.ourfuture.org/report/2008114507/change-election-2008\n\n \n\nOpenLeft.com\'s Chris Bowers on Obama\'s performance among the key groups\nthat voted Democratic in 2006\n\nhttp://www.openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=9729\n\n \n\nOpenLeft.com\'s Chris Bowers on demographic shifts from 2004 to 2008\n\nhttp://www.openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=9756\n\n \n\nDailyKos.com\'s DemFromCT Debunking the "Myths and Tall Tales" of the\n2008 election\n\nhttp://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/11/6/191435/160/814/656186\n\n \n\nNathan Newman at TalkingPointsMemo discussing state-level victories\n\nhttp://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/11/07/big_victories_in_the_sta\ntes_as/\n\n \n\nAs for the transition, I want to encourage you to keep in touch with me:\n\n \n\n-If you are interested in working in this administration, or know of\nreally high-quality people that are, send your resume along.\n\n \n\n-If you have ideas for the new White House, please send them to me.\n\n \n\n-If you have questions or concerns about something going on, please feel\nfree to share them.\n\n \n\nThanks for your understanding.
