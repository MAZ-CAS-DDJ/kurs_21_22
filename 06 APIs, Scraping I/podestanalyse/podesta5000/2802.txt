john.podesta@gmail.comb'Could NSN please explain why this is considered to be a "success" of\nObama\'s counterterrorism policy?\n\n \n\n"A missile believed to have been fired Thursday from an American drone\nkilled the younger brother of a top militant commander in the North\nWaziristan tribal area, according to several Pakistani security and\nintelligence officials, residents in Waziristan and a friend of the\ncommander\'s family."\n\n \n\nThe passage is quoted from this article:\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/20/world/asia/20pstan.html\n\n \n\nThe article also includes this line, which is not included in the NSN\npress release:\n\n \n\n"According to a family friend of the Haqqanis, Mohammad, who was about\n20, was on his way to see his brother, the commander, when the missile\nstruck.  The family friend in the village said Mohammad Haqqani was not\nan active member of the militant network and that his brother had wanted\nhim to pursue religious studies away from the area so that he could lead\na more normal life."\n\n \n\nHow exactly is using a drone to perpetrate an extrajudicial killing,\nwhich then fails to eliminate its target but instead kills an apparently\ninnocent relative, evidence of effective counterterrorism policy?  This\nis not only an instance of an apparent civilian casualty, it\'s precisely\nwhy these drone attacks are inflaming Pakistan and producing easy\nrecruits for the Taliban and Al Qaeda.\n\n \n\nHow in the world is this something to brag about?  Is it now U.S. policy\nnow to assassinate the relatives of militants?  What are we, the mafia?\n\n \n\n \n\nFrom: bigcampaign@googlegroups.com [mailto:bigcampaign@googlegroups.com]\nOn Behalf Of Adam Blickstein\nSent: Friday, February 19, 2010 9:37 AM\nTo: bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\nSubject: [big campaign] Obama\'s Counterterrorism Successes Continue\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nObama\'s Counterterrorism Successes Continue\n\n \n\nWashington, D.C. - This week has seen a wave of successes for the Obama\nadministration and our allies against extremists abroad.  The capture of\nsenior Taliban leadership this week has demonstrated that Obama\nadministration is taking the fight to the extremists, with concrete\nresults.  These successes are part of a longer trend of recent\nachievements in broader counterterrorism efforts, vindicating the Obama\nadministration\'s counterterrorism approach.  Despite these successes\nconservatives see terrorism and national security as a political\nopportunity not a strategy to keep America safe. \n\n \n\nOver the last week, "wave" of successes in counterterrorism and efforts\nagainst militants. This week has seen a wave of detentions of top\nmilitants in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  The Washington Post reports\ntoday that, "Mullah Abdul Salam, the Taliban leader in Afghanistan\'s\nKunduz province, and Mullah Mohammad, the shadow governor in Baghlan\nprovince, were taken into custody in Pakistan about 10 days ago,\naccording to the governor of Kunduz, Mohammad Omar, and a Pakistani\nsecurity official. The two served as part of the vast network of Taliban\nleaders who coordinate the Afghan insurgency and oversee Taliban courts,\nwhich mete out swift and often brutal settlements for local disputes."\nIn addition, the New York Times reports today that, "A missile believed\nto have been fired Thursday from an American drone killed the younger\nbrother of a top militant commander in the North Waziristan tribal area,\naccording to several Pakistani security and intelligence officials,\nresidents in Waziristan and a friend of the commander\'s family."\n\n \n\nThis comes at the end of a week that began with the announcement that\nthe CIA and Pakistani authorities captured Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar,\nwho the BBC says had "overseen Taliban military operations in\nAfghanistan, run the group\'s leadership council, and controlled its\nfinances." The Post article also describes how this string of successes\nwere handled by American officials, saying that these "detentions, which\nhave taken place in a wave since early last week, were initially kept\nsecret to allow intelligence operatives to use information gleaned from\ncaptures to draw additional militants into exposing their locations and\nmovements, according to officials who discussed the ongoing operations\non the condition of anonymity."

Decisions taken by\nPresident Obama as part of the broader U.S. counter terrorism strategy\nhave led key achievements.  \n\n \n\nGaining actionable intelligence without using torture.  Despite the\nrants from right wingers, concrete actionable intelligence was gained\nfrom the interrogation of Umar Farouq Abdulmutallab, without using\ntorture.  As Ken Gude of the Center for American Progress writes, "As we\nnow know, far from being wrong, irresponsible, or dangerous, the path\nthe Obama administration chose for the interrogation of Abdulmutallab is\ndirectly responsible for him cooperating with intelligence officials and\ngiving up fresh and actionable intelligence...The intelligence gained\nfrom Abdulmutallab has been shared widely throughout the intelligence\ncommunity - and has already produced results. On January 21, Malaysian\ncounterterrorism authorities arrested 10 suspected terrorists tied to\nAbdulmutallab."

The\nObama administration\'s revamped effort to work with allies has proven\nfruitful.  This week, Spain announced that it will accept five\nGuantanamo Bay detainees, boosting the administration\'s efforts to close\nthe controversial detention center.  In fact, bringing our interrogation\npractices in line with international increases intelligence sharing with\nallies.  As the Washington Post reported last year, "CIA officers\nacknowledged that some foreign intelligence agencies had refused, for\nexample, to share information about the location of terrorism suspects\nfor fear of becoming implicated in any eventual torture of those\nsuspects."

Michael Isikoff and Mark\nHosenball report this weekend that, "In late January, an Al Qaeda\noperative headed from Pakistan on his way to Yemen was arrested in the\nPersian Gulf country of Oman, a U.S. counter-terrorism official\nconfirmed."  And as a result, "U.S. intelligence officials appear to\nhave obtained access to what could turn out to be a significant trove of\nphone numbers, photographs and documents detailing the links between Al\nQaeda\'s leaders in northwest Pakistan and the terror group\'s\nincreasingly menacing affiliate in Yemen, two counter-terrorism sources\ntell Declassified."

As the Washington Times reported earlier\nthis week, "U.S. and allied counterterrorism authorities have launched a\nglobal manhunt for English-speaking terrorists trained in Yemen who are\nplanning attacks on the United States, based on intelligence provided by\nthe suspect in the attempted Christmas Day bombing after he began\ncooperating."

Ignoring the\nachievements under the Obama administration and the past policies of the\nBush administration, conservatives are attempting to use our national\nsecurity to gain political points.  According to Roll Call, "In a\nmessaging memo from the House Republican Conference, Members were\nencouraged to criticize the Obama administration and Congressional\nDemocrats on a host of national security issues including the decision\nto read alleged \'underwear bomber\' Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab his Miranda\nrights, the plan to close the Guantnamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility\nand the attempt to hold civilian trials for alleged terrorists such as\nKhalid Sheik Mohammed in New York City rather than in military courts...\nIn materials circulated to his GOP colleagues, Senate Republican\nConference Chairman Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) outlined talking points on\nthese issues. \'On national security, we continue to oppose closing the\nfacility at Guantanamo Bay without a better solution for detaining\nterrorists. And we have to make a distinction between an American\nteenager who breaks into a sandwich shop and a foreign terrorist who\nwants to blow up an airplane. Terrorists should be tried by military\ncommissions,\' Alexander wrote in the recess packet." \n\n \n\nThese talking points ignore reality and, instead reverting to radical\npolicies that even the Bush administration saw as necessary.  Richard\nReid, for example, "the 2001 \'shoe bomber\' - was read or reminded of his\nMiranda rights four times in two days, beginning five minutes after\nbeing taken into custody," according to Mike Allen of Politico.  In\naddition, the Bush administration prosecuted around 200 terrorists in\ncivilian courts, according to its own Justice Department records.\nFinally, the interrogation guidelines that Cheney conservatives knock as\ntoo soft were first implemented by Bush administration in 2008,\naccording to John Brennan, who served in senior intelligence positions\nin both the Obama and Bush administrations.  \n\n \n\nLike a broken record, conservatives have hit the air waves and in an\nattempt to politicize our national security. \n\n \n\nHouse Minority Leader John Boehner: "Treating terrorists like common\ncriminals and hoping for the best is part of a Sept. 11 mentality, and I\nthink it\'s a troubling pattern, pattern of dangerous decisions, that\'s\nputting the American people at risk," [John Boehner, via Politico, \n2/4/10\n<http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=cmadbkdab.0.0.olnitxbab.0&ts=S0457&p=http%3\nA%2F%2Fwww.politico.com%2Fnews%2Fstories%2F0210%2F32536.html%23ixzz0fzzX\n6RC3&id=preview> ]\n\n \n\nRep.
