john.podesta@gmail.comb'1)      At a previous transition meeting, there was some discussion\nabout a government reform speech that the campaign was planning to give.\nThat speech was given yesterday in Green Bay and is attached below.\nHere is a factsheet on our proposals:\nhttp://obama.3cdn.net/0080cc578614b42284_2a0mvyxpz.pdf\n<http://obama.3cdn.net/0080cc578614b42284_2a0mvyxpz.pdf> .   Because the\nissues addressed in this proposal affect many of the working groups,\nit\'s worth reading.  \n\n \n\nMuch of this is similar to a speech that Obama gave last year - no gifts\nfrom lobbyists; ban on executive branch officials lobbying the\nAdministration after they leave; all cabinet officials have to do\ninternet chats, etc.  But, there are some new wrinkles.  For instance,\nwe\'re now calling for the creation of a Chief Performance Officer in the\nWhite House to evaluate the results of government programs and determine\nwhat works and doesn\'t work.   Also, we\'re calling for new enforcement\nauthority for OGE.\n\n \n\n2)      Over the past few days, our research assistants have posted the\nfollowing policy promises documents in the general data room:\nfaith-based initiatives; courts; reproductive rights; government\nreform/ethics; and rural/agriculture.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRemarks of Senator Barack Obama-as prepared for delivery\n\nThe Change We Need in Washington\n\nMonday, September 22nd, 2008\n\nGreen Bay, Wisconsin \n\n \n\n \n\nThe era of greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street and in Washington\nhas led us to a perilous moment.  They said they wanted to let the\nmarket run free but instead they let it run wild, and in doing so, they\ntramped our core values of fairness, balance, and responsibility to one\nanother.  As a result, we are facing a financial crisis as profound as\nany we have faced since the Great Depression.  As a result, your jobs,\nyour savings, and your economic security are now at risk.\n\n \n\nThis week, we must work quickly, in a bipartisan fashion, to resolve\nthis crisis and avert an even broader economic catastrophe.  And as we\ndo act, Washington must recognize that true economic recovery requires\naddressing not just the crisis on Wall Street, but the crisis on Main\nStreet that so many of you have been feeling in your own lives long\nbefore the news of last week.  We need a plan that helps families stay\nin their homes, and workers keep their jobs; a plan that gives\nhardworking Americans relief instead of using taxpayer dollars to reward\nCEOs on Wall Street.  And we cannot give a blank check to Washington\nwith no oversight and accountability when no oversight and\naccountability is what got us into this mess in the first place.   \n\n \n\nBut no matter what solution we finally decide on this week, it is\nabsolutely imperative that we get to work immediately on reforming the\nbroken politics and the broken government that allowed this to crisis to\nhappen in the first place.  \n\n \n\nWe did not arrive at this moment by some accident of history.  We are in\nthis mess because of a bankrupt philosophy that says we should give more\nand more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down\nto the rest of us.  \n\n \n\nWe\'re here because for too long, the doors of Washington have been\nthrown open to an army of lobbyists and special interests who\'ve turned\nour government into a game only they can afford to play - who have\nshredded consumer protections, fought against common-sense regulations\nand rules of the road, and distorted our economy so that it works for\nthem instead of you.  \n\n \n\nWe are here because an ethic of irresponsibility has swept through our\ngovernment, leaving politicians with the belief that they can waste\nbillions and billions of your money on no-bid contracts for friends and\ncontributors, slip pork projects into bills during the dead of night,\nand spend billions on corporate tax breaks we can\'t afford and old\nprograms that we don\'t need. \n\n \n\nAnd today, even as Congress debates an emergency plan to save our\neconomy from the verge of collapse, there are reports that lobbyists and\nCEOs are already lining up to figure out what\'s in it for them; to find\nout how they can get theirs.  \n\n \n\nGreen Bay, enough is enough.  \n\n \n\nI began this race for the presidency as the one candidate who hasn\'t\nspent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington.  But I\'ve been\nthere long enough to know this - if we want a government that puts the\nneeds of middle-class families before the whims of lobbyists and\npoliticians; if we want to grow this economy and prevent a crisis like\nthis from ever happening again, then the ways of Washington must change.\nWe must reform our lobbyist-driven politics.  We must reform the waste\nand abuse in our government.  We must reform the rules of the road that\nlet Wall Street run wild and stuck Main Street with the bill.  We must\nchange Washington now.  \n\n \n\nThis has been our message from the day we began this campaign.  Our\nopponent, on the other hand, has spent much of the last nineteen months\narguing that what qualifies him to be President are the decades he\'s\nspent in Washington.\n\n \n\nBut with forty-two days left, he\'s had a sudden change of heart.  An\nelection-time conversion.  After twenty-six years in Washington - years\nwhere he voted for the same trickle-down, on-your-own policies that got\nus into this mess - he now claims that he\'s the one who can clean it up.\n\n\n \n\nWell let\'s be clear.  When it comes to regulatory reform, Senator McCain\nhas fought time and time again against the common-sense rules of the\nroad that could\'ve prevented this crisis.  His economic plan was written\nby Phil Gramm, the architect in the US Senate of the de-regulatory steps\nthat helped cause this mess.  Even knowing what we know now,  Senator\nMcCain said in an interview just last night that de-regulation actually\nhelped grow our economy.  Well that might be true for the profits of a\nfew CEOs, but it\'s certainly not true for America\'s prosperity.  \n\n \n\nWhen it comes to taking on the special interests, my opponent sounds\nlike Fighting Bob Lafollette.  But he acts like a guy who\'s spent three\ndecades of his life in Washington.  He\'s put seven of the biggest\ncorporate lobbyists in charge of his campaign - lobbyists for the\ninsurance industry and the oil industry; for foreign governments and\nFreddie and Fannie Mac, who paid his campaign manager nearly $2 million\nto defend them against stricter regulations.  I guess they got their\nmoney\'s worth.  \n\n \n\nAnd rest assured, those lobbyists who are working day and night to elect\nmy opponent aren\'t doing it to put themselves out of business.\n\n \n\nWhen it comes to reforming government waste and spending, Senator McCain\ntalks a lot about earmarks.  And while he deserves credit for not\nrequesting many of those earmarks during his time in Congress, what he\nnever mentions is that he voted for 144 billion dollars worth in just\nsix years; or that he voted for four out of the five Bush budgets that\nhave been filled with special interests giveaways and left us with the\nlargest deficit in history. \n\n \n\nThe truth is, our earmark system in Washington is fraught with abuse.\nIt badly needs reform - which is why I didn\'t request a single earmark\nlast year, why I\'ve released all my previous requests for the public to\nsee, and why I\'ve pledged to slash earmarks by more than half when I am\nPresident.  \n\n \n\nBut let\'s not pretend, as John McCain does, that proposing the\nelimination of 18 billion dollars of earmarks will make up for the more\nthan 300 billion additional dollars he wants to spend on tax breaks for\nbig corporations and multi-millionaires that don\'t need them and weren\'t\nasking for them - more than 300 billion dollars at a time when taxpayers\nare being asked to help finance two wars and a historic financial\nbailout.  That\'s some pretty creative math, but it doesn\'t add up to is\nchange.  And change in Washington is what we need right now.  \n\n \n\nThis change will not be easy.  It will require reforming our politics by\ntaking power away from the lobbyists who kill good ideas and good plans\nwith secret meetings and campaign checks.  It will require reforming our\ngovernment by taking on the spending habits of both parties and going\nafter the tax havens and loopholes that big corporations use to avoid\npaying their fare share while you pay more.  And it will require\nreforming our out-dated, unfair regulatory system that favors Wall\nStreet over Main Street but has ended up hurting both. \n\n \n\nBut I am ready to reform our politics because I\'ve done it before.  I\'ve\nspent my career taking on lobbyists and their money, and I\'ve won.  When\nI was a state Senator in Illinois, if you wanted a favor, there was\nactually a law that let you give campaign cash to politicians for their\nown personal use.  In the State House, they called it business-as-usual.\nI called it legalized bribery, and while it didn\'t make me the most\npopular guy in Springfield, I put an end to it.  I brought Democrats and\nRepublicans together, and we passed the first ethics reform in\ntwenty-five years. \n\n \n\nWhen I got to Washington, Jack Abramoff and his lobbyist pals had\nengaged in some of the worst corruption since Watergate.  I led the\nfight for reform in my party, and let me tell you - not everyone in my\nparty was too happy about it.  When I proposed forcing lobbyists to\ndisclose who they\'re raising money from and who in Congress they\'re\nfunneling it to, I had a few choice words directed my way on the floor\nof the Senate.  But we got it done, and we banned gifts from lobbyists,\nand discounted rides on their corporate jets.  And I\'m the only\ncandidate in this race who can say that Washington lobbyists do not fund\nmy campaign, you do - with donations of $100, and $10, and $5.     \n\n \n\nI also joined with one of the most conservative Republicans in Congress\nto end the abuse that allowed no-bid contracts to waste taxpayer dollars\ninstead of using them to rebuild the Gulf Coast after Katrina.  And we\nworked together to put the federal government\'s checkbook online - so\nyou can see how and where Washington is spending trillions of dollars of\nyour money.  \n\n \n\nFor years, I have also pushed for reform of the same loose regulations\nand lax oversight that could\'ve prevented the crisis we\'re in.  It was\ntwo years ago that I introduced legislation to stop mortgage\ntransactions that promoted fraud, risk or abuse.  It was one year ago\nthat I called on our Treasury Secretary and our Fed Chairman to bring\nevery stakeholder together and find a solution to the subprime mortgage\nmeltdown before it got worse.  In March, when John McCain was saying\n"I\'m always for less regulation," I called for a new, 21st century\nregulatory framework to restore accountability, transparency, and trust\nin our financial markets. \n\n \n\nThese are the types of reform I will pursue beginning on my very first\nday in office as President of the United States - political reform,\ngovernment reform, and regulatory reform. \n\n \n\nFirst, I\'ll reform our special interest-driven politics.  When I am\nPresident, I will start by closing the revolving door in the White House\nthat has allowed people to use their Administration job as a stepping\nstone to further their lobbying careers.\n\n \n\nI\'ll make it absolutely clear that working in an Obama Administration is\nnot about serving your former employer, your future employer, or your\nbank account - it\'s about serving your country.  When you walk into my\nadministration, you will not be able to work on regulations or contracts\ndirectly related to your former employer for two years.  And when you\nleave, you will not be able to lobby my Administration - ever.  I will\nalso institute an absolute gift ban so that no registered lobbyist can\ncurry favor with members of my administration based on how much they can\nspend on a fancy dinner.\n\n \n\nI\'ll make our government open and transparent so that anyone can ensure\nthat our business is the people\'s business.  As Justice Louis Brandeis\nonce said, sunlight is the greatest disinfectant.  As President, I will\nmake it impossible for Congressmen or lobbyists to slip pork-barrel\nprojects or corporate welfare into laws when no one is looking because\nwhen I am president, meetings where laws are written will be more open\nto the public.  No more secrecy.\n\n \n\nWhen there is a bill that ends up on my desk as President, you will have\nfive days to look online and find out what\'s in it before I sign it.\nWhen there are meetings between lobbyists and a government agency, we\nwill put as many as possible online for every American to watch.  When\nthere is a tax bill being debated in Congress, you will know the names\nof the corporations that would benefit and how much money they would\nget.  And we will put every corporate tax break and every pork-barrel\nproject online for every American to see.  You will know who asked for\nthem and you can cast your vote accordingly. \n\n \n\nThe second set of reforms I\'ll make will eliminate the waste, fraud, and\nabuse in our government.   \n\n \n\nWe are facing the largest deficit in history.  We are facing the largest\ngovernment bailout in history.  And we are also facing some of the\ngreatest challenges in our history.  All of this will cost money - to\nfix our health care system, and our schools, and build a new energy\neconomy.  And the only way we can do all this without leaving our\nchildren with an even larger debt is if Washington starts taking\nresponsibility for every dime that it spends.  \n\n \n\nWe can start by ending a war in Iraq that is costing us $10 billion a\nmonth when the Iraqi government is sitting on a $79 billion surplus.  We\nshould also stop sending fifteen billion dollars a year in overpayments\nto insurance companies for Medicare and go after tens of billions of\ndollars in Medicare and Medicaid fraud.  We need to stop sending three\nbillion a year to banks that provide student loans the government could\nprovide for less, and hundreds of millions a year in subsidies to\nagribusiness that can survive just fine without your tax dollars and use\nsome of the money to help family farmers who are struggling.  I will put\nan end to this waste when I am President.  \n\n \n\nI am not a Democrat who believes that we can or should defend every\ngovernment program just because it\'s there.  There are some that don\'t\nwork like we had hoped - like the Bush Administration\'s\nbillion-dollar-a-year reading program that hasn\'t improved our\nchildren\'s reading.  And there are some that have been duplicated by\nother programs that we just need to cut back - like waste at the\nEconomic Development Agency and the Export-Import Bank that has become\nlittle more than a fund for corporate welfare. \n\n \n\nI understand there are parts of these programs worth defending and\npoliticians of both parties who will do so.  But if we hope to meet the\nchallenges of our time, we must make difficult choices.  As President, I\nwill go through the entire federal budget, page by page, line by line,\nand I will eliminate the programs that don\'t work and aren\'t needed.  \n\n \n\nAs for the programs we do need, I will make them work better and cost\nless.  I will create a High-Performance Team that evaluates every agency\nand every office based on how well they\'re serving the American\ntaxpayer.  We will fire government managers who aren\'t getting results,\nwe will cut funding for programs that are wasting your money, and we\nwill use technology and lessons from the private sector to improve\nefficiency across every level of government - because we cannot meet\ntwenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy. \n\n \n\nI will also save billions of dollars by cutting private contractors and\nimproving management of the hundreds of billions of dollars our\ngovernment spends on private contracts, and I will end the abuse of\nno-bid contracts for good.  One employee of a former Halliburton\nsubsidiary actually admitted that he was ordered to put his company\'s\nlogo on towels provided to U.S. troops because our government - our tax\ndollars - would pay for it no matter how much it cost.  That is\nwasteful, that is wrong, and that will end when I am President.  \n\n \n\nAnd for all his talk about earmark abuse, what Senator McCain doesn\'t\nmention these days is the corporate abuse of our tax system - abuse that\nhas cost far more than earmarks ever have.  In 2003, loopholes and tax\nbreaks allowed 28 major corporations to actually have negative tax\nliabilities.  We lose $100 billion every year because corporations get\nto set up mailboxes offshore so they can avoid paying a dime of taxes in\nAmerica.  Imagine if you got to do that?  There is a building right now\nin the Cayman Islands that is the address for 18,000 corporations.  Well\nthat is either the biggest building in the world or the biggest sham in\nthe world, and I think we know which one it is.  I will shut down those\noffshore tax havens and all those corporate loopholes as President,\nbecause you shouldn\'t have to pay higher taxes because some big\ncorporation cut corners to avoid paying theirs.  All of us have a\nresponsibility to pay our fair share.  That\'s putting country first.  \n\n \n\nFinally, the third set of reforms I will pursue are the updated,\ncommon-sense regulations of the financial market that I\'ve been calling\nfor since March; rules of the road that will make Wall Street fair,\nopen, and honest; that will ensure a crisis like this can never happen\nagain.   \n\n \n\nI\'ve outlined six principles that such reforms should follow. \n\n \n\nFirst, if you\'re a financial institution that can borrow from the\ngovernment, you should be subject to government oversight and\nsupervision.  Taxpayers who have now been called upon to spend nearly a\ntrillion dollars to save our economy from the excesses of Wall Street\nhave every right to expect that financial institutions are not taking\nexcessive risks. \n\n \n\nSecond, we need to reform requirements on all regulated financial\ninstitutions, investigate rating agencies and potential conflicts of\ninterest with the people they are rating, and establish transparency\nrequirements that demand full disclosure by financial institutions to\nshareholders. \n\n \n\nThird, we need to streamline our overlapping and competing regulatory\nagencies that cannot oversee the large and complex institutions that\ndominate the financial landscape. \n\n \n\nFourth, we need to regulate institutions for what they do, not what they\nare. Over the last few years, commercial banks and thrift institutions\nwere subject to guidelines on subprime mortgages that did not apply to\nmortgage brokers and companies. This regulatory framework failed to\nprotect homeowners, and made no sense for our financial system. \n\n \n\nFifth, we need to crack down on trading activity that crosses the line\nto market manipulation.  We need regulators that actually enforce the\nrules instead of overlooking them.  The SEC should investigate and\npunish all market manipulation. \n\n \n\nSixth, we must establish a process that identifies systemic risks to the\nfinancial system like the crisis that has overtaken our economy.  We\nneed a standing financial market advisory group to meet regularly and\nprovide advice to the President, Congress, and regulators on the state\nof our financial markets and the risks they face. It\'s time to\nanticipate risks before they erupt into a full-blown crisis.\n\n \n\nThese are the principles that should guide the reforms we need to\nestablish a 21st century regulatory system - a system that recognizes\nour free market economy has only worked because we have guided the\nmarket\'s invisible hand with a higher principle - that America prospers\nwhen all Americans can prosper.\n\n \n\nTo restore this prosperity, we must change Washington.  We must reform\nour regulations, our politics, and our government, but we will not be\nable to make these changes with the same policies, the same lobbyists,\nor the same Washington culture that allows politicians and special\ninterests to set their own agenda. \n\n \n\nThat\'s exactly what we will get from John McCain.  After twenty-six\nyears of being part of this Washington culture, all that he has changed\nis his slogan for the fall campaign.  And the people in charge of that\ncampaign prove that if we elect John McCain, it\'s not a team of\nmavericks we\'ll be sending to the White House - it\'s a team of\nlobbyists.  \n\n \n\nWe can\'t afford four more years of that kind of politics.  We need real\nchange.    \n\n \n\nIt won\'t be easy.  The kind of change we\'re looking for never is.  What\nwe are up against is a very powerful, entrenched status quo in\nWashington who will say anything and do anything and fight with\neverything they\'ve got to keep things just the way are.    \n\n \n\nBut I feel good about our chances, because I\'ve got something more\npowerful than they do:  I\'ve got you.  In this campaign, you have\nalready shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like\nthis one, the change we need doesn\'t come from Washington.  Change comes\nto Washington.  \n\n \n\nChange has always come from places like Wisconsin - the state where the\nprogressive movement was born; where laws were passed to regulate the\nrailroads and insurance companies; laws that protected consumers and the\nsafety of factory workers.  It was a movement rooted in a principle that\nwas known as the Wisconsin Idea - the idea that government works best in\nthe hands of the people, not the special interests; that your voices\nshould speak louder than the whispers of lobbyists. \n\n \n\nThat\'s the Wisconsin idea.  That\'s the America idea.  And that\'s the\nkind of government we need right now.  \n\n \n\nSo if you want the next four years in Washington to look just like the\nlast eight, then I am not your candidate.  But if you want real change -\nif you want to shine a bright light into the backrooms of Washington; if\nyou want to replace the special interests with your interests, if you\nwant a government that costs less and works better for everyday\nAmericans, then I ask you to knock on some doors, and make some calls,\nand talk to your neighbors, and give me your vote on November 4th.  And\nif you do, I promise you - we will change America together.  Thank you.\n\n\n \n\n###\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n'
