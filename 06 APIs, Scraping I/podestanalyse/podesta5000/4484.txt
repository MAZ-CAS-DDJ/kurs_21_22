john.podesta@gmail.comb"Good evening\nThis afternoon the AFL-CIO convened the Political Committee (usually\nchaired by AFSCME President Lee Saunders but because of a health issue,\nTrumka chaired).  Interesting intel from this meeting to pass along.\n\n*Political Committee Discussion Points today:*\n\n1.  Stuart Appelbaum pushed back on the AFT at the meeting regarding their\nearly endorsement process.  He stated that he understood there to be a 60\nday notification to affiliated unions by an endorsing union.  Trumka\nclarified that that was incorrect.  He engaged in debate with Randi\nWeingarten's Executive Assistant Michelle Ringuette about their process and\nTrumka cut off debate.  Appelbaum also urged no early endorsement by the\nAFL-CIO in the Presidential primary.\n\nRandi personally called today to mention this exchange with Stuart along\nwith the importance of prep for the Executive Council meeting and\nreconnecting on policy. She stated that she will be directly following up\nwith Appelbaum and was very shocked by his comments at the meeting.  Randi\nis in Canada or would have been there in person.\n\nI am attaching a letter from Lee Saunders in the response to attacks Randi\nhas received over the past week, FYI.\n\n2.  The Political Committee decided that there would not be a President\nendorsement recommendation coming off of the Executive Committee meeting by\nJuly 30th.  This is not news for us but it was formally voted on.  This\nstill allows them to move in the future, internally I have heard a lot of\ntalk that they know they need to endorse and would be looking to before\nFebruary 2016 (how it looks today, we'll see).\n\n3.  The Bricklayer Unions (HRC spoke with President Boland on 6/10/15 and\nhe also attended the Podesta's reception) announced that they will be\nmaking a endorsement recommendation at their Convention on 9/14-17/15.  I\nwill follow up with them tomorrow, but this is good news for us.  BAC was a\n2007 HRC endorsers.\n\n4.  Write off APWU and the Flight Attendants (affiliated with CWA)-Both\nPresidents publicly stated their support for Sanders in the Political\nCommittee meeting today.  I think our work is to keep them neutral.\n\n*Preparation for the Executive Council Meeting:*\n\nRandi mentioned today she very much wants to be on the offense going into\nthe July 30th Executive Council meeting.  She is going to be asking for a\npoint of privilege at the meeting to emphasize the importance of her early\nendorsement.  She has already lined support in the room among AFSCME, Trade\nUnions and IAM.  She wants HRC to go into the room on offense too.  I flag\nthis because I think it could be helpful to have a strategy session around\nthe July 30th meeting for the Secretary.  Randi also raised the Cadillac\nTax issue with me today.  Randi is really an amazing HRC champion.\n\n*Other Follow Up Items:*\n\nAFT will be in the HQ tomorrow in department meetings from 11-4pm.\n\n*Flag for you, UTU President Mike Mulgrew will be attending the Policy\nmeeting from 1-2pm.  This was at the request of Randi.\n\nWe will be meeting in the Nevada room if anyone would like to stop by.\n\nI am reviewing tonight/tomorrow the research on ATU/APWU/CWA and will\ncircle back.\n\nI am setting up meetings with Suzie Ballentine this week and have a meeting\nwith Heather and Erin next week.  I'm going to only be asking Suzie for her\ninsights on the CWA and ATU, but not asking for assistance beyond her\nthoughts.  FYI.\n\nThank you!  September 9th is locked in for the Building Trades Council\nMeeting.  Great news.\n\n\n-- \nNikki Budzinski\nLabor Outreach Director\nHillary for America\n646-854-1442 (direct)\n"
