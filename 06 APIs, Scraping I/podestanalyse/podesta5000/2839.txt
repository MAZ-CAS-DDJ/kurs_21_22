OPM has informed me there is a discrepancy with GSA\nfrom the period of 07/20/01 where it shows that he was contributing to FERS\nbut when he resigned on 09/24/11 it showed he was NOT contributing to\nFERS.  OPM is trying to get information from GSA to find out the date that\nMr. Podesta stopped contributing to FERS during this period.\n\n\n\nWhen the package was submitted to OPM, the SF50s were included.  Mr.\nPodesta have copies in the folder that I provided to him.  When we had the\nexit interview with Mr. Podesta, we discussed this particular issue and I\ntold him that OPM will make the final determination concerning the GSA\nservice.  OPM informed me today that if they cannot get an answer from GSA,\nthey will be contacting him for additional information.\n\n\n\nCan you please pass this information to Mr. Podesta?  I just wanted to give\nhim a heads up.\n\n\n\nPlease let me know if he has any questions.\n\n\n\nThank you,\nRachel\n\n\n\nRachel Zinkhan\n\nEmployee Benefits Specialist\n\nHuman Resources Management Division\n\nOffice of Administration\n\nExecutive Office of the President\n\nPhone:  202.395.1065\n\nFax:  202.395.5608\n\ne-Mail:  *rzinkhan@oa.eop.gov <rzinkhan@oa.eop.gov>*\n\n\n\n*\xe2\x80\x9cWe would like to know how to serve you better---please visit *\n*https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/OcaoHR*\n<https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/OcaoHR> *to leave your feedback.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n'
