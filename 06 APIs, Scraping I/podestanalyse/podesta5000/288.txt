(I dont think Jake will care\nshy it was created in the first place in terms of whether or not he chooses\nto talk about it)There is a movement pushing for abolishing the holdiday\nand all others related to the confederacy.  So a statement denouncing all\nwould shut down this piecemeal oppo push.\n\n\n\nWould also like to say something publicly before HRC does the JJ dinner in\nArkansas so it doesn\'t become a will she or wont she narrative leading up\nto the dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Jun 22, 2015 at 1:55 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nIf there is revisionist history going on and good reason on the\ncombining of holidays I think that\'s worth explaining against Jake\'s\nuncorroborated oppo he\'s being fed.\n\n\n\n\nOn Jun 22, 2015, at 1:22 PM, Tina Flournoy <Tina@presidentclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nHe\'s just inaccurate -- the additional star on the flag for the\nConfederacy was added in 1924.  Neither I nor anyone I\'ve talked to in\nArkansas (including WJC) knows what the rationale was behind the 1987\ndeal - - though something WJC said has given me a thread to look into.\n\nAnd if you want to know the rationale for combining Robert E. Lee and\nMLK - happy to explain.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: craig@minassianmedia.com [mailto:craig@minassianmedia.com]\nSent: Monday, June 22, 2015 1:16 PM\nTo: Jennifer Palmieri\nCc: Tina Flournoy; Angel Urena; Karen Finney; Nick Merrill; Huma\nAbedin; John Podesta; John Podesta; Marlon Marshall; Jake Sullivan;\nMaya Harris; Robby Mook; Brian Fallon\nSubject: Re: Arkansas flag and Robert E Lee day\n\n\nFYI - Tapper just followed up just now with the below note.

Lee.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that steps taking in the 80s to honor the Confederacy\nare the same exact thing as waving the rebel flag at the state house\nin South Carolina today.\n\nBut honoring the Confederacy is what it is, and it seems reasonable to\nask about that.\n\nThoughts?"\n\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Jun 20, 2015, at 11:35 PM, Jennifer Palmieri <\njpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n>\n> Thought it was a good idea to link up chains and level set with\n> everyone on Arkansas press issues.\n>\n> Someone moved oppo research today designed to put WJC and HRC in a\n> tough spot by noting that the Arkansas flag has a confederate star on\n> it and WJC signed legislation making a Robert E.
