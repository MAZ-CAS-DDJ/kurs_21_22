A significant number of "Tikkun" readers have told us that they don\'t believe in God. Some see beliefs in God as playing a reactionary role in contemporary society. Yet many liberal and progressive people continue to be unaware of the truly radical notions of God that progressive theologians and believers are exploring. That\'s why we\'ve decided to present some of those radical notions in this special issue of "Tikkun." \n\nDon\'t miss out on this important discussion. You can get a taste of it by clicking on each article and reading the first few paragraphs. Then, if you are not yet a subscriber or member of the Network of Spiritual Progressives, you\'ll be asked to subscribe [ http://org.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=x0TGggY%2B8Okr3p60teP1Et3GkiFfsbEa ] or join [ http://org.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=AAW%2F1w6HgUOhBoAT%2Fbv83N3GkiFfsbEa ] (after which you will get the print and/or online version of the magazine). \n\nIf you are already a paid-up subscriber or member, you should be able to read the full article online and be getting the print version in the mail.
