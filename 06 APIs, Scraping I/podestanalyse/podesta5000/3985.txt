She's casting a wide net, looking for the best talent, and listening to people with bold ideas from across the party.  Notably, she is specifically reaching out to progressive policy experts and to people in the Obama orbit, demonstrating that she is doing things differently this time.  She will be positioned to run a thoughtful, successful, forward-looking and technological advanced campaign, should she decide to run.\n\n\n2)    Provides cover and context for recruiting the best people and appealing to those who are looking for signals about whether this is something that they want to be a part of.\n\n\n3)    Begins to build energy and enthusiasm among Democrats for a forward-looking potential candidacy that will offer a bold vision for the future.\n\n\nPlacing a Story\n\nAs discussed on our call, we are all in agreement that the time is right place a story with a friendly journalist in the coming days that positions us a little more transparently while achieving the above goals.\n\nWho:\nFor something like this, especially in the absence of us teasing things out to others, we feel that it\x92s important to go with what is safe and what has worked in the past, and to a publication that will reach industry people for recruitment purposes.\n\nWe have has a very good relationship with Maggie Haberman of Politico over the last year.  We have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed.  While we should have a larger conversation in the near future about a broader strategy for reengaging the beat press that covers HRC, for this we think we can achieve our objective and do the most shaping by going to Maggie.\n\nWhat:\nMechanically, the story will have three basic components.  First, a list of names that we agree upon beforehand that we will give to a reporter on background, both policy people and campaign people.  Second, some information provided on background that explains what is happening and why and third, a quote on-the-record that affirms all of this in an official capacity, making clear that this is a sanctioned story.\n\n\n1)    Names:\n\na.    Policy*\n\n                                              i.     Joe Stiglitz\n\n                                            ii.     Paul Volcker\n* More names available if and when it\x92s helpful. And we should revisit if and how to give people a heads up beforehand.\n\n\nb.    Campaign\n\n                                              i.     John, Joel, and Robby are already out there\n\n                                            ii.     Teddy Goff?\n\n                                          iii.     Wendy Clark?\n\n\n2)    On Background as someone familiar with HRC\x92s thinking:\n\nAfter the midterms, HRC turned in earnest to thinking through a decision, as she always said she would.  She\x92s taking on the two big questions she posed at the end of her book: \x93What\x92s your vision for America?\x94 and \x93Can you lead us there?\x94  During the midterm campaign, you heard her lay out a lot of the challenges we face, particularly stagnant incomes and the middle class squeeze that is preventing a lot of Americans from feeling the recovery.  So now she\x92s focusing on potential solutions.  She\x92s casting a wide net, with a particular emphasis on new voices and new ideas.  Talking to Joe Stiglitz about inequality. Talking to Paul Volker about financial reform.  When you include outreach by her team, there have been discussions with more than 100 policy experts across the country.  As for the second question -- can you lead us there? --  she\x92s also talking to people about what a successful, forward-looking and technological advanced campaign would look like, one that would allow her to have a conversation with the American public about these ideas and do so in innovative ways.  And just like on the policy side, she\x92s especially interested in new voices and new talent.  It\x92s no accident she\x92s talking to so many people from the Obama orbit.  Joel Benenson, for example.  If she runs, this is going to be a different kind of campaign, from top to bottom.\n\n\n3)    On the record:\n\n\n\nShe is thinking through a decision and doing so with a big-tent approach that allows her to hear from lots of people across the Democratic party.  She wants to hear new voices and new ideas. She's using this time to look at bold new ideas for helping the middle class and what it would take to build an inclusive, thoughtful and technically advanced campaign, so that if she decides to run, she'll be ready.\n\n\nWhen:\nNext week probably makes the most sense, but after we have an agreed-upon plan in place we should reconvene early next week by email or phone and make a decision.\n\n\nFrom: Philippe Reines <pir@hrcoffice.com<mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com>>\nDate: Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 8:32 PM\nTo: Cheryl Mills <cheryl.mills@gmail.com<mailto:cheryl.mills@gmail.com>>, Robby Mook <robbymook2015@gmail.com<mailto:robbymook2015@gmail.com>>, Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com<mailto:huma@hrcoffice.com>>, Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com<mailto:gruncom@aol.com>>, John Anzalone <john@algpolling.com<mailto:john@algpolling.com>>, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com<mailto:dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>>, Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com<mailto:jbenenson@bsgco.com>>, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>, NSM <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com<mailto:nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>>, Jim Margolis <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com<mailto:Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com>>\nSubject: Re: Follow-up Media Call\n\nRobby, I agree with you about the next discussion needing to be about specific implementation. Towards that end, Nick will reply all with the memo he drafted \x96 which has languished with me, not him.  I can do anytime tonight, but a 10pm call two years before Iowa seems a bit much \x97 especially since there won\x92t be anyone left to call us tomorrow, they all hit in one fell swoop this afternoon. So my suggestion is that everyone absorbs Nick\x92s draft overnight, and Marissa Astor sets up a call tomorrow for tomorrow on the early side with the benefit of reading all these stories. Again though, I\x92m free at 10pm if the group thinks we shouldn\x92t wait. Huma & Robby, entirely up to you.\n\nSince I procrastinated though, I\x92ll just add here what I was going to incorporate: Yes HRC learned from 2008, as she has learned from every experience of her life. But we shouldn\x92t let people forget that 2007 was eight years ago. She has had many experiences since and they have been part of the learning/growing process. So the question of what she will do in 2016 isn\x92t without a basis to answer as if she\x92s been in a coma since she last ran. Look at what she did for President Obama in the general. Look at how she handled his wanting her to join the cabinet. Look at how she did the job of Secretary of State. Look at what she has done since, particularly on the philanthropic front. She has made hundreds of policy, management and personnel decisions over that span, and by and large they\x92ve turned out pretty well.\n\nIf you want to know what someone is going to do, a good place to start is what they\x92ve done. In 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014.\n\n\nFrom: Robby Mook <robbymook2015@gmail.com<mailto:robbymook2015@gmail.com>>\nDate: Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 8:16 PM\nTo: Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com<mailto:huma@hrcoffice.com>>\nCc: Mandy Grunwald <GrunCom@aol.com<mailto:GrunCom@aol.com>>, John Anzalone <john@algpolling.com<mailto:john@algpolling.com>>, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com<mailto:dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>>, Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com<mailto:jbenenson@bsgco.com>>, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com<mailto:nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>>, PIR <pir@hrcoffice.com<mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com>>, Jim Margolis <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com<mailto:Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com>>\nSubject: Re: Follow-up Media call\n\nGreat--I just want something to react to because we have a rough strategy--I think we're in a good spot to talk next steps now.\n\nOn Tue, Jan 13, 2015 at 8:15 PM, Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com<mailto:huma@hrcoffice.com>> wrote:\nI know PIR will weigh in shortly\n\nFrom: Robby Mook [mailto:robbymook2015@gmail.com<mailto:robbymook2015@gmail.com>]\nSent: Tuesday, January 13, 2015 8:04 PM\nTo: Mandy Grunwald\nCc: Huma Abedin; John Anzalone; Dan Schwerin; Joel Benenson; John Podesta; Nick Merrill; Philippe Reines; Jim Margolis\n\nSubject: Re: Follow-up Media call\n\nAlso, to be clear, are we reacting to a proposed plan of action or just discussing?  I would strongly prefer to react to something because we discussed strategy on our last call and at this point I would like to discuss implementation. There was agreement that we should shape likely leaks in the best light for HRC and supplement with bits of policy that show her focused on helping the MC.  I'd like to just move forward in that strategy.  Is there a draft of the memo we can see?\n\n\nOn Jan 13, 2015, at 7:58 PM, Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com<mailto:gruncom@aol.com>> wrote:\nSure\n\nMandy Grunwald\nGrunwald Communications\n202 973-9400<tel:202%20973-9400>\n\n\nOn Jan 13, 2015, at 7:48 PM, Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com<mailto:huma@hrcoffice.com>> wrote:\nCan people do 9pm or 10pm tonight?\n\nFrom: John Anzalone [mailto:john@algpolling.com]\nSent: Tuesday, January 13, 2015 7:46 PM\nTo: Mandy Grunwald\nCc: Huma Abedin; Robby Mook; Dan Schwerin; Joel Benenson; John Podesta; Nick Merrill; Philippe Reines; Jim Margolis\nSubject: Re: Follow-up Media call\n\ntonight or tomorrow during the day would be better.
