What McCain never mentions in his praise\nof\nthat panel is that it urged hefty tax increases on businesses and employees.\nMcCain, then a newly elected congressman, voted for the proposals.\n\nThese contradictions reflect a central conundrum for the Arizona senator:\nHe\'s seeking to both placate conservatives -- suspicious of him because of\nhis willingness to buck the party in areas from climate change and campaign\nfinance to President George W.\nBush<http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=George+W.+Bush&site=wnews&client=wnews&proxystylesheet=wnews&output=xml_no_dtd&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&filter=p&getfields=wnnis&sort=date:D:S:d1>\'s\ntax cuts -- and project himself as an independent ready to work with\nDemocrats on many of these issues.\n\nWave of Retirements\n\nNo debate underlines the candidate\'s dilemma more than how to shore up\nSocial Security, which will pay benefits to almost 50\nmillion<http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/basicfact.htm>Americans this\nyear.\n\nSome conservatives are infuriated when raising taxes is even discussed. In\nan open letter<http://www.clubforgrowth.org/2008/07/an_open_letter_to_john_mccain.php>the\nday after the July 27 interview, the Club for Growth said McCain\'s\nremarks were ``shocking\'\' given his earlier ``adamant\'\' opposition to higher\ntaxes.\n\nYet experts argue that saving the system is possible with only some\ncombination of a tax increase and benefit cuts. In 2005, Bush proposed\nprivate savings accounts yet refused to negotiate on taxes. The effort died\n-- even in a Republican- controlled Congress.\n\nSocial Security, facing a tidal wave of baby-boomer retirements, is\nprojected to run out of assets by 2041. The solutions to its insolvency are\n``well-documented,\'\' said John\nRother<http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=John%0ARother&site=wnews&client=wnews&proxystylesheet=wnews&output=xml_no_dtd&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&filter=p&getfields=wnnis&sort=date:D:S:d1>,\nan executive vice president at AARP <http://www.atr.org/>, an advocacy group\nfor older people. They include raising the payroll tax as well as the age of\nfull eligibility.\n\nMust Include Both\n\n``A plan capable of passing Congress would have to have some of both,\'\'\nRother said.\n\nThe payroll tax totals 12.4 percent -- half of which is deducted from\nemployee wages up to $102,000, and half paid by employers.\n\nObama, 47, an Illinois senator and the Democratic presidential candidate,\nwould boost the tax by continuing to apply it to incomes up to $102,000 as\nwell as to those earning $250,000 and over. Incomes between $102,000 and\n$250,000 wouldn\'t be touched.\n\nWhile McCain, 71, hasn\'t detailed his own plan, spokesman Tucker\nBounds<http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Tucker+Bounds&site=wnews&client=wnews&proxystylesheet=wnews&output=xml_no_dtd&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&filter=p&getfields=wnnis&sort=date:D:S:d1>says\nhe thinks Obama ``is absolutely wrong.\'\'\n\nGetting Testy\n\nThe tax-benefit dilemma has not only thrown McCain into rhetorical\ncontortions, it\'s also caused him to get testy when pressed to explain.\n\nDuring a campaign bus ride last week in Missouri, a reporter said his July\n27 comment presumably meant McCain wasn\'t ruling out raising taxes.\n\n``That\'s presuming wrong,\'\' McCain\nsaid<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/04/AR2008080400431.html>in\ncutting him off, according to the Washington Post.\n\nStill, he has a history of being open to new Social Security taxes.\n\nIn a ``Meet the Press\'\' interview in 2005, McCain unequivocally endorsed the\nidea of levying such taxes on high- income earners, saying he could support\nthat ``as part of a compromise.\'\'\n\nThen, as he closed in on the Republican nomination between last December and\nFebruary, he pledged at least four times to oppose all tax increases,\nincluding Social Security levies.\n\n``I will not agree to any tax increase,\'\' he told the Wall Street Journal in\nDecember. On Feb. 3, he vowed on ``Fox News Sunday\'\' and CBS\'s ``Face the\nNation\'\' to veto any higher taxes. ``No new taxes,\'\' he declared on ABC two\nweeks later.\n\nConfusing Surrogates\n\nHis shifting rhetoric has entangled even some surrogates. In a Bloomberg\ninterview in July, adviser Carly\nFiorina<http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Carly+Fiorina&site=wnews&client=wnews&proxystylesheet=wnews&output=xml_no_dtd&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&filter=p&getfields=wnnis&sort=date:D:S:d1>ruled\nout Social Security tax increases on ``middle-and working-class\'\'\nAmericans, but said if a bipartisan coalition is ``creative enough\'\' to\nfashion levies on wealthier people, that may be acceptable.\n\nOther aides insist the candidate opposes new taxes and only wants to avoid\ndeclaring any option non-negotiable.\n\n``He\'s committed to tackling entitlements by seeking a real bipartisan\nsolution,\'\' said Mark\nSalter<http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Mark+Salter&site=wnews&client=wnews&proxystylesheet=wnews&output=xml_no_dtd&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&filter=p&getfields=wnnis&sort=date:D:S:d1>,\na confidant. ``You can\'t do that with preconditions.\'\'\n\nSome tax-cut proponents remain optimistic McCain won\'t let them down.\n\nGrover Norquist<http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Grover+Norquist&site=wnews&client=wnews&proxystylesheet=wnews&output=xml_no_dtd&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&filter=p&getfields=wnnis&sort=date:D:S:d1>,\npresident of Americans for Tax Reform <http://www.atr.org/>, said he\n``didn\'t go nuts the way some other conservatives did\'\' over McCain\'s July\n27 remarks because he\'s been reassured by the senator\'s aides.\n\n``McCain\'s saying: `Yes, let\'s talk about everything,\'\'\' he said. ``But that\ndoes not mean he\'ll agree to raise taxes.\'\'\n\nJust in case, Norquist is keeping handy the clips of McCain pledging on\nnational television to not raise taxes.\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
