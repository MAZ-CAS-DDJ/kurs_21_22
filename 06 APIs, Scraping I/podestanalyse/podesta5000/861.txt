You may recall\nthat last spring, the OCR informed us the investigation could take upwards\nof 6-9 months. A few days ago, Catherine L\n\xe2\x80\x8bh\xe2\x80\x8b\namon, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, made public a letter (here\n<http://www.boxer.senate.gov/press/related/150428EducationDepartmentReponsetoLetter.pdf>)\nthat addresses the length of investigations recently closed by the OCR.  If\nyou are interested in reading more, there is additional coverage in today\xe2\x80\x99s\nedition of the *Chronicle* (here\n<http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/length-of-education-dept-s-sexual-violence-investigations-has-increased-sharply/98371?cid=at&utm_source=at&utm_medium=en>)\nand *Inside Higher Ed* (here\n<https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/06/ocr-letter-says-completed-title-ix-investigations-2014-lasted-more-1400-days>\n).\n\n\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\nIn the letter, L\n\xe2\x80\x8bh\xe2\x80\x8b\namon states that while the Department of Education attempts to resolve all\ncomplaints in 180 days,\n\xe2\x80\x8bbecause of their complexity Title IX \xe2\x80\x8b\nsexual violence investigations are, on average, taking much longer. The\naverage length of\n\xe2\x80\x8bTitle IX \xe2\x80\x8b\nsexual violence investigations from FY2009 to FY2014 has grown from 379\ndays to 1,469 days, in part because of the increased caseload. In the\ncurrent year, FY2015, the Department said the average duration of a\n\xe2\x80\x8bTitle IX \xe2\x80\x8b\nsexual violence investigation was 940 days.\n\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8b\n(Complaints of sexual violence at institutions of higher education\nincreased more than 1,000 percent \xe2\x80\x93 from 9 to 102 \xe2\x80\x93 from FY2009 to FY2014\nand, as of April 8, 2015, 51 were filed for FY2015.)\n\nWe expect that an OCR resolution agreement will ensure sustained compliance\nwith appropriate regulatory guidance and all Federal and State laws, and we\nwill continue to keep you informed as any new information becomes\navailable. I hope this is helpful in understanding the nature and cause of\nany perceived delay as we await additional advice from the Department of\nEducation.\n\nGo well,\nKim\n\n-- \n\n*KIMBERLY K.
