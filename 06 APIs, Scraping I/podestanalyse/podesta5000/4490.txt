The one silver lining I see is that we finally managed a UN Security Council resolution on Feb 22, ordering the release of prisoners, an end to the barrel bombing and other indiscriminate warfare, the lifting of sieges, and the opening of borders to humanitarian aid.  The only reason we got that is because we convinced governments to push it forward during the Sochi Olympics when Russia would be reluctant to veto as it has in the past (despite initial US objection, because Kerry was focused on Geneva II, meaning that Russia was a "partner in peace," not an accomplice in mass murder).  The task now is to enforce the resolution, with Russia obviously in a much less cooperative mood.  However, the sanctions that the US and EU are moving toward on Ukraine are what we\'ve been pushing for some time to force Russia to rein in Assad.   Very unclear how this will all play out, but Ukraine changes things for Syria, probably making things more difficult, but also potentially making Russia more vulnerable to pressure.\n\nI\'m seeing Angela Merkel in an hour.  This is one of the big topics.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nKen\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Sandler, Herbert [mailto:hms@sandlerfoundation.org] \nSent: Tuesday, March 18, 2014 12:29 AM\nTo: Ken Roth\nCc: Daetz, Steve; Knaebel, Sergio; Sandler, Jim; Sandler, Susan; John Podesta; Tom Steyer\nSubject: Three Years of Strife and Cruelty Put Syria in Tailspin - NYTimes.com\n\nHorror of horrors!
