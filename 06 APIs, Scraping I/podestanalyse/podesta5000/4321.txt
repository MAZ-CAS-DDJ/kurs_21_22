Labor and the Freedom Caucus (ring wing nuts) are whipping against the rule vote.  As you know its very rare for a rule vote to fail.  And if this rule vote fails to extend the issue to July 30th there is talk of a separate rule vote to "deem passed".  This option would be pretty controversial, but is a option being discussed.\n>\n> The July 30th rule will likely pass today and when it passes the next set of discussions are around what vehicle will TAA be joined onto for final passsage.  There are two possibilities being discussed:  1.  Highway bill, (which will make lobbying defeat very difficult for TAA/TPA opponents)  2.  African Growth Opportunity Act (which would likely peal off CBC members).\n>\n> From what I\'ve heard, when whatever in the House passes it will move back to the Senate where it will likely be difficult to avoid conference.\n>\n> Of course if the rule fails today, the pathway for TAA is very very difficult.\n>\n> I hope this is helpful.\n> Nikki\n>\n> --\n> Nikki Budzinski\n> Labor Outreach Director\n> Hillary for America\n> 646-854-1442 (direct)\n'
