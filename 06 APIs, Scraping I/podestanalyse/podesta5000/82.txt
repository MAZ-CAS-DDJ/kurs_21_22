They allow demographics\nand party ID to swing markedly without making corrections, which leads to\ninaccurate and inconsistent polling.\n\n\n\n\xc3\x98  This is not the first time Quinnipiac polls in swing states have\nproduced data that is out of step with actual results.\n\no    In 2012, their final Colorado poll showed Mitt Romney winning that\nstate by a point. In reality, President Obama won Colorado by 5 points.\n\no    Similarly, in Virginia, they underestimated President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s margin\nof victory by two points.\n\n\n\n\xc3\x98  Their refusal to apply a consistent and rigorous likely voter model also\nled to variable polling in the 2014 cycle:\n\no    Their final poll in the Iowa Senate\n<http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/iowa/release-detail?ReleaseID=2110>\nrace had Ernst and Braley tied. Ernst won that race by 8.5 points.\n\no    Their final poll in the Virginia Senate race had Senator Warner ahead\nby 9 points. He won by less than a point.\n\n\xc2\xa7  And in the 2013 Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Race, they predicted McAuliffe would win by 6\npoints, when he won by 2.5\n\no    In Colorado, where Governor Hickenlooper won by 3 points, Quinnipiac\nhad his opponent, Republican Bob Beauprez up by 2-5 points in the final\nweeks of the campaign.\n\no    And in the Colorado Senate race, they had the race swinging from\nGardner 46/ Udall 39 (+7) to Gardner 45/ Udall 43 (+2), over the course of\n10 days. (Final result was Garner 49/Udall 46).\n\n\n\n\xc3\x98  Their current polls build on these flaws to produce results that tilt\nthe scales against Secretary Clinton. In particular, they allow party ID to\nswing significantly from poll to poll. Party ID does not swing wildly from\nmonth to month \xe2\x80\x93 and if it is, your data is not credible.\n\n\n\n\xc3\x98  In Virginia - where Quinnipiac has Clinton running 2-3 points behind the\nmajor Republican candidates - their poll is 5 points less Democratic than\ntheir own April poll and 6 points less Democratic than the 2012 exits.\n\n\n\n\xc3\x98  In Colorado \xe2\x80\x93 where they have Clinton 5-9 points behind \xe2\x80\x93 they have 7\npoints fewer Democrats than the 2012 exit polls keeping Republican party ID\nstable. And they have a 5 point swing in Party ID from their own April poll.\n\no    Additionally, they have a lower number of Hispanics in their poll than\nin the 2012 exits (11 vs 14), in a state where the Hispanic population is\non the rise.\n\n\n\n\xc3\x98  In Iowa -  where they have Secretary Clinton 6 to 8 points behind the\nRepublican candidates \xe2\x80\x93 their poll has Democratic Party ID 6 points lower\nthan the 2012 exits.\n\no    Additionally, they have a 4 point spread on gender (48% men / 52%\nwomen) when that state had an 8 point gender spread  in 2012 (46% men / 54%\nwomen)\n\n\n\n\n\n*Party ID Democrat / Republican*\n\n\n\n*Current Poll*\n\n*April Poll*\n\n*2012 Exits*\n\n*VA*\n\nDems: +1  (28 / 27)\n\nDems: +6 (32 / 26)\n\nDems: +7 (39 / 32)\n\n*IA*\n\nDems: -2 (27 / 29)\n\nDems: -1 (29 / 30)\n\nDems: even (33 / 33)\n\n*CO*\n\nDems: -3 (26 / 29)\n\nDems: +2 (28 / 26)\n\nDems: +4 (33 / 29)\n'
