john.podesta@gmail.comb"CLICK HERE TO TELL THE GOP NOT TO USE SHUTDOWNS AS A BARGAINING CHIP>>> \n\nJohn:\n\nWhen the GOP shut down the government last year, it was a disaster.\n\nFor two weeks, our economy was decimated by the GOP's insistence on political brinksmanship. There are just 15 days before the next shutdown. We can't afford to let the government shut down once more because the GOP wants to play partisan games.\n\nCan you click here to add your name and demand the GOP take another shutdown off of the table? \n\nTed Cruz and the rest of the Tea Party have refused to take a shutdown off of the table.\n\nAdd your name: http://action.thehousemajoritypac.com/shutdown-shutdowns\n\nThanks for all you do,\n\nNo More Shutdowns\n\n\n*No More Shutdowns is a project of House Majority PAC, the only PAC dedicated to electing a Democratic majority and getting President Obama's back.
