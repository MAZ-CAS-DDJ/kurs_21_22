Sarah Palin. There\x92s a small facet I\x92d like  \nto add to that story.\n\nAlaska\x92s Board of Game is a seven-member body that meets throughout  \nthe year for purposes of \x93conservation and development of game  \nresources.\x94 Hunting is an important part of the local culture and  \nattracts tourists. You\x92d think Palin would find the most qualified  \npeople to sit on that board.\n\nIn Palin\x92s judgment, one of the most qualified people she could find  \nwas her retired middle-school basketball coach, Lewis D. Bradley.\n\nPalin \x97 known these days by her high school basketball nickname,  \n\x93Sarah Barracuda\x94 \x97 has frequently described her childhood sports  \ncareer as a formative experience.\n\nTo be fair, on Bradley\x92s resume (here), he notes that hunting, fishing  \nand carving antlers are special interests of his. He also points out  \nthat he is working on a sheep hunting guide book, though the writing  \nprogress has stalled since he started remodeling his house.\n\nI checked out the payscale for Board of Game members. It looks like  \nthere is an hourly rate of $31, for a job that meets 20-25 times a  \nyear, according to the description. Travel expenses are also covered,  \nincluding a per diem \x97 not that it\x92s possible to abuse that.\n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
