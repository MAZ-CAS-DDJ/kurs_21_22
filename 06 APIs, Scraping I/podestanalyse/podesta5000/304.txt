Part of it's the competitive person in me -- I know Mitt Romney's been practicing for this moment for months, so I can't wait to cheer our guy on.\n \nBut most of all, I love getting together with my friends and fellow supporters to get energized for the last big push before November 6th.\n\nSomething tells me you might be a debate fan, too. \n\nIf you are, you should know that one of your neighbors in Washington is holding a watch party for the first debate on Wednesday, October 3rd. You should drop by and watch:\n\nhttps://my.barackobama.com/page/event/detail/2012debatewatchparty/gsbd8d\n\nHere are the details:\n\n    What: Debate watch party in Washington\n\n    Where: 4616 47th Street N W\n    Washington, DC 20016\n\n    When: Wednesday, October 3rd\n    8:30 pm\n\nRSVP here:\n\nhttps://my.barackobama.com/page/event/detail/2012debatewatchparty/gsbd8d\n\nAnd check out all the events happening near you on Wednesday:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Watch-the-Debate\n\nThe debates are going to define these last few weeks of the election, starting with the one this Wednesday -- and there's no better way to enjoy them than with other supporters (by the way, you should bring your friends, too).\n \nThousands of folks just like you will watch at volunteer-organized parties across the country, all coming together to cheer on President Obama.\n\nSo whether you're looking forward to the company, the competition, or the policy, I hope you can make it out to the debate watch party in Washington this Wednesday.\n\nRSVP here:\n\nhttps://my.barackobama.com/page/event/detail/2012debatewatchparty/gsbd8d\n\nCan't wait,\n\nJen\n \nJen O'Malley Dillon\nDeputy Campaign Manager\nObama for America\n\nP.S. -- Right after the debate, Vice President Biden will be appearing in an exclusive livestream discussion for watch party attendees.
