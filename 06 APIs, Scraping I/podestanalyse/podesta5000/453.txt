It was a reminder of why we must build a\nmovement that fights for justice on all fronts and forces candidates to\ntalk about the issues that our families care most about, like raising\nwages, creating a pathway to citizenship, ensuring justice in every\ncommunity, and prioritizing affordable, quality home care and child care\nfor all families.\n\n\n\nThe debate stood in stark contrast to our home care roundtable event with\nHillary Clinton earlier in the day in Los Angeles. This was the second\nroundtable event we\xe2\x80\x99ve held with Secretary Clinton since the Executive\nCommittee directed us to begin engaging presidential candidates on our\nagenda for working people back in March.\n\n\n\nSecretary Clinton listened to the stories of home care providers like\nAretha Peters from Cleveland. Aretha\xe2\x80\x99s story follows below. You can watch\nvideo of the event here <https://youtu.be/Mr6x3Z7dVSw>, and read a great\nstory in the Los Angeles Times here\n<http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-clinton-home-care-20150806-story.html>.\n\n\n\n\n*Aretha Peters \xe2\x80\x93 home care worker from Cleveland, OH*\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a single mom who works hard to provide for my kids. But I only make $8\nan hour and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have vacation or sick time. I work more than 50 hours a\nweek, yet I\xe2\x80\x99m unable to support my family\xe2\x80\x99s basic needs. I struggle to keep\nfood on the table and spend hours in line at the food bank. This month I\nhad to choose between paying a full month\xe2\x80\x99s rent and buying new shoes for\nmy eight-year-old to replace her pair with holes in the bottom.\n\n\n\nAnd now Hillary Clinton knows it. She learned from all the home care\nworkers in the room that we are not just making sacrifices; we are making\nthem with love and compassion for others. These jobs aren\xe2\x80\x99t easy and we are\nworth more.\n\n\n\nI was encouraged when the Secretary said:\n\n\n\n*\xe2\x80\x9cThis movement to give dignity and respect and better pay and benefits and\ntraining to home care workers is one of the most important missions that we\nshould take on together. You are on the front lines and the rest of us have\nto be supporting and advocating for you.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n\n\n\nAnd when she recognized how special home care workers are:\n\n\n\n*\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s good at this work. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just anyone you\ncan trust in your home. The union, the training, it makes a huge\ndifference.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n\n\n\nI was so encouraged to look in her face and see compassion. Secretary\nClinton asked questions, she wanted to know more about us. This day has\nbeen the highlight of the last two years of reaching out to our fellow home\ncare workers, marching in the streets, and fighting for $15. Hillary\nClinton knows we need higher wages, paid time off, sick time, vacation, and\na union and why that matters; not just to home care workers, but to our\nconsumers, too.\n\n\n\nI want to say thank you to SEIU for this amazing opportunity. I was honored\nto be at the table with amazing home care workers from across the country.\n\n\n\nI am inspired by *Kindalay Cummings-Akers* from Massachusetts, who just won\n$15 an hour with her union sisters and brothers. She made clear that home\ncare workers are a force in the 2016 election, saying the best\npresident is *\xe2\x80\x9csomeone\nwho supports the home care workers and our consumers, especially seniors\nand veterans. We home care workers will be out there knocking on doors to\nget word out, talking to our neighbors. Home care workers and our issues\nshould be right out front.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n\n\n\nI learned about the training course *Regina Sutton* from California took\npart in* \xe2\x80\x9cThis has helped us learn how to be care team. Me as the provider,\nKaren as the consumer, her doctor, her therapist, we come together and make\nsure we know the needs Karen has.\xe2\x80\x9d *I think all home care workers and\nconsumers should have access to a program like that.\n\n\n\nAnd *Karen Johnson*, a consumer from CA, made clear that Regina is such an\nimportant part of her life. She shared that her chronic pain drove her to\nattempt suicide. And then she met Regina. *\xe2\x80\x9cI like to be independent and\nmake people laugh and now I have that back. And it\xe2\x80\x99s just a blessing.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n\n\n\n*Susie Young* told us about the better health outcomes her clients have\nthanks to the great programs SEIU has built in Washington State. And,\nWashington home care workers have won the first \xe2\x80\x93 and only \xe2\x80\x93 retirement\nplan in the country. *\xe2\x80\x9cWe found our voices. We came out of our shadows. We\nbecame invisible no more.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n\n\n\n*Sumer Spika* fought for years to win her union and says her greatest\nvictory is paid time off \xe2\x80\x93 as a single mom, I can really relate to that.\nShe is living the struggle of caring for a family on home care wages. *\xe2\x80\x9cWhen\nI first became a caregiver there were no benefits. I found myself in the\ngrocery store with a baby on my hip and a screaming toddler at my side\nhaving to choose between buying toilet paper or laundry soap.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n\n\n\n*Lizabeth Bonilla* has been a home care worker for four decades and is\nsounding the alarm about the senior care gap and is worried about what\nhappens when it\xe2\x80\x99s her turn. *\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m 60 years old. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be my turn to\nbe the client. What do I have? Nothing. I have nothing to show for 42 years\nof my life. If I get sick, I get sick, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t get paid. So I have\nabsolutely nothing. Nothing at all. I had to humble myself after 42 years\nof work to get food stamps.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n\n\n\nAnd *Latonya Allen* is fired up about the Fight for $15 and spreading the\nword in the South. *\xe2\x80\x9cI love the job that I do, I\xe2\x80\x99m very passionate about\nit. Home care workers don\xe2\x80\x99t get the pay they deserve. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been hurt on the\njob, with no worker compensation. We have no benefits, no vacation, no sick\ntime. So what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is for you to please stand by us, walk with us,\nand help us win a living wage.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n\n\n\nNow more than ever, home care workers know what\xe2\x80\x99s possible when we stick\ntogether and demand change for our families. Together, we will keep uniting\nwith thousands of homecare workers across the country to make a difference\nfor home care workers and all working families in 2016.\n\n\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to go back home and tell everyone we need to keep fighting. We\nare out of the shadows and we are not going to stop until everyone across\nthe nation has a living wage and a union.\xe2\x80\x9d\n"
