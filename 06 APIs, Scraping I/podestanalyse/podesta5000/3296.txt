But the administration's current policies throughout the region suggest that the White House no longer sees Iran as the key problem. Rather, it views the clerical regime as a potential partner, particularly when it comes to combating Sunni extremists like al Qaeda and ISIS. As Obama has explained in several interviews, the Iranian regime, while problematic, represents a real nation-state and rational actor that looks out for its interests and responds to incentives\xe2\x80\x94which is not the case for non-state actors.\n\nThe White House has re-prioritized American strategy in the Middle East. Its policies in Syria and Iraq demonstrate that it now sees groups like al Qaeda and ISIS\xe2\x80\x94rather than Iran\xe2\x80\x94as the key threat to American interests. The question is whether the Obama administration has got it right. And if it's wrong, what are the likely consequences?\n\nOn August 14th, Hudson Institute Senior Fellow Lee Smith will moderate an expert panel featuring Michael Doran, Hillel Fradkin, and Brian Katulis to discuss whether non-state Sunni extremism or Iran constitutes the major strategic threat to American interests in the region.\n\nLunch will be provided.\n\nThis event will be live streamed on  Hudson's homepage [http://hudson.org].\n\nPanel          Michael Doran\n\nMichael Doran is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center for Middle East Policy where he specializes in Middle East security issues.
