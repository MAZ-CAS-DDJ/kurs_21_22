john.podesta@gmail.comb'Good Evening -\n\nWe are once again facing the possibility of a government shutdown. This would wreak havoc on our economy and provide further evidence that many in Congress are more interested in representing themselves -- not the rest of us.\n\nBut the choice is ours, not theirs. If we take just a few minutes to register to vote and show up on Election Day, weeks like this one won\xe2\x80\x99t happen. We can choose better representation. It is when we stay home that we allow this reprehensible behavior.\n\nWe deserve representatives who put forth plans to help make college more affordable, ensure job growth, and protect our most basic civil rights.\n\nMake sure you take the power back and visit www.ourtime.org/vote to register to vote now.\n\nEnough is enough. We deserve better.\n\nThanks.\n\nAndrew Lee\nExecutive Director, OurTime.org\n\nPS - Visit www.ourtime.org/vote to do your part and register to vote today.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you believe you received this message in error or wish to no longer receive email from us, please https://act.myngp.com/el/-2547472149304178688/3675918660687759360.'
