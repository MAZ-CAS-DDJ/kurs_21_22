Coordinating our efforts with friendly nations is vital to our national security and the security of our European allies. Extending certain rights to their citizens will also help foster a trusting and mutually beneficial relationship for American and European businesses. In short, this legislation will bolster our intelligence gathering capabilities and protect civil liberties at home and abroad."\nCongressman Conyers: "For more than a decade, our allies in Europe have worked with federal law enforcement to ensure that our recordkeeping is both accurate and complete.  In support of that vital relationship, this legislation offers our allies a limited set of privacy protections.  This bill is a measure of basic fairness-our friends abroad should have some course of redress with respect to information that they provided to the U.S. government in the first place.  The Obama Administration fully backs this proposal, and I look forward to its speedy passage."\n\n\n\nFrom: Waddoups, Shawn\nSent: Wednesday, March 18, 2015 6:40 PM\nTo: \'Bruce.Swartz@usdoj.gov\'; \'noyesjv@state.gov\'; \'Thomas.Burrows@usdoj.gov\'; \'Kenneth.Harris@usdoj.gov\'; \'Stevan.Bunnell@hq.dhs.gov\'; \'karen.neuman@hq.dhs.gov\'; \'Michael.Scardaville@HQ.DHS.GOV\'; \'MooreWC@state.gov\'; \'freriksenld@state.gov\'; \'KiingiEM@state.gov\'; \'Catherine.Ahn@treasury.gov\'; \'Young.Lee2@treasury.gov\'; \'Jocelyn.Aqua@usdoj.gov\'; Herms, Kevin; \'Erika.Brown.Lee@usdoj.gov\'; \'Jacob.Thiessen@treasury.gov\'; \'JAntonipillai@doc.gov\'; Edelman, R.
