Dan / Jake (I\'d imagine Ann is asleep), could you\nplease revise?  I am sorry for the last minute; I was asleep when it came\nthrough last night.\n\nMy edits changed to goals language to dial back sounding like proactive\nfederal policy -- because we havent settled on the design choice yet, for\nhow to realize these goals.  I also moved the insurance paragraph up,\nbecause our current plan would not monkey with insurance rules at the\nfederal level in a major way, so i didn\'t want it to sound like we were\nproposing an ACA/insurance change...
