The bill passed the House and missed in the Senate by 1 vote \xe2\x80\x94 Scott Brown having said he would support and then not (there were 59 Democrats at the time).\r\n\r\nIn 2012 there was a slightly stripped down version offered by Whitehouse in the Senate.  By then, we had lost control of the House and it had no chance of passing.  It was not passed in either House.\r\n\r\nThere is also a Wyden Mirkowsi disclosure bill in 2012 that never went anywhere but was bipartisan.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMarc E.

It has three major components to get rid of dark money:\r\n\r\n\r\no Require all groups that engage in more than $10,000 in political spending, including for-profit corporations, labor unions, and social welfare nonprofits, to disclose their donors.\r\n\r\n\r\no To prevent organizations from \xe2\x80\x9claundering\xe2\x80\x9d their money by transferring it through multiple organizations and thereby hiding the original identity, require any transfers over $50,000 to another organization while knowing the money will be used for political spending to be disclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\no Expand the electioneering restriction window: 120 days before any presidential contest; starting on January 1 of an election year for any congressional contests.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sat, May 9, 2015 at 11:55 AM, Robby Mook <re47@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:re47@hillaryclinton.com>> wrote:\r\nDisclose requires you to list your 5 biggest donors right?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 9, 2015, at 11:48 AM, Jake Sullivan <jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com>> wrote:\r\n\r\nGuys - this is what I was raising with you all on the call on Thursday when we discussed next steps on campaign finance reform.  As Marc says, it is match for small dollar donations.   I continue to think this would be a smart move - and I believe we can support the bill or at least a variant of the proposal.  I'm adding Dan because we have already done work with the Brennan Center on this topic.\r\n\r\nDISCLOSE is good too, but I would go further.\r\n\r\nMaya, in working these up, touch base with Dan on the work already done.\r\n\r\nOn May 9, 2015, at 11:39 AM, Maya Harris <mharris@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:mharris@hillaryclinton.com>> wrote:\r\n\r\nI will touch base with our experts on EMPOWER.
