LERNER\n\n4/14/15 9:55 PM EDT\nUpdated 4/14/15 10:31 PM EDT\n\nGov. Chris Christie spent Tuesday reassuring his supporters that he\xe2\x80\x99s still\nbold, still brash and should still very much be in the 2016 conversation.\n\nOn the Hugh Hewitt show, the New Jersey Republican told\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_UDY0IxglY> the host outright, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I run,\nI will beat [Hillary Clinton].\xe2\x80\x9d He mentioned Pennsylvania, New Mexico, New\nHampshire and Colorado as four states won by President Barack Obama in 2008\nand 2012 that he believes he could put in play.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHe also took a swipe <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgH3qINvNqo> at the\nDemocratic front-runner on foreign policy, criticizing Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creset\xe2\x80\x9d\nwith Russia while secretary of state as akin to \xe2\x80\x9callow[ing] Vladimir Putin\nto believe that he can move in on Crimea.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThere would be no\nmisunderstandings between Mr. Putin and I if I were president,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\nIn an interview\n<https://www.yahoo.com/politics/chris-christie-bets-on-bold-chris-christie-116349714161.html>\nwith\nYahoo News\xe2\x80\x99 Matt Bai, Christie dismissed comparisons between 2016 and 2012,\nwhen the Garden State governor decided to forgo a presidential bid despite\nnumerous Republican heavy-hitters urging him to run.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only way you\xe2\x80\x99re going to perform well is if you believe in your heart\nthat you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to be president. And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. And so there was no way I\nwould have won in 2012. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have, because I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\n[image: New Jersey Gov.
