john.podesta@gmail.comb'Made this a little playful, but still strong--could tone it down, remove\nMadeleine, etc. if you want. I listened to the segment again to make sure I\nwas getting the right guest, and it was actually Ilya Lozovsky, Assistant\nEditor of Democracy Lab, Foreign Policy... which somehow seems worse.\n\nDear Kojo,\nOne of your faithful weekly listeners, Madeleine Albright, contacted our\noffice today to alert us to a glaring error made by a guest during your\nsegment on "Think Tanks & Transparency: A Global Perspective." While\nattempting to demonstrate the "Merchants of Doubt" thesis that think tanks,\nboth conservative and liberal alike, "follow the ideological dictates of\ntheir funders," Foreign Policy\'s Ilya Lozovsky mentioned John Podesta in\nconnection with running the "lobbying group" Podesta Group (which, he said,\nnotably has a blog post\n<http://www.podesta.com/pipeline/how-think-smart-about-think-tanks>\nadvising how to take advantage of the many Washington, D.C. think tanks).\n\nWe just wanted to clarify that John does not run Podesta Group, nor is he\neven employed there. His brother Tony Podesta is the founder and chairman.\nThough this is a commonly made mistake by people who\'ve never seen John and\nTony together in person, we\'re hoping you\'d be willing to issue a\ncorrection.  There may be examples of what Mr. Lozovsky was trying to\nillustrate on the liberal end of the spectrum, but his error did not serve\nto underscore that point for your listeners.\n\nThank you,\nEryn\n\nOn Mon, Mar 23, 2015 at 4:53 PM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n> I think a request for correction to Kojo cc the guest is the way to go.\n> Want to.
