This debate is an important one for our country.\n\nFor everyone asking for more information, I wanted to \nmake sure you had the chance to hear from President \nObama himself. \n\nHe's addressing the nation tonight -- you can watch it live \nhere at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time:\n\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/Live\n\nThere's a lot to do to pass the agenda Americans voted for \nlast fall -- that's work that we'll remain focused on. More on \nthat soon. \n\nFor now, thank you for everything you do.\n\nJon\n\nJon Carson\nExecutive Director\nOrganizing for Action\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for Action\n\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo update your address, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/change-address?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe from these messages, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscription\nOrganizing for Action, P.O.
