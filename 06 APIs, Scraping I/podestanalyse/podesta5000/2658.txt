They have been survivors.  They were singularly focused on day-to-day survival and the are proud of the job they did on their own with no politician or institution helping them (In their mind hurting them).  They are now breathing easier but on guard.  They are more prepared if the bottom drops out again.  But the are finally moving a bit forward \x97 not in income, and college affordability or retirement \x97 but moving forward in that they are not moving backward.  Again, a little breathing room.  So for the first time in a long time they can actually maybe ponder the future \x97 what does it look like, what can I attain, what can I do for my kids, retirement?, etc \x97 and that is where I think we need to drive the announcement speech.  What does that future look like \x97 not the scary parts, they have that covered, they have been through it. And quite frankly their expectations are not huge, rather they are reasonable.  There are a lot of things that haven\x92t changed about americans during this tough time\x97 they work hard, they have ingenuity, guts, value families and communities.  You can remind them but they know all that.  The only things that hasn\x92t changed is that they feel no one is looking out for them, the deck is stacked in favor of those at the top and the political system is poison.   So, HRC is going to make being middle class mean something again.  She is going to be their champion.  She is going to even the scales.  She is going to change the three things that never change.  That is what we need to lay out and people need to hear.  That is their path to the future.  I think people want to hear about what the path looks like.  Not platitudes but in a relatable, detailed roadmap.\n\n\n\n\x97 John Anzalone\nAnzalone Liszt Grove Research\n334-387-3121\nwww.algpolling.com\ntwitter: @AnzaloneLiszt\n\n'
