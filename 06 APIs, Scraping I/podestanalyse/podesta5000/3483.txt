john.podesta@gmail.comb'NARAL Pro-Choice America\n_____________________________\n   An avalanche of anti-choice bills are flying through state legislatures\n   around the country. Will you chip in $15 to help stop them?\n                                 [1]Donate Now\n\n   Dear John,\n\n   Since 2011, anti-choice state legislatures have passed hundreds of\n   restrictions on abortion.\n\n   This year, the onslaught continues--with attacks that are more outrageous\n   than ever.\n\n   Florida just passed a clinic shutdown bill.^1 Wisconsin recently passed\n   legislation to cut off funding for critical preventive services at\n   family-planning clinics.^2\n\n   And Indiana just passed a bill to further tighten already burdensome\n   restrictions on abortion providers.^3\n\n   And anti-choice legislatures continue to attack Planned Parenthood, even\n   after David Daleiden was indicted for his actions in the calculated smear\n   campaign against the women\'s health group.^2\n\n   [2]Will you chip in $15 to help stop the avalanche of\n   anti-choice attacks in state legislatures?\n\n   Since 2010, state legislatures and governorships have become\n   overwhelmingly dominated by anti-choice extremists.\n\n   A whopping 23 states are completely controlled by anti-choice\n   politicians--including the governor\'s mansion and both houses of the\n   legislature.^4\n\n   And anti-choice lobbyists are taking advantage of this domination by\n   pushing ever more extreme bills to attack abortion rights, often using\n   copycat "model legislation" that are introduced in state after state.\n\n   We need to be as organized and mobilized as our opposition if we stand any\n   chance to stop them.\n\n   [3]Will you chip in $15 to help stop the avalanche of\n   anti-choice attacks in state legislatures?\n\n   Thank you for helping to make reproductive freedom real for all women.\n\n   Ilyse G.
