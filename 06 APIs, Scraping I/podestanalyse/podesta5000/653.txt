Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s effort is aimed\n>>    at helping the people of Flint make significant progress on reaching their\n>>    goal of raising $100 million for this critical fund.\n>>    - *Ask her Hillary for America volunteers to deliver water instead of\n>>    canvassing for votes.* Today, Hillary for America volunteers joined\n>>    the Red Cross and United Way effort to distribute water to the neediest\n>>    residents of Flint.\n>>    - *Provide Connections and Support to Help Health and Education\n>>    Officials Expand their Capacity.* Hillary Clinton has been working in\n>>    the area of child health, development and well-being for decades and she is\n>>    calling on experts from around the country to lend their support and\n>>    services.
