Quick\noverview:\n\n \n\n.         Open seat-incumbent Todd Tiahrt is running for Sam Brownback's\nopen Senate seat (Brownback is running for Governor). \n\n \n\n.         Tough district (R+14) but winnable. Sebelius won it 2002 and 2006.\nObama got 41% in November, a 7-point improvement over Kerry 2004.\n\n \n\n.         Democratic nomination cleared for me (although I am not taking\nanything for granted) and there is a contested Republican primary. We have a\nvery late primary (August 2010). \n\n \n\n.         Our strategy is fairly simple: relentlessly fundraise and execute\nan early, aggressive field program. Karl Agne is my pollster and Rich Davis\n(of Dixon & Davis) is doing the media. Rich has worked with Sebelius since\n2001 and knows Kansas well.\n\n \n\n.         Campaign manager is a great young Obama operative named Mitch\nWallace-he ran the KS Caucus in 2008 and just won the special election as\nfield director for Democrat Scott Murphy in NY-20.\n\n \n\n.         DCCC is very interested. Spent a day there in April and met with\nVan Hollen and all the DCCC staff. All went well.\n\n \n\nWould be grateful if I could run a few questions by you, either by phone or\nemail. If not, I understand completely.\n\n \n\nAnd on timing, I launch in two weeks.  \n\n \n\nThanks! \n\n \n\nRaj\n\n316-681-8133\n\nwww.rajforkansas.com \n\n \n\n"
