There are two issues here.  One is that the air guns themselves kill and injure marine mammals as well as other marine life at high rates. The other issue regards the dangers of oil spills surrounding offshore drilling.\r\n\r\nAndy also included something on seafood fraud.  It seems overly detailed for the purpose of giving you a brief overview, but you may find it interesting none the less.  The take home I believe is that Oceana is very pleased with the White House\'s position and actions they have taken on this issue and wants to thank John for being a champion on this topic.  He is, however, nervous that the momentum could flag and wants to encourage John to keep up the pressure.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you want to talk about any of these.\r\nAlso, please inquire if it would make any sense for John or somebody else at the White House to talk with Andy on either of these topics.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\xf0\x9f\x90\x8b\xf0\x9f\x90\x9f\xf0\x9f\x90\xb3\xf0\x9f\x90\xa0\r\n\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8fJim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSent from my iPad\r\n\r\nBegin forwarded message:\r\n\r\nFrom: "Sharpless, Andrew" <ASharpless@oceana.org<mailto:ASharpless@oceana.org>>\r\nDate: August 25, 2014 at 3:07:15 PM PDT\r\nTo: James Sandler <james@sandlerfoundation.org<mailto:james@sandlerfoundation.org>>\r\nCc: "Haro, Cheryl" <CHaro@oceana.org<mailto:CHaro@oceana.org>>\r\nSubject: Documents for your Dad\'s Podesta Meeting\r\n\r\nJim:\r\n\r\nHere are the two briefers for you.  Let me know if they are what you expected.  I\xe2\x80\x99m really glad that you and your Dad are following up on this with John.  Bottom line, the message on seafood fraud to John is \xe2\x80\x9cYou did a really important thing, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d and on Atlantic Ocean seismic testing, is \xe2\x80\x9cespecially after BP and the Deepwater Horizon disaster, why are you taking these extraordiary risks, and expanding into an area that had been off limits to international oil companies for thirty years?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nAndy\r\n\r\nAndrew Sharpless\r\nChief Executive Officer, Oceana\r\n'
