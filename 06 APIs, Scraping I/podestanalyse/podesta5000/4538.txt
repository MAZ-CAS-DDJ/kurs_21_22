john.podesta@gmail.comb'I just saw the film. I do not agree with you. \nFacts\nGuy stopped for selling loose cigarettes. Surrounded by at least four police officers. One officer seizes him in an illegal choke hold to take him down (illegal under clearly known police department rules). I saw no threatening gestures by Garner which suggested the need to take him down. Even if the choke hold were not illegal, the actions by the four officers was clearly excessive.\n\nSent from my iPad'
