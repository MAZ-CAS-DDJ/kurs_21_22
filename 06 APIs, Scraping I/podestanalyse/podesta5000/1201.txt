I skipped over that because it is sandwiched in the middle of the hit on citizenship.  \n\nFeels out of place to me there - "not one" should roll right into "when they talk..."   But I defer to you guys.  \n\n\n\n\n> On May 4, 2015, at 11:18 PM, Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com> wrote:\n> \n> It is indeed. \n> \n> Sent from my iPhone\n> \n> On May 4, 2015, at 10:59 PM, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n> \n>> It\'s here:\n>> \n>> And make no mistake: Not a single Republican candidate has clearly and consistently supported a path to citizenship.

I will fight to defend the executive actions that protect Dreamers from deportation.  And, if Congress refuses to act, as President I will do everything possible under the law to go even further.
