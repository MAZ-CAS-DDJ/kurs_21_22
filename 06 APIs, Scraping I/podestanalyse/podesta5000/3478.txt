john.podesta@gmail.comb"Hi John and Dennis and fyi Bari - pls see the traffic below from Jim - he references that Tom may be interested in supporting the CF. John serendipitous timing given we talked about this Thursday at the CGI retreat. Please let me know how I can help f/u. Bari can give you more color Dennis on Jim and common sense and the new organization his brother Tom is helping fund (you may remember Tom from mom's campaign as he was a big supporter of hers). Keep me posted on how I can help! Thanks.\nChelsea\n\n________________________________________\nFrom: Jim Steyer [jim@commonsense.org]\nSent: Monday, February 06, 2012 10:37 AM\nTo: Diane Reynolds\nCc: Bari Lurie; Carina Mifuel\nSubject: Re: Quick chat\n\nSounds good. Btw, we had a good chat with Ginny Erlich last week re childhood obesity and I had great meetings with Neera in DC re the kids campaign ... Will give you the update on that and the book stuff.\n\nAnd my bro is potentially interested in chatting about collaboration with the Clinton Foundation... He may be in NYC on Feb 16th.\n\nGood luck and we will talk very soon.\n\nJim\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Diane Reynolds [mailto:dreynolds@clintonemail.com]\nSent: Monday, February 06, 2012 07:25 AM\nTo: Jim Steyer\nCc: Bari Lurie <bari@chelseaoffice.com>\nSubject: RE: Quick chat\n\nHi Jim - later in the week is tough because we have the Clinton Trustees meeting and the Clinton Health Access Iniative board meeting - maybe later on Friday afternoon though? I've cc'ed Bari though who is probably free to connect this week when I may not be if its a logistical or similar question. Or maybe you cld connect w/ Bari and then we cld touch base?\nHope you and all are well\nChelsea\n\n________________________________________\nFrom: Jim Steyer [jim@commonsense.org]\nSent: Monday, February 06, 2012 9:18 AM\nTo: Diane Reynolds\nSubject: Re: Quick chat\n\nHi Chelsea,\n\nHope you had a good weekend, and look forward tro seeing you next week in NYC.\n\nCan we touch base briefly by phone towards the latter half of this week?\n\nCheers,\n\nJi\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Diane Reynolds [mailto:dreynolds@clintonemail.com]\nSent: Thursday, February 02, 2012 06:58 AM\nTo: Jim Steyer\nSubject: Re: Quick chat\n\nHi Jim - I'm not unfortunately.
