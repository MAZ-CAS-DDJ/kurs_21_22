The R\xe2\x80\x99s have dragged their feet, using document production as an excuse.  Recently, Gowdy has said he wanted her to testify twice, the first time about emails, maybe by deposition.   My response to Gowdy\xe2\x80\x99s staff has been:  she\xe2\x80\x99ll come once, in public\xe2\x80\x94you can ask her about emails then, if you want.  I would hate for us to say something that might give them leverage on a two-appearance push.\r\n\r\nI attach a draft of the Gowdy letter, but it\xe2\x80\x99s very near final.  Please don\xe2\x80\x99t send outside the group.\r\n\r\nI await advice on release.  Philippe has raised a concern about  sending it to Gowdy, then immediately releasing it to the public.  Since Gowdy released his server request last Friday very quickly, he may release our letter as soon as he gets it.  I\xe2\x80\x99m agnostic.\r\n\r\nFrom: Jennifer Palmieri [mailto:jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com]\r\nSent: Friday, March 27, 2015 1:10 PM\r\nTo: John Podesta\r\nCc: Nick Merrill; Heather Samuelson; Kristina Schake; Philippe Reines; Jake Sullivan; Cheryl Mills; Kendall, David; Huma Abedin\r\nSubject: Re: Tomorrow | Gowdy\r\n\r\nHow about this, then?
