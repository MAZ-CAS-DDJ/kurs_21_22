Ops center, which is comparatively apolitical and professional, has translation capabilities and can assist as desired with notetaking.  \r\n \r\nOn Wed. am, we need to contact the State Dept Executive Secretary to ask them to facilitate.  Please advise if you want to do, Chris, or you want one of us to do.\r\n \r\nThanks,\r\n \r\nSusan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nPlan your next getaway with AOL Travel.
