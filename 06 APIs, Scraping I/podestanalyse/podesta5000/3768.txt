It\xb9s fair to ask,\nas our ad does, who does he use the clout for?\xb2\n \n            Last week, Campaign Money Watch announced a $385,000 purchase of\nairtime in three markets \xad Lexington, Louisville and northern Kentucky. This\nweek\xb9s additional buy brings the group\xb9s spending to $1,185,000 across\nbroadcast and cable in seven media markets.\n \n            \xb3McConnell wanted a debate on his own clout and now he\xb9s got\none,\xb2 Donnelly said. \xb3I think Mitch McConnell, in talking about his power in\nthe Senate, is the only politician in America who is running with\nWashington, not against it.\xb2\n \n            Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\xb9s opposition\nto campaign finance reform and public financing of elections is well\ndocumented. He led filibusters against campaign finance reform throughout\nthe late 1990s. McConnell threatened business leaders who supported reform\nwith implied legislative retribution. He sued the federal government \xad and\nlost \xad over the McCain-Feingold law. In June 2007, McConnell testified\nbefore his own Senate Rules Committee in opposition to the bipartisan Fair\nElections Now Act, a bill to make public money available to candidates who\nagree to spending limits.\n \n            Campaign Money Watch has a successful history of holding\npoliticians accountable who oppose reform. The group led the effort to drive\nindicted former Majority Leader Tom DeLay from office, as well as conducted\na voter education effort in Ralph Reed\xb9s primary race for lieutenant\ngovernor in Georgia. Campaign Money Watch is a project of Public Campaign\nAction Fund.\n \n### \n\n-- \nDavid Miller\nCommunications/Web Manager\nPublic Campaign Action Fund/Campaign Money Watch\n1828 L St. NW #250\nWashington, DC 20036\n(202) 448-6154\n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail lori@progressiveaccountability.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
