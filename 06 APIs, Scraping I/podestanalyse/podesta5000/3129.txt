My dad never graduated high school and took any job he thought could help support our family -- even working as a paid pallbearer.\n\nThey taught me the importance of hard work and a good education, and I remember these values by keeping a photo beside my desk of my mother meeting President John F. Kennedy.\n\nThroughout my life, I've worked to honor my parents and the spirit of Kennedy's legacy by giving back to the community through efforts that bring people together.\n\nThat's what New Way for New Jersey, and this new video, is all about. I hope you'll take a moment to watch and share it with your friends and family:\n\nhttp://act.NewWay4NJ.com/Watch-Democratic-Values\n\nI built a successful career by learning how economies grow and create jobs. I've led charities to help troubled teens and domestic abuse survivors, and these organizations have changed thousands of lives for the better. \n\nI've started New Way for New Jersey because I know if you look for answers in the same old places, you'll just end up with the same old problems.\n\nLet's get started building a better tomorrow for New Jersey families -- watch and share the video: \n\nhttp://act.NewWay4NJ.com/Watch-Democratic-Values\n\nThank you,\n\nPhil\n\nPhilip D.
