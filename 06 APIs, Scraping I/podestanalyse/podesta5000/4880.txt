There is a lot of attention from USG, but the most important needs are people on the ground who can deliver care and establish trust with the Liberians.

They are working to ensure that the people in the most rural counties are as prepared as possible.  Hard to do with so much attention (not inappropriately) on the disaster in Monrovia.  I am afraid we are going to see cases in Cote d\'Ivoire imminently.  Hard to believe that they are not already.\n>>>> \n>>>> Have you guys been receiving the CDC updates?

Boedigheimer MBA Lead - State Coordination Task Force (2014 Ebola Response) regarding Liberia. They are concerned this crisis could destabilize the government.  They are aware of how hospitals like JFK may actually transmit the disease because they do not have the equipment and training to contain it.  Docs without Borders is going to have 1000 beds but don\xe2\x80\x99t think that will be enough.  They are training sending DART (Disaster Assistance Response Team) with equipment etc.  I advised them of the cultural issues-eg how cremation would probably not be accepted and how mysticism plays into their fears etc.\n>>>> \n>>>> I suggested they consider rotating health care workers like the HEARTT group does so as to give people a time limited experience (e.g. a month)which would allow more people to volunteer.  It appears as if CDC will start taking somewhat of a lead but there will probably be a variety of groups doing their own thing.  What is concerning is how long NGOs will stay.  It does appear that the US gov will be taking a stronger lead as evidenced by Tom Freiden-head of CDC being in Liberia today.\n>>>> \n>>>> That\xe2\x80\x99s it for now\n>>>> \n>>>> Jim\n>>>> \n>>>> \n>>>>> On Aug 25, 2014, at 10:43 PM, Mae Podesta <mpodesta@gmail.com> wrote:\n>>>>> \n>>>>> I just saw that Dr. Borbor passed away....I can\'t get over that this is just beyond horrible.
