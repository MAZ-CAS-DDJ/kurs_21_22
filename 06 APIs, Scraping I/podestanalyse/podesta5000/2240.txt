john.podesta@gmail.comb'::: ProgressNow - Building the online progressive movement state by state ::: \n\n\n\nDear Friends and Colleagues,\n\nIt might have only been two weeks since the election, but we\nhaven\'t stopped moving forward on our work in the 21-state\nnetwork of ProgressNow and ProgressNow Education.\n\nAs we get ready for the holiday, it\'s time to face up to the\nfact that we\'ll be talking over turkey with our conservative\nrelatives - even if they lost in the election. Our Iowa\naffiliate put together a great guide here to help you navigate the\nmeal - using facts, and kindness.\n\nMany of our other states are releasing their "Turkey of the\nYear" awards - Virginia chose Attorney General Cuccinelli\nfor the honor due in large part to his nationally-known efforts to\nroll back rights for women\'s health.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the time together with family and friends and, like\nus, return refreshed and ready to keep on fighting.\n\nDenise Cardinal\nExecutive Director\nProgressNow\nProgressNow Education\n\nP.S. Down in Georgia we didn\'t stop working on Election Day.\nBetter Georgia leaked a video of the Georgia GOP Senate Caucus\n"learning" about President Obama\'s alleged secret\nmind-control plot. The conspiracy theory was so outrageous Majority\nLeader Chip Rogers stepped down from his leadership role within three\ndays. Rogers also serves as national treasurer for ALEC.\n\n\n\n:::\n\nCopyright 2012 ProgressNow\n\nChange your e-mail preferences or unsubscribe: http://www.pnstate.org/site/CO?i=NHCtFNWTwOVqEB0BUM22ub-hNLFMVwnb&cid=0\n\n'
