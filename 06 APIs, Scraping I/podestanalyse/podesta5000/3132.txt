I would greatly appreciate it if you could put a good word in for Lizzie. Attached are her cover letter, resume, and writing sample. She is a sociology major at Connecticut College in New London (my hometown) with a 3.08 average and strong writing skills.  As part of her Sociology major she has taken several courses on race relations, which is a special interest of hers as an Asian American adoptee from South Korea. In addition, she also studied immigration issues as part of her Danish Politics course during her semester abroad in Copenhagen.  She has also focused on global women\xe2\x80\x99s empowerment, child exploitation, education and special needs children issues  through internships with Child Plan, a global non-profit focused on young women and children, For Love of Children (FLOC) a DC based tutoring program and an Arlington County School Summer Life Skills Program for special needs children. Lizzie is very committed to making a contribution on important public policy issues like race relations, immigration, human trafficking and child exploitation. She is a hard worker, capable of juggling many tasks and would be honored to have the opportunity to work at CAP.\r\nThanks very much for any assistance you can provide, Claudia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClaudia James | Principal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPodesta Group | 1001 G Street, NW Suite 1000 West, Washington, DC 20001\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n202.879.9310 (d) | 202.270.9310 (c) | james@podestagroup.com<mailto:james@podestagroup.com> | www.podestagroup.com<http://www.podestagroup.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe information contained in this transmission is attorney privileged and/or confidential information intended for the use of the individual or entity named above.
