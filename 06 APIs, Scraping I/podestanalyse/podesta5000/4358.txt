She'll be relentless in making sure everyone gets a fair shot.\n\nFor those reasons and more, she's the fighter I want alongside me in Washington. But right now, the polls show her tied and her opponent has a $2 million cash advantage. \n\nTo hold our majority in the Senate, we need to elect Elizabeth. That's why I'm asking you now to join me in making a direct contribution to her campaign. It has to be now so she can come out of the convention with a wave of momentum that will carry her to victory in November.\n\n*Rush $5 or more to help elect Elizabeth Warren to the U.S. Senate. She's the middle-class champion we need in Washington.* [ https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/warrengillibrand ]\n\nThanks,\n\nKirsten \n \n \n \n\n\nThis message was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.
