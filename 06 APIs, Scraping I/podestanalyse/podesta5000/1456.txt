john.podesta@gmail.comb'Colleagues:\n\n\n\nI know the facts are still coming in about the tragic school shooting in Newtown, CT.  Our NEA Health Information Network is in contact with our local and school officials on the ground there.  The NEA and AFT national communications teams are coordinating as well.\n\n\n\nFor those who may not be aware, we have a research-based crisis guide and world class crisis response team that is frequently deployed.  They were on the ground 24/7 during the Columbine tragedy.  The guide is a really useful tool for administrators and school board members to use during this type of tragedy.  http://crisisguide.neahin.org/crisisguide.  It is a step by step guide for educators and administrators about how to respond to a school crisis, including providing advice to educators about how to talk about these incidents with kids in an age appropriate way.\n\n\n\nStudents across the country will likely hear about this tragedy, so educators and administrators across the US will need to know how to address this in their own schools tomorrow when children come back to school.  The questions and suggested lesson plans/discussion guide can be modified for any educator (whether in an impacted school or not) to use with students.  The most important thing all educators, parents, and other adults must do for kids is to create a sense of normalcy and assure a sense of safety.\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to share our guide<http://crisisguide.neahin.org/crisisguide> or links to pages with your networks.\n\n\nHow Parents Can help:  http://crisisguide.neahin.org/crisisguide/tools/p3_2.html\nHow Educators can help: http://crisisguide.neahin.org/crisisguide/tools/p2_17.html\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd please keep the families of students and educators in Newtown in your prayers.  I\'ll forward our statement when it\'s ready.\n\n\n\nKim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*******************************************************************\nOnly the individual sender is responsible for the content of the\nmessage, and the message does not necessarily reflect the position\nor policy of the National Education Association or its affiliates.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to dubois.sara@gmail.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
