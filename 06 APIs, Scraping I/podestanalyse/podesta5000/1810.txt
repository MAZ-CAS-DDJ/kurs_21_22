They were her first remarks on the issue since grand juries declined to indict the white police officers accused in the two deaths.\n\nThe Boston event came the day after a grand jury in Staten Island, New York, chose not to indict a police officer in the death of Eric Garner, who was placed in a choke-hold during his encounter with the police. The decision sparking a series of protests throughout New York City and headlines questioning the judicial process just days after a grand jury last week refused to indict a police officer accused of shooting 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nClinton\x92s comments on the DOJ probes echo calls from a number of civil rights leaders, such as the Rev. Al Sharpton, and her former New York congressional colleagues, who have urged the feds to take a close look at both cases.\n\n\x93I know that a lot of hearts are breaking and we are asking ourselves aren\x92t these our sons aren\x92t these our brothers,\x94 Clinton said. \x93I\x92m very pleased that the Department of Justice will be investigating what happened in Ferguson or Staten Island. Those families and those communities and our country deserve a fair and full accounting as well as whatever substantive reforms are necessary to assure quality justice and respect for every citizen.\x94\n\n\x93More broadly,\x94 Clinton went on, \x93each of us has to grapple with some hard truths about race and justice in America. Because, despite all the progress we\x92ve made together, African-Americans \x97 most particularly African-American men \x97 are still more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms.\x94\n\nShe added that \x93a third of all black men face the prospect of prison in their lifetimes \x97 what devastating (consequences) that has for their families.\x94\n\n\x93The United States has less than 5 percent of the world\x92s population, yet we have almost 25 percent of the world\x92s total prison population,\x94 said Clinton, a former secretary of state. \x93Now, that is not because Americans are more violent or criminal than other (people) around the world, but it is because we have allowed our criminal justice system to get out of balance, and I personally hope that these tragedies give us the opportunity to come together as a nation to find our balance again.\x94\n\nShe praised the \x93creative and effective police departments\x94 around the nation that demonstrate \x93that it is possible to keep us safe and reduce crime and violence.\x94\n\n\x93There are decent, honorable brave police officers out in our communities every single day, inspiring trust and confidence rather than fear and frustration,\x94 she said. \x93So let\x92s learn from the best examples.\x94\n\nClinton also tackled an issue that\x92s risen in the wake of the Ferguson shooting: whether to demilitarize police forces. She called for keeping the good and getting rid of \x93weapons of war that have no place on our streets and contribute to unnecessary force or arrest.\x94\n\nAs for the president\x92s task force and proposals for new funding streams for training and technology, Clinton called those \x93important steps.\x94\n\nBut going forward, she said, will require understanding other people\x92s struggles.\n\n\x93The most important thing that each of us can do is to try even harder to see the world through our neighbor\x92s eyes, to imagine what it is like to walk in their shoes, to share their pain and their hopes and their dreams,\x94 she said. \x93These tragedies did not happen in some far away place. They didn\x92t happen to some other people. These are our streets, our children, our fellow Americans and our grief.\x94\n\nAnd she quoted Brown\x92s father in saying, \x93We are stronger united.\x94\n\nClinton gave extensive remarks about Brown\x92s death and the days of rolling protests a few weeks after he was shot to death by a police officer who claimed he was attacked by the 18-year-old. At that time, in a paid speech, Clinton urged people in the crowd to try to imagine what they would feel like if they faced the same statistics of being stopped by police as black people face.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Clinton\x92s appearance at the Boston conference was a paid speech.\n\nFrom: Jake Sullivan <Jake.Sullivan@gmail.com<mailto:Jake.Sullivan@gmail.com>>\nDate: Thursday, December 4, 2014 at 10:37 AM\nTo: Dan <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com<mailto:dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>>\nCc: Cheryl Mills <cheryl.mills@gmail.com<mailto:cheryl.mills@gmail.com>>, Huma Abedin <Huma@clintonemail.com<mailto:Huma@clintonemail.com>>, Philippe Reines <pir@hrcoffice.com<mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com>>, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com<mailto:nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>>, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>, Robby Mook <robbymook@gmail.com<mailto:robbymook@gmail.com>>, Brynne Craig <bcraig@hrcoffice.com<mailto:bcraig@hrcoffice.com>>, Ethan Gelber <egelber@hrcoffice.com<mailto:egelber@hrcoffice.com>>\nSubject: Re: HRC remarks on race and justice\n\nI don\'t love the "how could this happen in America" line.  The ferguson case is highly complex.   And this has been happening in America since the beginning.  I think earlier on you should make the point about how these men are someone\'s sons, someone\'s friends, someone\'s neighbors.   They are part of our community.\n\nOn Dec 4, 2014, at 10:16 AM, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com<mailto:dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>> wrote:\n\nRevised below, with some trims and adds:\n\nBefore I begin today, I would like to say a few words about the pain and frustration that many Americans are feeling today about our criminal justice system.
