john.podesta@gmail.comb"Huma,\n\nHope you are feeling well.  I wanted to touch base with you and set up a call for this week - a meeting would be great but if not at least a call - to discuss space.  As you may know from the traffic btw Chelsea and I last week which included Bruce and Podesta, I had a meeting and walk through for the additional space available at 77 Water Street.  They have an interested party (who today just asked for a draft lease - so that is moving quickly) on the table for part of the space so if we want additional space, we need to move quickly.  Goldman, b/c of their relationship with us, is delaying the drafting of a lease for this interested party until they get a better sense from us but they cannot hold them off too much longer.  I briefed John this am and then he and I met with Bob regarding CGI needs.  It would be great if we could arrange a call to discuss the Secretary's needs for this week and I can have John and/or Bob join as needed.  Michelle is copied here for follow up on setting a time for a meeting or call at your convenience.  In meantime, Genzler via Goldman Sachs is awaiting our details to do test fit options.
