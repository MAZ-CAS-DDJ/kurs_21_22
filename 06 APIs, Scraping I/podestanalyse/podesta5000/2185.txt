Too long to read right now, but I\'ll get to it this weekend.\n\nDid you end up visiting my sister? I know you felt some ambivalence. How was DC otherwise?\n\nThere was a story in yesterday\'s Washington Post about Podesta and other Hillary staff required to take cheap interstate buses to get to DC. Those buses are actually a big negative issue in many Manhattan districts, as Port Authority is overcapacity and they must pick up and drop off on already overcrowded city streets. This issue drives us, and the NYC Dept of Transportation, crazy. I sent the article to the Borough Commissioner, suggesting that perhaps President Hillary Clinton will provide the funds to build a badly needed new Port Authority facility. The situation is so bad, and the cost of building a new facility in Manhattan is so great, that people are talking about moving the terminal to New Jersey. BTW, when the current terminal was conceived and created in the late 1940\'s, the number of buses on the street needing a terminal was actually less than the number of buses on the street now, due to the overcapacity of the current terminal. And there is absolutely NO political leadership on either the city or state level focusing on this problem or our other transportation disasters-waiting-to-happen (Penn Station, the one hundred year old tunnels between NJ and NY, etc).\n\nSorry. Didn\'t mean to go on. Much better in person.\n\n________________________________\nFrom: "Sandler, Herbert" <hms@sandlerfoundation.org<mailto:hms@sandlerfoundation.org>>\nTo: Wally Rubin <wjr16c@yahoo.com<mailto:wjr16c@yahoo.com>>\nSent: Thursday, June 11, 2015 12:07 AM\nSubject: In the New Whitney by Ingrid D.
