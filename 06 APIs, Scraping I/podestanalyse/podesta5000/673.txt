Levin said, "With\n   negotiations reported to be entering the final stages, it is critical \xe2\x80\x8bthat\n   Congress focus at this point not on how to \'fast track\' approval of an\n   agreement \xe2\x80\x94 through passing Trade Promotion Authority \xe2\x80\x94 but on making sure\n   the TPP itself is on the right track."\n\n\n   - On Dec. 5, 2014 Rep. Levin addressed reporters to "discuss the TPP and\n   the need to continue to focus on the continuing negotiations of that\n   agreement instead of focusing on TPA." Levin said, "If you put the focus on\n   TPA when you have so many outstanding issues, essentially what it does is\n   force or stimulate members to say \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99 to TPP before so many of\n   the outstanding issues have been resolved."\n\n\n   - In January 2014, Rep. Levin released a statement strongly opposing the\n   Camp-Baucus TPA legislation. Levin cited several characteristics a TPA must\n   have to gain his support, including: (1) a meaningful role for Congress;\n   (2) a requirement that USTR be transparent with Congress during\n   negotiations; (3) negotiating objectives that include labor,\n   environmental, and access to medicine provisions; and (4) provisions\n   that strengthen enforcement of existing trade agreements.\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\n\n\nOn Tue, Apr 14, 2015 at 12:48 AM, Marissa Astor <mastor@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n> How is 9:30am for this call since the HRC call is at 10am ET tomorrow?\n>\n> On Apr 14, 2015, at 12:41 AM, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com>\n> wrote:\n>\n> Swapping Jake\'s email so he sees this\n>\n> On Tue, Apr 14, 2015 at 12:38 AM, Jennifer Palmieri <\n> jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n>\n>> All for it.\n>>\n>> Sent from my iPhone\n>>\n>> > On Apr 13, 2015, at 11:00 PM, Robby Mook <re47@hillaryclinton.com>\n>> wrote:\n>> >\n>> > Gang--should we do a small call with just us tomorrow morning to (1)\n>> decide on a united point of view on trade position and (2) decide who\n>> should call whom and gather what info before we got a on a call w HRC to\n>> argue our united case?\n>> > Seems like the most efficient path to getting her locked into something.\n>> > Thoughts?\n>>\n>\n>\n'
