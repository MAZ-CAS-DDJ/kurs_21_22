Ware*\n\n*202-226-7100 <202-226-7100>*\n\n*Amanda Duvall*\n\n*202-225-6030 <202-225-6030>*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Statement on the Release of Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Benghazi Emails*\n\n\n\n*Washington, DC*\xe2\x80\x94 Select Committee on Benghazi Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C.,\ntoday issued the following statement after the State Department released\n300 self-selected emails from former Secretary Hillary Clinton, over which\nthe department had no control and no custody for nearly two years. These\nemails were turned over to the State by former Secretary Clinton in the\nfall of 2014 in reaction to a request from the Select Committee:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than six months after the Select Committee first discovered Secretary\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s unusual email arrangement with herself, and after the media\ndiscovered Secretary Clinton relied exclusively on a personal server\nhousing a personal email account eschewing any official email address,\nState Department transferred 300 messages exclusively reviewed and released\nby her own lawyers,\xe2\x80\x9d Gowdy said. \xe2\x80\x9cThese lawyers, it must be noted, owed and\ncontinue to owe a fiduciary responsibility to Secretary Clinton to protect\nher interests. To assume a self-selected public record is complete, when no\none with a duty or responsibility to the public had the ability to take\npart in the selection, requires a leap in logic no impartial reviewer\nshould be required to make and strains credibility."\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is also important to remember these email messages are just one piece\nof information that cannot be completely evaluated or fully understood\nwithout the total record. The Committee is working to collect and evaluate\nall of the relevant and material information necessary to evaluate the full\nrange of issues in context.  We will not reach any investigative\nconclusions until our work is complete, but these emails continue to\nreinforce the fact that unresolved questions and issues remain as it\nrelates to Benghazi.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Select Committee continues to believe the American people have a right\nto the full and complete record of her official emails and, therefore,\nasked Secretary Clinton to turn her server and the full body of emails over\nto a neutral, detached, independent third party for review. This is also\nwhy the State Department must comply with a months-old subpoena for emails\nof the former Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s top aides, whose emails have never been received\nor reviewed by any congressional committee."\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Committee\xe2\x80\x99s interest is in building a complete record from which the\nfinal, definitive accounting regarding the terrorist attacks in Benghazi\ncan be provided.  The best way to answer all questions related to the\nattacks in Benghazi continues to be having access to the full public\nrecord, not a "record" controlled, possessed and screened exclusively by\nSecretary Clinton\'s personal lawyers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\n*Background Information on Released Emails:*\n\n\n\n*Among the emails the Select Committee finds highlight the existence of\nsignificant investigative questions:*\n\n\xc2\xb7  September 24, 2012\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCompiled protest and Benghazi Statements.\xe2\x80\x9d A\ndocument that reinforces issues relating to characterization of the motives\nfor the attacks. For example, Jake Sullivan noted, \xe2\x80\x9cYou never said\nspontaneous or characterized the motives. In fact you were careful in your\nfirst statement to say we were assessing motive and method. The way you\ntreated the video in the Libya context was to say that some sought\nto *justify* the attack on that basis.*\xe2\x80\x9d  *\n\n\xc2\xb7  August 24, 2012 \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cH: Intel on new Libya president.

But on Thursday, the New York Times released about a third of that\nbatch of correspondence, which Clinton exchanged using a private server\nrather than a government email account.\n\nThe documents show that, while Clinton used her personal email account to\nreceive information the government calls "sensitive," she did not appear to\nuse her private server to exchange classified information.\n\nThe "sensitive" information included details like the location of State\nDepartment officials in Libya during a time of instability in the country\nin 2011.\n\nThe documents released by the New York Times also show that Clinton\nreceived numerous briefing memos about Libya from Blumenthal, a longtime\nfriend of the Clintons who was not employed by the State Department. The\nNew York Times reported earlier this week that Blumenthal was also involved\nwith a possible business venture in the country at the time.\n\nTwo of those memos from Blumenthal came in the days immediately following\nthe September 11, 2012 Benghazi attacks.\n\nIn one, sent on September 12, Blumenthal suggested that top security\nofficers in the country believed that the attacks "were inspired by what\nmany devout Libyan viewed as a sacrilegious internet video on the prophet\nMohammed originating in America." Clinton forwarded that information to top\nadviser Jake Sullivan with the message "more info."\n\nBut another memo sent the following day indicated that the attacks may have\nactually been carried out by a militia group. Blumenthal wrote that\nofficials in the country "believe that the attackers having prepared to\nlaunch their assault took advantage of the cover provided by the\ndemonstrations in Benghazi protesting an internet production seen as\ndisrespectful to the prophet Mohammed."\n\nThe release of the emails comes after a prolonged political fight for\nClinton over her use of a private email server while serving as Secretary\nof State.\n\nOn Tuesday, Clinton urged the State Department to expedite the vetting of\nthe emails after initial reports suggested that the data trove would not be\nready for public release until January of next year\n\n\n\nOn Fri, May 22, 2015 at 1:00 PM, Brian Fallon <bfallon@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nState did a nice job with this, despite the initial, sensationalized tweet\nby AP\n\n\n\nOn Friday, May 22, 2015, Josh Schwerin <jschwerin@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\nState Dept. releases Hillary Clinton e-mails in Benghazi probe\n\nAP  MAY 22, 2015\n\nhttp://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2015/05/22/state-dept-set-release-hillary-clinton-mails-benghazi-probe/E48MdmnEHKruEi5sTKzOwM/story.html\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton received\ninformation on her private email server about the deadly attack on U.S.\ndiplomatic facilities in Benghazi that was classified Friday at the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s\nrequest.\n\nThe email in question, forwarded to Clinton by her deputy chief of staff,\nrelates to reports of arrests in Libya of possible suspects in the attack.\n\nThe information was not classified at the time the email was sent and was\nupgraded from unclassified to \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98secret\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 on Friday, according to State\nDepartment officials. The officials said 23 words of the November 2012\nmessage were redacted from the release of 896 emails totaling 296 pages, to\nprotect information that may damage foreign relations.\n\nThey said no other redactions were made for classification reasons.\n\nSpokeswoman Marie Harf says publication includes 296 e-mails given to a\nHouse committee investigating the 2012 attack on the US diplomatic post in\nBenghazi, Libya.\n\nShe says redactions were made according to Freedom of Information Act\nstandards. The emails will be released via the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s FOIA\nwebsite, foia.state.gov.\n\nThe documents cover e-mails between 2011 and 2012 related to the Benghazi\nfacility and its security, and to the broader issue of a US diplomatic\npresence in Libya.\n\nHarf says the e-mails don\xe2\x80\x99t provide new facts about how four Americans were\nkilled on Sept. 11, 2012. The State Department also said on Twitter that\nthe emails don\xe2\x80\x99t provide a change in its understanding of the events.\n\nThe State Department is still reviewing 55,000 further pages of e-mails\nfrom Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s private email account. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be published on a rolling\nbasis.\n\n\nOn Fri, May 22, 2015 at 12:42 PM, Tyson Brody <tbrody@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n>\n> User Actions\n>  Following\n> Matt Lee\xe2\x80\x8f@APDiploWriter\n>\n> Matt Lee retweeted Brian Fallon\n>\n> Classified this morning - as the story makes clear.\n>\n> Matt Lee added,\n>\n> Brian Fallon @brianefallon\n> Classified only in recent days MT @KThomasDC: Clinton received\nnow-classified Benghazi info on private email server, documents show.\n>\n> On Fri, May 22, 2015 at 12:35 PM, Tyson Brody <tbrody@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n>>\n>> WASHINGTON (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Clinton received now-classified #Benghazi info on\nprivate email server, documents show.\n>>\n>> On Fri, May 22, 2015 at 12:35 PM, Christina Reynolds <\ncreynolds@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n>>>\n>>> Please use this email chain to send around clips that are breaking on\nthe email release.
