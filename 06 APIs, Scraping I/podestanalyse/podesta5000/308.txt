Here's why:\n\nYesterday: Speaker Boehner's lawsuit was passed by the House Rules Committee and is now going to be voted on by the full House.\n\nToday: Our ads holding Stewart Mills III accountable for his out-of-touch agenda went on TV in Minnesota's 8th Congressional District.\n\nSunday: We have less than 100 days until Election Day, so we're going to have to go all in to stop the Tea Party - and elect a Democratic majority.\nSo John, with so much going on, are you ready to stop the Tea Party and elect a Democratic majority?
