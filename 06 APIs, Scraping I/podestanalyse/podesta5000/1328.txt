Until an election-eve conversion, she had backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal which would be the biggest in history.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders\x92 campaign responded to Clinton\x92s assertion in Detroit that she has a plan to restore manufacturing jobs. \x93The American people are sick and tired of establishment politicians who promise to create manufacturing jobs during campaign season but support trade policies that make it easier to outsource these jobs the day after they get elected,\x94 Sanders said in a prepared statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders\x92 campaign on Friday distributed a video showing Clinton in India in 2012 discussing what she said were \x93pluses and minuses\x94 to outsourcing U.S. jobs.\n\nTo read Sanders\x92 statement, click here<http://sendy.berniesanders.com/l/gw9wgkXXCeMUlhxO9mkh3A/bsLS7eYy763bQ8f90iRMUkkg/QNLSpwBi892dEtuZ8pBDEGfA>.\n\nTo see the video of Clinton on outsourcing, click here<http://sendy.berniesanders.com/l/gw9wgkXXCeMUlhxO9mkh3A/yx6FiBqEeuGkgBQ8ekEumg/QNLSpwBi892dEtuZ8pBDEGfA>.\n\n###\n\n\nPAID FOR BY BERNIE 2016\n\n[(not the billionaires)]\n\nPO Box 905 - Burlington, Vermont 05402, United States\n\n\n--\n@MattOrtega<http://www.twitter.com/MattOrtega>\nDigital Communications\nHillary for America\n\n--\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "HRCRR" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to hrcrr+unsubscribe@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:hrcrr+unsubscribe@hillaryclinton.com>.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrr@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:hrcrr@hillaryclinton.com>.\n\n'
