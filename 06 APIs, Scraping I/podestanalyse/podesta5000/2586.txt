One in six teachers would lose their job. \n\nThat would be devastating for our schools, but that's the cost of Bruce Rauner's tax cuts for the wealthy. \n\nWill you chip in to make sure that doesn't happen?\n\nhttps://www.quinnforillinois.com/fight-for-education\n\nSunday night is an important fundraising deadline. We know that at any moment Rauner could cut another huge check to his own campaign, and we have to keep up. \n\nBecause one in six teachers is too high a price to pay.  \n\nLou\n\nLou Bertuca\nCampaign Manager\nQuinn for Illinois\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nContributions are not tax deductible.
