This will be announced in late February.\r\n\r\nClinton Health Matters Initiative\r\n\r\n\xc2\xb7         The PGA Tour has pledged to support a Clinton Health Matters Initiative community initiative in the Greater Jacksonville area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xb7         The Clinton Health Matters Initiative is in conversations with the Riady family about supporting community initiatives in two small communities in Indonesia.\r\n\r\nClinton Economic Opportunity Initiative\r\n\r\n\xc2\xb7         CEO is in preliminary discussions with Inc. magazine about the possibility of integrating CEO\xe2\x80\x99s Entrepreneur Mentoring Program with the Inc. Business Owners Council (the Council), a membership organization made up of top Inc. 5000 entrepreneurs and family business owners.  The Council, which currently has local presence in the NYC, Philadelphia, and San Francisco areas,  holds monthly meetings for its membership that feature expert presenters from the pages of Inc. magazine, and facilitates peer-to-peer development to support business growth and wealth-creation amongst business owners.  Current discussions between Inc. and CEO are focused around the feasibility of creating an enhanced EMP program that would provide high-growth entrepreneurs from underserved populations with a Mentor from the Council membership, as well as access to key Council privileges including workshops with guest speakers, special events, and access to exclusive networking opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJOR INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES\r\n\r\nClinton Development Initiative\r\nMalawi\r\n\r\n\xc2\xb7         While in Malawi, Walker Morris escorted Jens Johannson from U&We, largest seller of Plan Vivo in Sweden, to meet with Trees of Hope project farmers, local program monitors and CDI Lead Farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xb7         CDI is finalizing the steps needed to be ready to distribute initial carbon credit sale funds to smallholder farmers in Trees of Hope. CDI is working with the local bank FMB to set up accounts for each of the farmers receiving funds. FMB has offices in the rural areas CDI serves and also provides banking services at local locations of two farm supply stores, so that project farmers will have readily available access to deposit and withdraw funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xb7         Rains came late this year but have generally been good.
