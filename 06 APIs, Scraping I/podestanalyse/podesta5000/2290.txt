This is about proving that she will fight for those people and has ideas that will make a difference in their lives.  Romney\'s problem was that his proposals helped those at the top, not everyday Americans.  Remember the 47%??\n\n\nOn O\'Malley/Sanders:  We ought to slip a line into that answer something like, "We know they\'ll be battling each other\xe2\x80\xa6.\n\n\nOn expectations in Iowa and NH, haven\'t each of those states backgrounded press on specific numbers and past vote history?  It would be good to share some of those numbers.\n\n\nthx\n\n\nMandy Grunwald\nGrunwald Communications\n202 973-9400\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Kristina Schake <kschake@hillaryclinton.com>\nTo: John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>; Robby Mook <re47@hillaryclinton.com>; Jennifer Palmieri <jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com>; Oren Shur <oshur@hillaryclinton.com>; Margolis, Jim <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com>; Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com>; Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com>; David Binder <David@db-research.com>; John Anzalone <john@algpolling.com>\nSent: Wed, May 27, 2015 8:51 pm\nSubject: Fwd: Updated doc for background press briefing\n\n\n \n  \nWanted to let you know that we have had so many media requests this week to get background info about the launch, details on our summer plans and visit the office that we decided to consolidate them and do a backgrounder tomorrow afternoon with our regulars to give an overview of our thinking followed by a casual happy hour afterwards so they can see the HQ.  For those of you in town, it would be great to have you join us for the happy hour, plan to start at 6 pm.    \n  \n   \n  \n  \nWe updated our overall talking points to reflect how we want to frame the launch and summer - and plan to use these as a guide for talking with the press tomorrow.  We would love your thoughts and edits.    \n  \n   \n  \n  \nWe will resume our 8 am call on Friday and review our plans for next week and the launch on June 13.     \n  \n   \n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n   \n  \n  \n   \n    \n     \n      \n       \n        \n         \n          \n           \n            \n             \n              \n               \n              \n              \n               Kristina Schake | Communications              \n              \n               Hillary for America              \n                                          \n             \n             \n                            \n             \n            \n           \n          \n         \n        \n       \n      \n     \n    \n   \n  \n  \n \n\n\n'
