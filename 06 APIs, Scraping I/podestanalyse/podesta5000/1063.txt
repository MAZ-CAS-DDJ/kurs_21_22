He thinks it is 90-95\npercent that the TPA bill will drop Tuesday.\n\nI have been thinking about a version of the Podesta approach.\n\nWhat if she said something along the lines of the following?\n\nLook, I\xe2\x80\x99m focused on the final deal, and whether it will measure up.  If it\ndoes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll support it.  If it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\n\nTPA is about Senate procedure \xe2\x80\x93 and in any event it\xe2\x80\x99s just a draft proposal\nmaking its way through a Senate committee.  I want to focus on the\nsubstance:  will TPP be a good deal, or not?  We haven't seen the details\nso we can't answer that question yet.\n\n\nLet me say this about TPA.  I believe that President Obama should have the\nnegotiating authority to conclude a transpacific agreement that works for\nthe American middle class and advances American leadership.  But I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nbelieve we should give an open-ended fast track to the next president.  I\nhope I\xe2\x80\x99m the next president, and I think I should have to justify fast\ntrack to the new Congress.  And if a Republican is the next president, I\ncertainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give fast track to them now \xe2\x80\x93 heck, that's why I\nvoted against fast track for President Bush.\n\n\nThese are all procedural issues.  The key for me is whether the final deal\npasses two tests:  pass two tests: First, does it raise wages and create\nmore good jobs at home than it displaces? And second, does it also\nstrengthen our national security?  Let\xe2\x80\x99s wait and see that final deal.\n"
