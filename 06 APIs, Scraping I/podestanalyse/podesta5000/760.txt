john.podesta@gmail.comb'Highlights:\n1.     CNN: Analyst suggests McCain camp responsible for republican anger\n\nROGER SIMON: "This anger is coming from somewhere, it is being ginned up by\na campaign, and it is logical, I think, to assume that these people are only\nresponding to what they have heard from the candidate\'s mouth and it it\'s\nfair game and it\'s in fact responsible for us to report how the crowds are\nreacting."\n\n2.     CNN: Cindy McCain withholding finances, McCain camp erratic\n\nFRANK RICH: "Cindy McCain we know was involved in business dealings\ninvolving Keating and we don\'t know what- everything\'s hidden by a pre-nup\nagreement- we don\'t know what\'s going on in terms of her finances, which are\nreally, no matter how you slice it, a potential President of the United\nStates\' as well."\n\n3.     CNN: Panel Suggest Troopergate Ruling Undercuts McCain\'s Judgment,\nPalin\'s Credibility\n\nROGER SIMON: "Does that go to John McCain\'s judgment? And, now that the\nLegislative panel has ruled what does John McCain say about it? Does he\ncare? Is he dismissing it? Can he attack Barack Obama\'s judgment and not\nattack the judgment of his running mate?"\n\n4.     FNC: Pfotenhauer Says McCain Has Always Stood up for the Mistreated,\nInvokes POW Experience, Criticizes Obama\'s Response to Lewis Charge\n\nNANCY PFOTENHAUER: "He is someone who has always stood up for anybody he\nfelt was not being treated correctly and has had personal experience with\nhaving his own civil rights taken away from him."\n\n5.     MSNBC: McCain Supporters Think Obama\'s Muslim Because He Might Be\nElected and His Policies Would Take us Backward, Pfotenhauer Alleges\n\nHALL: "[H]ow do you convince voters [...] that John McCain is the man to fix\nthe ailing economy when you\'ve got the report that the campaign wanted to\nchange the topic?"\n\n\n\nPFOTENHAUER: "[I] think that\'s been completely parsed and taken out of\ncontext like the 100-years war comment."\n\n6.     CBS: Graham Refuses Responsibility for Angry McCain-Palin Supporters\n\nLINDSEY GRAHAM: "[T]he $700B that will be interjected into the economy needs\nto go to Main St. not just Wall Street."\n\n7.     MSNBC: Palin Received More Boos than Cheers; Brought Daughter to\nStunt Hostility from Hockey Fans\nMATT BERGER: "I talked to some of my colleagues who were higher up [in the\nstadium]. They said that they heard more boos than cheers. Sarah Palin said\nearlier in the day, at a fundraiser in Philadelphia, that she was gonna\ndress her daughter, Piper in a Flyers jersey to hope to mitigate some of the\nboos."\n\nHighlights, No Video\n1.     CNN - PAUL BEGALA: "He is no longer the master of his own destiny.\nThis is the problem Senator McCain has. He\'s reached in his bag of tricks\ntoo many times. He tried picking Governor Palin, the Governor of Alaska,\nthat shook things up for awhile, helped him for a little while [...]. [N]ow\nit looks like a negative in the polling data. Then he tried suspending his\ncampaign, remember, because they wouldn\'t pass a bill to bail out Wall St.,\nnow, he\'ll try something else, the problem is, every tactic he tries looks\nlike what it is, desperation. And...the best hope he has is for something\nhorrible for America."\n2.     CNN - LESLIE SANCHEZ: "I really did not appreciate the \'palling\naround\' comment, I agree with Paul on that. And I also didn\'t appreciate\nthat she didn\'t take a stand and say something very much to the extent that\nSenator McCain did and say that you know "we\'re really not going to tolerate\nthat" and really take that issue on, I think that\'s what leadership is\nabout."\n\nClips\nHighlight #1\n*Roger Simon Suggests McCain\'s Negativity Stokes Followers\' Anger *(CNN\n10/12/08 10:00am)\nHOWARD KURTZ: [...] It seems that the press has kind of adopted this theme\nthat McCain and Palin are stoking the anger.\n\nROGER SIMON: Well it may be that McCain and Palin are stoking the anger. It\nseems to me that John McCain is riding a tiger and he\'s trying not to fall\noff that tiger and get eaten by it. When your Vice Presidential running mate\ngoes around the country saying \'Barack Obama is palling around with\nterrorists," and when you run ads that say, ya know, he\'s a liar, he\'s not\ntelling the truth about this unrepentant terrorist, and then you wonder why\npeople in the crowd shout out "terrorist" when you mention the name Barack\nObama? This anger is coming from somewhere, it is being ginned up by a\ncampaign, and it is logical, I think, to assume that these people are only\nresponding to what they have heard from the candidate\'s mouth and it it\'s\nfair game and it\'s in fact responsible for us to report how the crowds are\nreacting.\n\nHighlight #2\n*Rich Criticizes Cindy McCain\'s Financial Secrecy; Erratic Campaign* (CNN\n10/12/08 10:31pm)\nFRANK RICH: [...] One of the many pieces of information we don\'t have in\nthis campaign, is the full financial records of the McCain household.  Cindy\nMcCain we know was involved in business dealings involving Keating and we\ndon\'t know what- everything\'s hidden by a pre-nup agreement- we don\'t know\nwhat\'s going on in terms of her finances, which are really, no matter how\nyou slice it, a potential President of the United States\' as well.\n\n[...]\n\nFRANK RICH: [...] I\'m not one of those who was madly in love with John\nMcCain, and then turned, although I did like him. I think he\'s running an\nerratic campaign, I think something\'s changed about him, and look, right now\nhe\'s become a sort of big government liberal, with one liberal plan after\nanother to deal with the economic meltdown, so he\'s, there\'s something\ndifferent about him.\n\nHighlight #3\n*Panel Suggest Troopergate Ruling Undercuts McCain\'s Judgment, Palin\'s\nCredibility* (CNN 10/12/08 10:18am)\nHOWARD KURTZ: [...] Roger Simon, it seems to me that until then, most of the\nmedia kind of treated this as an amusing, backwoods personnel dispute, is\nthat going to change?\n\nROGER SIMON: Uh, I think it is going to change, and I suspect that the Obama\ncampaign will remind us of what happened. It not only raises the question of\nwhether she abused power, the Legislative Committee says she did, but how\nwell did John McCain vet this person? Was she the best the Republican Party\ncould come up with? I mean, she was actively under investigation when she\nwas named as his running mate. Does that go to John McCain\'s judgment? And,\nnow that the Legislative panel has ruled what does John McCain say about it?\nDoes he care? Is he dismissing it? Can he attack Barack Obama\'s judgment and\nnot attack the judgment of his running mate?\n\nHOWARD KURTZ: Lynn Sherr, It seems to me there\'s been 500 more stories and\ndebates and television segments about "Is Sarah Palin a good mother?" "Is\nshe up to juggling the Vice Presidency?" "Is she too much like Tina Fey?"\nthen this controversy, which goes to her record as governor and what looks\nto be her heavy handedness as governor in this instance.\n\nLYNN SHERR: And this is a woman who is modeling herself as a reformer, as a\nmaverick and the precise thing that the report says, is that she violated\nthe ethics standard. Now, I have to say, I think the report is a little\nweasley, and I\'d like to see more press coverage of How do you abuse your\npower, but it\'s within your power to fire somebody? Apparently, she violated\na state ethics law- isn\'t that breaking the law? I think it reflects badly\non the campaign and you notice yesterday, when or Friday night or Saturday\nGovernor Palin responded to that thrown out question by a reporter. She\nbasically said, "As you\'ll see, I didn\'t break any laws." Well, how about\nabusing power? Isn\'t that an ethics thing? Is that something that we want to\nthink of that with a "reformer"? I think, definitely, there has to be more\nmade of this.\n\nHighlight #4\n*Pfotenhauer Says McCain Has Always Stood up for the Mistreated, Invokes POW\nExperience, Criticizes Obama\'s Response to Lewis Charge *(FNC 10/12/08\n12:17pm)\nNANCY PFOTENHAUER: I think that Mr. Lewis\' comments were reprehensible. I\nthink the implication somehow of even roughly equating Senator McCain with\nthose comments and their outcome is just beyond the pale and I believe that\nSenator Obama\'s campaign has kind of given their typical lackluster, oh\nwell, almost arm\'s-length distancing from it without ever saying the words\nthat needed to be said, which is that comparison is absolutely beyond the\npale, should never have been made, should be completely rejected and has\nnothing to do with [...] John McCain\'s life and his career. He is someone\nwho has always stood up for anybody he felt was not being treated correctly\nand has had personal experience with having his own civil rights taken away\nfrom him.\n\n[Baier contrasts McCain attack ad on Obama with McCain\'s defense of Obama at\nrecent town hall]\n\nBRET BAIER: So, on the one hand, Nancy the campaign says, \'You can\'t trust\nBarack Obama and it\'s important to bring that up,\' on the other hand, the\ncandidate is saying that people shouldn\'t be afraid of Barack Obama as\n[POTUS].\n\nPFOTENHAUER : [T]he distinction is very clear and that is Senator Obama\'s\npolicies are extraordinarily risky for this country [...].\n\nBAIER: I understand, but this aggressiveness on the campaign trail, with\nads, it doesn\'t seem to be reflected in some of things that John McCain has\nbeen saying in these town hall meetings.\n\nPFOTENHAUER: [I] think he\'s drawing the distinction between Barack Obama, as\na human being, and Barack Obama\'s policies that he\'s advocating [...].\n\nHighlight #5\n*McCain Supporters Think Obama\'s Muslim Because He Might Be Elected and His\nPolicies Would Take us Backward, Pfotenhauer Alleges *(MSNBC 10/12/08\n1:05pm)\nTAMRYN HALL: [A]fter a month of character attacks and finger-pointing we\'re\nsuddenly seeing a softer side of John McCain this weekend [...]. Looking\nback at these last series of events what is your best explanation for why\nwe\'ve been seeing this angry language from the audience, including what this\nlady said in that exchange [where a woman claims Obama is Muslim] there.\n\nNANCY PFOTENHAUER: [I] think people are getting more and more concerned that\nSenator Obama may actually be elected president and that the policies that\nhe\'s advocating would take us in precisely the wrong direction, whether\nyou\'re talking about the economy or the foreign policy challenges that we\'re\nfacing and I think there\'s an element of frustration and real concern. [...]\n\nHALL: Are they reacting to his policies or are they reacting to other things\nbecause she didn\'t say, \'I hate his policies.\' She said, \'He\'s an Arab. I\ncan\'t trust him.\' They didn\'t say, \'I don\'t agree with tax cuts,\' or\nwhatever his plan is. They said, \'Kill him.\'\n\nPFOTENHAUER: [I] can\'t project into the mind of somebody who would say\nsomething like that. Obviously I focus primarily and I think our campaign\nfocuses primarily on the policies that he\'s advocated and, to an extent,\nsome of his associations because it points out the fact that he embraces\nthings when it works for him and he tosses them over the side when it\ndoesn\'t. [...]\n\nHALL: [H]ow do you convince voters [...] that John McCain is the man to fix\nthe ailing economy when you\'ve got the report that the campaign wanted to\nchange the topic?\n\nPFOTENHAUER: [I] think that\'s been completely parsed and taken out of\ncontext like the 100-years war comment.\n\n[cross-talk]\n\nPFOTENHAUER: The context is whenever there\'s an economic downturn the\npolitical party of the incumbent in the White House carries that burden.\nThat\'s well known.\n\nHighlight #6\n*Graham Refuses Responsibility for Angry McCain-Palin Supporters* (FNC\n10/12/08 10:35am)\nLINDSEY GRAHAM: [O]bama who\'s masquerading as a centrist is anything but a\ncentrist when it comes to taxing, spending and social policy [...]. I think\nthe [Obama] campaign hit an all-time low, from my point of view. When you\nhave a statement issued by John Lewis from Georgia, saying that Senator\nMcCain and Sarah Palin are conducting themselves in a way like George\nWallace, inspiring hatred is an absolute offense to people like me who are\nclose friends to John McCain, to all of his supporters and we\'re not gonna\nbe intimidated by this playing the race card simply because Senator Obama\'s\nrecord has been attacked in a very fair way. The rhetoric and the record\ndon\'t match when it comes to Senator Obama and this is not going to work. It\nmay have worked with Clintons, but it\'s not going to work with us.\n\n[airs clip of McCain saying Obama is an honorable family man]\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: So, Senator Graham apparently even John McCain thinks this\nthing may have gotten over the line.\n\nGRAHAM: Well let me tell you about being over the line. Millions of dollars\nof money have been spent by Obama against Senator McCain [...]. [Obama\'s]\ncampaign is quite frankly awash with money because he broke his word; he\nopted out of public funding. We can\'t be responsible for what one person\nsays at a rally surrounded by a thousand, but John McCain has never\nconducted himself, in any way, to incite hatred. He has compared his record\nto that of Senator Obama in a fair way, in a firm way and will keep doin\'\nit.\n\nThe idea that John McCain and Sarah Palin are conducting themselves like\nGeorge Wallace is just incredibly offensive to me and all those who support\nSenator McCain and we\'re not gonna take this. We\'re going to challenge\nSenator Obama\'s record versus his rhetoric.\n\n[...]\n\nDOUG WILDER: You know when you hear Senator Graham say that they can\'t be\nresponsible for one person, putting the cover all over the McCain campaign\nyet he just put Obama down because of what John Lewis had to say [...].\n\n[...]\n\nGRAHAM: [N]ow\'s the time to lower tax rates for investors, capital gains\ntax, dividends tax rates, to make sure that we can get the economy\njump-started. The worst thing we could do now, Bob is to increase federal\nspending and increase taxes on small business like Senator Obama would\npropose or mandate, from the federal government, health care requirements on\nindividuals and business with fines if you don\'t comply. [T]he $700B that\nwill be interjected into the economy needs to go to Main St. not just Wall\nStreet. So, if you\'re in a home now, where you owe more on the home than the\nhome\'s worth, adjustable rate mortgages are coming into play now, we\'d give\npeople a chance for primary residents to re-finance your home at the actual\nvalue [...]\n\nHighlight #7\n*Palin Received More Boos than Cheers; Brought Daughter to Stunt Hostility\nfrom Hockey Fans* (MSNBC 10/12/08 1:05pm)\nMATT BERGER: I talked to some of my colleagues who were higher up [in the\nstadium]. They said that they heard more boos than cheers. Sarah Palin said\nearlier in the day, at a fundraiser in Philadelphia, that she was gonna\ndress her daughter, Piper in a Flyers jersey to hope to mitigate some of the\nboos, but they knew going into this that this could be a hostile crowd\n[...], but they feel like the image they see of her as a hockey mom, on the\nice, dropping the puck, that\'s a good image for them.\n\n-- \nJacob Roberts\nPAO\n208.420.3470 (c)\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
