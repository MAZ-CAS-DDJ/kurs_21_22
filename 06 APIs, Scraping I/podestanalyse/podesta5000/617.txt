Soldiers and their trained and valiant companion dogs\nform a unique bond.Keeping them together after service\n\nseems like the right thing to do. PTSD is often reduced.The bond that is\nformed in danger and combat deserves to be enjoyed in\n\nrelative peace and recovery.\n\n\n\nIf you can look into this and make an inquiry it would be deeply\nappreciated.\n\n\n\nJack Brown\n\nKnox 68\n\n\n\nSEE Piece below Link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[image: Image removed by sender.
