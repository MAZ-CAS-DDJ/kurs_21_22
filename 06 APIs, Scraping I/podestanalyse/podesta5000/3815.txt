Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin, chairman of a\nHouse subcommittee investigating communism in government, was confronted by\nattorney Joseph Welch during nationally televised hearings. McCarthy had\ncarried on his anti-communism innuendo campaign through congressional\ninvestigations for several years. Now, before a national audience, he\nattacked a young legal associate of Welch as a member of a communist\n\xe2\x80\x9cfront\xe2\x80\x9d organization when he was at law school.\n\nIn what will go down in history as the moment of McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s undoing, Welch\nreacted with outrage to this attack. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve done enough. Have you no sense\nof decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Senate censured McCarthy six months later and his career was over.\n\n\nSo I ask a similar question of Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the chairman of\nthe House Select Committee on Benghazi, and the other five Republicans on\nthe panel: Reps. Susan Brooks (Ind.), Jim Jordan (Ohio), Martha Roby\n(Ala.), Peter Roskam (Ill.) and Lynn Westmoreland (Ga.).\n\nHave you lost all sense of shame?\n\nThe decision to call private citizen Sidney Blumenthal, former President\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s assistant and Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s longtime friend, on June 16 for a\nbehind-closed-doors sworn deposition is emblematic of the shameful,\nshamelessly partisan conduct of Gowdy and the Republicans on his committee\n\xe2\x80\x94 and their constituents should be asking them each this same question.\n\nThere are facts they cannot deny.\n\nBlumenthal had nothing to do with the Benghazi attack or the government\xe2\x80\x99s\nreaction to it. He passed along to Hillary Clinton, then secretary of\nState, via email information from a former high-ranking CIA official about\nLibya. She, in turn, passed along some of Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s emails to see if\nthey contained anything useful. That is it. Both acted responsibly.\n\nHe volunteered to come to the committee to respond to all questions,\nwithout the need for a subpoena. Yet the committee Republicans sent two\nfederal marshals in the middle of the day to his doorstep to serve a\nsubpoena on his wife \xe2\x80\x94 and leaked to the media the fact they were serving a\nsubpoena.\n\nBlumenthal was questioned for nine hours. Democratic members estimate the\nquestions asked by Gowdy and the Republican members of a committee that\xe2\x80\x99s\nsupposed to be investigating the tragedy of Benghazi to be as follows:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 more than 160 about his relationship and communications with the\nClintons, and fewer than 20 about the Benghazi attack;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 more than 50 about the Clinton Foundation, and just four about security\nin Benghazi;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 more than 270 about Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s humanitarian Haitian assistance idea,\nwhich came to nothing and in which no money was ever exchanged, and zero\nabout the U.S. presence in Benghazi;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 forty-five questions about David Brock, Media Matters and related\norganizations, and zero about former Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who\nwith three other Americans was killed in the attack.\n\nThe nature of the questions asked exposes the committee\xe2\x80\x99s true intent. Many\nof the questions amounted to this: Are you now or have you ever been a\nDemocrat? Are you now or have you ever been a friend of Hillary Clinton?\n\nThe Republicans on the committee refuse to make the transcript of the\nembarrassing deposition public. Why? I wrote Gowdy to ask him for a copy.\nNo answer. Yet one day after the deposition, the National Review published\na leaked email that Blumenthal provided to the committee; a conservative on\nBloomberg News released a different email; and *Politico* published a story\nquoting \xe2\x80\x9canother GOP select committee member\xe2\x80\x9d to characterize Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s\ndocument submission and testimony. None of these selective leaks reported\nwhat the committee Republicans asked or what Blumenthal answered.\n\nThe committee was created despite the fact that numerous other committees\nhad already investigated Benghazi, costing millions of tax dollars,\nincluding the Republican-led House Intelligence and Armed Services\ncommittees. None of them found intentional distortion of the causes of the\ntragedy by the White House or State Department; there was no stand-down\norder, no political cover-up. The panel has spent more than $3.5 million so\nfar and maintains an 18-member staff, whose full-time employees are paid an\naverage of $128,750 per year. (Yes, self-proclaimed fiscal conservatives,\nthey!) Yet it\xe2\x80\x99s held so far only three public hearings \xe2\x80\x94 and they are still\nrefusing Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s repeated requests to appear and testify publicly.\n\nIs there anyone who can doubt that Gowdy and these five other Republicans\nare participants in nothing neither more nor less than a partisan sham, out\nto harm Hillary Clinton and existing for no other reason?\n\nTo repeat: Have they no sense of shame?\n\n*Davis served as special counsel to former President Clinton, is principal\nin the Washington, D.C., law firm of Lanny J.
