john.podesta@gmail.comb"Denis, want to accommodate  this at least for tomorrow? Brynne can you\nreach out to Kim? This is a group of super volunteers and delegates who\nhave kept themselves organized since 08.\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: *John West* <gardens@jwlandscapes.com>\nDate: Tuesday, May 12, 2015\nSubject: Urgent Hail Mary\nTo: John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>\nCc: Kim Frederick <kimfrederi@yahoo.com>\n\n\nDear Mr. Podesta,\n\nJohn West here, the gentleman and his husband who had the honor to drive\nyou to O'hare after the Chicago finance committee meeting.\n\nWanted to thank you for the picture and conversation regarding some of our\ngrass roots efforts by many long time Hillary Supporters - many who were\n2008 delegate that have been corralled into one very organized Facebook\nGroup and contact list by Kim Frederick, from Houston, Texas.\n\nKim Frederick also had wonderful ideas for the QR code and for assigning\nmerchandise I.D's to lower dollar fund raisers to encourage folks to take\npart in promoting sales which I shared at the meeting and in the packet I\nshared with you.  She's a Hill Starter and has raised $11,000 to date and\nhas a local Houston fundraiser this evening as well as been a big help in\nassisting the Texas Field Organizer on identifying key strategically\nlocated folks for helping with setting up organizing events throughout the\nmassive state of Texas. Beyond Texas, she has been key in getting the top\nvolunteers in contact with field organizers throughout the country and\nproviding a forum for both field organizers and super volunteers to\ncoordinate and exchange information efficiently.\n\nI have an* urgent request I was wondering if you could help with**.*  Kim\nFrederick will be in NY for work from tomorrow night through Sunday and\nbeing a leader and organizer of 50 states worth of very capable, motivated\nand experienced grass roots organizers - I was hoping she could get an\ninvite for one of the events in New York as well as an audience with\nsomeone to discuss how best to utilize this amazing resource of folks she\nhas assembled and keeps organized and engaged. It appears Adam will be\ntravelling at that time - and they will be missing one another\nunfortunately.  Kim has even organized a 50 person super volunteer get\ntogether at 6 p.m Friday evening at O'Reilly's Bar and Kitchen while she is\nin town.\n\nI can attest to Kim's long time dedication and hard work already. She was a\nstate level delegate in 2007 and is involved heavily in organizing in Texas\nfor the Democratic Party.  It would be really helpful to the grass roots\neffort and really energize folks to see one of their own have some audience\nand a photo op. IT's also her birthday so I can't help but feel compelled\nto at least send a hail Mary email. Anything would help to make sure there\nisn't a wasted opportunity with her business trip to New York (at someone\nelse's expense!)\n\n-JW\n\n\nJohn West\nCo-Founder, Chief Designer, APLD\n\nJW Landscapes LLC\n65 East Scott Street #10A\nChicago, IL 60610\n\nPhone: 312.787.9974\nFax: 312.275.8755\nCell: 312.213.3052\n\nUnrivaled Outdoor Lifestyle Design\n"
