What it does is opens the\nmarket to a new generation of ad creators who want to come up with\nbigger ideas and make a name for themselves. It takes financial\nconsiderations out of strategic planning. I agree there is a risk we\nlose some of the bigger talents who only want to work for a big\ncommission but maybe we don't need them. The donors really despise\npaying commissions to media consultants for cut and paste advertising.\nThat is what I'm trying to address here.\n\n\nOn Nov 29, 2007 4:17 PM, Susan McCue <Susan.McCue@one.org> wrote:\n> It's good but I imagine the media consultant graf is DOA with a lot of\n> folks.
