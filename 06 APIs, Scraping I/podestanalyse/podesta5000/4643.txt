Once you get started\nthe system does its best to guide you through each step of the process so\nhopefully the setup is fairly intuitive.\n\nAlso- I wanted to let you know that I am available to help with anything\nthat may come up while you're on the road, especially in regards to\npaper/information you may need from HQ. At this point folks up here all\nknow me and are ready to turn things around quickly for our team.\n\nYou have my cell!\n\nMilia\nP.S. tell my dad I say hi!\n\n*Set up Touch ID*\n\nEnter *Settings > Touch ID & Passcode. *\n\n(Make sure that the Home button and your finger are clean and dry)\n\n1. Hold your device as you normally would when touching the Home button.\n2. Touch your finger to the Home button (but don't press it) and hold it\nthere until you feel a quick vibration or until you're asked to lift your\nfinger.\n\n\n [image: Inline image 1]\n\n3. Continue to lift and rest your finger slowly, making small adjustments\nto the position of your finger each time. (The phone will prompt you to do\nthis)\n4. After the initial scan completes, you'll be asked to adjust your grip to\ncapture the edges of your fingerprint.\n5. Hold your device as you normally would when unlocking it and touch the\nadjacent outer areas of your fingertip, instead of the center portion that\nyou scanned first.\n\n*FYI:*\n\n   - If you have trouble enrolling one finger, try a different finger.\n   (FYI: touch ID works only for fingers that you enrolled).\n   - You can enroll up to five fingers using Settings > Touch ID &\n   Passcode. *With each additional finger that you enroll, it may take\n   slightly longer for Touch ID to recognize your finger when you use it.*\n   - As you use Touch ID, it will continue to learn and improve recognition\n   of your fingerprint.\n   - Note: You can still enter your passcode simply by sliding to unlock.\n\n\n*How To Use:*\n\nYou can use Touch ID to unlock your iPhone or iPad without having to enter\nyour passcode every time.\n\n*There are two ways you can unlock with Touch ID: *\n\n   1. Press the Home button once to wake your device and keep your finger\n   lightly on the Home button.\n   2. Press the Sleep/Wake button once to wake your device, and then touch\n   your finger lightly on the Home button.\n\nIf Touch ID doesn't recognize your finger, you'll be asked to try again.\nAfter three attempts, you'll be given the option to enter your passcode.\nAfter two more tries, you'll need to enter your passcode.\n\n\n-- \nMilia Fisher\nSpecial Assistant to the Chair\nHillary for America\nmfisher@hillaryclinton.com\no: 646.854.1198 c: 858.395.1741\n"
