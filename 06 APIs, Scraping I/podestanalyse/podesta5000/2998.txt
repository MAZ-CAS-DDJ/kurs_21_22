john.podesta@gmail.comb'Let\'s do that\nMaybe after our 10am press call?\n\nOn Feb 19, 2016, at 6:19 PM, Jake Sullivan <jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nHappy to talk in morning - should we do call?\n\n\n\nOn Feb 19, 2016, at 8:58 PM, Jennifer Palmieri <jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nYep.  Looking  now.\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Feb 19, 2016, at 7:52 PM, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nI just sent around a draft that tries out some new "it doesn\'t add up"\nlanguage so that might be worth looking at and discussing. And I think Jake\nmay have talked to H about some of this as well.\n\nOn Fri, Feb 19, 2016 at 7:33 PM, Jennifer Palmieri <\njpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\n> Just re- read this note from Jon.\n>\n> It reaffirms my concern with relying on argument that his plans don\'t add\n> up as contrast.

The awesome DREAMer video you guys put out\n>\n> 2. The race speech\n>\n> 3. This David Brooks column (I know, I know, I\'ll go kill myself):\n> http://nyti.ms/1KTjYqJ\n>\n> 4. The Love and Kindness story\n>\n> Her most important job right now is to inspire people, and generate\n> enthusiasm. And she will not succeed by playing the pragmatist to Bernie\'s\n> idealist. No young person - no any person - who isn\'t the most committed\n> voter will head out to the polls or knock on doors for someone who tells\n> them that they should have more realistic expectations for what politics\n> can achieve (even though they should!). In 2008, we would purposely bait\n> her into playing the wet blanket so we could turn around and whack her for\n> it. The line from the New Hampshire primary night speech, "In the unlikely\n> story of America, there has never been anything false about hope" was a\n> direct retort to Hillary\'s line about Obama "giving everyone false hopes."\n> And it was devastating.\n>\n> Far more effective has been what she\'s been doing recently - saying that\n> Bernie is a single issue voter and that there are a lot more issues at\n> stake than Wall Street. This idea that class is the only divide and\n> economic issues are all that matter is a very white male centric view of\n> the world (a Bernie Bro view, if you will). It also reminds me of the\n> hilarious joke that Brian Buetler keeps making every time some asshole says\n> something horribly racist about Obama or sexist about Hillary or prejudice\n> about immigrants and Muslims - oh, let\'s not blame them, they\'re just\n> economically anxious.\n>\n> People are of course economically anxious, and Bernie is tapping into that\n> very well. But that\'s only half the equation. They\'re also being told to\n> blame other groups for all their problems - blacks, gays, immigrants,\n> Muslims, women, political correctness, etc. Fighting that intolerance and\n> divisiveness is just as important as fighting inequality - arguably more so\n> in this election because Trump has made it the defining issue. And she is\n> way better equipped and qualified to make that argument than Bernie is.\n> That\'s true because she\'s a woman. That\'s true because she was America\'s\n> chief diplomat. That\'s true because she\'s fought for these issues her\n> entire life.\n>\n> As far back as Audacity of Hope, Obama often talked about our ability to\n> coexist peacefully in a shrinking world as a central challenge of the 21st\n> century. Bill Clinton used to talk about interdependence on one another as\n> our central mission.\n>\n> Hillary can pick up the mantle here in a very inspiring way. She just has\n> to tweak it and be careful that it doesn\'t sound like she\'s listing off\n> interest groups - here\'s my black speech, here\'s my Latino policy, here\'s\n> my woman\'s event, etc. She needs to combine her policies with her record\n> with a vision of the country and the world where we\'re stronger together\n> than we are divided against each other. That\'s different than "stronger\n> together than we are on our own," which would be more of a Bernie/Obama \'12\n> message that\'s all about right-wing economics. This is an evolution of that\n> message that\'s primarily a response to the intolerance and bigotry of Trump\n> and the right.\n>\n> She should be talking about love and kindness. She should be talking about\n> mutual respect and tolerance. She should be talking about rebuilding the\n> bonds of community and rebuilding friendships, not just between nations,\n> but between people all over the world. Not just compassion for compassion\'s\n> sake - but because we\'re stronger when we\'re pulling together\' when\n> everyone feels like they\'re part of the team.\n>\n> It reminds me of one of my favorite passages from any speech - Cuomo\'s 84\n> convention address:\n>\n> "It\'s an old story. It\'s as old as our history. The difference between\n> Democrats and Republicans has always been measured in courage and\n> confidence. The Republicans -- The Republicans believe that the wagon train\n> will not make it to the frontier unless some of the old, some of the young,\n> some of the weak are left behind by the side of the trail. "The strong" --\n> "The strong," they tell us, "will inherit the land."\n>\n> We Democrats believe in something else. We democrats believe that we can\n> make it all the way with the whole family intact, and we have more than\n> once. Ever since Franklin Roosevelt lifted himself from his wheelchair to\n> lift this nation from its knees -- wagon train after wagon train -- to new\n> frontiers of education, housing, peace; the whole family aboard, constantly\n> reaching out to extend and enlarge that family; lifting them up into the\n> wagon on the way; blacks and Hispanics, and people of every ethnic group,\n> and native Americans -- all those struggling to build their families and\n> claim some small share of America. For nearly 50 years we carried them all\n> to new levels of comfort, and security, and dignity, even affluence. And\n> remember this, some of us in this room today are here only because this\n> nation had that kind of confidence. And it would be wrong to forget that."\n>\n> Who better to deliver that message than First Lady-turned-Secretary of\n> State who could become America\'s first female president?\n>\n>\n>\n'
