The Communications and IST teams have built a memorial page on the Georgetown Law website where these remembrances are being collected for all to read. The page is available here.\n\nhttp://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/in-memoriam/katherine-mccarthy/index.cfm\n\nIf you would like to submit your thoughts and memories of Katherine, click on \x93Click here\x94 at the bottom of the memorial page and your message will be added to the page. The submission form can be accessed directly at\n\nhttp://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/in-memoriam/katherine-mccarthy/form.cfm\n\nYou may also continue to send your messages to Dean Treanor or to mediarelations@law.georgetown.edu<mailto:mediarelations@law.georgetown.edu> and we will add them to Katherine\x92s page. The messages that faculty and staff members have already sent to the community via e-mail are being added, so there is no need to resend those.\n\nWe are heartbroken as well, and we will miss Katherine dearly.\n\n\nThe Communications Team\n\nAnne, Kara, Emily, Richard, Brent, Ines, Sam, and Ann\n\n\n\nKara Tershel | Director of Media Relations\nGEORGETOWN LAW | kat5@law.georgetown.edu\nOffice: 202.662.9037 | Fax: 202.662.9501\n600 New Jersey Avenue N.W. | Washington, D.C. 20001\nWebsite<http://www.law.georgetown.edu/>  |  Facebook<http://www.facebook.com/georgetownlaw>  |  Twitter<http://twitter.com/georgetownlaw>  |  YouTube<http://il.youtube.com/GeorgetownLaw>  |  Flickr<http://www.flickr.com/photos/georgetownlaw/>  |  Instagram<http://instagram.com/gtownlaw> | RebelMouse<http://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/social.cfm>\n\n'
