john.podesta@gmail.comb'John, I thought Secretary Clinton did a great job tonight. A key moment for me and very much related to our discussions was the question from the American Muslim woman who served in the Air Force and spoke about discrimination against American Muslims. Secretary Clinton hit a home run with her reply and clearly demonstrated why we need a leader like her in the presidential office.\r\n\r\nI also note that the woman, Ms. Erum, represents what I spoke to you about - a large and important group of people that identify as Americans and Muslims without reference to ethnicity like Asian, Arab, etc. I still hope this is a topic of discussion at the campaign and we can do something to bring out this vote.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nKamran\r\n\r\n__________________________________________\r\nKamran S.
