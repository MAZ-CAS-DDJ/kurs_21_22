And\nthey have cynically rooted for the President\'s jobs and economic plan to\nfail every day since.   It\'s now clear that if the Party of NO would\nhave had their way, up to 1.6 million American people would be out of\nwork today. When will Congressional Republicans stop rooting for failure\nand start working with the President and the Democratic Leadership in\nCongress to continue moving the economy in the right direction?"  \n\n \n\n-30-\n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://online.wsj.com/article/SB125964003843970851.html\n\n \n\nCBO: 600,000 to 1.6 Million Employed by Stimulus \n\n \n\nWall Street Journal\n\nNOVEMBER 30, 2009, 11:08 P.M. ET\n\nBy JOSEPH B. WHITE\n<http://online.wsj.com/search/search_center.html?KEYWORDS=JOSEPH+B.+WHIT\nE&ARTICLESEARCHQUERY_PARSER=bylineAND>  \n\nThe Congressional Budget Office late Monday said it estimates that the\nfederal stimulus package sustained between 600,000 and 1.6 million jobs\nin the third quarter, and raised gross domestic product by 1.2 to 3.2\npercentage points higher than it would have been without the program.\n\nThe CBO said the figures were estimates made "using evidence about how\nprevious similar policies have affected the economy and various\nmathematical models that represent the workings of the economy."\n\nCBO Director Douglas Elmendorf, in a blog post <http://cboblog.cbo.gov/>\n, said stimulus recipients have reported that about 640,000 jobs "were\ncreated or retained" with stimulus funding through Sept. 30. "However,\nsuch reports do not provide a comprehensive estimate of the law\'s impact\non employment in the United States. That impact may be higher or lower\nthan the reported number for several reasons (in addition to any issues\nabout the quality of the data in the reports)," Mr. Elmendorf wrote. The\nCBO is required to comment on the figures released by stimulus\nrecipients.\n\nThe White House has recently touted the figure of 640,000 jobs tied to\nstimulus spending, based on the reports from grant recipients, as\nevidence that the package is effective. But questions about the accuracy\nof the reports underpinning that figure have prompted criticism by\nmembers of Congress from both parties. Republicans have said the $787\nbillion package of tax cuts and spending hasn\'t stopped unemployment\nfrom rising to 10.2%. Some Democrats have expressed frustration with the\napparent inaccuracies in the job count.\n\nThe CBO in March projected that the stimulus would result in 600,000 to\n1.5 million more jobs than would have existed without the spending. In\nhis blog post, Mr. Elmendorf says the CBO\'s latest estimates reflect a\nfinding that the impact of the package\'s tax cuts have been about $10\nbillion larger than originally projected, while the impact on federal\nspending because of the legislation "has turned out to be slightly\nsmaller than CBO initially estimated."\n\n"Economic output and employment in the spring and summer of 2009 were\nlower than CBO had projected at the beginning of the year. But in CBO\'s\njudgment, that outcome reflects greater-than-projected weakness in the\nunderlying economy rather than lower-than-expected effects" of the\nstimulus, according to Mr. Elmendorf\'s blog post. \n\nWrite to Joseph B.
