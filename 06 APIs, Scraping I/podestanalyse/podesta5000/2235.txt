john.podesta@gmail.comb't r u t h o u t | George W. Bush was right and the Iraq War was good so let\'s have another one because we\'re all going to be killed by those undocumented ISIS fighters who hate our freedom and have weapons of mass destruction and are in Texas RIGHT NOW with the Ebola they brought across the border and did I mention they\'re going to kill us all if we don\'t die of Ebola first?\n \nThat\'s basically the gist of television "journalism" these days, the distilled essence of manufactured hysteria combined with utterly predictable blowback. When you gut medical preparedness at home, diseases have a way of erupting, and when you spend ten years indiscriminately dropping bombs abroad, the victims have a way of punching back\xe2\x80\xa6 but hey, it\'s great for political campaigns, TV ratings and advertising dollars, right?\n \nThe people spreading this bad noise - politicians and "news" media entities alike - are being well-paid to do so. It furthers their combined agenda to have you climbing the walls in fear. If we do collapse as a society, it will not be because of Ebola or ISIS or immigrants or anything else. The virus that will end us is stupidity compounded by manufactured fear compounded by the deranged priorities of those who seek to terrorize you and then laugh all the way to the bank.\n \nWe can do better, and we must do better. The antidote for that virus is sunlight, truth and information, delivered with clean hands to the people. At Truthout, that is what we do, all day and every day. We are not in the business of making a buck off of your fears and uncertainty; we are in the business of informing your fears and assuaging your uncertainties with bedrock-reliable data.\n\nWe are, in short, the antidote. And like any antidote, we need funding to get it to the people who need it.
