He suggested I\ncontact you regarding the transition work you\'re doing for Obama.  I am\nforwarding to you the note I sent to Pete.  Please let me know how I can\nbe of help.\n\nAnd, thanks for all the support you\'ve been giving Jen through the\nEdwards debacle.  They\'ve really been leaning on here to get them\nthrough this.  I know she appreciates the friendship and counsel you\'ve\nprovided her during this difficult time.  Just wanted you to know that I\nappreciate it, too.\n\nJim Lyons\n1403 East Central Avenue\nEdgewater, Maryland  21037\n443.995.3573\nJimrlyons@aol.com\n\n\n**************\nLooking for a car that\'s sporty, fun and fits in your budget?

Glad to help out on the\ncampaign in whatever way I can and will continue to work with Heather\nwhen and where she needs.\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to work on the transition and am attaching\nmy bio and resume as you suggested.  I appreciate your passing this\nalong to Chris and will contact John Podesta directly.\n\nAs I mentioned, I\'ve been working on a transition piece for USDA for a\nbook that CAP will produce.  However, I probably can be most helpful in\nworking on the natural resources, energy and environment elements of the\ntransition given my work with conservation agencies in USDA and DOI.\nHaving focussed alot with the Clinton administration and since at Yale\non western lands issues like fire, forests, and roadless area\nprotection, I probably know more about the large landscape issues.\nBut, wherever I can help...\n\nOne final thought.\n\nI mentioned to Heather that I thought a simple and direct way to deal\nwith the energy issues raised by gas prices (and the critical editorial\nin the NY Times yesterday) would be to propose to redirect the tax\ncredits now going to big oil (aka Exxon-Mobil) and instead give them to\nGM, Ford, and Chrysler to accelerate their efforts to develop fuel\nefficient cars.  The auto manufacturers need the credits (given big\nfinancial losses) and Exxon doesn\'t.  But rather than an abstract\nredirect of these funds to consumers or to "accelerate development of\ncellulosic ethanol", by specifically redirecting the tax credits to the\nauto manufacturers, the benefits should be clear -- especially for the\nunion employees and the states that would benefit like Michigan, Ohio,\nand Wisconsin.  Key electoral states, of course.\n\nThanks again.  I look forward to helping with the campaign and the\ntransition.\n\nJim Lyons\n1403 East Central Avenue\nEdgewater, Maryland  21037\n443.995.3573\nJimrlyons@aol.com\n\n\n**************\nLooking for a car that\'s sporty, fun and fits in your budget?
