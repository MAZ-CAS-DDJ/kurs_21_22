john.podesta@gmail.comb"John -- \n\nThere's a crucial Senate election in Massachusetts in just three days. We need your help to win it.\n\nThe polls are tightening as right-wing money floods the state, and one even shows the race to be a dead heat between progressive champion Martha Coakley and her extreme opponent. The truth is, special elections often have very low turnout and are notoriously unpredictable.\n\nThe stakes are just too high to leave Martha's victory to chance.\n\nIf we lose, Sen. Ted Kennedy's seat will be in the hands of someone who opposes everything he fought for. We'll lose a key vote for the President's agenda in the Senate -- and put all the progress we've made toward health reform at risk.\n\nThat's why OFA is putting together a massive voter turnout effort to make sure Obama voters get back to the polls this time around -- but we need your help to pay for it. Please donate $5 or more to OFA to help fund our organizing, including our work to elect Martha Coakley.\n\nhttps://donate.barackobama.com/Coakley10\n\nOFA is going all out in Massachusetts -- we're sending organizers, knocking on doors, and making phone calls by the tens of thousands to make sure that folks know how to participate. \n\nIt's a huge effort, it's expensive, and time is short. But with the outcome uncertain and the stakes sky high, I don't want to wake up the morning after the election thinking that we could have done something more. If you feel the same way, please donate $5 or more to help us make Martha Coakley the next senator from Massachusetts:\n\nhttps://donate.barackobama.com/Coakley10\n\nThanks,\n\nMitch\n\nMitch Stewart\nDirector\nOrganizing for America\n\n\nPlease donate: https://donate.barackobama.com/Coakley10\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for America, a project of the Democratic National Committee -- 430 South Capitol Street SE, Washington, D.C. 20003.
