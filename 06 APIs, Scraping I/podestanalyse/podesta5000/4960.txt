Our campaign wouldn't be where it is without you, and as I've criss-crossed our city for over a year, it's been my deep honor to hear your stories, your hopes, your challenges and your dreams for Los Angeles.\n\nNow, as we wait for the ballots to be counted, I want you to know how grateful I am for how far we have come together. We have grown into the largest grassroots campaign in the race. We've gone from small house parties to raucous rallies and we have touched people in every corner of Los Angeles with our plans for a stronger economy and a truly responsive City Hall.\n\nWe'll know the results at some point tonight and will be in touch soon, but for now, I just want to send my deepest thanks.\n\nEric\n\n\n-=-=-\nEric Garcetti- Los Angeles Mayor 2013 - United States \nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.
