Dick Ravitch wants to\n>> make sure that you understand that the current bill put forward by the PR\n>> Congressional Rep. Pedro Pierluisi would only allow PR to grant Chapter 9\n>> bankruptcy reorganization to their publicly owned companies (e.g. water,\n>> electricity and highway authorities) and municipalities (in the same way\n>> States can provide this authority to cities - e.g. Detroit and Stockton),\n>> but would not give the authority to PR itself.  Dick feels strongly that PR\n>> is ultimately going to need this authority themselves, but that politically\n>> it will be hard to get for two reasons: (1) giving it to PR is\n>> acknowledgement that PR is not a state and is distinct from states, which\n>> are prohibited from declaring bankruptcy under the Constitution; (2) the\n>> hedge funds have invested in PR itself, whereas mutual funds have\n>> investment in the utilities - hedge funds are hoping that the debt\n>> restructuring happens in the government entities to free up dollars to make\n>> them entirely whole.  Despite these constraints, Dick\'s advice is to make\n>> clear that you recognize that PR needs debt restructuring authority under\n>> Chapter 9 and call for support of the bill as a first step.\n>>\n>> (3) Health - In 2008, you made very clear that you support full parity\n>> with Puerto Rico on Medicare and Medicaid.  Since this time, the health\n>> crisis has heightened -- 60 percent of Puerto Ricans rely on Medicaid or\n>> Medicare to get their health insurance, and we have continued to underfund\n>> them so that doctors are fleeing the island and residents are fleeing to\n>> relocate to Florida in order to seek health care.  As a bargain in the ACA\n>> negotiations, PR was given a $6.5 billion Medicaid grant that was supposed\n>> to last them until 2019, but they are expected to use this money up by the\n>> end of 2017.  And they now have 75 percent of their Medicare recipients on\n>> Medicare Advantage, but the government announced an 11 percent cut in\n>> premium subsidies to MA which will impact their access. We believe that you\n>> should recommit to parity, but recognize that we need to start on a\n>> "pathway to parity."  Chris Jennings and I did a back of the envelope\n>> estimate (CBO has scored parity) and guess that it could cost $40-50\n>> billion over 10 years to get there so we want to be careful about\n>> overcommitting.\n>>\n>> (4) On the politics, Jeff Farrow and others strongly have urged us to\n>> make your position clear on allowing Puerto Ricans to express their will on\n>> the question of statehood (same thing you said in 2008).

Puerto\n>> Ricans are proud American citizens who work hard and contribute to our\n>> Nation every day and they deserve a chance to get ahead.

As a first step, Congress should\n>> provide Puerto Rico the same authority that states already have to enable\n>> severely distressed government entities to restructure their debts under\n>> Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code.

The deficit is a consequence of an economy\n>> that has lagged that of the States for decades and shrunk for eight of the\n>> last nine years.  Puerto Rico needs a longer-term plan to address a\n>> declining population, eroding employment base, high utility rates and the\n>> impact of unequal federal investments.  It will take tough decisions and\n>> real economic reforms.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>> But we should also recognize that the inconsistent \xe2\x80\x94 and incoherent \xe2\x80\x94\n>> treatment of Puerto Rico in federal laws and programs has substantially\n>> contributed to the economic decline.  One troubling example of this\n>> treatment is the lack of equity in federal funding for Puerto Rico under\n>> Medicaid and Medicare.
