john.podesta@gmail.comb'is fairly unbelievable. It is essentially, Palin is uninformed just like\n"regular people," and that\'s why they\'ll like her.\n\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/02/mccain-camps-pre-debate-s_n_131295.html\n McCain Camp\'s Pre-Debate Spin: Palin Doesn\'t Need To Pass IQ\nTest<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/02/mccain-camps-pre-debate-s_n_131295.html>\n\nListening to surrogates and aides to John McCain on Thursday, one is left\nwith the impression that there is no great need for Gov. Sarah Palin to\nactually answer questions during tonight\'s vice presidential debate.\n\nIndeed, the spin coming from McCain surrogates and strategists is that Palin\nhas to do is pass a sort of artificial personality test, in which she\nstrikes an emotional thread with the average voter -- question, answers, or\nintellectual capacity be damned.\n\nSuch were the talking points mere hours before the debate in St. Louis,\nwhich peaked with Sen. Joe Lieberman - a man not unaccustomed to the\npressures of such a forum - actually proclaiming that Palin\'s relative\nignorance helped her relate to "regular people."\n\n"She\'s not lived in the world of Washington, so she doesn\'t know every\ndetail of all the questions senators deal with," Lieberman told NBC\'s Andrea\nMitchell. "But, frankly, that\'s her strength. I think that\'s why a lot of\nregular people out across America think she\'s going to be their voice."\n\nMitchell interjected, "Senator, she wants to be a heartbeat away from the\npresidency. You know, that doesn\'t mean just being an average mom, it means\nbringing other skills."\n\nBut Lieberman stayed on the point, stating later, "I think tonight is not a\nkind of final college exam. I think the point is who is she as a person...\nWhether she can answer every detailed question, I don\'t think that\nultimately matters to the American people so long as they think she passes\nthose other personal thresholds."\n\nIt was the ultimate setting of expectations -- a political\nget-out-of-jail-free card should Palin stumble this evening. And it wasn\'t\nan isolated incident. Over on Fox News, Chris Wallace was relaying a\nconversation with a McCain "strategist" in which the metrics for debate\nsuccess were once again defined in strictly personal terms.\n\n"They say they want to show that she is plain spoken, that she relates to\nJoe Six-Pack and embrace the contrast her to a smooth-talking Washington\ninsider like Joe Biden," Wallace reported. "I said: \'But what if she does\nnot know some of the answer to something?\' They said, \'Look, she should not\nbe embarrassed by that. She should say \'I\'m not a Washington insider. I\'m\ngoing to learn about that but I was a reformer in Alaska and I shook things\nup.\'"\n\nEarlier in the day on Fox News, McCain aide Meg Stapleton was also playing\nup Palin\'s "Joe Six-Pack" attributes, even arguing that Palin\'s "experience\nas an ordinary American" qualified her to be "one heartbeat away" from the\nOval Office... "god forbid."\n\n"So if it\'s the economic crisis, she can certainly speak to the fact that\nshe carries a mortgage. She\'s got kids ready to go to college, she has a son\nwho is also heading off to the military. So from a military perspective, she\nis engaged just like any ordinary American. So if she is one heartbeat away,\nas she is one heartbeat away as a vice presidential candidate, and she\nassumes the presidency, god forbid -- in terms of John McCain, I don\'t wish\nill, but as your question points -- if she becomes president of the United\nStates, she is ready, and that is because she has the experience of an\nordinary American who can get in there and knows what is on people\'s minds\nand what people need."\n\n\n\n\nNico Pitney\nThe Huffington Post\nP: 202.834.0301\nAIM: njpitney\nGTalk/MSN: nico.pitney@gmail.com\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
