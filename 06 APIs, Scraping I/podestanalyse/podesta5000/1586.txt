On Friday, September 25 she is overseeing a day long conference commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Beijing Conference on Women. It should be an interesting event and I\x92m thinking some GULC folks might want to hop on a train to attend. Could you distribute the attached promo sheet around to the faculty with a kudo to Suzanne? Thanks.\n\nRichard\n\n\x96 \x96 \x96\n\nCELEBRATING\n125 YEARS\nJoin us at 125.nyls.edu\n'
