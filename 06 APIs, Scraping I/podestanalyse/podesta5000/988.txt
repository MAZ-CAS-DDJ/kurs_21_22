You paint pictures well with words.\n\nOf course, those of us old enough, could not help comparing what we saw on TV the last few days with the Washington of 1968  -- Except that I think the Washington riots were more widespread - west to 19th Street and east at least to the Anacostia, south almost to Pennsylvania Avenue and north on some streets almost to the District line.   And I can not recall the Baltimore of yesterday materializing in DC.\n\nIncidentally, GULC played a role.   For one thing, we were close enough to see the fires and smell the smoke.   For another, we mobilized scores if not hundreds of law students (under a hastily passed student practice rule) to represent defendants in arraignments for 3-4 24 hour days.  It was a tragic time, but the GULC reaction was one to be proud of.\n\nSherman\n\n\nSherman L.

I\'m not sure the MSM caught the flavor of the day.  I\'m fully aware that today or tomorrow might be a bad day, but i want to convey that yesterday was a very good day.\n\nThere was virtually no violence.  But more important is what there was.  Here\'s my sense of it, garnered from local news and social media  (which I know you can also access, but might not....).  Community organizers, three hundred man march group members, activist ministers, mothers galore, neighbors and volunteers from all over the city including even from baltimore county god bless them, local artists, musicians and dangers were out in loving force yesterday.  The neighbors and volunteers helped clean up the streets.  The organizers and the ministers counseled and calmed teenagers, telling people with signs and bullhorns at the end of the day when the curfew hit to Go Home.  Community and city leaders linked arms with neighbors and protestors, forming lines and placing themselves between the police and the national guard, on one side, and teenagers on the other, effectively urging restraint and peaceful protest on the two sides.  In West Baltimore, a Baltimore brass band played music and people danced and roller bladed. There was singing in the streets - quite a lot.   There was a lot of talking.  There was a lot of organizing.  There was protest.  There were expressions of despair and anger at city-wide injustice that were offered up hand in hand with expressions of civic pride and community loyalty.\n\nEveryone with a TV set who has watched even a single episode of The Wire is aware of the tale of two Baltimores... East and West Baltimore are poor and majority black, North Baltimore is wealthier and whiter the further north one goes, South Baltimore is mixed racially and economically -- hip, young, edgy, gentrified, home to excellent ethnic restaurants, the inner harbor, Camden Yards, Fort Mchenry, and other places Washingtonians regularly visit.  That\'s the familiar tale of two Baltimores: East/West, on the one hand, North/South, on the other.  The Wire, The Corner, and Homicide are set in various communities in East and West Baltimore, with occasional glances at South....If you\'re familiar with, visit, or live in North/South Baltimore, then East/West is the "other Baltimore."  If you live in or visit East/West Baltimore ... etc.\n\nWhat was out in force yesterday -- why it was such a very good day -- was that the other other-Baltimore was so visible. Not the East/West Baltimore of Wire fame and infamy, and not the north/south Baltimore of wealth and gated neighborhoods and gentrification.  Rather, what made itself so visible yesterday was the Baltimore of community organizers, of activist ministers, of protests and protestors, of bottom up development, of neighborhood loyalty, of other-mothers who make it their business to care for everyone\'s children, of three hundred men marchers, and of hope and activism in the face of gut wrenching cruelty and brutality and injustice and grinding poverty.  The National Guard arrived yesterday along with a curfew and plenty of recriminations.   They were plenty visible.  But what I think the MSM missed was that even more than the national guard, the citizens of the other-other Baltimore were truly, truly, front and center -- on the streets, organizing, talking, interacting, building, counseling, cleaning, cleansing, protesting, caring and loving.  Even more than the national guard.   That\'s what made it a good day.  They were kind of magnificent.  They carry Baltimore\'s hopes and possibilities for the future, as in all our cities.\n'
