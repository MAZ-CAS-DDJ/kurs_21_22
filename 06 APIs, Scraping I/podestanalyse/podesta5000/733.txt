john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi John-\n\nOur digital team is prepping to send out the first big fundraising email in\nyour name. These drafts have been approved by comms, research, and legal.\n\nThese three are test drafts. What that means is that they\'ll send all three\nsimultaneously to small lists to test the clickthrough and donation rates.\nAfter about an hour of testing they\'ll pick the most popular draft and send\nit to the huge list.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or edits. Apologies for not getting\nthese to you in hard copy, but I was just informed that they were in the\nworks. If you\'d prefer for us to hold until you can approve in hard copy\njust let me know.\n\nThanks!\nMilia\n\n\n\n*---v1----------------------------------------------------------Sender:\nJohn PodestaSubject: *\n\nNAME,\n\nThis week, Hillary took the boldest stance a presidential candidate has\never offered on immigration reform.\n\nWhat was the Republicans response? A spokesperson for one Republican\ncandidate for president called millions of people -- people who contribute\nto our economy and are Americans in everything but citizenship paperwork --\nthe equivalent of "domestic terrorists."\n\nThat\'s not contributing to the serious debate our country needs on the\nissue -- it\'s just name calling (and deeply offensive, to boot).\n\nOur opponents aren\'t going to engage on the issues because they don\'t have\nreal solutions. They\'re just going to talk.\n\nWe\'re going to act. Chip in $X or more right now to support this work:\n\nLINK\n\nI hope Republicans keep on blathering on like this because Americans need\nto hear what they really think.\n\nThank you so much,\n\nJohn\n\nJohn Podesta\nChairman\nHillary for America\n\n\n\n*--v2------------------------------------------------------------SENDER:\nJohn PodestaSUBJECT: *\n\nFriend --\n\nDespite the attacks that Republicans have been throwing at her, Hillary has\nbeen steadily gaining favor over the last few months. That\'s good news,\nstraight from the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.\n\nSupporters like you made this happen by recognizing these attacks as\nbaseless smears -- and fighting back with the truth in conversations online\nand around the dinner table.\n\nThere\'s a reason that the other side seems more focused on spreading rumors\nand lies about us than on making their own case to voters. This campaign is\nstill early, but it\'s only getting stronger as more and more Americans join\nour team.\n\nWe need to make sure we have the resources to support that growth and to\nfight back against the other side\'s accusations. Can you donate $5 or more\ntoday?//Founding Donors like you have gotten us this far, and thank you for\nthat -- now can you commit to making a monthly donation?\n\nLINK\n\nThanks,\n\nJohn\n\nJohn Podesta\nChairman\nHillary for America\n\n\n\n\n\n*--- v3\n------------------------------------------------------------------Sender:\nJohn PodestaSubject: *\nFRIEND --\n\nOn Tuesday, Hillary sat down in Las Vegas with a group of DREAMers -- young\nAmericans in everything but citizenship paperwork -- to talk about real and\nlasting immigration reform.\n\nI hope you saw it, NAME, because conversations like that one are core to\nthis campaign. We\'re tackling head-on the issues facing everyday Americans.\n\n<link>The opportunity to fix our broken IMMIGRATION system only comes with\na campaign that can win. Help make that possible by chipping in $X or more\nright now to support this work.<link>\n\nNo matter how hard the Republicans try, we\'re not getting dragged into a\nmudslinging competition. They want to talk politics. We want to talk about\nthe things that matter to real people.\n\nTuesday was a major step in that direction. In the months to come, there\nwill be many more.\n\nI look forward to having you be a part of it -- and the first step is\nhelping build the right campaign. Chip in $X right now:\n\nLINK\n\nThank you so much,\n\nJohn\n\nJohn Podesta\nChairman\nHillary for America\n\n-- \nMilia Fisher\nSpecial Assistant to the Chair\nHillary for America\nmfisher@hillaryclinton.com\no: 646.854.1198 c: 858.395.1741\n'
