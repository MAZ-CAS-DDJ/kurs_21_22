john.podesta@gmail.comb"This is my final email to you this month.    \n\nFriend,\n\nThis is my final email to you before the end-of-year FEC deadline at midn\xe2\x80\x8cight. It couldn't be more urgent:\n\nWe're just hours away from the biggest fundraising deadline of my campaign.\n\nTo prove our grassroots strength to Portman and his dark money backers, we set an aggressive $1 million online donation goal. We're close. But Justin tells me we still need 97 supporters to step up by midni\xe2\x80\x8cght.\n\nSo, I'm coming directly to you.\n\nThere are less than 11 hours left to prove our grassroots strength. Can you help?\n\n http://links.e.tedstrickland.com/ctt?kn=4&ms=ODM5MjMyMwS2&r=MTAyNDUyNjI4OTcwS0&b=2&j=ODIzNDA2NzA3S0&mt=1&rt=0 \n\nWe need to invest in our grassroots campaign, the organizers, the offices, the movement. To do it, I'm counting on you!\n\nThanks,\n\nTed\n\n\n                                     \n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.
