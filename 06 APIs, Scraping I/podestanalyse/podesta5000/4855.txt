By the end of the First World War, the number of Armenians in what would become Turkey had been reduced by ninety percent&mdash;more than a million people. A century later, the Armenian Genocide remains controversial but relatively unknown, overshadowed by later slaughters and the chasm separating Turkish and Armenian versions of events. In this definitive narrative history,&nbsp;<strong>Ronald Suny</strong>&nbsp;cuts through nationalist myths, propaganda, and denial to provide an unmatched account of when, how, and why the atrocities of 1915&ndash;1916 were committed.</p> <p class="BodyText1">Drawing on archival documents and eyewitness accounts, Professor Suny\'s book is a vivid and unforgettable chronicle of a cataclysm that set a tragic pattern for a century of genocide and crimes against humanity.</p> <p class="BodyText1">This event is cosponsored by the <a href= "http://go.wilsoncenter.org/SV0U0V0yD0008Mq0700dbrH" >Global Europe Program</a></p> <h2 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif; font-size: 16px;">Speaker</h2> <p><strong>Ronald Grigor Suny</strong><br /> Kennan Institute Title VIII-supported Short Term Scholar; Charles Tilly Collegiate Professor of History, University of Michigan</p> <h2 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif; font-size: 16px;">Moderator</h2> <p><strong>Thomas de Waal</strong><br /> Senior Associate, Russia and Eurasia Program, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</p>\n\nRSVP NOW \xc2\xbb <http://pages.wilsoncenter.org/20140814_Armeniangenocide_KennanEvent.html>\nForward to a Friend <http://go.wilsoncenter.org/v/CVq00s0ID0dM08Vy0b07U00>\n<http://pages.wilsoncenter.org/20140814_Armeniangenocide_KennanEvent.html>\nThursday, August 14, 2014\n\n3:00pm - 4:30pm\n\n6th Floor Flom Auditorium\n\nDirections <http://www.wilsoncenter.org/directions>\n\nWilson Center\n\nRonald Reagan Building and\n\nInternational Trade Center\n\nOne Woodrow Wilson Plaza\n\n1300 Pennsylvania, Ave., NW\n\nWashington, D.C. 20004\n\nPhone: 202.691.4000\n\nkennan@wilsoncenter.org <mailto:kennan@wilsoncenter.org>\n\nPrivacy Policy <http://www.wilsoncenter.org/privacy-policy>\n\n<div style="text-align: center">Subscriber: podesta@law.georgetown.edu.
