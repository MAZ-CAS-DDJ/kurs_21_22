So today, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking for $5: \n\n http://links.e.tedstrickland.com/ctt?kn=8&ms=ODMyODQ1NgS2&r=MTAyNDUyNjI4OTcwS0&b=2&j=ODIwOTIxMzI2S0&mt=1&rt=0 \n\nThat may not sound like much compared to what the Koch brothers and Karl Rove are spending against me. But if everyone reading this email chips in that amount, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the resources to take on Portman and his billionaire backers before dinner.\n\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t stress this enough. Our public showing in 2015 will determine if we have what it takes to go head to head with Portman and his ultra wealthy special interest backers. To show our grassroots strength, we set an aggressive goal of 20,000 online donations for the year, making this our biggest test yet. \n\nOur first mid-month fundraising deadline is in just 48 hours. My team tells me we still need 11 donations from your area to keep pace:\n\ntedstrickland.com/deadline\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m so grateful to have you on my team,\n\nTed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.
