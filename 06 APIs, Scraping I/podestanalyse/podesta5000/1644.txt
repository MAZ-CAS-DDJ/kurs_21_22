Here\'s what\'s going on:\n\n*3 Missed calls:*\n\n\n*Sean Sweeney*\n\n202-697-3206\n\nWants to follow up on last call with you.  Could wait til tomorrow if you\nwant.\n\n\n\n*Deputy Secretary Liz Sherwood-Randall*\n\nScheduler Direct: (202) 586-8472 (Kathryn)\n\nOffice Main Line: (202) 586-5500\n\nWants to speak with you about China before she *leaves for China on Friday*.\nAlso could wait until tomorrow, but she has a window tonight, 6:30 - 7 pm,\nwhile you\'re on the train, if you\'d like to call her then.  Shall I get a\ncel l# for her, or should we try for tomorrow?\n\n\n\n*Chris Niedermeier*\n\n203-556-6314\n\nBiden\'s campaign is interested in her if he runs.  She really just wants an\nindication one way or the other if she should be holding her breath for\nHillary.  Made lots of wild speculation.  I acted like I know nothing but\ntried to be very nice and said I\'d pass on to you.\n\n\n\nAnd *Bill Daley* emailed you so you know about that one of course.\n\n\n*Other:*\n\n*Inquiry from Daschle:* He\'d like to get on the list for PM Abe State\nDinner.  Shall we contact someone?\n\n*Tomorrow:*\n\n*CONFIRMED: Denis McDonough,* 12-12:45 pm at Starbucks at 14th and NY.\nMight go for a walk from there if weather is nice.  Figuring 12:45 pm end\ntime, just in case, since you told Bob and Ed you\'d call them at 1 pm.\n\n*RSVPs for reporter dinner*--you saw from Jesse that we\'re at 40 confirmed\n(including you, me, and Milia). 4 staff are unconfirmed.  That list is\nreattached, if you need it. That\'s more than you bargained for, clearly.\nWhen do you need me to come over?  I can also run errands if we need more\nfood.  We\'ve got the draft Facebook here for you in the morning, and also\nattached to this email.\n\n\nOn Wed, Apr 8, 2015 at 5:43 PM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n> I\'m at the train.
