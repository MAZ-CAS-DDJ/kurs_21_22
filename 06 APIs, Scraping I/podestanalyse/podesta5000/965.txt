Margot\'s paper, "Framing Copyrighted Works," is attached. We will meet from 1:20-3:20 in McDonough 344, and you are welcome to join us.\n\nHere is the abstract:\n\nCopyright law has a framing problem. The problem is pervasive, unresolved, and often unnoticed, and it significantly impacts the nature and scope of copyright protection. Many copyrighted goods can be framed as one comprehensive whole, an approach we call "zooming out," or as a combination of many small works, as approach we call "zooming in". This framing choice is apparent across many areas of copyright law. Courts need to choose whether to zoom in or zoom out on works to determine how much of a work has been copied, which is relevant for purposes of both fair use analysis and for applying the substantial similarity tests; to count how many works were infringed for purposes of determining the multiplier for statutory damages; and to decide who are the authors of complex works.\nThis article is the first to explore the dozens of decisions in which courts have to choose the proper level of zoom across these doctrines. In the majority of cases, courts make the decision without noticing it or with no detailed reasoning. The factors that courts use when they do explicitly reason through the framing decision vary both across and within copyright law doctrine. Moreover, courts that do provide reasoning often rely on factors that are normatively questionable, and are becoming less reliable in the modern digital world.\nThis article suggests that despite the costs of variation, some variation, especially across doctrines, can be justified. Different areas of copyright law face different policy considerations, and we show examples of how variation is not only unavoidable, but sometimes necessary. We show that sometimes the framing of the work itself may need to change, so that the policy balance behind copyright law can remain constant.\n\n\nAll best, Julie\n\n\n\nJulie E.
