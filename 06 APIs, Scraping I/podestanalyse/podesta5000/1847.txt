john.podesta@gmail.comb'WOW - how did we get to December 16?  There must be a new Dr. Seuss book coming, The Grinch that Stole the Time Before Christmas - I am sure that it would be a hit with adults.\n\nAnyway, the registration<https://sp.law.georgetown.edu/sites/Community/Lists/Community%20Events/Flat.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fsites%2FCommunity%2FLists%2FCommunity%20Events%2FSecond%20Annual%20Georgetown%20Law%20Holiday%20Decoration%20Contest> is open for the Second Annual Georgetown Law Holiday Decoration Contest!\n\nThe Standard "Rules"\n\n\n*         All Georgetown Law community members may participate.  You may choose either any seasonal theme and you can partner with other staff/offices if you wish.   There are three broad groupings: Individual Workspace/Office, Door Decoration, Offices/Teams.\n\n\n*         The decorations will be judged on December 18th.\n\n\n*         Please keep costs in mind - our prior decoration contests were offered at minimal cost by staff donating or bringing from home most of the materials used outside of a small amount of office supplies.  The decorations are for everyone and they are greatly enjoyed by the students and the enhanced community spirit benefits all.\n\n\n*         Finally - HAVE FUN!\n\nPlease register<https://sp.law.georgetown.edu/sites/Community/Lists/Community%20Events/Flat.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fsites%2FCommunity%2FLists%2FCommunity%20Events%2FSecond%20Annual%20Georgetown%20Law%20Holiday%20Decoration%20Contest> so everyone will have the opportunity to see who is participating!  A viewing guide will be provided as well.\n\nHappy Holidays from the Building Community Committee!\n\nCharles\n'
