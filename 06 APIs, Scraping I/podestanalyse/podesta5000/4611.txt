Clinton\nspoke at another event for the group in 2006 and has served as an honorary\nchairwoman.\n\n\n\nThroughout her speech, some in the crowd became emotional and many of them\ntook to the rope line afterwards to share stories of their deceased family\nmembers and show photos, with several telling her heartbreaking stories.\nSome just wanted to take a photo with Clinton, but many more had a story to\ntell.\n\n\n\nOne woman, after telling the former secretary of state about her fallen\nhusband, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI miss him every day, thank you for coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton listened to their stories and expressed her condolences, saying\nover and over again, \xe2\x80\x9cI am so, so sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d at times holding the family\nmembers\xe2\x80\x99 hands. One man who urged Clinton to run for president also told\nher about his nephew who he said \xe2\x80\x9cgot the run around\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgot screwed at\nthe VA,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to fix the VA and we need to fix the mental health system,\xe2\x80\x9d he\ntold her.

Clinton has previously served as the group\'s\nhonorary chairwoman.\n\n\n\nClinton said the event was particularly "emotional" for her, according to\nthe Associated Press, especially given the birth of her granddaughter last\nFriday. It was the former secretary of state\'s first public appearance\nsince her daughter Chelsea gave birth to a baby girl, Charlotte Clinton\nMezvinsky.\n\n\n\n"This a great privilege, but it is also for me emotional as we celebrate\nthe birth of our granddaughter and as I look out and see all of you who are\nthinking of your loved ones and the life that he or she lived," she said,\naccording to ABC News. "It\'s really important to me that we never forget\nyour loved ones and we never forget you."\n\n\n\nClinton nodded at her work on the Armed Services Committee when she was a\nsenator from New York, recalling her work with TAPS and other groups to\nincrease survivor benefits for the families of fallen service members.\n\n\n\n"We fought, we cajoled," she said, adding that they eventually secured an\nincrease in immediate survivor benefits from $12,000 to $100,000.\n\n\n\nSeveral attendees shared their stories of loss with Clinton. One man\ndescribed his nephew\'s frustrating experience with the Veteran\'s Affairs\nmedical system, which has been buffeted this year by scandal after reports\nrevealed crushing wait times and employee misconduct at VA facilities.\n\n\n\n"If you run, and I hope you do, fix the VA and fix the mental health\nsystem," he said, according to Buzzfeed. "My nephew was lost, and let me\ntell you something...he really got screwed."\n\n\n\nAnother woman told Clinton it had been two years since her brother\'s\nsuicide.\n\n\n\n"Did he get any help at all?" Clinton asked.\n\n\n\n"Not the right help," the woman said.\n\n\n\nBonnie Carroll, the president and founder of TAPS, thanked Clinton for her\nprevious work with the group.\n\n\n\n"We count you as family," she told Clinton," and we love you a great deal."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Vogue: \xe2\x80\x9cState of Play: John Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s High-Stakes Year\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.vogue.com/1414623/john-kerry-secretary-of-state/>*\n\n\n\nBy Suzy Hansen\n\nOctober 2, 2014, 8:00 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] Through one international crisis after another, America\xe2\x80\x99s\nSecretary of State is waging a marathon campaign of high-stakes diplomacy.\n\n\n\nBack in June, Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to the tiny French\nvillage of Saint-Briac-sur-Mer to do something he never could have done\nwhile running for president\xe2\x80\x94celebrate his European roots. Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s mother, a\ndescendant of the Forbes shipping family, grew up here on an estate called\nLes Essarts, which was destroyed by the Nazis and then rebuilt as an\nenormous blue-shuttered ch\xc3\xa2teau the family still owns today. \xe2\x80\x9cJohnnie,\xe2\x80\x9d as\none of his cousins, the town\xe2\x80\x99s former mayor, calls him, spent his boyhood\nsummers in this idyllic, immaculate place: all stone buildings, cobbled\nstreets, \xc3\xa9piceries with bright awnings, and women in Jean Seberg striped\njerseys outside the Bar Tabac de la Poste. Having come from the\nseventieth-anniversary commemorations of the Normandy invasion, Kerry, 70\nhimself and slender as the Tin Man, is dressed in a midnight-blue suit and\na pink-orange tie, his dense, graying hair as immovable as ever. He glances\ntoward the windswept Brittany coastline and then at the crowds trailing his\nconvoy, eager to see an eminent American so intimately connected with their\nvillage give a speech about the war.\n\n\n\nI have been traveling with Kerry for several days\xe2\x80\x94from Warsaw to Beirut to\nFrance\xe2\x80\x94and though I have caught glimpses of his playful side, the Secretary\nof State has largely lived up to his reputation for reserve. In the\nbackseat of his SUV, we discuss the elaborate Normandy festivities at Omaha\nBeach, where President Obama, German chancellor Angela Merkel, and Russian\npresident Vladimir Putin gathered to remember the sacrifice of hundreds of\nthousands of Allied soldiers\xe2\x80\x94and Kerry is pensive. He speaks of how\nterrifying the invasion must have been for the soldiers. I ask if he, as a\nformer officer, could put himself in their shoes. He shakes his head.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was the possibility that we would be killed,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, referring to\nhis tours of duty in Vietnam, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it was more remote in that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nknow when you were going to be ambushed. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t know when something was\ngoing to happen. In that situation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94D-day\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou know. You are watching boats\nblown up around you. It\xe2\x80\x99s hell.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nI compare the America of 70 years ago, the America that liberated France\nand won the admiration of the world, to the America of today, which seems\nmore embattled and wary. It\xe2\x80\x99s a moment, I suggest, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere there are\naccusations that America is \xe2\x80\x98pulling back\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! We\xe2\x80\x99re not, we\xe2\x80\x99re not pulling back,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. Kerry leans forward\nin his seat. \xe2\x80\x9cThat kicks me into gear and makes me want to go out and\nexplain more. We have to make it clearer to people. I intend to, and the\npresident intends to. That\xe2\x80\x99s what he did at West Point.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe is referring to President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s much-discussed speech in May at the\nmilitary college, in which he laid out a vision of American foreign policy\nthat emphasized diplomatic engagement over the reflexive use of military\nforce. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to build on that,\xe2\x80\x9d he continues. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s what I am\ngoing to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut Kerry will barely get the chance. The summer will bring a cascading and\nsurreal series of international crises, which keeps him constantly on the\nmove. Rarely a day goes by without shocking and terrifying news: a fierce\nelection dispute in Afghanistan that threatens to bring the country to\ncivil war; the downing of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner in Ukraine; a deadly\nconflict between Israel and Hamas; the advance across Iraq of the jihadist\ngroup ISIS, on whom President Obama authorizes air strikes in mid-August.\n\n\n\nDuring this jolting period Kerry will seem to be everywhere at once,\nengaging in negotiations, jousting with his foreign counterparts, and\nstruggling to pull off small victories before jumping back on his plane. \xe2\x80\x9cI\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think there has ever been a Secretary of State who has thrown himself\ninto the job with as much verve and conviction as this guy has,\xe2\x80\x9d says\nStrobe Talbott, a deputy Secretary of State under President Clinton and now\nthe president of the Washington think tank the Brookings Institution as\nwell as a Kerry adviser. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he can\xe2\x80\x99t get a workable and acceptable\ncompromise on a dispute, it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to imagine anybody who can.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nKerry practices just the sort of vigorous diplomacy President Obama spoke\nabout at West Point\xe2\x80\x94but his relentlessness, especially on issues as\nseemingly intractable as Israeli-Palestinian peace, has been bruising at\ntimes. Does America wield the influence in the world that it once did?\nCritics say that Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s go-for-broke diplomatic style raises just this\nquestion\xe2\x80\x94and that he has wasted time on problems that the U.S. cannot\nsolve; supporters say that if Kerry achieves a breakthrough in even one of\nhis major endeavors\xe2\x80\x94say, a nuclear deal with Iran\xe2\x80\x94he could be one of the\nmost important Secretaries of State in recent history.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot going on,\xe2\x80\x9d Kerry acknowledges when I meet with him over the\nsummer in his office at the State Department. \xe2\x80\x9cBut when you have four or\nfive flare-ups at the same time, you\xe2\x80\x99ve still got to talk to people; you\xe2\x80\x99ve\ngot to sit down with them face-to-face, look in their eyes, grab the\nproblem, and work through it. So we\xe2\x80\x99re managing. We can multitask.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous amount of pressure for someone who already suffered a\nlarge-scale defeat in his political career, but Kerry seems at ease. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nfeel comfortable, and I feel free,\xe2\x80\x9d he says of the work he\xe2\x80\x99s doing now. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nfeel completely liberated. But, you know . . . I was a lot better senator\nafter I ran for president because I had done it. I had run. I came within\n59,000 votes in one state\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Ohio\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cso for three hours I was president.\xe2\x80\x9d He\nsmiles to make sure I get what I am not completely sure is a joke.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel like I made a few mistakes, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t blow it,\xe2\x80\x9d he continues and\nshrugs. \xe2\x80\x9cThe one thing I kick myself about back then is not listening to\nmyself a few times . . . not letting it all out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDemocrats could be forgiven for feeling less sanguine about 2004. Many\nstill consider Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s loss to President George W. Bush an almost\nunfathomable debacle. The war in Iraq was proving disastrous at the time,\nand Kerry had the perfect presidential r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9: a Kennedy-like background, a\nrecord of courage in Vietnam, 20 years in the Senate. But some voters found\nhim hard to connect to and perceived an aristocratic air that the Right\nmercilessly exploited. Swift Boat Veterans for Truth smeared Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s\nmilitary record, Republicans branded him a flip-flopper on Iraq (a war he\nhad voted for in 2002), and, in the end, Kerry lost the popular vote by 3\nmillion.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything harder in this life,\xe2\x80\x9d apart from matters of\nlife and death, \xe2\x80\x9cthan losing a presidential election,\xe2\x80\x9d says his friend\nformer Yale classmate and State Department adviser David Thorne. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\nrequires determination and toughness to get back up on the horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAfter the election, Kerry largely faded from view as he returned to the\nSenate, chaired the Foreign Relations Committee, and recovered from his\nloss. \xe2\x80\x9cI would say he became more confident,\xe2\x80\x9d says his longtime chief of\nstaff, David Wade. \xe2\x80\x9cThat experience of running a campaign like that . . .\nand then losing in a pretty heartbreaking way. He came out of that\nexperience with a great deal of conviction about how he wanted to spend his\n60s and his 70s.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI also think it left him with a little sense of \xe2\x80\x98I just don\xe2\x80\x99t really give\na shit,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Wade adds. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are going to make judgments, but you play a\nlong game.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThat long game has brought a kind of vindication. Today President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\nforeign policy happens to look much like Kerry proposed America\xe2\x80\x99s should\nduring the campaign in 2004: more modest, more interested in multilateral\ndiplomacy and fighting terrorism on a case-by-case basis. Kerry praises\nwhat he calls President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvery careful, hard-nosed approach\xe2\x80\x9d to\ndecision-making. \xe2\x80\x9cI am impressed by the questions he asks . . . and how he\nwants to know the strategy and the facts that support that choice before he\nmakes it\xe2\x80\x94not afterward.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe world is also more turbulent, multipolar, and crisis-prone than it was\na decade ago. When Kerry succeeded Hillary Clinton as secretary in 2013,\nafter President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s presumed choice, Susan Rice, withdrew her name\nfollowing the attacks in Ben\xc2\xadghazi, Libya, he faced a dizzying list of\nproblems. The U.S. was in the midst of messy withdrawals from Iraq and\nAfghanistan. The Israeli-\xc2\xadPalestinian peace process was dead. The Arab\nSpring had upended American policy in the Middle East. Syria had become a\nhumanitarian catastrophe, and Iran still posed a nuclear threat.\n\n\n\nKerry began addressing each with gusto. \xe2\x80\x9cThe way he views it is that\nSecretary Clinton was secretary at a time when we had to repair our\nrelationship with the world,\xe2\x80\x9d says State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s building on a lot of the work she has done.\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cI telephone Hillary\nhere and there and ask her for her thoughts about things,\xe2\x80\x9d Kerry says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nhave a lot of admiration and friendship for her.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\n\n\nAt press time, Kerry had traveled some 543,687 miles, visited 55 countries,\nand spent almost 1,200 hours in the air. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has chosen to tackle head-on\nsome difficult strategic issues,\xe2\x80\x9d says Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former U.S.\nnational-security adviser, \xe2\x80\x9cand these issues would probably deteriorate\ninto more dangerous prospects without some serious signs of U.S. interest.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe listens well,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ryan Crocker, former ambassador to Iraq, of Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s\ndiplomatic style. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will listen to his interlocutors, understand their\nviewpoint, and make his points within the context of where they stand. That\nkind of empathy goes a long way to creating a climate in which compromise\nand agreement become possible. And he also has a reputation for absolute\nhonesty and integrity. He never misleads, and he\xe2\x80\x99s known for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThere are those who call Kerry naive or arrogant for believing that he can\nsomehow solve problems that no one else can. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he vastly overstates\nhis personal ability to persuade people to do what the U.S. wants,\xe2\x80\x9d says\nStephen Walt, an expert on foreign policy and a professor of international\naffairs at Harvard. \xe2\x80\x9cKerry is like Madeleine Albright, who said that the\nU.S. is \xe2\x80\x98the indispensable nation.\xe2\x80\x99 So if a problem happens in the South\nChina Sea or Nigeria or Ukraine, Kerry thinks there\xe2\x80\x99s a solution in\nWashington. And he hops on a plane to try and provide it. I think that view\nis occasionally correct, but usually not.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nKerry\xe2\x80\x99s response is that he would \xe2\x80\x9crather get caught trying than never try\nat all\xe2\x80\x9d (this, incidentally, was also a favorite phrase of President\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s). He acknowledges that President Obama has given him \xe2\x80\x9cenormous\nlatitude. I actually thanked him a couple of months ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he tells me. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98You know, Mr. President, I want to thank you for giving me the\nbreadth to take the ball and roll with it.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that Kerry is more suited to the diplomatic life than he ever\nwould have been to the modern presidency. He is far less extroverted and\neager to please than most politicians\xe2\x80\x94and he can\xe2\x80\x99t fake a folksy, telegenic\nstyle. He has a solemn air of politeness, which seems to come from a sense\nof duty. At a press conference in Beirut, for example, I watch a Lebanese\njournalist yell angrily at him because she believes Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s staff has cut\nthe time short. Kerry, halfway off the dais, stops mid-stride, eyebrows\nraised, and returns to the microphone. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very happy to take your\nquestion,\xe2\x80\x9d he says with gentle amusement. On his plane, he briskly walks\nthe aisles to say hello to members of the press, flashing a T-shirt given\nto him by a Lebanese security detail, posing obligingly for photos. The\nroutine lasts for only a minute or two before he passes his huddled staff\nand the hulking bodyguards stowing their weapons, and returns to his\ncabin\xe2\x80\x94back to work.\n\n\n\nWork is a constant. Only rarely do photographers catch him relaxing or\nkiteboarding on Nantucket, and his reading tends toward serious history and\nbiography (though he recently made time for The Art of Fielding). For a man\nin his eighth decade, Kerry takes remarkably little time off\xe2\x80\x94but he seems\nto be having a good time on the road, too. One night in Paris, I run into\nhim outside the gilded Westin hotel near the Tuileries Garden, returning\nfrom dinner at Chez L\xe2\x80\x99Ami Louis with David Thorne, his stepson Andr\xc3\xa9 Heinz,\nand both men\xe2\x80\x99s partners. He stands on the sidewalk extolling the virtues of\nthe wine he\xe2\x80\x99d had that evening, then poses for selfies with some eagle-eyed\nBoston natives. It is midnight when he disappears into the hotel bar, his\nstaffers trailing behind him, struggling to keep up.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really do think some of it comes out of Vietnam,\xe2\x80\x9d says Wade about\nKerry\xe2\x80\x99s drive. \xe2\x80\x9cHe came out of Vietnam with a pretty fundamental conviction\nthat for whatever reasons a lot of his closest friends never came home, and\nhe did. He has this conviction of not wasting time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPeals of laughter can be heard from his plane cabin when Kerry FaceTimes\nwith his daughter Vanessa, a critical-care physician in Boston, and his\ntwo-and-a-half-year-old grandson, Alexander. Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s other daughter,\nAlexandra, a film director, recently had a baby girl. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been awesome,\nactually,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanessa says of Kerry as grandfather. \xe2\x80\x9cI have left him alone to\nbabysit Alexander, which makes me feel really guilty. I remember asking\nhim, \xe2\x80\x98What are you going to do if the prime minister of Israel calls?\xe2\x80\x99 And\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll figure it out.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have many late-night and early-morning phone calls, and John takes\nevery opportunity to get home,\xe2\x80\x9d reports his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, whom\nhe married in 1995 and who quickly became known for her outspokenness and\nhumor on the campaign trail. Now 75, she suffered a seizure last summer\nwhile vacationing on Nantucket, and has been keeping out of the public eye\nthrough her recovery. \xe2\x80\x9cI have learned so much about the brain and the time\nit takes to recover from a seizure such as mine,\xe2\x80\x9d she adds. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel blessed\nto have the support of my husband\xe2\x80\x94who quite literally lay beside me in my\nhospital bed last year.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nKerry\xe2\x80\x99s first wife was Vanessa and Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Julia Thorne, who\ndied of cancer in 2006. (She and Kerry divorced in 1988.) Since her death,\nKerry has become assertive with parental advice. Vanessa remembers when she\nwas getting married in 2009\xe2\x80\x94Kerry was senator then\xe2\x80\x94her father handed her a\nsketch of what resembled a wedding dress. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he was going\nfor\xe2\x80\x94I think it was sort of a strapless gown that was formfitting up top and\nflowing on the bottom. He drew on a sticky note, like, \xe2\x80\x98This is what I\nthink the dress should look like.\xe2\x80\x99 He genuinely had been thinking about it.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s been really sweet to see him cross some of the normal territory\nbecause we don\xe2\x80\x99t have our mom.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost of the rest of the world doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lie awake at night worrying about\nAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s presence; they worry about what would happen in our absence,\xe2\x80\x9d\nKerry told the graduating class at Yale this May, sounding like the\nidealistic young man who signed up to serve in Vietnam. In other ways,\nthough, he remains the heartbroken veteran who turned against the war, too.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the president and I share a tremendous sense of the damage that\nwas done by the prior administration\xe2\x80\x99s approach\xe2\x80\x94particularly to Iraq, and\nits inattention to Afghanistan,\xe2\x80\x9d he says to me during our interview at the\nState Department. America\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwars of choice . . . never should have become\nwhat they were, and never should have taken place.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHis office suite, decorated with traditional Washington Federal-style\nfurniture and Oriental rugs in patterns of scarlet and blue, overlooks the\nLincoln and Jefferson memorials. It\xe2\x80\x99s a handsome but not particularly\npersonal space, and I imagine Kerry prefers his plane or Boston, where he\nworks out of an office in his Beacon Hill town house.\n\n\n\nI ask about the fears of American decline expressed so often on the\npolitical Right. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, first of all, there\xe2\x80\x99s no empire; there\xe2\x80\x99s no desire\nfor empire. The age of empire is over,\xe2\x80\x9d he tells me. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at\nnow is an age of alliances and partnerships.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe adds that \xe2\x80\x9cdemocracy is not on the wane. People want democracy.\xe2\x80\x9d What we\nhave to be mindful of is \xe2\x80\x9cyoung people around the world being co-opted by\nthe demagoguery of individual leaders. If we don\xe2\x80\x99t find a global approach\nto them, we\xe2\x80\x99re all going to feel the heat.\xe2\x80\x9d This brings terrorism into our\nconversation; he calls it \xe2\x80\x9cthe instrument of choice that fills the vacuum\nleft by inadequate governance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHis assessment of the terrorist group ISIS and their murderous tactics is\nunsparing: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re ugly. They\xe2\x80\x99re really horrible\xe2\x80\x94as bad as anything I\xe2\x80\x99ve\nseen in public life. They\xe2\x80\x99re willing to kill indiscriminately.\xe2\x80\x9d He adds\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cthey have proclaimed definitively that they intend to attack the\nWest\xe2\x80\x9d and that countries across the Middle East\xe2\x80\x94from Israel to Iran to\nSyria to Jordan\xe2\x80\x94oppose the group: \xe2\x80\x9cAll of us are unwilling to tolerate the\nrise of a jihadist ISIS.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nI ask him if it\xe2\x80\x99s painful to see the sectarian deterioration in Iraq.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it makes me angry,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cPainful is not the word I\xe2\x80\x99d choose. We\nnever should have turned it upside down. Having done so, they\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the Bush\nadministration\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnever put a political process together.\xe2\x80\x9d We will speak\nabout Iraq again after the country\xe2\x80\x99s embattled leader, Nouri al-Maliki,\nresigns, and shortly before the execution by ISIS of American journalist\nJames Foley. Over the phone, Kerry will express some cautious optimism:\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s moving in the right direction with Maliki stepping down peacefully.\xe2\x80\x9d\nA legitimate government, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cwas the prerequisite for President\nObama, from day one, to say now we can do something about ISIL\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94an\nalternative name for ISIS. \xe2\x80\x9cThe U.S. is not going to get involved in any\non-the-ground combat troops . . . but we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to shy away from\nequipping and assisting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe fighting that broke out between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip\ncaptured Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s focus like no other development this summer. In July, Fox\nNews caught him on a live microphone speaking to his Deputy Chief of Staff\nJonathan Finer and seeming to complain about the scope of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s\nincursion into Gaza (\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a hell of a pinpoint operation,\xe2\x80\x9d he\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\nFiner sarcastically). Back on air, he will quickly champion Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right\nto defend itself, as he will even after being criticized by Israeli leaders\nwho publicly dismiss Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to broker peace.\n\n\n\nWith me he defends his attempt to get a cease-fire. \xe2\x80\x9cThe level of\ncollateral damage that was taking place inevitably was going to turn\nagainst Israel and be harmful to the overall effort and harden people\nagainst cutting some kind of long-term agreement. So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we were\npushing. We continue to work at this and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to, despite\nfrustrations in one camp or another\xe2\x80\x94because the stakes are very, very high.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAt the end of the summer, Kerry traveled to Australia and Myanmar and\ndeclared, upon his return, that he would be turning his attention to\n\xe2\x80\x9clong-term opportunities\xe2\x80\x9d in that region of the world. It was a reminder\nthat Kerry has another two years to serve as the president\xe2\x80\x99s chief\ndiplomat, and much ground still to cover. If you ask him about the legacy\nhe hopes to leave, however, he practically snaps. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think about a\nlegacy. I think about getting the job done as well as I can, and you and\nhistory and other people will take care of the rest of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut he does reflect on the past. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, obviously, losing the\npresidency is not the option of first choice,\xe2\x80\x9d he says and laughs, as if\nawed by the memory. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t get lost in it. I said, \xe2\x80\x98I am not going\nto make this the defining moment of a life of involvement in public service\nand caring about things.\xe2\x80\x99 I was a senator and had a lot I was interested\nin; I have a great family, a great life, and I have nothing to complain\nabout. So I went right back in and started kicking. . . .\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love it, I really enjoy this job, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great job,\xe2\x80\x9d he continues. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nI am excited. Look, we got the deal on chemical weapons [in Syria]; we\xe2\x80\x99ve\ngot Iran talking. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got the Middle East people talking\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot\nof progress there, and I believe we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to talking.\xe2\x80\x9d He cocks his\nhead pointedly, with a faint smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not finished.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Hill blog: Briefing Room: \xe2\x80\x9cPriebus: GOP women worth \'bragging\' about\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/219561-priebus-gop-does-bad-job-bragging-about-women>*\n\n\n\nBy Kevin Cirilli\n\nOctober 2, 2014, 10:59 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Thursday that\nhis party is making gains among women voters, but it needs to do more\n"bragging" about the women in its own ranks.\n\n\n\nDuring a panel at George Washington University, Priebus praised GOP leaders\nlike Sen. Kelly Ayotte (N.H.), South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Rep.\nShelley Moore Capito (W.Va.).\n\n\n\n"We do a really bad job bragging about it," he said following his prepared\nremarks. "As far as putting more women up on the news on Sunday morning and\nmaking sure that we\'re placing people better \xe2\x80\x94 I think we\'ve improved on\nthat a lot."\n\n\n\nThe comments come with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presumed\nto be Democratic frontrunner for president in 2016.\n\n\n\n"She doesn\'t poll as well as you would think with women," Priebus said. "We\nneed to do better [...but] women, as of today, they don\'t have a sizable\nadvantage in the Democratic Party over the Republican Party, as much as\nthat narrative has sunk in.\n\n\n\nPriebus also said the party must shift its strategy in 2016 to focus more\non a ground game as opposed just to raising large amounts of money.\n\n\n\n"We had become a U-Haul trailer of cash for a presidential nominee," he\nsaid of 2012. "That is a loser\'s strategy."\n\n\n\nPriebus said that party can\'t just "raise a gazillion dollars and hand it\noff to the presidential nominee" or engage in a "23-debate traveling\ncircus," alluding to the 2012 Republican nominating process. "\n\n\n\nYou have to be a national party obsessed over mechanics, obsessed over a\nground game, over the data game," he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Chicago Sun-Times: \xe2\x80\x9cDungeons & Dragons Kickstarter campaign features\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://politics.suntimes.com/article/washington/dungeons-dragons-kickstarter-campaign-features-hillary-clinton/thu-10022014>*\n\n\n\nBy Chad Merda\n\nOctober 2, 2014, 10:42 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nHere are three things that don\xe2\x80\x99t normally go together: Hillary Clinton,\nKickstarter and Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n\n\nFor now, they do because one group wants to raise money to hire Clinton to\nspeak and \xe2\x80\x9chelp us bring our fantasy world to life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe only problem for the Dungeons & Dragons group from New York? They don\xe2\x80\x99t\nhave $200,000, which is what Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s reportedly paid to speak. So\nnaturally, they\xe2\x80\x99re turning to Kickstarter to help and have launched a\nfundraising campaign called \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton: The Ultimate Adventure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSo far, they\xe2\x80\x99re off to a slow start, with a little more than $200 pledged.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone can benefit from Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s legendary political savvy and\ntop-notch oratory skills. Especially gamers,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Jared Logan, who\nstarted the effort.\n\n\n\nAnd really, it\xe2\x80\x99s all about the D-word.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy achieving this goal, we will prove that a democracy is for the people\nand by the people,\xe2\x80\x9d Logan writes. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will show that even the most\ndisenfranchised and oppressed group in this country (tabletop roleplayers)\ncan still access our nation\xe2\x80\x99s leaders and speak to them face to face.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd if by some small miracle they not only raise the money, but manage to\nlure Clinton to New York, she\xe2\x80\x99ll have to forgo the large venue she\xe2\x80\x99s\naccustomed to \xe2\x80\x94 and maybe even duck to avoid hitting her head on some low\nbeams and exposed plumbing.\n\n\n\nWhy?
