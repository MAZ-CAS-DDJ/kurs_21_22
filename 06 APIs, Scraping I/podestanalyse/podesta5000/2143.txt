I just wanted to drop in a quick note\nand see how you're doing. I am now based in Singapore, and will be coming to\nthe States for a few days next month. I just realised that I don't have\nJohn's new email address, so took the liberty of contacting you. I hope you\ndon't mind.\n\nI will be in DC from June 8-10, and New York from June 10-12. It would be\ngreat to see you and John if you are in those cities during that time. My\nhusband is also coming with me, so I would love to introduce him to both of\nyou since he has heard so much.\n\nHope we can have the opportunity to catch up next month!\n\nWarm regards,\n\nSeher\n\n"
