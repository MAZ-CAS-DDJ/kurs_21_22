I think this means we have a little maneuvering space until R candidates start dropping out. It does still look like McCain will win it in the end.\n\nHere is where I think we go:\n\n1. Continue our McCain focused research. Groups, probably a message poll in lieu of state baselines.\n\n2. Start prepping the "McCain is just like Bush. Same old thing." materials. We will all want to open on that even if we don\'t make that the big play. People need something to say about McCain if asked. Tara\'s draft talking points serve that purpose.\n\n3. Continue to develop economic scripts and produce economic ads.\n\nAny thoughts? I will ask Ryan to see if we can reconvene for a call this week.\n'
