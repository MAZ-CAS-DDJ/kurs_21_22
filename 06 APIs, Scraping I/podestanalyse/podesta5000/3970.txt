But I'm back at work because there's a battle I can't ignore right now.\n\nJohn, my wedding is a testament to the progress we've fought so hard to achieve and I refuse to see that progress erased.\n\nNot for other LGBT men and women who want to marry their partner. Not for my children who deserve to live in a country defined by equality and opportunity.\n\nThere are a lot of people - with a lot of money - who hate our values and want to destroy the gains we've made. That's why Randy and I agreed that I need to get back to work; the honeymoon has to wait.\n\nThe NY primary is tomorrow and the biggest FEC public filing deadline is seven days away.\n\nI wouldn't be asking - in fact, I wouldn't be here today - if this weren't so important.\n\nPlease donate whatever you can to my campaign before midnight tomorrow by using this link: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20140623-lapd&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\nIt would be a huge help and since I can't spend these next few days with my husband, I might as well make it worth it and beat these guys coming after me.\n\nThanks again and we'll send pictures along ASAP!\n\nSean\n\nP.S. Now that the wedding is over I can admit it - yes, I was a little nervous...no, I don't feel any different!\n\n\n\nContribute -- https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20140623-lapd&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.\nTo unsubscribe from the Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress email list, please click here: http://action.seanmaloney.com/unsubscribe\n\n\nPAID FOR BY SEAN PATRICK MALONEY FOR CONGRESS\n\n\n"
