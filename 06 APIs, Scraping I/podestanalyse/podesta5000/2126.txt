In a letter to Chairman Klein, Senator Clinton\nhighlighted in particular two issues that exemplify the concerns: the\nfailure of Entergy to install an adequate new emergency siren system and\nthe coming move to dry cask storage of spent fuel at Indian Point.\n\n \n\n"The continuing drumbeat of problems at Indian Point has undermined\npublic confidence in both Entergy and the NRC.  How the siren and dry\ncask storage issues are handled in the coming months will send a signal\nto the public about whether there is a renewed commitment to public\nsafety by federal regulators and the plant\'s owners.  I urge the NRC to\nuse this opportunity to demonstrate a new seriousness about getting it\nright at Indian Point," Senator Clinton wrote.\n\n \n\nSenator Clinton has worked to push both the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission (NRC) and Entergy to improve safety, security and emergency\npreparedness at the plant, including the siren system. Senator Clinton\nadded a provision to the energy bill in 2005 to require Entergy to\ninstall a new siren system with battery backup in response to repeated\nfailures of the Indian Point siren system due to a lack of backup power.\nThat provision was signed into law in August of 2005, and the NRC set a\nJanuary 2007 deadline for having the system operational. Entergy applied\nfor and received an extension of the deadline to April 15th, and\nsubsequently missed the deadline. NRC fined Entergy $130,000 and Senator\nClinton announced that she would sponsor Senate companion legislation\n<http://clinton.senate.gov/news/statements/details.cfm?id=274453&&>  to\na bill to be sponsored in the U.S. House by Congresswoman Nita Lowey\n(D-Westchester/Rockland) and Congressman John Hall (D-Hudson Valley),\nthat would steer fines levied by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for\nsafety violations to counties surrounding nuclear facilities in order to\nassist them with emergency planning (see -\nhttp://clinton.senate.gov/news/statements/details.cfm?id=274453&&)\n\n \n\nEarlier this year, Senator Clinton announced that she would be asking\nthe DHS inspector general to evaluate why Entergy has failed to meet\nestablished deadlines to achieve operability of a new alert and\nnotification system for the Indian Point nuclear power plant (see -\nhttp://clinton.senate.gov/news/statements/details.cfm?id=281505&&).\nSenator Clinton has also continued to call for the NRC to conduct an\nIndependent Safety Assessment (ISA) at Indian Point and has introduced\nlegislation to require an ISA at the plant.\n\n  \n\nThe following is the text of Senator Clinton\'s letter to NRC Chairman\nKlein:\n\n \n\nDr. Dale E. Klein\n\nChairman\n\nNuclear Regulatory Commission\n\nWashington, D.C. 20555\n\n \n\nDear Chairman Klein:\n\n \n\nI have worked hard over the last six years to push both the Nuclear\nRegulatory Commission (NRC) and Entergy to improve safety, security and\nemergency preparedness at Indian Point.  While improvements have been\nmade, problems persist at the plant.  At the same time, new issues and\nchallenges continue to emerge.  I write today regarding two issues that\nexemplify these two types of concerns: the failure of Entergy to install\nan adequate new emergency siren system; and the coming move to dry cask\nstorage of spent fuel at Indian Point.\n\n \n\nI am extremely dismayed about the continued failure of Entergy to put a\nsiren system in place that meets the requirements of the Energy Policy\nAct of 2005, and the related Nuclear Regulatory Commission orders.  We\nwill soon reach the one year anniversary of the date by which the new\nsiren system with backup power was supposed to be in place.  When that\noriginal deadline approached, Entergy applied for and received an\nextension of the deadline to April 15th of 2007.  Entergy subsequently\nmissed that extended deadline, and was fined $130,000 by the NRC.  Since\nthat time, Entergy and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)\nhave been in talks to discuss how the new siren system can be modified\nto meet the applicable requirements.  In my view, it is time for the NRC\nto become more involved in order to drive these talks to a conclusion,\nand then to use its enforcement tools to force Entergy to devote the\nresources that are required to achieve the long-delayed goal of having a\nnew siren system in place that complies with the law and enhances public\nsafety.  \n\n \n\nIn addition, I note that Entergy will soon move spent fuel rods from\npools at Indian Point to dry cask storage on site.  This action will\nhave benefits; in particular, it will enable Indian Point to empty the\nspent fuel pool that has been leaking water contaminated with strontium\n90 into the environment.  At the same time, any action involving spent\nfuel presents potential hazards and security risks.  With these risks in\nmind, I urge you to take whatever measures are required to ensure that\nEntergy puts public safety and security first during this new phase of\noperations at Indian Point.  \n\n \n\nThe continuing drumbeat of problems at Indian Point has undermined\npublic confidence in both Entergy and the NRC.  How the siren and dry\ncask storage issues are handled in the coming months will send a signal\nto the public about whether there is a renewed commitment to public\nsafety by federal regulators and the plant\'s owners.  I urge the NRC to\nuse this opportunity to demonstrate a new seriousness about getting it\nright at Indian Point.  \n\n \n\nSincerely yours,\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\n\t\n\t \t \t\n'
