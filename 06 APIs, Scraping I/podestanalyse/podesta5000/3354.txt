john.podesta@gmail.comb'Team,\n\n\n\nAttaching draft bullets for tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s organizing events in Nashville and\nMemphis. The acknowledgements at top will change, but the bulk of the\nremarks will remain the same for both events. This re-ups the taxes\ncontrast from the Dallas, specifically highlights our new up to $5k tax\ncredit for excessive health care costs, does some Kentucky-vs-Tennessee on\nhealth care and ACA, touches HRC\xe2\x80\x99s coal communities plan, and ends. We\xe2\x80\x99re\ngoing to experiment with providing shorter bullets rather than long\nscripted remarks for these organizing events.\n\n\n\n*Please return edits and comments by 6pm today*.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nKristina\n'
