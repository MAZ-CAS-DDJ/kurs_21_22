john.podesta@gmail.comb"but this one is interesting.  it's EVP for Ops at CBPP.  I met with Susan\nSteinman today and she is interested but they are far along in the process\nand i'm thinking about whether this move would make sense (if they decided\nto go my way).  it's same salary basically, but a growth job for sure.  my\ngut is telling me to look a little longer, and actually that i may really\nwant to go back to nyc.  i just know it's such a good organization -- i\nwanted to get any thoughts you might be willing to share.\n"
