Mark Kirk<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/11/16/kirk-palin-snub/>\n\nhttp://thinkprogress.org/2009/11/16/kirk-palin-snub/\n\nEarlier this month, the Washington Post reported<http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/eye-on-2012/il-sen-kirk-seeks-palin-endors.html> that Rep. Mark Kirk (R-IL), a candidate for Senate in 2010, wrote a memo to Sarah Palin requesting that she endorse him during her visit to Chicago for the Oprah Winfrey Show. The Post noted that "Palin\'s endorsement [of Conservative Party candidate Doug Hoffman] helped force state Assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava (R) from the race" in the NY-23 special election, and that Kirk\'s memo is "tangible evidence<http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/eye-on-2012/il-sen-kirk-seeks-palin-endors.html> of the power of Palin\'s endorsement in a Republican primary."\n\nThe memo is also tangible evidence of Kirk\'s willingness to dramatically switch positions in order to gain political power. Last year, Kirk panned Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) selection of Palin as his running mate, telling the Chicago Tribune, "I would have picked someone different<http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2008/oct/01/local/chi-10th-district-race-01oct01>." Asked about Palin\'s qualifications for office, Kirk said, "Quite frankly, I don\'t know<http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2008/oct/01/local/chi-10th-district-race-01oct01>."\n\nHowever, it appears that Palin has rejected Kirk\'s request for an endorsement. Recently, Kirk told ThinkProgress<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/11/06/kirk-palin-beck/> that he had been expecting her endorsement once she visited Chicago:\n\nTP: How about Sarah Palin? How close are you to getting her endorsement?\n\nKIRK: We sent a memo detailing the race, and she\'ll be coming in to Chicago shortly.\n\nWatch it:\n\nHowever, Palin visited Chicago last week<http://www.kwch.com/Global/story.asp?S=11510148> to tape an interview with Winfrey and made no mention of Kirk. Indeed, the Wall Street Journal noted that Kirk was "unsuccessful<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125798895092944509.html>" in his bid for an endorsement, despite his detailed memo.\n\nFacing a competitive challenge from businessman Patrick Hughes in the Republican primary, Kirk is attempting to veer to the right. After voting in favor<http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll477.xml> of cap-and-trade clean energy legislation during the summer, Kirk quickly changed his mind and told tea party activists that he would vote against<http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/mark-kirk-i-voted-for-cap-and-trade-in-the-house-would-vote-no-in-the-senate-and-crowd-cheers.php> the same bill in the Senate. Speaking to another assembly of conservative supporters in April, Kirk suggested that peopleshould shoot<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/04/16/kirk-shoot-taxes/> Gov. Pat Quinn (D-IL) for raising taxes.\n\n\n\n-----\nAdam Jentleson\nCommunications Director, Progressive Media\nCenter for American Progress Action Fund\najentleson@americanprogressaction.org<mailto:ajentleson@americanprogress.org>\najentleson (AIM)\n202-247-8614 (cell)\n\n\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
