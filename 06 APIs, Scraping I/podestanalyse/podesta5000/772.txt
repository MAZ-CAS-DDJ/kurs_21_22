john.podesta@gmail.comb"Dear John,\nI'm writing you about a project that I suspect you would not embrace immediately, but might come to embrace over time. Here's the issue: I've been pondering for several months whether I want to write a third book, and if so, what would be the right topic. Initially, I had envisioned writing a purely environmental book, about the Great Plains, but for both logistical and commercial reasons (namely, Andrew and I aren't prepared to move to North Dakota and book publishers don't care that much about the northern Plains), that's not going to happen. As a result, I've been looking for something that could combine my interest in the environment with my White House duties.\n\nTo make a long story short, I pitched a few ideas to Andrew Miller (who's at Knopf/Pantheon, and edited my shark book), and he's most interested in a book that would focus on you and the ideas you've managed to make central to the Democratic Party's agenda. In other words, it would look at how you've helped define what it means to be a progressive/liberal in the 21st century. It would also help explain how Washington works, since you've immersed yourself in so many different arenas, including the White House, agencies, campaigns and the think tank and advocacy world. Plus, it still means I get to travel to a couple of wilderness areas (though maybe not the Remote Pacific Islands, unless Obama decides to go there).\n\nAgain, I'm guessing that given your reluctance to talk about yourself, you're not going to love this idea. But I would like to know what you think, especially before I start formally pursuing it.\n\nThanks so much,\nJuliet\n\n\nJuliet Eilperin\nWhite House Bureau Chief\nWashington Post\njuliet.eilperin@washpost.com<mailto:juliet.eilperin@washpost.com>\n(O) 202-334-7774\n(C) 202-302-3663\n@eilperin\n\n"
