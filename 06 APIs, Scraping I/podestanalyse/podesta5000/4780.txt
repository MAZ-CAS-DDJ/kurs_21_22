He said he's invited HRC to walk across the Golden Gate Bridge if she comes for the U.S. Mayor's conference. I said it was my guess that security might not like it... He mentioned there were a few other walks going on during the conference too.\n\nSecond, George Marcus swears Biden is running. He said he took him on Air Force Two, and he's getting emails. This is probably just George seeking cover for not getting on board with HRC. But it seemed so odd - especially after the tragic loss of Joe's son - that George would even say it. But he was adamant. \n\nAll best,\n\nEleni \n\nAmbassador Eleni T.
