When you\nweren't around to jump on the phone he got on the line and delivered this\nmessage to me to give to you:\n\nHe would like to give a huge thank you to YOU and HRC for the $30 billion\ndollar aid plan to ensure that coal miners and their families get the\nbenefits they\xe2\x80\x99ve earned and respect they deserve. He said it shows a great\nsensitivity for these issues that no other politician in this country is\nshowing right now.\n\nIf you'd like to follow up with him he's happy to talk. If not, he's happy\njust knowing you received this message.\n\nNikki sent over our coal communities package to his office yesterday.\n\nOffice number: (202) 637-5238\n\nThanks,\nMilia\n\n-- \nMilia Fisher\nSpecial Assistant to the Chair\nHillary for America\nmfisher@hillaryclinton.com\nc: 858.395.1741\n"
