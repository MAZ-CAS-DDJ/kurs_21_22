john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John,\n\nWith last week\'s ruling in Citizens United v. FEC, the Supreme Court overturned virtually all restrictions on campaign spending by corporations.  They can now buy as much TV time as they want to influence our elections.  It\'s a troubling assault on the core value of our democracy - "one person, one vote." \n\nElections must be decided by the American people, not by the corporate special interests with the deepest pockets.  This decision tilts the playing field way too far away from everyday people and toward big corporations.\n\nWe cannot let this decision be the last word.  Our vibrant democracy depends on it.\n\nI need your help to show Congress the tremendous grassroots opposition to this disastrous change.  Stand with me to tell my colleagues that we must act.  We need new measures that put strong limits on the amount of corporate cash affecting our elections.\n\nPlease click here to help protect our democracy from corporate greed.  I\'m working with my colleagues to address the Supreme Court ruling and I need you to stand with me.\nhttp://www.democratsenators.org/o/44/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=39\n\nThe Supreme Court\'s actions are as radical as they are dangerous.  In one fell swoop, a narrow majority of five justices reversed decades of congressional legislation and well-established legal precedent.\n\nI\'m most worried that, just as both parties were reducing corporate influence through an increase in small online donations, this decision gives more and more power to the privileged few.\n\nThat\'s not how America is supposed to work, and I pledge to do everything I can to stop it.  Stand with me today.\n\nJoin me in opposition to this troubling Supreme Court decision.  Together, we can defend our democracy from corporate greed.\nhttp://www.democratsenators.org/o/44/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=39\n\nThe powerful special interests are chomping at the bit for the opportunity to pour millions into our elections.\n\nOrganizing a powerful grassroots movement to change the rules is the only way to stop it.  Please get involved right away.\n\nSincerely,\nKirsten Gillibrand\n\n--\n\nPaid for by Gillibrand for Senate\n\nTo unsubscribe please click here\nwww.democratsenators.org/o/44/unsubscribe.jsp?Email=john.podesta@gmail.com&email_blast_KEY=12347&organization_KEY=44'
