john.podesta@gmail.comb"I had a nice long conversation with lois quam, told her everything I know.   I heard second hand about the meeting last week on my favorite topic.  Let me know if I can be of any help.  I'm here all weekend naturally, given the weather.  Last do you have any suggestions on someone who could come (perhaps from CAP) and speak broadly about the need to do voting work, not the specifics of our plan.\n\nThanks.  I had a dream last night that you were screaming at me because I had blown something with the President.  Scared me to no end.  Maybe it was the politico article. :)\n\nMolly McUsic | President\nThe Wyss Foundation\n1601 Connecticut Ave. NW, Suite 802 |  Washington, DC 20009\nPhone: 202-232-4418 Ext. 12 | Fax: 202-232-4419\nwww.wyssfoundation.org<http://www.wyssfoundation.org/>\n\n"
