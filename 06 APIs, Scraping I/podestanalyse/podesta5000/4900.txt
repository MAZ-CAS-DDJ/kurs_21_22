As a candidate, President Obama laid out a vision for this country -- and bringing our troops home from Iraq was a defining part of that vision. It was one of the reasons that all of us knocked on doors, made phone calls, and voted.\n\nKeeping that promise is important, not only for our brave women and men in uniform, but also for their loved ones, and for all Americans who have hoped and prayed for a resolution to this war.\n\nPlease take a moment to watch the President's speech if you missed it last night:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/IraqAddress2\n\nThanks,\n\nMitch Stewart\nDirector\nOrganizing for America\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for America, a project of the Democratic National Committee -- 430 South Capitol Street SE, Washington, D.C. 20003.
