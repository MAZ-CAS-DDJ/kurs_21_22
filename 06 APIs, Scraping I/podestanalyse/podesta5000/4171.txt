john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\n\nI will be in NYC Sun late aft until first thing Tues morning (along with the rest of the world, it seems).  I would like to get 15 min of your time face to face during that window - prefer not to email re my topic. Failing that, can we schedule a call over the next few days?\n\nSteve\n\n\n303-292-7957            [http://www.moyewhite.com/email/signature/alliancelogo_o.jpg]  <http://www.moyewhite.com/alliance.aspx>\n\n[http://www.moyewhite.com/email/signature/MW_Logo_email.jpg]\nMoye White LLP Attorneys at Law\n16 Market Square 6th Floor 1400 16th Street Denver CO 80202-1486\ntel 303 292 2900 fax 303 292 4510 www.moyewhite.com <http://www.moyewhite.com>\n<http://www.moyewhite.com>\n__ > Profile <http://www.moyewhite.com/ourattorneys/>   __ > Download vCard <http://www.moyewhite.com/vcard.aspx?ID=>\n\n'
