There was a lot of pep talk about Texas\xe2\x80\x99 native son who is in the race.\xc2\xa0\nMost of my friends know I\xe2\x80\x99m partial to the Bush family, and since there are no Bush\xe2\x80\x99s in the race now, I pretty much kept my mouth shut.\xc2\xa0\nEven so, I was elected as a delegate to the district party convention, and I will be a candidate for election to the state convention, and maybe to the national convention as well.\xc2\xa0\nWhile I don\xe2\x80\x99t particularly enjoy all the internal side-swiping and manipulation that occurs in this arena, I do feel it is important for people with disabilities to be represented at every stage of the democratic process.\xc2\xa0\nFor me, though, the most important and most interesting aspect of engagement in this process is not filling the role of a token delegate with a disability\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0\nFor me, it is the opportunity to influence a party platform.\xc2\xa0\nTonight at my precinct meeting, I put forward a \nresolution demanding that the U.S. Senate ratify the U.N.\xc2\xa0\nConvention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.\xc2\xa0\nMine was the only resolution offered at the precinct convention, and I was obliged to explain the resolution and its purpose, and to provide background information about it for my neighbors.\xc2\xa0\nI gladly did so, and afterwards the resolution was passed unanimously.\xc2\xa0\nNow, our precinct will move the resolution to the district convention and then to the state convention.\xc2\xa0\nAs the author, I will have the responsibility of presenting the resolution at each level, and I do not expect any opposition to it until it reaches the national convention.\xc2\xa0\nAt that point, I hope there are disability advocates, family members of people with disabilities, and other disability-friendly delegates there who will pick up the resolution and push it forward through predictable roadblocks from party leaders and\n Senators who have opposed it in the past.\xc2\xa0 \nHere\xe2\x80\x99s the thing \xe2\x80\x93 and it is something I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure everybody in the disability movement understands: In our democratic process, one small effort by an individual at a neighborhood meeting can snowball into a wave that can result in having every member of a\n party who is campaigning for elected office at the local, state and national level pledged to campaigning on a platform that is committed to ratifying our UN Convention.\xc2\xa0\nAll I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, colleagues, is if you want to foster change for the better, get your feet wet and your shoes dirty.\xc2\xa0\nLearn about the process, understand the process, and use the process to your benefit, the benefit of your colleagues and the benefit of the movement.\xc2\xa0\nFor those of you who live in states that have yet to vote in the primaries, consider going to your precinct meetings after the polls close \xe2\x80\x93 get yourselves selected to your respective parties\xe2\x80\x99 conventions, and put forward a resolution that can educate\n others and possibly interject disability issues into the mainstream of the political debate.\n\xc2\xa0#RevUp #VoteDisability.\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\nLex Frieden\n\nmailto:lfrieden@outlook.com\n\nhttp://www.lexfrieden.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Molly Broadway <mbroadway@disabilityrightstx.org>\n\nSent: Tuesday, March 1, 2016 6:23 PM\n\nTo: Kate Garrison; Esperanza; Bob Kafka; Danny Saenz; Danny Shortlidge; David Wittie; Doug Geib; Elyse Fulton; John Meinkowski; Kelle Martin; Nelson Peet; Regina Blue; Sandra Bitter; Tanya Winters; Shae Butts (shae.butts@dads.state.tx.us); Andrea Parton;\n David Christian Swallow; Krissi Perryman; Matt Bloodsworth; Rick Razo; Sharon Hardaway\n\nSubject: Voter Hotline\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\nJust a friendly reminder that the DRTx\xc2\xa0 Voter Hotline will be open until 7 pm this evening.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you are having problems at the voting polls, you can still call this evening.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We answer calls statewide.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n1-888-796-8683(VOTE)\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nMolly Broadway, LMSW\n\nTraining and Technical Specialist for Voting Rights\n\nDisability Rights Texas | 2222 W.
