I will also be asking Randi\n> Weingarten to call Hite in the next day or two.  She can help here.\n>\n> IUPAT:  They have conducted their internal poll, HRC is on top.  They are\n> ready to go.  The President asked me today if HRC will visit a training\n> facility.  I think this would be very helpful.  They would love to do an\n> endorsement at a facility.  Is there anyway to find a date/time to do\n> this?  They can be flexible on location.\n>\n> Operating Engineers:  They are another union impacted by the KXL\n> decision.  Callahan is from NY and wants to be there and is motivated to\n> endorse.  He has requested a 30 minute conversation with his Executive\n> Board and HRC.  We do that, they will endorse.  I have flagged this for\n> Heather as a scheduling request already.\n>\n> Ironworkers:  They will endorse in October.  Eric Dean will be pushing it\n> with his board.  They are impacted by KXL as well.  More details on\n> infrastructure roll out and policy will assist here and keep things on\n> track.\n>\n> SMART;  Sellers is in a good place.  I need to follow up with staff.\n> Sanders came to their Convention (no idea why they invited him), which got\n> some members fired up.  They will be on board, just need to push.  Mike\n> will help me with this.\n>\n> Insulators Union/Roofers Union/Elevators Union:  Each of these three\n> unions are small but will keep working with Mike to push.  Again,\n> infrastructure plans and details will help here.\n>\n> OPCMIA-Good place.  I just need to follow up.\n>\n> BAC-Done.
