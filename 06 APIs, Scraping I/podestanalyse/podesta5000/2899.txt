More than 4000 troops were overcharged for their mortgages by JP Morgan Chase, while 14 more were foreclosed on improperly.  Under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA), active-duty troops generally get their mortgage interest rates lowered to 6 percent and are protected from foreclosure. JP Morgan Chase had been charging troops interest rates of over 9 and 10 percent.\n\nThis cannot go without investigation. We need you to co-sign our letter to the Chairs and Ranking Members of the relevant committees in the House and Senate.\n\n*CO-SIGN OUR LETTER TO THE HILL, CALLING FOR INVESTIGATIONS, NOW!* [ http://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/6676/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=5226 ]\n\nWhile JP Morgan Chase admitted their fault, and will be reimbursing those troops overcharged and foreclosed on, we must know how this was allowed to happen. More importantly, we need to know if this is happening at other banks, as well. NBC News was only alerted to the story when a Marine chose to bring a lawsuit against JP Morgan Chase.\n\nTroops are risking their lives for America, and the law protects them from this kind of nonsense while they are in harm's way. That the law was violated by JP Morgan Chase, and not caught until they were sued over it demands an investigation. We simply don't know if JP Morgan Chase is the only bank to violate the law. How many other banks could be getting away with the same thing? We need to know, and take care of the troops who may have been harmed.\n*\nJOIN US IN DEMANDING INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE BANKS ON TROOP MORTGAGES [ http://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/6676/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=5226 ]*\n\nThis is not a partisan issue, or an ideological issue. This is an issue as to whether the law is being followed, and our troops are afforded the protection of the law. They're fighting for us. Let's fight for them.\n\nSincerely,\nAshwin Madia\nIraq War Veteran \nChairman, VoteVets.org \n\n\nPaid for by VoteVets.org Action Fund\n\nUnsubscribe Here: https://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/6676/unsubscribe.jsp?Email=john.podesta@gmail.com&email_blast_KEY=1150816&organization_KEY=6676"
