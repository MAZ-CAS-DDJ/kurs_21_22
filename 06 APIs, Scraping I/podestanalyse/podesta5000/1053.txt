john.podesta@gmail.comb"Petition: Demand Congress brings our voting machines into the 21st Century >>\n\nRemember how the 2000 election was decided? Florida, hanging chads, Jeb Bush trying to help his brother.\n\nIn response to this embarrassment, many states made sincere efforts to modernize their voting infrastructure so that Florida's 2000 calamity would not reoccur. Unfortunately, these efforts mostly fell short.\n\nTell Congress to make sure our voting infrastructure can handle the 2016 elections:\n\nSIGN YOUR NAME >>\n\nhttp://go.turnoutpac.org/voting-systems\n\n\n\nJohn --\n\nOur voting infrastructure is little better than it was in 2000 (and may even be worse).\n\nVoting systems in 28 states were not certified by the federal Election Assistance Commission because they predate standards. 43 states use systems that are no longer even manufactured. To make matters worse, these aging machines are susceptible to freezes and crashes.\n\nThis is unacceptable. We need modern, reliable machines with paper backups in case the technology malfunctions.\n\nDemand Congress enacts legislation to bring our voting systems into the 21st Century:\n\nhttp://go.turnoutpac.org/voting-systems\n\nThanks,\n\nThe Progressive Turnout Project----\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.\n\nTo unsubscribe, go to: \n  http://go.turnoutpac.org/unsubscribe\n\nPaid for by Progressive Turnout Project and not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.\n\n"
