john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John,\n\nPlease accept my thanks for all your support so far this year. In the heat of legislative and electoral work, sometimes we don\'t say "thank you" enough.\n\nAs a member of LCV\'s online community, you know that we have fought long and hard to win comprehensive energy and climate legislation that curbs global warming pollution, rebuilds the economy, and reduces our dangerous addiction to oil. President Obama is with us, the public is with us, and one year ago the U.S. House passed a bill. But now, the fate of comprehensive legislation rests in the hands of a few wavering senators. As part of our efforts, we have partnered with the Sierra Club, the Service Employees International Union, and VoteVets.org Action Fund to launch an $11 million multi-media campaign to help ensure that the U.S. Senate takes decisive action on comprehensive energy and climate legislation this summer.\n\nWe likely have only one month to convince the Senate to pass strong climate and energy legislation this year. Once Congress starts its August recess, all bets are off. And it is very likely that passing a strong bill in the next Congress will be much more difficult.\n\nThe recent defeat of the Murkowski "Big Oil Bailout" resolution shows that votes against keeping America addicted to oil can be won. On June 10, the U.S. Senate rejected, by a vote of 53-47, this resolution that would have gutted the Clean Air Act, put public health at risk, and jeopardized long-overdue action to hold the biggest polluters accountable. Your financial support helped LCV run a major campaign to defeat this bailout for Big Oil,\nincluding:\n\n*  Mobilizing citizens to make thousands of phone calls to key swing senators.\n*  Organizing our largest-ever lobby day on Capitol Hill, which brought representatives from more than 20 state LCVs to meetings with over 100 members of Congress and their staff. \n*  Partnering with allied groups to run radio ads targeting key swing senators and print ads in influential Capitol Hill newspapers in the days leading up to the vote.\n\nOn the electoral side, the 2010 midterm elections are only four months away -- and clearly the stakes could not be higher. Some of our strongest  pro-environment leaders, like Senator Barbara Boxer, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senator Patty Murray and others are in the fight of their political lives.\n\nThere are 16 key races we have our eye on in the Senate alone. In Missouri and New Hampshire, we\'ve already started contacting voters door-to-door\nand organizing an extensive volunteer base, and our political team has already identified six key races in which to embed campaign staff.\n\nWe\'re already talking to voters at the door, making phone calls, holding\none-on-one conversations, doing paid ads, and connecting with swing\nvoters. We are gearing up to defeat some of Big Oil\'s best friends, like Dirty Dozen members Rep. Roy Blunt, who is making a run for the U.S. Senate, and Rep. Michele Bachmann. \n\nFinally, I\'d like to briefly update you on our state LCV partners. I am pleased to tell you that a group of environmental leaders in New Jersey has launched the newest state LCV. They recently held a press conference in Trenton with their new board and are actively searching for an Executive Director. State LCVs also recently celebrated key primary election victories in state races in North Carolina, Idaho, and Oregon. Our partnership with our more than 30 state LCVs is what makes us unique and gives our greatest strength.\n\nThis is just a portion of the work that your generous donations support. We still have much more work ahead of us this year - so please, consider making a contribution today that will help sustain our campaigns to bring us closer to the clean energy future that our country - and our planet -needs.\n\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=4Y_l2iilpwgwoAJ60Zt36Q..\n\nThank you for standing with LCV.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGene Karpinski\nPresident\nLeague of Conservation Voters\n\nPS: Two weeks ago, LCV celebrated our 40th anniversary with a sold out dinner at Union Station in Washington, DC. Your ongoing support has helped us reach 40 years of legislative and political victories. I look forward to your support for another 40 years.\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here:\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=5qrIor2Kk4nMfESds8JybtpvQ31NkRfz&cid=0\n\n'
