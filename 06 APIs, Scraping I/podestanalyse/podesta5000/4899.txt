john.podesta@gmail.comb'Rep. Cummings just released a very strong letter he wrote to Chairman Gowdy\ncalling for the release of the Sidney Blumenthal transcript.\n\nRep. Cummings says that the transcript directly contradicts what Chairman\nGowdy said on Face the Nation on Sunday.  On Face the Nation, Chairman\nGowdy said he has "zero interest" in the Clinton Foundation.  Rep. Cummings\nsays that the deposition transcript shows that Chairman Gowdy personally\nasked Blumenthal about the Clinton Foundation and then directed his staff\nto ask 50 questions on the subject.\n\nHere\'s a quote from the letter: "it is incredibly unfair to the American\npeople to make claims on national television that are completely erroneous\nand then refuse to release the evidence that clearly demonstrates their\ninaccuracy."\n\nHere\'s the link:\nhttp://democrats.benghazi.house.gov/sites/democrats.benghazi.house.gov/files/documents/2015_10_20_EEC_to_TG_re_Blumenthal.pdf\n'
