He is someone who is ready from day-one to help move our community and all of Los Angeles forward. Today, as the City of Los Angeles celebrates Filipino-American History Month, we are proud to join with more than 60 Filipino-American community leaders in endorsing Eric Garcetti for Mayor, including:\n\n- Bernardo Bernardo -\xc2\xa0Artist&Activist\n- Rob Bonta - Vice Mayor, Alameda\n- Jilly Canizares -\xc2\xa0Executive Director, Fil-Am Arts\n- Vicente Ching -\xc2\xa0Past President, HIFI Rotary Club\n- Johneric\xc2\xa0Concordia -\xc2\xa0Owner, Park's Finest Restaurant\n- Melany De La Cruz-Viesca -\xc2\xa0Human Relations Commissioner, LA City\n- Pilar Diaz -\xc2\xa0Organizing Committee Member, Asian American Pacific Islanders in Philanthropy-LA\n- Arturo Garcia -\xc2\xa0National Coordinator, Justice for Filipino-American Veterans\n- Guila Miramba -\xc2\xa0Project Coordinator, Ayala Foundation-USA\n- Olympia Resol -\xc2\xa0Board Member, Philippine Nurses Association of Southern California\n- Carmen Salindong -\xc2\xa0Owner, LA Maison du Pain\n- Aquilina Soriano -\xc2\xa0Executive Director, Pilipino Workers Center\n- Casimiro Tolentino -\xc2\xa0Vice President, Board of Fire Commissioners\nTo see the complete list, click here <http://www.ericgarcetti.com/filam>.p. Eric designated the Historic Filipinotown neighborhood and has invested in the quality of life with new sidewalks, parks, and programs to clean graffiti. He played a key role in building the nation's first memorial to Filipino veterans who fought under General MacArthur in World War II - veterans who served alongside Eric's grandfather when he was in the Pacific Theater. Eric also led the City Council in taking a stand to push for Sen. Daniel Inouye's Filipino Veterans Equity Act.\n\nBut the Filipino-American community isn't just supporting Eric because of our friendship. We know Eric will create jobs and bring new ideas to City Hall so that Los Angeles realizes its full potential.\xc2\xa0\n\nOur families came to Los Angeles - like Eric's - because they knew this was a place of opportunity and greatness. We want Los Angeles to capture that spirit again, and we know Eric has the creative solutions and commitment to make that possible.\n\nMabuhay.\n\nProsy De la Cruz\nFormer Commissioner,\xc2\xa0L.A.
