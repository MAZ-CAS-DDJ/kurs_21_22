(Please let me know if you would prefer to complete the process\noffline, and I will email you a Word version of the form, which you can\neither print out and complete by hand or type your responses into directly.)\n\nPlease log on and begin completing these forms as soon as you\xb9re able \x8b for\nanyone who hasn\xb9t done this before, it\xb9s a surprisingly time-consuming\nprocess.  Your e-QIP forms must be completed, with hard copies sent to our\noffice as described below, by Tuesday, October 14, 2008.\n\nPlease supply answers to all questions going back fifteen years.  (The\ninstructions on the forms will tell you that you only need to go back either\nseven or ten years, but disregard that.  The FBI insists that it needs full\ninformation going back fifteen years.)  Further instructions are attached to\nthis email in a document titled \xb3SF-86 instructions.\xb2  Please review these\ninstructions in addition to those on e-QIP.\n\nIn addition to answering all of the questions in the e-QIP system, we\xb9ll\nneed you to complete the two additional forms attached to this email:  a\ncredit release form and a general consent form authorizing the FBI to share\nwith the campaign any information it uncovers during its investigation (the\n\xb3OPC-D\xb2 form).  \n\nDon\xb9t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions at all.  I will be in\ntouch with each of you separately to arrange for fingerprinting, and to\ndiscuss with you the initial briefing process that will occur after your\ninterim clearance has been granted.\n\nMany thanks.  \n\ne-QIP Instructions\n\nGo to:  www.opm.gov/e-qip/.\n\nClick the button button labeled \xb3Enter e-QIP Applicant Site.\xb2\n\nA \xb3browser checker\xb2 will automatically test your computer for e-QIP\ncompatibility.
