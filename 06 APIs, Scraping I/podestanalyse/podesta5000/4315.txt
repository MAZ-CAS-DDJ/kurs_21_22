john.podesta@gmail.comb'Robby has asked for a call with the following participants in place of the 8:00am call tomorrow morning that was pulled down. However, he will be in flight at 8:00am and would need to do it a bit later in the morning. Is there a time after 10:30am EDT that might work? Please let me know and I will check with Marc and Charlie. \n\nParticipants \nCharlie Baker\nMarc Elias\nCheryl Mills \nRobby Mook\nJohn Podesta\n\n\n'
