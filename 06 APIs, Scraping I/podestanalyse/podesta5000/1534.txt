john.podesta@gmail.comb'FYI in case you missed you shout out yesterday on cspan.  A little garbled but I ducked.\n\nSubject: RE: Cspan\n\nHere\x92s a transcription of that exchange -\n\nHost: Let me ask you about a couple of headlines, this is from the Washington Post it\x92s environmental groups questioning the president\x92s commitment to climate change saying he needs to be more aggressive on some of these issues and there\x92s this from John Podesta who is questioning why environmentalists would challenge the president energy strategy. He was brought on board earlier this year he is the former head of the Center for American Progress. What\x92s your take on his role and what he represents?\n\nGene: Well, you know John\x92s a longtime dear friend of mine we went to school down the street at Georgetown law school together. He\x92s a great addition to the administration he cares deeply and passionately about the climate change issue and a whole host of issues that he worked on at the Center for American Progress. And most importantly he knows how to work, probably better than anyone in this town, he knows how to work the levers of the executive branch going back to when he was Chief of Staff for President Clinton, to get the job done cause as we saw President Obama say and again he made some very strong remarks on climate change in the State of the Union address and we appreciate that and we applaud it. But he made clear that getting, solutions through this Congress on climate change or on many other issues, is very very very difficult, therefore let\x92s use the existing authority that the Environmental Protection Agency has with the clean air act, the Interior Department has to set up new monuments, the Department of Energy has to set up new standards. Use the leverage the government that Congress gave to the EPA and to the Interior Department and the Energy Department to make progress, and John is the perfect person, to be in the White House at this point who understands how to use executive branch to do the job it\x92s supposed to do to make progress on issues that he cares about and he cares deeply about the climate change issue he knows it well he studied it, and he\x92s a great addition to the White House staff.\n\nHost: Okay well let me follow up though on this because in the letter he said with reference with environmental groups the president has been leading the transition to low carbon energy sources and understands the need to consider a balanced approach, to the all forms of energy development including oil and gas production. Clearly he would have written this letter if he didn\x92t think he was getting pressure from your organization and others. Are you putting pressure on him?\n\nGene: Well I think what the letter signaled is that, there\x92s some key questions outstanding one of which we discussed two of which we\x92ve already discussed. The issue of the pipeline, the Keystone pipeline, the issue of what are we going to do about natural gas and they specifically reference in the letter saying\x85and we agree John with the president in particular, we\x92ve made a lot of progress. But we\x92re flagging this concern that we can\x92t\x85and we need to continue to make progress as we make that progress we can\x92t take some big steps backwards so it\x92s just, there\x92s nothing in the letter frankly that we haven\x92t already said in other ways before. But it just sharpens some big decisions, in front of us and we wanted to make sure it was clearly out there that, while president has we agree with everything John\x92s said in his letter, while the president has made major progress on cutting pollution from automobiles. The EPA\x92s in the middle of a historic effort to cut carbon pollution from power plants, that\x92s hugely important. So those are big steps forward but let\x92s make sure we don\x92t take big steps backwards at the same time, and things like the pipeline, the Keystone pipeline are examples of that.\n\nHost: So let me follow up one other point this is from Politico how John Podesta is changing Obama\x92s White House from your standpoint on environmental issues. Give me one example, one executive order that you want John Podesta to give to the president to have him sign.\n\nGene: Well it\x92s not an executive order but it\x92s an agency action. And here\x92s the most important piece, the EPA is in the middle of the process, deciding to cut carbon pollution right now from new plants. And on June 1st the president in his great climate action plan that he announced last June June 25th, said EPA you have on June 1st, announce a plan to cut carbon pollution from existing power plants. That\x92s the single biggest step this administration can take, in its second term, to make major impact. And John is in the middle and we\x92ll be in the middle of that conversation, with EPA with other agencies so that on June 1st when they announce the new proposal, that will be a hugely important signal of the right direction to take in terms of cutting. That\x92s the single biggest piece, that can happen.\n'
