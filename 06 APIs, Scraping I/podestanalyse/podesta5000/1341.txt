Current title is deputy director of digital engagement (I\nbelieve) at the WH. Would like him for director of social media on the\ncampaign. Great guy for whom this would be a big step up in his career \xe2\x80\x93\nlet me know if you are able to put in the request. Obviously, if this isn\'t\ndoable or would create drama with Denis, don\'t worry about it.\n'
