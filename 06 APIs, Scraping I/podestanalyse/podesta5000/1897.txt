john.podesta@gmail.comb"John,\n\nI was planning to check in with you for a general chat and advice session at some point this summer, depending on your timing.   As you may have heard, I departed USAID back in early April and have been getting Quorum (my old consulting practice) back up and running, and putting together a seminar to teach at Dartmouth in the fall, and I've been enjoying the different pace.  But I just got a call this afternoon about something back inside and I could use your thoughts on whether/how seriously I should consider it.  I told them I'd get back to them w/n a couple days on it.  Are you by any chance available for a meeting or phone call tomorrow or Wed to talk with me about it?\n\nThanks much\nMara"
