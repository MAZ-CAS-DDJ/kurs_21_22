I think you said her organizer here is Chuck Quintero? In any\ncase, if you have a quick second to send an introduction, or at least pass\nalong his contact info, that would be great.\n\nHope all's well... Any plans to join POTUS on the Vineyard? Get his ass on\na fishing boat and take some pictures!\n\nBest,\nMike\n"
