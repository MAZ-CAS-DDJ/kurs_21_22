john.podesta@gmail.comb'Anna is right about Social Security and S-CHIP.  Those are, I suspect,\neasy fixes.\n \n...but The Hug is the point.  It needs to be the iconic image, burned\ninto people\'s consciousness.  It\'s Dukakis in the tank.  If we could get\nit in three times I\'d be for it.  The Hug not only links McCain to Bush,\nit feminizes him.  He looks like a smaller, weaker dog exposing his neck\nto the alpha male.  And it will drive McCain batshit.    I\'m for all\nhugs, all the time.\n \nBegala\n \n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: Anna Greenberg [mailto:agreenberg@gqrr.com] \nSent: Monday, February 04, 2008 9:24 AM\nTo: Andrew Baumann; Begala, Paul; tom@zzranch.com; Stan Greenberg;\nzschwartz@shangrila.us; John Podesta; tara@campaigntodefendamerica.org;\nsusan\nCc: Rebecca Buckwalter-Poza; Lori Lodes; Kristi Fuksa; Dave Walker\nSubject: RE: We\'ve got some ads...\n\n\n\nAgree with Paul and Andrew.  \n\n \n\nOn Happy Together, I think that the images need to be changed slightly.\nYou barely see the photo of Bush smiling from the podium, but you see\nthe hugging photo twice for a long time at the end.  It might be nice to\nend the spot with one of McCain\'s quotes about how much he admires and\nrespects George Bush.  Finally, we should go to the McCain poll for the\nevidence on linkage to Bush on the economy - the strongest economic hit\nincludes privatizing social security and opposition to schip, in\naddition to tax breaks for millionaires.  \n\n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: Andrew Baumann \nSent: Sunday, February 03, 2008 10:49 PM\nTo: Begala, Paul; tom@zzranch.com; Stan Greenberg; Anna Greenberg;\nzschwartz@shangrila.us; John Podesta; tara@campaigntodefendamerica.org;\nsusan\nCc: Rebecca Buckwalter-Poza; Lori Lodes; Kristi Fuksa; Dave Walker\nSubject: RE: We\'ve got some ads...\n\n \n\nI just have a couple of thoughts...\n\n \n\nI think "Fatigues" could be made to work with the priorities message if\nthe chyron and voiceover more explicitly linked the money spent in Iraq\nto what it hasn\'t been spent on at home.  I also think we need to update\nthe $486 billion number.  I\'m pretty sure we can get away with calling\nit a trillion dollar war at this point, or at least "almost" or "nearly"\n$1 trillion.\n\n \n\nI like the priorities spots with Rose, but I thought we had all agreed\nwith John that we should change "1000 years" to "100 years" to make the\nmessage sound more credible.  Agree with Paul that it would make sense\nto add "Iraq War Veteran."\n\n \n\nI liked "Happy Together" as well but I\'d suggest playing with the text a\nbit.  Perhaps something like:\n\n*\t"McCain supports keeping our troops in Iraq for decades... just\nlike Bush" instead of "opposing bringing our troops home... just like\nBush."  I think the proactive framing of him wanting to keep troops\nthere forever is a bit more powerful than simply opposing withdrawal.   \n*\t"They\'ve spent $1 trillion on Iraq instead of health care,\nqualities jobs and new energy sources" instead of "spent $486 billion on\nIraq instead of health care."  I think with the economy becoming more\nand more the issue, it makes sense to include an explicit reference to\njobs.  And why not also include energy to round out the big three? \n*\t"Make Bush\'s tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations\npermanent" instead of "Make the tax cuts for the wealthy permanent."  ? \n\n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: Begala, Paul [mailto:pbegala@hatcreekent.com] \nSent: Sunday, February 03, 2008 3:17 PM\nTo: tom@zzranch.com; Stan Greenberg; Anna Greenberg;\nzschwartz@shangrila.us; John Podesta; tara@campaigntodefendamerica.org;\nsusan\nCc: Rebecca Buckwalter-Poza; Lori Lodes; Andrew Baumann; Kristi Fuksa;\nDave Walker\nSubject: RE: We\'ve got some ads...\n\n \n\n"Fatigues" does not get to the misplaced priorities/economic argument\nabout Iraq.  The only takeaway is endless war.\n\n \n\n"Happy Together" is, as you know, the spot I\'ve fantasized about for two\nyears.  I love it.  It feminizes McCain and ridicules him.  Will\ngenerate buzz and perhaps piss the old sailor off.  It certainly draws\nthe link between McCain and Bush.  I think it\'s sticky and memorable.\n\n \n\nOf the ads with Rose and her baby, "Priorities" and "Priorities alt" are\nthe only ones that get to the misplaced priorities message.  The others\nsuffer from the same problem as "Fatigues":  they\'re "endless war"\nspots.  Fine for 2006, a half-step off for 2008.  But Rose is a star and\nthat baby is adorable.  I would add the phrase "Iraq War Veteran" under\nher name and National Guard status, just to drive home the point that\nshe was shipped out to Iraq; she\'s not "just" a mom.  \n\n \n\nThose are my two cents.\n\n \n\nBegala\n\n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: tmatzzie@gmail.com [mailto:tmatzzie@gmail.com] On Behalf Of Tom\nMatzzie\nSent: Sunday, February 03, 2008 1:48 PM\nTo: Stan Greenberg; Anna Greenberg; zschwartz@shangrila.us; John\nPodesta; Begala, Paul; tara@campaigntodefendamerica.org; susan\nCc: Rebecca Buckwalter-Poza; Lori Lodes; Andrew Baumann; Kristi Fuksa;\nDave Walker\nSubject: We\'ve got some ads...\n\nHere is the status. We\'ve got some rough cuts of ads and some ads still\ncoming in. Overall I\'m happy but not ecstatic about what we\'ve got.\nThey\'re good ads. We just don\'t have a good mix yet. No straight economy\nspots yet, for example. We are expecting "dating," "mcsame" and a\nvotevets-paid-for ad called "target" later today. Next push is for\neconomy spots. They might not be for this week.\n\nPlease review and send me feedback.
