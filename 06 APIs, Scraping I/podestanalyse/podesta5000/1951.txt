So, yes, Susan, your idea of a Seniors United is\nan excellent one.\n \n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: Susan McCue [mailto:Susan.McCue@one.org] \nSent: Monday, January 07, 2008 3:38 PM\nTo: Andrew Baumann; ic2008; Ana Iparraguirre; Bryan Fisher; John\nPodesta; Kristi Fuksa; Begala, Paul; Stan Greenberg; Tara McGuinness;\nTom Matzzie\nSubject: RE: Obaam among seniors\n\n\n\nTara and I talked today about starting a seniors surrogate group.

As noted, he does more\npoorly among this around in all 3 match-ups, especially against\nGiuliani.  We have some very good attacks among seniors for Romney, and\nour strong attacks on Huckabee are still strong among seniors.  This is\nnot the face for Giuliani as our attacks on him do not score well among\nseniors.  If Giuliani somehow ends up as the nominee, this will be a\nconcern.\n\n \n\n \n\nGiuliani:\n\n \n\nOverall:  49-42 (initial) to 45-40 (final).  Shift of -2.\n\nSeniors:  35-52 (initial) to 27-49 (final).  Shift of -5\n\n\nObama does very poorly against Giuliani among seniors and he continues\nto lose ground through the debate.  This is partially due to the lack of\neffectiveness of our attacks among this group.\n\n \n\nPushing Kerik as DHS secretary pops a bit among this group in the list\nof negative facts, toping the list along with Rudy covering up the\nexpenses of his Hamptons affair.  In the doubt battery none of our\nattacks score as well among seniors as they did overall.  The top attack\nis on Giuliani\'s ethics, but it only scores a 26% very serious, 54%\ntotal serious score.  Attacks tying him to Bush are second, scoring 26%\nvery serious, 51% total serious.  Again, slightly worse than among the\noverall population.\n\n \n\nRomney:\n\n \n\nOverall: 48-39 (initial) to 46-39 (final).  No real shift.\n\nSeniors: 38-45 (initial) to 35-39 (final).  Shift of +3.\n\n \n\nSo the situation is not as dire against Romney and Obama actually\nimproves among seniors against him.  This is probably because our\nattacks on Romney resonate strongly with seniors.  In fact, when we read\nthem the list of negative facts 15% of seniors select "all" of them.  \n\n \n\nTying Romney to Bush on Iraq is the top choice among this group.  41%\nsay this raises very serious doubt with a total of 58% saying it raises\nserious doubts.  This is higher than among the overall population.\nRomney being out of touch on economic issues also scores well among\nseniors with 39% saying it raises very serious doubts and a total of 69%\nsaying it raises serious doubts.  In the follow up question Bush and\nIraq popped and was the clear choice with 22% citing this choice.\n\n \n\nHuckabee:\n\n \n\nOverall: 47-42 (initial) to 45-39 (final).  Shift of +1.\n\nSeniors: 39-44 (initial) to 32-40 (final).  Shift of -3.\n\n \n\nThe Huckabee attacks perform at about the same rate among seniors that\nthey do among the overall population.  In the list of negative facts his\nabortion extremism is the top choice.  On the doubts, ethics/judgment\n(which includes the rapist) is tops at 39 percent very serious, 70\npercent total serious - about the same as the overall population.  His\nextremism is next at 37% very serious, 61% total serious.  Again, about\nthe same as the overall population).\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAndrew Baumann\n\nAnalyst\n\n \n\n10 G Street NE, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20002\n\nPhone: 202 478 8300 / Fax: 202 478 8301\n\n \n\nabaumann@gqrr.com <mailto:abaumann@gqrr.com>  \n\nwww.greenbergresearch.com <http://www.greenbergresearch.com> \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n'
