It's a reminder that while progress never comes easy, if we keep working, keep pushing, and never, ever give up, anything is possible.  \n\nAdd your name if you agree that access to health care is a basic human right:\n\n http://links.hillaryclinton.com/ctt?kn=8&ms=MjI5MTkxODQS1&r=MTExODA4Mjg2NjExS0&b=2&j=NTgyNDcwMTI1S0&mt=1&rt=0 \n\nDespite two clear rulings by the highest court in the land, Republicans running for president still want to take basic health security away from millions of Americans. \n\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re in lockstep with allies in Congress who have voted more than 50 times to repeal or dismantle the Affordable Care Act without proposing a single viable alternative.  \n\nThe next president will either protect and expand health care for every American, or undo the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.\n\nIf you believe we need to keep fighting, join me:\n\n http://links.hillaryclinton.com/ctt?kn=3&ms=MjI5MTkxODQS1&r=MTExODA4Mjg2NjExS0&b=2&j=NTgyNDcwMTI1S0&mt=1&rt=0 \n\nHealth care reform was a hard-fought battle -- congratulations to everyone who played a part in this win.\n\nThank you,\n\nHillary\n \n\n\n\n*************** \n\nPAID FOR BY HILLARY FOR AMERICA\n\nContributions or gifts to Hillary for America are not tax deductible.\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.
