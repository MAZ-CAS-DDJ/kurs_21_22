If\nthe cloture vote is successful, then Dr. Califf's nomination only\nneeds a simple majority - over 50 yes votes - to pass, so each vote is crucial.\n\nhttp://getinvolved.pogo.org/site/R?i=xeTe6Qs8iU6EXF2dq-NUoQ\n\nTell your Senators: Vote against Califf's Nomination:\n\nhttp://getinvolved.pogo.org/site/R?i=s73zFVF8c_BQUITuvofOaQ\n\nPlease tell your Senators that the American people deserve an FDA\nCommissioner who has both the expertise and independence from the drug\nindustry to protect public health and safety.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDanielle Brian\nExecutive Director\n\n\n\n*************\nUnsubscribe: http://getinvolved.pogo.org/site/CO?i=KMYKisDO21lBGxm8vIYJMx212mll31ZA&cid=0\n\x00"
