We obviously just learned that Lincoln Chafee has opened an exploratory account, so we will tweet the following from me:\n\nDWS TW\n\nLincoln Chafee has done great things for Rhode Island. I\'m excited to hear his thoughts for the country as he considers a bid for president.\n\nJust wanted to give you a heads up. Glad we had a chance to meet today. Look forward to working together going forward.\n\nDWS\n'
