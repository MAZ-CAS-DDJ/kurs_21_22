Just looked at the numbers and since I emailed last night, two hundred and sixteen people have chipped in to stop Speaker Boehner and former Congresswoman Hayworth from carrying through on their nightmare Tea Party agenda. TAKE THAT, BOEHNER.\n\nOur volunteers are out right now talking to voters (beautiful day for it) - but to back them up and win we've got to increase our resources - we're shooting for an even 300 donors in 36 hours. Can you chip in $250 right now to ensure we win? It'll take less time than ordering a cup of coffee, promise.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20140808-ld&amp;amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\nTHANK YOU. I'm counting on you to lead us to victory.\n\nSean\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.\nTo unsubscribe from the Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress email list, please click here: http://action.seanmaloney.com/unsubscribe\n\n\nPAID FOR BY SEAN PATRICK MALONEY FOR CONGRESS\n\n\n"
