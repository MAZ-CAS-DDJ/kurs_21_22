john.podesta@gmail.comb'Main Topics: Saddleback Forum, Georgia, Veterans\n\n\n*Summary of Shift: *The revelation that McCain was not in the so-called\n\'cone of silence,\' a room promised by Pastor Rick Warren to shield the\ncandidates from hearing their opponent\'s questions and answers during the\nforum Saturday, ruled the political coverage today. McCain campaign manager\nRick Davis attempted to use the controversy as fodder to attack NBC, saying\nthe network is "abandoning non-partisan coverage of the presidential race."\nWhile Davis made the charge because Andrea Mitchell mentioned the Obama\ncamp\'s concerns relating to this issue Sunday, most networks today covered\nthe story on its merits of McCain possibly cheating, rather than whether NBC\nis biased. The Georgia-Russia conflict continues to be in the news, with\nsome coverage of McCain\'s pro-Georgia remarks in Florida this morning. The\nreporting on the announcement of Pakistan President Musharraf\'s upcoming\nresignation has not yet included commentary on McCain\'s outspoken support\nfor the leader. As the nominating conventions near, there is increasing\nrunning mate speculation on every network     Non-political news is centered\non the tropical storm hitting Florida. Other stories include the daily\nMichael Phelps puff piece, a flying car invention, a dam collapsing in\nArizona, and a baby bear being rescued in California.\n\n*Highlights: *\nCone of Silence Controversy\n1.FNC: Fox Pundits dismiss accusations of McCain\'s knowledge of questions\nGeorgia Russia conflict\n2.

CNN: LOU DOBBS: Even though this was an evangelical forum, that\nMcCain\'s appeal was broader than that as a result of that forum?\nTONY PERKINS: I would say that\'s true\n\n*Clips:*\n*Highlight #1*\n*Bob Barr Attacks McCain\'s Georgia Policy As \'Simplistic\', Like Bush* (FNC\n08/18/08 4:30pm)\n\nNEIL CAVUTO: So you find Senator McCain\'s approach to this bad, why?\n\nBOB BARR: Well it\'s very simplistic. Either that or he really doesn\'t have a\nfirm grasp on the geopolitics and ethnic and demographic problems in that\npart of the world. He seems to feel similar to what George Bush felt a\nnumber of years ago, that Putin could be trusted because he had looked into\nhis eyes and saw a man he could trust. S*enator McCain seems to be falling\ninto that same simplistic mode if you meet somebody and know them, they\'re\ntrustworthy and we\'re their friend and you need to support them.* We\'re not\nall Georgians simply because there is a very serious problem and we ought to\nbe concerned about and we ought to be monitoring very carefully between\nRussia and Georgia does not be any stretch of the imagination mean that we\nought to becoming involved and that clearly seems to be direction that both\nthis administration and Senator McCain are going.

Is that accurate?\n\nRALPH REED: No, not true. I\'m in Washington \x96 had meetings that had been\nscheduled for quite some time. I\'m strongly supporting Senator McCain, proud\nto do so for his record for lower taxes, stronger families, and a 26 prolife\nvoting record in Congress.\n\nHILL: Okay let\'s go off that. Dee Dee I want to ask you, why does it,\naccording to the latest Pew poll that I took a look at, say that John McCain\nis having such a tough time getting women to say they\'ll vote for him.\n\nDEE DEE MYERS: He is having a tough time getting women to say they\'ll vote\nfor him, and I think he\'ll have a tough time getting them to actually vote\nfor him come November. Because he\'s simply-two reasons, *he\'s wrong on a lot\nof issues that women care about, from the issue of choice, to issues like\nthe environment, to healthcare*- he doesn\'t have a health care plan that\nseems to really address women\'s health care concerns and I think that as\nwomen are watching these two candidates, *Senator McCain becomes really\nanimated and most alive when he\'s talking about military policy, things like\nthat.* It\'s not that that\'s the only thing that he maybe- have a plan for,\nbut he only seems to really care about foreign policy, military policy. It\'s\nnot that women don\'t care about those things, but they don\'t see that same\npassion when he\'s talking about what he\'s going to do to improve the\neconomy. I think a lot  of women feel that they\'re on the edge as the\neconomy is sort of bordering on recession.

They didn\'t strike them that things can go on they have to pretend\nthat some how McCain must have cheated to have won and I think that says\nsomething perhaps about the Obama campaign\'s excessive regard for their man\nand their disdain for Senator McCain. McCain won the evening, but look if\nthey want to say that this is because McCain somehow got access to these\nquestions, as if that would have mattered any way, not that he did\napparently, McCain should say tomorrow fine let\'s do it again. I\'m serious\nhe should say let\'s have another forum the next day. We can have it on the\nsame topic, we can have it on Georgia and Russia, we can have it on Iraq,\nand you know what? I\'ll go first. I\'ll go first so Senator Obama can see the\nquestions and the answers. I think the Obama campaign has set itself up for\nlooking like whiners and I hope Senator McCain challenges Obama to have\nanother forum tomorrow.\n\n[\x85]\n\nJEFF BIRNBAUM: [\x85] Just in quick defense of Andrea Mitchell for just one\nquick second, she didn\'t say, she did not, she was not \x96 *did not report\nthat McCain was not in the cone of silence. *\n\nBRET BAIER: No but the Obama people were-\n\nBIRNBAUM: So she, the attack by the McCain campaign on NBC I think had\nsomething to do with something else. Maybe some problems they\'ve been having\nor an eagerness to call attention to this particular forum that McCain\nclearly won [\x85]\n <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g6ymXaWuTc>\n\n*Highlight #4*\n*Schuster Slams McCain\'s Bear DNA Line (MSNBC 08/18/08 7:05pm)*\n\nDAVID SCHUSTER:  At the Saddleback church forum on Saturday, one of John\nMcCain\'s loudest applause lines came when he slammed pork barrel spending\nand one project in particular.\n\nJOHN MCCAIN:  We spent money in ways that mortgaged our kids\' futures.  My\nfriends, *we spent three million dollars of your money to study the DNA of\nbears in Montana*.  I don\'t know if that was a paternity issue or a criminal\nissue. But the point is, it was three million of your money.  It was your\nmoney.\n\nSCHUSTER:  Your money.  That\'s a pretty good line.  The problem is, it\ndidn\'t keep John from voting in favor of the project as part of a larger\nspending bill.  Yes.  Back in 2003, McCain could have tried to block the\nproject through an amendment or other procedural means, but he didn\'t.  And\n*McCain ultimately voted for the spending bill with the bear DNA study\nfunding in tact. *\n\n\n*Highlight #5*\n*Schuster on McCain\'s Pro-War Foreign Policy Stance* (MSNBC 08/18/08 7:05pm)\n\nSCHUSTER: I want to play a sound bite that gives us a sort of roadmap as to\nthe strategic battlefield that John McCain wants right now.   It\'s about\nforeign policy and belittling Barack Obama. [\x85]\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: Behind all these claims and positions by Senator Obama lies the\nambition to be president.  What\'s less apparent is the judgment to be\ncommander and chief.  And in matters of national security, good judgment\nwill be at a premium in the term of the next president, as we were all\nreminded ten days ago by the events in the nation of Georgia.\n\nSCHUSTER: Christian, as the tensions in Russia ratchet up and go the other\nway, doesn\'t that help John McCain?\n\nCHRISTIAN FREELAND:  Absolutely.  *I think the Georgia crisis has been very,\nvery good for John McCain.*  You know, for one thing, he was right.  I think\nthe Georgia crisis shows that McCain\'s hawkish line on Russia and Putin,\nwhich is not a new thing.  He hasn\'t flip-flopped here.  He\'s been very\nconsistent- has turned out to be presient.  And I think because he had that\nview  [\x85] he was faster than anyone, including the White House off the\nmark.  So I think he\'s done well on the issue, and I think that\'s given him\nsome confidence.  [\x85]\n\n[\x85]\n\nMICHAEL CROWLY:  [\x85] *It\'s kind of amazing the gall of John McCain to be\norganizing his campaign around foreign policy judgment, when he supported\nthis war that really turned out to be a disaster and incredibly unpopular\nwith the American public. * [\x85]\n\nSCHUSTER:  And the other thing is that John McCain was certainly far out in\nthe front in terms of even President Bush when this first erupted, and there\nare also all those questions about John McCain\'s foreign policy adviser and\nthe lobbying that he has done on behalf of Georgia, and whether there\'s some\nsort of conflict in interest there.<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGl5Qj_uFrc>\n\n*Highlight #6*\n*Olbermann on McCain\'s Eagerness on Iraq* (MSNBC 08/18/08 8:13pm)\n\nKEITH OLBERMANN: At the same in the campaign the presumptive republican\npresidential nominee ripped the presumptive democratic presidential nominee,\nfor bad judgment about Iraq, the New York Times reminded the nation that\nJohn  *McCain\'s immediate response to 9/11 was to threaten Iraq and Saddam\nHussein.  Within hours of the attack, Senator McCain reciting a laundry list\nof other countries that supported terrorism, including Iraq, and a month\nlater Senator McCain warning Iraq is the first country. * By January 2002,\ntelling sailors and airman onboard the deck an aircraft carrier, \'next up,\nBaghdad\'. Yet today, Senator McCain criticizing his opponent\'s record on\nIraq, ratcheting up his rhetoric in an address to the convention of Veterans\nof Foreign Wars, criticizing Obama\'s shifting positions on the troop surge\nin Iraq.\n\nJOHN MCCAIN:  Senator Obama still can\'t quite bring himself to admit his own\nfailure in judgment.  Nor, has he been willing to hee the guidance of\nGeneral Patreus, one of the great leaders in military history, or to listen\nto our troops on the ground when they say, as they have said to me on my\ntrip to Iraq, \'let us win, just let us win\'. In short, both candidates in\nthis election pledged to end this war, and bring our troops home.  *The\ngreat difference is that I intend to win it first." *\n <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40Ujq8xQ3os>\n\n*Highlight #7*\n*Olbermann on McCain\'s Lack of Support for Veterans* (MSNBC 08/18/08 8:13pm)\n\nKEITH OLBERMANN:  Though victory in Iraq is finally in sight, you told the\nVFW today, Senator McCain, a great deal still depends on the decisions and\ngood judgment of the next president.  The hard-won gains by our troops hang\nin the balance.  The lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in\nthe heart of the Middle East could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal,\nand arbitrary timelines.  [\x85]  *Senator McCain, on the 22nd of May, 2003 you\nsaid of Iraq, on the Senate floor "We won a massive victory in a few weeks,\nand we did so with very limited loss of American and allied lives. We were\nable to end aggression with minimum overall loss of life, and we were even\nable to greatly reduce the civilian casualties of Afghani and Iraqi\ncitizens."*\nSenator, you declared victory in Iraq nearly five years and three months\nago.  Today you say, "*Victory in Iraq is finally in sight".  The victory\nyou already proclaimed five years ago? * [\x85] In June of 2003, with even Fox\nNews noting,  \'Many argue that the conflict in Iraq isn\'t over. \'  You\nanswered, "Well, then why was there a banner that said \'Mission\nAccomplished\' on the aircraft carrier?  Look the \'I have said a long time\nthat reconstruction of Iraq would be a long, long difficult process, but the\nconflict\' the major conflict is over, the regime change has been\naccomplished, and it\'s very appropriate.\'\nThe senator also foolishly invoked his opponent in that speech today. He\ntold the convention today, \' I suppose from my opponents\' vantage point,\nveterans\' concerns are just one more issue to be spun or worked to\nadvantage. This would explain why he has also taken liberties with my\nposition on the GI Bill\x85. As a political proposition it would have been much\neasier for me to have just signed on to what I considered flawed\nlegislation.  But the people of Arizona, and of all America, expect more\nfrom their representatives than that, and instead I sough a better bill. I\'m\nproud to say that the result is a law that better serves our military,\nbetter serves military families, and better serves the interests of our\ncountry.\nSenator McCain spoke out against that very bill last May.  *On the asinine\npremise that the awards to our heroes in it were so good, that it did not\nencourage them to stay in the service.  *[\x85] Moreover, Senator McCain *missed\n10 of the 14 votes on Iraq u*p to middle of last year, this year he has\nmissed them all. Including one just to honor the sacrifice of the fallen.\nHe has voted to *table or oppose 20 million dollars for veterans\' healthcare\nfacilities, 322 million dollars for safety equipment for our troops in Iraq,\n430 million dollars for veterans outpatient care, 1 billion dollars in new\nequipment for the national guard, and in separate votes 1billion 500 million\ndollars in additional veterans medical care to be created by closing tax\nloopholes. * <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDORvQQoavk>\n\n\n\n\n-- \nLisa L.
