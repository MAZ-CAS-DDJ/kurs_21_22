Her tenacity, ties to wealthy givers and mastery of making donors happy have made Ms. Bonner, 48, among the most successful practitioners of a trade that is virtually invisible to voters but has taken on immense power and influence in the post-Citizens United world.\n\nAlmost every candidate for high office must now court ultrarich donors to finance super PACs. And with each party more reliant than ever on networks of outside groups to supplement its advertising and opposition research, fund-raisers like Ms. Bonner hold the keys to the big-money kingdom.\n\n\'\'The Bonner Group gets us the best fund-raising product for the lowest cost,\'\' said David Brock, the founder of the monitoring group Media Matters and the super PAC American Bridge. \'\'In my experience, the commission incentivizes the fund-raiser to meet the ambitious goals we set.\'\'\n\nBut the growing influence of paid fund-raisers has angered donors in both parties, who are skeptical of Washington\'s consultant class and the secret, often lucrative deals they reach with campaigns.\n\nSome organizations, like Freedom Partners, overseen by the conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, emphasize their reliance on salaried staff members to raise money.\n\n\'\'I want my money to go to the candidate, to get them elected; I don\'t want it to go to middlemen,\'\' said Andrew Sabin, a prominent Republican donor.\n\nSeveral Republican presidential contenders are now courting Spencer J. Zwick, Mitt Romney\'s finance chairman in 2012. But some former donors grumble about the fund-raising fees paid by Mr. Romney\'s campaign committees to limited liability companies established by Mr. Zwick: about $34 million, according to campaign disclosure reports.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Zwick declined to describe his own fee. But he said that the bulk of the payments collected by the companies were in turn paid out to more than 50 other fund-raisers employed by the campaign.\n\n\'\'We raised more money than has ever been raised before at a better cost of fund-raising than has ever been done before,\'\' Mr. Zwick said.\n\nBut few fund-raisers seem to command commissions as generous as Ms. Bonner\'s. Political fund-raisers are typically paid monthly retainers, which can reach $25,000 a month during campaigns. The Bonner Group is paid almost exclusively on commission, a practice that is legal but frowned upon by some fund-raising consultants, who say it leads to fights with clients and other consultants over credit. It is considered unethical by the Association of Fundraising Professionals, partly because it can encourage abuses and, in the charity world, places self-gain over philanthropy.\n\n\'\'I think it\'s a breach of fiduciary responsibility to pay fund-raisers on commission,\'\' said Cindy Darrison, a professor at the George H. Heyman Jr. Center for Philanthropy and Fundraising at New York University.\n\nAllies say Ms. Bonner and her 20-member firm are worth the expense. The Bonner Group maintains a database of 70,000 donors and collects detailed information on their past giving, their families and their political relationships. Many praise her energy and personal touch: thank-you notes, for example, or tickets to Broadway shows.\n\n\'\'Without Mary Pat, we would never be where we are today,\'\' said Craig T. Smith, a senior adviser to Ready for Hillary. Mr. Smith said the group had paid Ms. Bonner and some other fund-raisers a single-digit percentage of money raised.\n\nMs. Bonner, who cut her teeth as a campaign aide and fund-raiser for former Vice President Al Gore, is also known among colleagues for her aggressive tactics. During the 2012 campaign, Ms. Bonner, who was raising money for American Bridge, clashed repeatedly with other Democratic super PACs over joint fund-raising efforts.\n\nEarly in the cycle, American Bridge wanted a larger portion of shared fund-raising so it could begin tracking and researching Republican candidates. The other groups thought that Ms. Bonner was seeking to establish her client as a central financial clearinghouse for other Democratic groups.\n\nSeveral recalled attending a meeting at American Bridge where they glimpsed a half-erased whiteboard diagram, showing money flowing into American Bridge and then back out to their super PACs.\n\nOpacity surrounds political fund-raising. Priorities USA Action, a Democratic super PAC that is now preparing to back Mrs. Clinton, employed several consultants to bolster its fund-raising efforts in 2012. But a scan of the group\'s disclosure reports shows mostly regular, round-number payments to them.\n\nAfter The New York Times asked about payments to several specific fund-raisers, a spokesman confirmed that the payments constituted commissions to three of them. One, Andrew Korge, a Florida fund-raiser, was paid a 10 percent commission on a single million-dollar check. Another, Janet Keller, based in California, was paid a 5 percent commission on checks from a few wealthy donors totaling more than $2 million.\n\nIrwin M. Jacobs, the billionaire co-founder of Qualcomm, said in an email that Ms. Keller had merely helped arrange for him to meet with two Priorities officials. \'\'I was not aware that consultants might be paid a percentage of the political contributions that they raise,\'\' Mr. Jacobs wrote.\n\nIn an email, Ms. Bonner said she routinely disclosed to donors that she was being paid on commission. \'\'We charge all of our clients the same way, so there is no incentive for anyone in the firm to focus on one client more than another,\'\' Ms. Bonner said.\n\nBut there is little question who her biggest client is. Mr. Brock\'s growing empire, now composed of about 10 interlocking PACs and nonprofits, uses the Bonner Group for all of its development efforts.\n\nTwo years ago, reflecting her expanding role in Mr. Brock\'s enterprises, Ms. Bonner moved her company and staff into his headquarters, though she continues to serve other clients. She and Mr. Brock have adjoining offices and even share a summer rental in the Hamptons.\n\nMr. Brock credits Ms. Bonner with helping persuade donors that news media monitoring and opposition research deserve large-scale financial support. His groups brought in more than $28 million in 2014, entitling Ms. Bonner\'s firm to about $3.5 million in fees. Her commission represented his entire fund-raising overhead, Mr. Brock said, which compared favorably with that of other nonprofit groups.\n\nHe also emailed a statement from 40 donors attesting to the value her firm provided.\n\nNot everyone seems convinced. Ms. Bonner\'s fees have been a perennial source of controversy in the Democracy Alliance, a club of wealthy progressive donors, each obligated to contribute money to a select roster of liberal research and advocacy organizations.\n\nMs. Bonner originally worked there as a consultant, helping recruit new members. Later, when she moved to take on some of the funded organizations as clients, the alliance asked that contributions earmarked by its donors be exempt from Ms. Bonner\'s commission. Eventually, the Alliance ended her consulting arrangement. But an Alliance official said that there was no formal policy in place and that its staff had no way of tracking Ms. Bonner\'s commissions.\n\nMs. Bonner said in an email that she abided by the request. She continues to attend the alliance\'s private donor conferences, however, as an unpaid \'\'donor adviser\'\' to Marcy Carsey, a prominent Hollywood producer. Current and former executives at liberal nonprofits complain about a perception that hiring Ms. Bonner would improve their chances of being included in the Alliance\'s investment portfolio.\n\nOne Alliance donor, the billionaire Boston investor Vin Ryan, said that he had not been informed of Ms. Bonner\'s commission before donating to Media Matters and later demanded a written guarantee from the group that his contributions would be exempt.\n\n\'\'I don\'t know what her role in the D.A. is at this point, nor do I know who she actually is a donor adviser to, nor do I know what organizations she represents within the group of organizations who we are supporting,\'\' Mr. Ryan said. \'\'I think it\'s outrageous.\'\'\n\n\nMandy Grunwald to Join Clinton Team (NYT)\nBy Jonathan Martin\nFebruary 5, 2015\nThe New York Times\n\nMandy Grunwald, an adviser to the Clintons for over two decades and a top strategist to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, is expected to serve as a senior adviser for communications to Hillary Rodham Clinton\'s all-but-certain presidential bid.\n\nMs. Grunwald will advise Mrs. Clinton on strategy and make some of the television ads along with Jim Margolis, whose firm, GMMB, is expected to take the lead on producing and buying the commercials. The pollster Joel Benenson is another senior adviser poised to work for Mrs. Clinton on her second White House run.\n\nMs. Grunwald, an original member of Bill Clinton\'s 1992 presidential campaign team who also worked on Mrs. Clinton\'s 2008 White House bid, represents a nod to continuity after a stream of recent stories about Mrs. Clinton\'s plans to hire advisers close to her one-time rival for the White House, President Obama. Mrs. Clinton\'s camp has put out word that she will look to Mr. Margolis, Mr. Benenson, Robby Mook, John D. Podesta and Jennifer Palmieri - each of whom has worked or now works for Mr. Obama - to build her campaign. (Some of them, it should be noted, also have ties to the Clintons.)\n\nThe move to bring Ms. Grunwald onto the nascent campaign also underscores how unlikely it is that Ms. Warren will run for president. Ms. Grunwald produced Ms. Warren\'s TV ads in her 2012 Senate campaign, and the two remain close; Ms. Grunwald hosted a book party last year to celebrate the release of Ms. Warren\'s autobiography.\n\nThe decision to tap Ms. Grunwald, as well as Ms. Palmieri as communications director, could also address questions about gender diversity in Mrs. Clinton\'s still-developing campaign team. Mrs. Clinton has a number of women in her inner circle, including Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin, but grumbles have been growing louder in recent weeks from some female Democratic operatives about the number of men who appear bound to take senior roles on Mrs. Clinton\'s likely campaign.\n\nMs. Grunwald counts a number of Democratic senators as her clients and is particularly close to several women in the Senate, including Senators Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who was one of the only Democratic senators last year to fend off a Republican challenge.\n\n\nMandy Grunwald to join Hillary Clinton\'s team (Politico)\nBy Gabriel DeBenedetti\nFebruary 5, 2015\nPolitico\n\n\nLongtime Democratic operative Mandy Grunwald will join Hillary Clinton\'s probable presidential campaign as a top adviser, a Democrat familiar with the Clinton campaign structure confirmed to POLITICO on Thursday.\n\nGrunwald is a veteran of Bill Clinton\'s 1992 presidential campaign and Hillary Clinton\'s unsuccessful 2008 bid. She had recently been working for Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has often been mentioned as a challenger to Clinton but who insists she will not run in 2016.\n\nThe move, which was first reported by The New York Times, is "totally expected," the Democrat who confirmed it said. It also serves as further evidence that Warren is serious about not running.\n\nGrunwald is expected to work with Jim Margolis on media strategy. Margolis was a top campaign aide for President Barack Obama and also served on Bill Clinton\'s 1992 campaign.\n\nThe news of Grunwald\'s hiring comes one day after it emerged that White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri will leave the West Wing to help direct the likely Clinton campaign\'s communications team.\n\nGrunwald also will join Robby Mook, the expected campaign manager, and John Podesta, a former White House chief of staff to Bill Clinton and adviser to Obama who will likely serve as campaign chairman.\n\n\nCan Jennifer Palmieri Keep Hillary Clinton On Message? (Bloomberg)\nBy Margaret Talev\nFebruary 6, 2015\nBloomberg\n\nAmong watchers of Barack Obama\'s presidency and Hillary Clinton\'s expected 2016 campaign launch, the coming departures of two top White House aides got lots of attention: senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer, because he\'s been with Obama since before his 2008 win, and counselor John Podesta, because he\'s a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton whose move is all but proof of what everyone already assumed was true about Hillary\'s plans to run again.\n\nBut a more telling figure in the second-term White House departure lounge may actually be Jennifer Palmieri, Obama\'s affable but battle-tested communications director. Palmieri is leaving this spring to become the communications director for what doesn\'t yet exist as but will become the Clinton 2016 campaign.\n\nPalmieri, 48, is viewed in the White House and national political press corps as accessible and an honest broker whose loyalty to politicians comes with expectations of professionalism and propriety by the candidate, but has its limits (see: John Edwards). Her hiring suggests that Clinton, a former first lady, U.S. senator, failed 2008 presidential candidate and secretary of state, either really is serious about wanting to reset her own infamously antagonistic relationship with the media or at least wants to send that signal.\n\nKevin Madden, a Republican strategist and former spokesman for presidential candidate Mitt Romney, said Palmieri is "as formidable an opponent as I\'ve ever come across in political campaigns" and is someone so organized that "everyone in Palmieri\'s line of sight will know exactly what the campaign plan is and what they need to do to execute."  She also has the credentials, Madden said, to push back when she thinks the candidate or eager-to-please aides are making a mistake.\n\n"She knows her stuff," Madden said. "That\'s critical when you\'re the staffer that has to stare down the sycophants inside every campaign and offer the candidate unvarnished truths. It\'s important when you\'re developing the message and strategy privately and when you\'re executing it publicly." Palmieri declined to comment for the story.\n\nWhile Palmieri hasn\'t worked directly for Hillary Clinton before, the two women have gotten to know one another over the course of the last two decades because Palmieri worked for the Bill Clinton White House both terms and during a six-month transition period after he left office. She and Podesta also are close with a long history of working well, even between the Clinton and the Obama administrations. Podesta founded the Center for American Progress, where Palmieri, during her time there from 2005-2011, built a reputation among Democrats for her ability to stand up a progressive war room of sorts, with a communications operation of about 50 people. Obama pollster Joel Benenson and Jim Margolis, a media consultant who has advised the Obama campaign as well as Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, are among the other cross-over advisers expected to join the Clinton effort.\n\nIn the world of presidential runs, Palmieri was John Edwards\' 2004 campaign press secretary and in a less formal capacity an adviser in 2008. Before Edwards\' reputation was felled by an extramarital scandal and a trial, the 2004 vice presidential nominee was known for his "two Americas"  speech in which he addressed the gulf between the wealthy and Americans living to paycheck to paycheck. With Obama and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren prodding for income inequality to be a rallying cry for Democrats in 2016,  Hillary Clinton must consider how she wants to address the issue.\n\nPerhaps even more important for the Clintons is the value of Palmieri\'s experience with scandal.  A large part of her battle-testing was during the extended drama surrounding Edwards\' affair with videographer Rielle Hunter, his trial on charges related to allegations of illegal campaign contributions, and the death from cancer of his embattled wife Elizabeth Edwards, to whom Palmieri was a devoted friend.\n\n"There\'s an old saying in campaign world, you learn more from the losing ones than the winning ones and there\'s some truth in that," said Mike Feldman,  a former top adviser to Vice President Al Gore. "You don\'t control all the variables."\n\n"If you\'re looking to establish trust and credibility from the beginning," he said of Palmieri, "you couldn\'t do any better."\n\nDemocrat strategist Bill Burton, a former Obama spokesman, said Palmieri "is one of the greatest communicators in the Democratic Party and a huge get" for Clinton. "She will help to bridge the White House and the Clinton campaign in a way that few people could," and be "instrumental to Secretary Clinton\'s success."\n\n\nClinton widens her circle (Hill)\nBy Amie Parnes\nFebruary 6, 2015\nThe Hill\n\nHillary Clinton is widenening her circle for her second White House bid, adding key staffers more associated with other Democratic heavyweights to her tight-knit camp.\n\nThe new additions to Team Hillary suggest she is casting a wider net for help, and has become more open to relying on officials associated with President Obama who haven\'t been members of Clinton Inc.\n\nThose joining Team Hillary includes former staffers from her East Wing days in the White House - including Karen Finney and Clinton West Winger Jennifer Palmieri,who announced this week that she\'s leaving the White House as Obama\'s communications director to join Team Hillary.\n\nThey also reportedly include Teddy Goff, who ran the president\'s digital operation and Andrew Bleeker, who handled online advertising. Obama\'s 2012 campaign manager Jim Messina has already committed to supporting her candidacy through Priorities USA, the superPAC.\n"We want Hillary Clinton to be the next president of the United States," Messina said in an interview with MSNBC\'s Ronan Farrow earlier this week. "It\'s her turn. I think it\'s her time.\n\nAnd she has brought on Jim Margolis, who served as a senior adviser to Obama in both presidential elections along with Joel Benenson, who was Obama\'s chief strategist and pollster.\n\nOther political operatives, notably Brian Fallon, a longtime aide to Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), have also entered Hillaryland.\n\nThe changes are drawing praise from longtime Democratic operatives.\n\n"I\'m encouraged by it," said Jim Manley, the Democratic strategist. "I think it signifies that she\'s figuring out that she needs a different structure going forward. It seems like she\'s internalized some of what happened in 2008 and they\'re looking at a different approach."\n\nOne Clinton ally added: "It seems like she\'s taking more of a hands on approach and figuring out who\'d be best for each job."\n\nClinton has been criticized time and again for relying on the same key group of people, particularly during her 2008 presidential campaign. Back then, many of her advisers, loyal to the core, had been with her since her days as first lady and senator.  Some felt she was limiting herself by not bringing in fresh faces.\n\nAfter losing the Democratic primary in 2008 to Obama, she began to change that approach.\n\nShe started to rely not just on her own people but career types and even a couple of Obama people like Alec Ross, who ended up serving as Clinton\'s senior adviser for innovation at the State Department.\n\nClinton elevated people who impressed her, including Jake Sullivan, who served on her 2008 campaign but was a relative newcomer to Clinton\'s inner circle.\n\nSome allies say she has applied that approach to a greater extent during this upcoming campaign. Those close to Clinton say she\'s not in any rush to announce a candidacy and is taking her time to choose the right staff and nail the right tone and message.\n\nBut others say the final structure of a Clinton campaign is in question.\n\n"I think a lot still needs to play out," one staunch Clinton ally said. "She needs to be clear on what he organization looks like, the chain of command, who reports to who, and what responsibilities each individual has. A lot of that was missing in the last campaign."\n\n"And almost more than anything, is there a collaboration among the staff?" the ally added. "Because in 2008 that just didn\'t exist."\n\nOther Clinton supporters are unimpressed by the lineup so far, saying it is anything but out of the ordinary.\n\n"It\'s not thinking outside the box, it\'s essentially using the same class of political operatives," said the supporter who worked on the 2008 campaign. "Why is there not one new face from Austin, Texas or one person who hails from Silicon Valley?"\n\n"It\'s tired and predictable," the supporter said.\nOne thing is clear, however. With so many Obama staffers joining her operation, Clinton cannot run from the president\'s policies.\n\n"I just don\'t expect her to spend a lot of time running away from his agenda," Manley said.\n\nRepublican operatives agree.\n\n"What\'s noteworthy is Secretary Clinton is bring on top level Obama policy hands-not just political hacks," said Tim Miller, the executive director of America Rising, the superPAC that is targeting Clinton. "Any thought that she will able to distance herself from him effectively is completely wrong."\n\nAnd as Michael Short, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee added, "Resets are not Hillary\'s strong suit."\n\n\nAre men afraid to run against Hillary Clinton BECAUSE she\'s a woman? (WAPO)\nBy Nia-Malika Henderson\nFebruary 5, 2015\nThe Washington Post\n\nHillary Clinton is on the glide path to the Democratic nomination, with few credible challengers stepping forward. And Ross Baker, a political scientist professor at Rutgers University, thinks he knows why.\n\nClinton and the political "colossus" that is Nancy Pelosi are scaring away all the good male rivals, Nurse Ratched-style. They are "towering and intimidating figures, who have sucked the oxygen out of the spheres they dominate."\n\nHe writes more in USA Today:\n\nWhile the Democratic bench isn\'t as full as it has been, there is still no shortage of qualified male candidates who will probably not step forward in 2016. In the Senate there are potential hopefuls who could win the hearts of the very people who consider Clinton too middle-of-the-road: Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, and Jeff Merkley of Oregon. There are well-regarded governors such as Jack Markell of Delaware and Andrew Cuomo of New York or former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick. None of them has given the slightest hint that they might consider a run.\n\nFirst off, if I was to make a list of who would mount a run for the White House if Clinton didn\'t, I\'m not sure many of these people would make it (s0rry, Sen. Merkley). Which leads to this: If these candidates were so formidable, wouldn\'t they just run against Clinton? If they thought they could amass the millions and millions of dollars it would take to mount a run for the White House -- against Clinton or anyone else -- wouldn\'t they do it? She\'s a clear favorite, yes, but an open primary doesn\'t come around every four years.\n\nTo Baker, it is Clinton\'s gender that is a big, big stop sign. He doesn\'t seem to see a failure on the part of any of these potential male candidates to do the years and years of work it requires to become a contender. Nope, all of them are just afraid to run against Clinton because she is a woman -- not because she has a much higher profile, much better presidential resume and political network.\n\nHe calls this failure or fear of going "toe-to-toe with a powerful woman is, in the final analysis, a form of patronizing that ill-becomes a party that has stood so steadfastly for women."\n\nBut haven\'t male Democrats run against women before, you might ask? Yes, they most certainly have. Like in 2008, for instance. That contest was rough and tumble early on, with none of the candidates shaking in their boots at the thought of challenging Clinton, who after all was a powerful woman back then, too.\n\n(Baker argues that Obama\'s race gave him a special angle. He was also a much better candidate and reshaped the electorate as a result, but never mind that).\n\nSo what to make of Baker\'s argument, one that doesn\'t account for the fact that men dominate every single level of politics and nearly every other powerful industry you can think of? I have never thought of Clinton scaring away all the good men because of her gender.\n\nIn fact, she is "scaring away" women candidates too: Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.). Clinton, like her or not, has done what many countless men have done before her. She has plotted a course to the White House, clearing a path not because of her gender, but because of her strength and her power. To suggest otherwise is to deny her proper credit and gives too much to those who haven\'t "manned up."\n\n\n\n\nElection campaign will debate troops to stop Islamic State\nDavid Lightman; Mcclatchy Washington Bureau (TNS)\nFebruary 5, 2015\nGrand Forks Herald\nCopyright 2015, NewsBank. All Rights Reserved.\n\nWASHINGTON - The horrifying murder this week of a Jordanian pilot suggests that U.S. efforts to stop the Islamic State extremist group are ineffective, making it more likely that the 2016 election campaign will become a debate about ground troops.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has launched waves of airstrikes at Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria, but he steadfastly rules out sending ground troops into combat.\n\nAt least six potential Republican presidential candidates won\'t dismiss that option. Others, though, hedge when asked how they\'d proceed beyond criticizing Obama\'s airstrikes-only strategy as ineffective.\n\nDealing with the Islamic State is risky political business.\n\nPoliticians have to be careful that they don\'t appear to be taking advantage of fear and outrage over the group\'s brutality. And they know that ground troops are not a crowd-pleasing idea, since a war-weary public has vivid memories of the lengthy U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAmericans are increasingly worried about terrorist threats and want heightened readiness and a tough response.\n\nA recent Pew Research Center survey found combating terrorism inching ahead of the economy as Americans\' top priority for Obama and Congress. Twothirds were concerned the Islamic State was a major threat to this country.\n\nThe drumbeat of horrors keeps the apprehension fresh. The beheadings of hostages, the killings at the offices of satirical Paris-based magazine Charlie Hebdo and the burning alive of Jordanian Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh intensify the concern.\n\nRepublicans, far more than Democrats, have for months sensed an opportunity to use terrorism policies to their advantage, and aren\'t relenting.\n\n"There is a Democrat in the White House, so it\'s a little easier (for Republicans) to be hawkish," said Craig Robinson, editor of TheIowa Republican.com, a partisan website.\n\nAdd to that the prospect of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee, even though she was in office in 2011, when American forces killed terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden. As a U.S. senator, Clinton voted in 2002 to authorize President George W.\n\nBush to use military force in Iraq, a vote she later said she regretted.\n\n"Republicans likely view her as being weak on foreign policy," said Robinson.\n\nClinton said last month that military action against Islamic terrorists was "critical."\n\nShe did not get more specific about U.S. ground troops.\n\nGround troops, many suggest, could or should be an option. Among their views:\n\n* Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry "believes we shouldn\'t take options off the table when it comes to protecting America\'s interests," said spokeswoman Lucy Nashed.\n\n* Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. "If you need ground troops to take them out, you put in ground troops," he told McClatchy in a recent interview.\n\n* Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker told ABC on Sunday, "We have to be prepared to put boots on the ground if that\'s what it takes."\n\n* Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida told CNN last fall the fight against the Islamic State "might require some element of U.S. ground power in order to finish the job." He continues to think the U.S. shouldn\'t take options off the table.\n\n* Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina suggested "ground troops on the American side to supplement a regional force with large enough numbers to defeat" the Islamic State. He called for about 10,000 American support personnel "to make sure that we win not only in Syria but in Iraq."\n\n* Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has been a supporter of U.S. airstrikes, though he said Obama had acted improperly by not seeking congressional authorization first.\n\nIn December, he introduced a resolution providing that consent, which hasn\'t been taken up for a vote. It included a section limiting how ground forces could be used.\n\n\nAttention Hillary staffers: Here are directions to all the big donors in New York City (WAPO)\n\nBy Phillip Bump\n\nFebruary 5, 2015\n\nWashington Post\n\n\n\nReports this week that Hillary Clinton may have settled on a location for her presidential campaign* have focused on an area of Brooklyn Heights, just across the East River from Lower Manhattan in New York City. According to the New York Daily News, Clinton\'s looking at a spot just off the Brooklyn Bridge, in a part of the borough that would be considered hip only by the standards of staid Manhattan types.\n\n\n\nIn the long-running spirit of offering helpful tips to political newcomers to New York City, we thought we\'d offer the Clinton campaign* the most useful service we could provide: instructions on how to easily get from the proposed campaign* headquarters to the most lucrative donors.\n\n\n\nNew York City, as it always is for everyone, was a gigantic ATM for Clinton in year prior to her 2008 bid. The top five most generous ZIP codes for her that year were all in New York, all in Manhattan. We\'ve mapped them, relative to the possible headquarters location.\n\n\n\nThe very good news for Clinton is that there are two subway stops just a few blocks from the proposed headquarters, which link to the two most important subway lines: the 4/5/6 and the 1/2/3. The former run up the east side of Manhattan; the latter, up the west side. Now, we understand that the likelihood of candidate* Clinton swiping a MetroCard and hopping onto a rush-hour 5 train is low (although -- remember this prediction -- she would certainly ride the train at least once for a photo op), but it will certainly be handy for low-to-mid-level staffers tasked with doing set-up or warming up the room before Clinton pops in to point to the check-collection basket.\n\n\n\nSo, to aid them in their efforts:\n\n\n\nHow to get to donors on the Upper West Side\n\n1. Head south to the Borough Hall 2/3 stop.\n\n2. Take the 2/3 toward Manhattan to W. 72nd.\n\n3. Walk two blocks east to Central Park West.\n\n4. Ask the doorman for the location of the service elevator.\n\n\n\nHow to get to donors on the Upper East Side\n\n1. Head south to the Borough Hall 4/5 stop.\n\n2. Take the 4/5 toward Manhattan to 59th Street.\n\n3. Transfer to the uptown 6.\n\n4. Exit at 77th Street.\n\n5. Walk two blocks west to Madison Avenue.\n\n6. Ask the gallery owner where you are allowed to hang the signs.\n\n\n\nHow to get to the big donors in Brooklyn\n\n1. Walk outside.\n\n2. Loudly say, "Who wants to get in good with the next president?"\n\n3. Point at the box labeled "MONEY GOES HERE" at your feet.\n\n\n\nHow to get to the Democratic Convention\n\nIf it is in Brooklyn:\n\n1. Walk south to Atlantic Avenue.\n\n2. Turn left onto Atlantic, follow it until the word "BARCLAYS" fills your field of vision.\n\n\n\nIf it is in Philadelphia or Columbus:\n\n1. Skip it.\n\n\n\nWe hope that helps.\n\nNBC\'s Bad Memory (Slate)\n\nBy Alec MacGillis\n\nFebruary 5, 2015\n\nSlate\n\n\n\nQuestions are swirling about NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams\' guarded acknowledgment Wednesday night that he had, over the years, falsely claimed to have been in a helicopter that came under rocket-propelled grenade fire in Iraq in 2003. But NBC itself has been mostly mum about the matter, and MSNBC has given it only the briefest of mentions.\n\n\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the network\'s coverage of a quite similar matter in 2008: Hillary Clinton\'s false claim to have arrived in Tuzla, Bosnia under sniper fire in 1996, when coverage of her visit at the time showed her being greeted leisurely by an 8-year-old with a welcoming poem. From what I can tell from the transcripts at the time, Williams did not directly address Clinton\'s exaggerations on the air when they were covered by NBC Nightly News. But his colleagues at NBC and MSNBC hammered away at Clinton repeatedly over several weeks for her dishonesty and carelessness. Some examples, with some especially tart comments highlighted:\n\n\n\nMeet the Press, March 23, 2008:\n\n\n\nTim Russert: Yesterday in the column called "Fact Checker" by Michael Dobbs in the Washington Post, Dobbs wrote this, "Clinton\'s tale of landing at the Tuzla Airport under sniper fire and then running for cover is simply not credible. Photographs and video of the arrival ceremony combined with contemporaneous news reports tell a very different story. Four Pinocchios," which is the highest you can get, which means a whopper in terms of exaggeration.\n\n\n\n... It\'s a credibility issue, truth-telling-is this a problem for Sen. Clinton?\n\n\n\nChuck Todd: Well, it\'s been the nagging things about this whole campaign. When you ask that question of honest and trustworthy, she has always consistently scored lower than Obama. ... But, I, for the life of me, haven\'t understood why they have pushed this story. They knew that somebody went after and re-interviewed Sinbad, who was on that trip, the former "comedian," and I put comedian in quotes. That he was on that trip and doesn\'t remember it being that harried or anything like that, and yet she went out and retold the story. ... They didn\'t need to retell the story because if they had not, then they wouldn\'t have gotten this four Pinocchio thing out of the Washington Post and given the Obama campaign something to hit them with.\n\n\n\nToday Show, March 25, 2008:\n\n\n\nMatt Lauer: So let\'s talk about this trip to Bosnia March of 1996. Here\'s how Hillary Clinton described it last week: "I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles and get to our base." Now, I still remember winning a Little League championship single-handedly when I was 10, probably didn\'t happen. But this isn\'t the Little League, this is someone running for president. There were reporters on this trip and she\'s using her experience as a deciding factor. How could this happen?\n\n\n\nChuck Todd: Well, and it\'s worse than that, Matt. There had been reporters questioning her story on this a few weeks ago. One even reached out to the comedian Sinbad, who was also on this trip, to get his recollection of it and it differed from the first lady. So somebody didn\'t scrub that speech. It was in prepared remarks last week, and not only did she say it with certitude, but it was in her prepared text. So this was a real sort of bone-headed mistake on the campaign\'s part at a time when everybody is looking at everything so carefully.\n\n\n\nLauer: Right, and does it make people now go back and start to question everything she said?\n\n\n\nCountdown, March 27, 2008:\n\n\n\nKeith Olbermann: Forgetting about Bosnia. The March 17 misspeak was just she said, sleep deprivation or something. But now, two other Bosnia misspeaks have turned up. Were they sleep deprivation, too?\n\n\n\nSpeaking of Bosnia, it turns out Sen. Clinton was speaking of Bosnia and gunfire and danger last December. Is that sleep deprivation chronic?\n\n\n\nHardball, April 7, 2008:\n\n\n\nChris Matthews: That said, [for Obama to run ads about] Tuzla doesn\'t require any nastiness toward Sen. Clinton. It requires playing over and over again a fish story that she was under enemy fire, a very elaborate kind of story about wartime and risk and courage and survival that turned out not to be at all true. Who would hold that against Barack? I can imagine Mark Penn running series of ads over and over again. I can imagine a saturation campaign. Why doesn\'t he do what Hillary would do?\n\n\n\nWhat\'s especially striking about the comparison of the scandal over Clinton\'s Tuzla\'s claims-which unquestionably wounded her already listing campaign against Barack Obama-was that Williams made some of his false claims about the Iraq helicopter attack directly after Clinton was slammed over Tuzla. In a May 12, 2008 blog post, he wrote:\n\n\n\nA young soldier, who is, like me, from the Jersey Shore, reads my blog entry last week during a break while on active duty in Iraq. The last time I saw him, I was with my friend and NBC News Military Analyst Wayne Downing, a retired 4-Star Army General. Wayne and I were riding along as part of an Army mission to deliver bridge components to the Euphrates River, so that the invading forces of the 3rd Infantry could cross the river on their way to Bagdhad. We came under fire by what appeared to be Iraqi farmers with RPG\'s and AK-47\'s. The Chinook helicopter flying in front of ours (from the 101st Airborne) took an RPG to the rear rotor, as all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire. We were forced down and stayed down-for the better (or worse) part of 3 days and 2 nights.\n\nWilliams had seen what happened to Clinton just weeks earlier, yet kept telling his own fish tale. To paraphrase one of his own NBC colleagues, this isn\'t Little League, it\'s a nightly news anchor with an audience of millions. Will he be held to the same standards to which NBC and the rest of the media held Clinton?\n\nHillary Clinton\'s consolation prize for Brooklyn (WaPo)\n\nBy Jonathan Capehart\n\nFebruary 5, 2015\n\nWashington Post\n\n\n\nAmie Parnes of the Hill reports that the as-yet-announced presidential campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton will likely be headquartered in Brooklyn. One knowledgeable Democratic strategist told me that the consultants prefer the Big Apple\'s largest borough to someplace in Westchester because it would be easier to get to and out of. But putting the campaign in Brooklyn would have another benefit: consolation prize.\n\n\n\nAny day now, the Democratic National Committee will announce its choice for its 2016 presidential nominating convention. Brooklyn, Philadelphia and Columbus, Ohio, are the finalists. By now, you know I think Philadelphia should get the quadrennial jamboree. I recognize the power of having Clinton officially accept the nomination (assuming she runs and secures the required delegates) in her home state 24 years after her ex-president husband did the same in the Big Apple. Still, there are significant issues with hosting the convention in Brooklyn, which is why the money is on the City of Brotherly Love.\n\n\n\nThat\'s why the leak about Clinton considering Brooklyn for her campaign headquarters is so intriguing. The borough could lose the convention but gain the campaign. It could dodge the bullet of the four-day convention (and the headaches for all concerned that would entail) but bask in the glow of a 16-month presidential operation. There are issues with putting the campaign there, too. Being the capital of hyper-expensive Hipstervania is one. Actually, that might be its biggest knock. That, and being the center of action for HBO\'s "Girls." But in touting Brooklyn for the convention, New York City Council Member Vincent Gentile gave a rationale for why Clinton should make the borough her HQ. "One in seven Americans can trace their roots to Brooklyn so history shows Brooklyn is at the crossroads of our country," he said last year. "We are a true mosaic of our country and of the world. Clearly Brooklyn is America and America is Brooklyn."\n\n\n\nCan\'t argue with that.\n\n\n\n\n\'Talking is Teaching\' event focuses on early childhood literacy (Tulsa World)\nBy Mike Averill\nFebruary 5, 2015\nTulsa World\n\n\n\nFind ideas for talking to young children at the Talking is Teaching website.\n\nThe importance of early childhood literacy and providing caregivers with the tools to enhance a child\'s development was the focus of a "Talking is Teaching" event Wednesday night.\n\nTalking is Teaching is a new effort to empower parents and caregivers to boost young children\'s brain development and build their vocabularies by increasing the number of words they hear spoken to them every day.\n\n"It might seem strange to have an adult conversation with a 10-month-old or 2-year-old child, but it\'s our role. We can help children grow and be ready for school simply by talking, singing and reading with them," said Kujanga Jackson, pastor at New Beginnings Community Church, 1401 Charles Page Blvd., where the event was held.\n\nResearchers say an average child from a low-income family usually knows 500 words by age 4, while a child from a working-class family generally knows 700 and a child from a professional family knows 1,100.\n\nThe goal of the initiative is to close that word gap.\n\nTalking is Teaching is a partnership between the George Kaiser Family Foundation, the Community Action Project of Tulsa County, Tulsa Educare and Too Small to Fail - a joint initiative of Next Generation and the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.\n\nCaleb Gayle, program officer with the Kaiser Foundation, said a poll of low-income parents determined that their most trusted messengers on raising their children are those in the medical and education professions, as well as the ministry.\n\nNew Beginnings is one of several area churches that are partners in the initiative, delivering messages on the importance of talking, reading and singing in child development and by hosting events to model good parenting and child interaction, Gayle said.\n\nOther components of the initiative include a partnership with the Parent Child Center of Tulsa to provide the parents of every newborn a guide with materials to prompt caregiver-child engagement and a partnership with Tulsa Transit, where encouraging posters are placed inside buses.\n\n"Our overall effort is to demonstrate that every opportunity, whether in a car, bus or church, every one of those is an opportunity to learn for your child," Gayle said. "Cooking dinner, eating food or when a child is on your lap - that is an opportunity to attach with a child and enhance that child\'s learning experience."\n\nSandie Stewart, a member of New Beginnings Community Church, attended the meeting with her granddaughter, Jordan Stewart, to help increase her interest in reading.\n\nShe said she plans to share what she learns with the girl\'s parents so they can reinforce the same skills at their home.\n\n"Learning to love reading, writing and singing is something that will help them their whole life," Stewart said. "Reading together is a very special bonding time that makes us slow down and take it easy and not be so rushed in our lives."\n\n\n\n'
