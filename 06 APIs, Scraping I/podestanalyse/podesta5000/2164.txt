Warren Christopher was right.\r\nWe wanted it just as bad, but we honored the rule of law in a constitutional republic. It is easy to win temporarily by force intimidation and lawlessness.\r\n\r\nSafe travels,\r\nGood luck Tuesday.\r\n\r\nFrom: John Podesta [mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com]\r\nSent: Saturday, March 12, 2016 3:00 PM\r\nTo: Mitchell W.
