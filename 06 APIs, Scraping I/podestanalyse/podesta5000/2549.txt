john.podesta@gmail.comb"John\n\nHope you are well.  I just wanted to touch base and try to get together at some point soon.  As you know I will be doing part of the polling for HRC along side of Joel (OK, let's call it what it is -- second chair).  Since we are going to go through this adventure together it would be helpful to pick your brain and get to know you better.  We have done our fair share of polling for CAP in the past and as you know polled battleground states for the Obama campaigns in 2008 and 2012.\n\nI don't live in DC but have a condo there and am up there a couple of times a month.  I am heading up today and the HRC consultant team is suppose to be in NYC on Wednesday but given the weather that is coming that may be postponed.  So I might find myself with time in DC this week if you have any holes or free up.\n\nThanks for your time and look forward to working with you.\n\nJohn Anzalone\nAnzalone Liszt Grove Research\n334-387-3121\n\nPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS: john@ALGpolling.com\nwww.ALGpolling.com\n\ntwitter: @AnzaloneLiszt\n\n\n\n"
