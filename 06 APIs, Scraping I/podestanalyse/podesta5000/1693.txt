And in those cases it was their responsibility, as it is for all\n> State Department employees, to make sure what needed to end up in the State\n> Department system did. And we\'re confident that when the public is able to\n> read them all they\'ll see that\'s what overwhelmingly happened, and then\n> some.\n>\n>  As for how you\'ve characterized them, yes, we have disagreed. Starting\n> with the simple fact that you presented several email as examples of using\n> personal accounts when in fact those emails were sent from State.gov\n> <http://state.gov/> accounts.  And in terms of the content of these\n> emails from state.gov accounts, you have cited examples of both an email sent\n> by Jake about the Sunday shows taped after the attacks and one about the\n> Secretary\'s previous remarks.  Since you seem to have been provided these\n> without context, it\'s important to note that the first is proof that\n> internal State communications line up completely with how the\n> administration was discussing the matter externally - that is, the publicly\n> stated administration view and the privately stated administration view\n> were exactly the same. And that view was guided by the intelligence\n> community.  All that the second email shows is that given the maelstrom\n> that formed in the aftermath of the Sunday shows, Jake was simply informing\n> the Secretary of what she had personally said publicly, since many people\n> were mischaracterizing her remarks.   To apply any further analysis, or to\n> suggest it, would be wrong.  And this is precisely why we hope that these\n> emails will be released as soon as possible, particularly those related to\n> Benghazi, so everyone will have the full context and see for themselves.\n>\n>  Again, this is on the record in response to your questions. And if you\n> would like to post online our entire exchange about your story for every\n> reader to see for themselves, I am more than happy for you to do so.
