Remember, you will earn\n  award miles\n  for every survey you complete. The award miles will automatically be\n  deposited into your MileagePlus account for you.\n\n  Once the award miles are automatically deposited into your\n  MileagePlus account, you can use them in so many different ways. Use\n  miles toward upgrading to a premium cabin on your next flight** or\n  simply relaxing at one of the nicest hotels.
