john.podesta@gmail.comb'\n\nJohn Adams called on Sunday afternoon and left  the following message:\n\nThanks for calling me.  I  know you are quite busy and have more important things than taking telephone calls  from your  friends.\n\nWanted to give you my feelings and concerns about a couple of spots that are moving ahead.  Have some concern about Jason Gromen and the Carol Btowner seat - both of whom I like and are friends.\n\nAlso interested in NOAA with Bill Richardson taking over.  Will we have somebody who will be an ocean champion?  Thinking about Jane Lapchinko (spelling) who is really an outstanding intellect in this area,would make an excellent head of NOAA.\n\nI know there are lots of other posts you are thinking about, hope you are thinking about a post for yourself.  You should consider being the climate guru - the only chance in a lifetime to get something important done.  If you do that and I can help - that will be fun.  In the meantime - good luck.  All the best.\n'
