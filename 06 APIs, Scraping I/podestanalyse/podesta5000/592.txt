john.podesta@gmail.comb'Congrats on a historic report - an incredible and accessible discussion and set of recommendations.\nIt is amazing work in 90 days - and amazing work in any time period.\n\nI think it really lays out many of the key issues and the discriminatory one is probably the most complex to resolve and regulate.  Would have liked to see some discussion of common carrier rules for mail and phone but you are clear that the consent model alone is not enough in the modern era.  And the call out on education was clear - Google I note in the last few days reversed some of its policies that were called out in our ad campaigns.\n\nI also note some echoes of our 96 slogan - meeting our challenges, protecting our values.\n\nAmazing report.\n\nWhen dust settles, let me know if anything I can do to help in the implementation.\n\n\nFrom: John Podesta [mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com]\nSent: Thursday, March 20, 2014 10:51 AM\nTo: Mark J.
