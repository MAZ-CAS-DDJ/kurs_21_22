Senator Clinton\'s call comes in light of a recent\nreport by DHS Inspector General Richard Skinner that DHS improperly\nawarded a $475 million no-bid contract to Chenega Technology Services\nCorporation, which according to the report "likely did not provide the\ngovernment the best value" and that DHS "did not comply with federal\nregulations".  According to the IG\'s office, the agency also provided\naward fees to the company as part of its contract.  In calling for the\ninvestigation, Senator Clinton underscored that despite federal law\nrequiring DHS to link award fees with successful acquisition outcomes,\nthere have been a number of reports of DHS providing award fees\nregardless of performance.    \n\n \n\n"This disconnect between performance and award fees appears to be part\nof a troubling pattern," said Senator Clinton.  "In too many cases, DHS\nappears to be awarding bonuses without evaluating work or, even worse,\ndespite poor performance.  Failing contractors should be rooted out not\nrewarded."\n\n \n\nThe following is Senator Clinton\'s letter to DHS Inspector General\nRichard L. Skinner requesting an investigation:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNovember 26, 2007\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMr. Richard L. Skinner\n\nInspector General\n\nUnited States Department of Homeland Security\n\nWashington, D.C. 20528\n\n \n\nDear Mr. Skinner:\n\n \n\nI write regarding a disturbing report you issued last month that raises\nserious questions about contracting practices at the Department of\nHomeland Security (DHS).  The report -  Customs and Border Protection\nAward and Oversight of Alaska Native Corporation Contract for\nEnforcement Equipment Maintenance and Field Operations Support\n(OIG-08-10) - details how DHS improperly awarded a $475 million, no-bid\ncontract to Chenega Technology Services Corporation to maintain X-ray,\nradiation and other screening machines at U.S. border checkpoints.  Your\nreport concludes the contract "award likely did not provide the\ngovernment the best value" and that DHS "did not comply with federal\nregulations."\n\n \n\nAdditionally, your staff informs me that award fees were given to\nChenega as a part of its contract with DHS.  Given that your report did\nnot focus on award fees to Chenega, the details of these fees are\nunclear.  However, taken together with your conclusion that the\nDepartment improperly awarded the underlying contract to Chenega, it is\ndisturbing to hear that DHS has provided an award fee to this\ncorporation.  \n\n \n\nThis disconnect between performance and award fees appears to be part of\na troubling pattern.  The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) state\nclearly that cost-based award fee contracts are intended to motivate\nexcellent contractor performance in areas such as quality, timeliness,\ntechnical ingenuity, and cost-effective management.  Despite this\nguidance, during the course of the past several years there have been a\nnumber of reports documenting how award fees are being doled out by DHS\nto contractors regardless of performance:\n\n \n\n*\tEvaluation of TSA\'s contract for the installation and\nmaintenance of explosive detection equipment at United States Airports\n(DHS Inspector General, September 2004) - TSA awarded a contract to\nBoeing for the installation and maintenance of explosive detection\nequipment at airports.  TSA paid more than $44 million to Boeing without\nany evaluation of Boeing\'s performance. \n\n \n\n*\tTransportation Security Administration Review of the TSA\nPassenger and Baggage Screening Pilot Program (DHS Inspector General,\nSeptember 2004) - TSA awarded four pilot program contracts to determine\nwhether private companies could provide and maintain passenger screening\nperformance at levels equal to or greater than the TSA screener force.\nThe Inspector General found the award fee determinations lacked\nperformance criteria, were highly subjective and based primarily on\ncontractor self-assessments and input from TSA officials. \n\n \n\n*\tObservations on the Department of Homeland Security\'s\nAcquisition Organization and on the Coast Guard\'s Deepwater Program\n(GAO-07-453T) (February 8, 2007) - GAO found that despite documented\nproblems in schedule, performance, cost control, and contract\nadministration throughout the first year of the Deepwater contract, the\ncontractor had received a rating of 87 percent, which fell in the "very\ngood" range and resulted in an award fee of $4 million. \n\n \n\nIn too many cases, DHS appears to be awarding bonuses despite poor\nperformance, or worse, without even evaluating work.  Failing\ncontractors should be rooted out, not rewarded.  Given your report of\nwhat appears to be noncompliant federal contracting practices on the\npart of the DHS and a pattern of providing award fees to contractors\nwithout justification, I request that you expand your investigation into\nthe practice of award fees by the Department, especially when it comes\nto no-bid contacts.  Specifically, I would ask that your investigation\nreview the following questions:\n\n \n\n*\tSection 3501 of the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans\' Care,\nKatrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 (P.L.\n110-28) states, "The Secretary of Homeland Security shall require that\nall contracts of the Department of Homeland Security that provide award\nfees link such fees to successful acquisition outcomes (which outcomes\nshall be specified in terms of cost, schedule, and performance)."  DHS\nhas engaged in a number of contracts in Fiscal Year 2007.  How many of\nthese contracts included award fees and were these award fees based on\nsuccessful acquisition outcomes?  What was the total amount of these\naward fees? \n\n \n\n*\tDid the Department of Homeland Security violate P.L. 110-28 in\nproviding award fees to contractors Fiscal Year 2007? \n\n \n\n*\tWere award fees given to Chenega Technology Services Corporation\njustified and based on successful acquisition outcomes? \n\n \n\n*\tWhat mechanisms are currently in place at DHS to ensure that\naward fees are awarded in a proper manner?  Are these mechanisms\nenforced in providing award fees for DHS contracts?  What can the\nDepartment of Homeland Security do to ensure that award fees are\njustified and based on successful acquisition outcomes? \n\n \n\nThank you for attention to this matter.  \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\n \n\nHillary Rodham Clinton\n\n \n\n \n\n###\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n'
