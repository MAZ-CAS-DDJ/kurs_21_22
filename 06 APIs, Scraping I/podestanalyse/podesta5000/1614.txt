There is a lot going on in this poll and a lot that we all want to know but naturally there are time limitations on what we can do in one instrument.  We will have future policy polls that will build on this one and dive deeper into specific issue areas.\n\nWe are attempting to do several things in this poll:\n\n1:  Measure the importance voters put on different issues\n2:  Measure isolated support or opposition of policy proposals\n3:  Determine the prescriptions that voters have when policy proposals are stacked against each other\n4:  And on some issues, see if proposal stand up to opposition arguments.\n\nWe have also focused on the following issue areas \x97 almost all economic related:\n\n1:  General Issue salience (most important issue that leaders should focus on)\n2:  Importance of new investments in a variety of areas that could help families and the economy\n3: The importance of different policy proposals to improve the economy and incomes\n4:  Dissecting the needs of small businesses and what is needed to help them succeed and grow\n5:  Proposals that would improve public education (K-12) and college debt\n6: Tax reform and tax policy options (OK, tax increases)\n7:  Climate changed focused mostly on the Pollution Tax (carbon tax), including opposition arguments\n8  Paid Family Leave including opposition arguments\n9:  Baseline measure on trade\n10:  Proposals for retirement security\n\nThat is a lot for one poll and it is certainly too long but we wanted people to be able to get the full flavor or issues we have discussed on past policy calls and strategy meetings.  This will allow us to put issues side by side and then make decisions on priorities and what we might be able to wait for future polls.\n\nAs you review think to yourself what might not be needed in this round of research.  If you feel strongly that there are items missing that should be included please be ready to let us know what you would cut to fit it in the poll.\n\nI also want to give a shout out to the Policy Team.  Them memos, calls and endless emails we sent to Jake, Dan and Ethan have been invaluable and we could not have put this draft together without your effort.  Thank you.\n\nWe have a call on Monday which gives everyone the weekend to kick the tires (Happy Valentines).  Feel free as you review and ponder to shoot me, Jeff Liszt, and Matt Hogan, an email on your comments and suggestions (and questions) and then we can attempt to put a second draft together before the call.  That would make the call more efficient.\n\nThanks for everyone\x92s time and effort.\n\n\n\x97 John Anzalone\nAnzalone Liszt Grove Research\n334-387-3121 Office\n@AnzaloneLiszt\n\n\nFrom: Marissa Astor <marissa.astor@icloud.com<mailto:marissa.astor@icloud.com>>\nDate: Fri, 13 Feb 2015 11:37:00 -0500\nTo: Robby Mook <robbymook2015@gmail.com<mailto:robbymook2015@gmail.com>>, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>, Jake Sullivan <jake.sullivan@gmail.com<mailto:jake.sullivan@gmail.com>>, Shannon Currie <scurrie@bsgco.com<mailto:scurrie@bsgco.com>>, John Anzalone <john@algpolling.com<mailto:john@algpolling.com>>, Jim Margolis <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com<mailto:Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com>>, Mindy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com<mailto:gruncom@aol.com>>, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com<mailto:dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>>, Jeff Liszt <jeff@algpolling.com<mailto:jeff@algpolling.com>>, Jennifer Palmieri <jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com<mailto:jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com>>, Kristina Schake <kristinakschake@gmail.com<mailto:kristinakschake@gmail.com>>, Ethan Gelber <egelber@hrcoffice.com<mailto:egelber@hrcoffice.com>>, Mona Thinavongsa <Mona@algpolling.com<mailto:Mona@algpolling.com>>, Teddy Goff <teddy.goff@gmail.com<mailto:teddy.goff@gmail.com>>, Cheryl Mills <cheryl.mills@gmail.com<mailto:cheryl.mills@gmail.com>>, Joanne Laszczych <jlaszczych@cdmillsGroup.com<mailto:jlaszczych@cdmillsGroup.com>>\nSubject: Policy Poll Review Call\n\nFor this call, please use the number (202) 847-6076 and enter the pin 98260.
