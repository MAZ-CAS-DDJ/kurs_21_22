You know far better than I how to make it happen, but I think it's important that it happen.  I'm sure Graham will have to continue to fulminate against the administration for the next 5 months and beyond.\n\nHope you're doing well.   Seems like it from here.  \n\nBest, Paul \n\n\nPaul Harstad\nHARSTAD STRATEGIC RESEARCH, INC\n2820 N.
