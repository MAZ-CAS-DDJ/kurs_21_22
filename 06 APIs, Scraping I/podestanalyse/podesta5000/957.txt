john.podesta@gmail.comb" \n\nDear Friends, \n\n \n\nAs the Washington Director for Common Sense Media, I  have had the privilege\nto be part of their advocacy and research efforts for almost nine (9) years.\nNow that Common Sense has evolved into one of the largest non-profits in the\ncountry focused on the well-being of children,  our next big step is into\nthe funding of research and understanding of media and its impact on the\nhealth of our nation's kids.    As such, I am thrilled to announce some\nresearch which John and I have helped support and which was recently\ncompleted by Vicky Rideout.   The study focuses on the use of media by\nTweens and Teens (e.g. differences in technology use between girls and boys,\nthe means by which technology is differently utilized according to social\nand economic factors.) The findings of this seminal research is being\nlaunched at an event on the morning of November 4th at the Kaiser Conference\nCenter 1330 G Street , NW Washington DC.  There will also be an accompanying\npanel discussion with CSM Founder Jim Steyer, Northwestern Professor Ellen\nWartella, an FCC Commissioner, Mike McCurry, and Gary Knell, CEO of national\nGeographic.  A copy of the invitation to this event is attached, and I would\nlove it if you are able to attend this launch if it fits into your morning\nschedule.\n\n \n\nIn addition, if you are unable to attend the launch, John and I are hosting\nat our Capitol Hill home a cocktail reception the night prior to the launch.\nThe reception will be on November 3rd at our home at 628 East Capitol\nStreet, NE from 6 30 to 8 00 pm.    In attendance will be the panelists,\nstaff of Common Sense Media from San Francisco, our Washington Advisory\nCouncil and various thought leaders in the area of kids, education and\nmedia.     For those on the Washington Advisory Council, this reception will\nbe in lieu of our fall meeting.    I would really love it if you could\nespecially stop by this event at the house and pick up some materials\nrelated to this study and also to meet again our CSM team.   I have attached\nboth invitations with all the key details, and I thank you again for your\ncontinued friendship and support.\n\n \n\nIf you should desire further information, please do not hesitate to contact\nmy assistant, Carey Snyder.
