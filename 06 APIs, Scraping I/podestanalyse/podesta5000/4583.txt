john.podesta@gmail.comb"John -- I also wanted to add that I wasn't planning on talking to Neera\nabout looking for a job until I had more concrete options. Let me know if\nyou think I should mention sooner given the potential campaign option.  My\nreview is on Friday, so I suppose the fact that I'm interested in looking\naround could come up then organically, but the reality is I don't have any\nconcrete options at this moment so don't want her to start counting me out\nover here.\nAgain, I'm very interested in both of the opportunities you mentioned.\nEspecially the campaign.  I'm really excited about my next stop -- wherever\nit is!\nThanks again!\nxd\n\nOn Mon, Dec 1, 2014 at 9:24 PM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n> Let's talk.\n>\n> JP\n> --Sent from my iPad--\n> john.podesta@gmail.com\n> For scheduling: eryn.sepp@gmail.com\n>\n> > On Dec 1, 2014, at 6:44 PM, Debbie Fine <debsfine@gmail.com> wrote:\n> >\n> > hi john!  hope you were able to fit in a thanksgiving break somehow with\n> your family.  i'm thinking that may be dubious.... hope springs eternal.\n> >\n> > i wanted to let you know that i am looking for other opportunities\n> outside of CAP -- just starting to look and haven't told Neera -- but I\n> wanted to ask that if you hear of anything you think could be a good fit to\n> pls keep me in mind.  i'm planning to look at positions that include admin\n> management as well -- like operations, HR, etc.  I have been overseeing\n> cap's admin team since Joe left in the beginning of august and I like it.\n> I'm also open to other cities -- NY, LA, wherever.\n> >\n> > Hope to see you soon!\n> >\n> > x, debbie\n>\n"
