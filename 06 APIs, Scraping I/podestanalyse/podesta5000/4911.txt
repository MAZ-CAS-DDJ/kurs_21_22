Owners and Residents may bring up to four (4) non-resident guests with them. Please provide the concierge with names of your anticipated guests.\r\n\r\nSince the maximum roof capacity is 40, we may have to limit the number of people on the roof accordingly. For safety, we will have an additional staff person on-duty.\r\n\r\nNo cooking/barbequing will be allowed that evening.\r\n\r\nNo alcoholic beverages are allowed on the roof.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely dangerous to stand or sit on, place objects on or throw anything off the parapet walls.\r\n\r\nChildren under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult.\r\n\r\nNo pets are allowed.\r\n\r\nThe deck will be closed at 11:00 PM on 7/4/15.\r\n\r\nThank you for your cooperation and understanding.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJeff Klarfeld\r\n\r\nJeff Klarfeld, CPM\xc2\xae, Senior Property Manager\r\n\r\nHalstead Management Company, LLC.
