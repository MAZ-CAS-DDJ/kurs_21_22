This, of course, is driving  Republican political \nconsultants crazy.  Republicans have never gotten elected by laying out to the \nvoters the  core components of their economic agenda.  When they have been \nsuccessful it has generally been by soft-pedaling or  sugar-coating the \nthings that mattered most to their corporate backers and  playing instead to the \nfears and anxieties of their rank and file voters.  \nDuring his campaign  for re-election in 2004, George Bush never uttered a \nword about his plan to  privatize Social Security, cut guaranteed benefits \nand replace this massively  popular retirement system with a risky investment \nscheme that allowed Wall  Street to get its hands on the Social Security \ntrust fund.   But that was exactly his major  policy initiative once he was \nre-elected. \nIn the 2000  election, Bush didn\x92t focus his campaign on his plan to slash \nthe portion of  taxes paid by the wealthiest two percent of Americans and \npreside over a massive  transfer of wealth from the middle class to the rich. \nAnd he certainly didn\x92t  explain the policy of pre-emptive war that resulted \nin the trillion dollar  foreign policy disaster in Iraq.  \nNor, of course, did  Bush campaign on the pledge that he would take the \nlong-term surplus in the  federal budget he inherited from Clinton and turn it \ninto more debt, during his  term, than all of the Presidents before him in \nAmerican history put together.  \nThis  year, the Republican establishment is not worried about the primary \nvictories of  Tea Party candidates because they will advocate \x93far out\x94 \nextremists  policies.  Most of the Republican  Party leadership agrees with \nthose policies.  The problem is that these candidates  don\x92t seem to have enough \nsense \x96 or political experience -- to know that  they\x92re not supposed to \ngo around talking about those policies before they\x92re  elected.  \nTake Ken Buck, the winner of the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in  \nColorado.  He has made it crystal clear that he  simply does not believe in \nSocial Security.  In fact he said that Social Security is  \x93horrible policy.\x94  \nAccording to Politico, Buck told a right-wing audience last spring that \x94I \ndon\x92t  know that the federal government should be involved in a retirement \nplan,"  adding that the very idea of social insurance is "fundamentally \nagainst what I  believe." \nNow the actual content of this position is not really at variance with  \ntrue Republican orthodoxy.  The  Republican Party opposed Social Security when \nit was founded seventy-five years  ago, and fundamentally Republicans have \nnever supported the notion the  Government should be running a pension \nprogram. They believe in what President  Bush referred to as the \x93ownership \nsociety.\x94  Basically that means that the \x93private  market\x94 should take care of \nthings, and that if you\x92re not tough enough or smart  enough to make it by \nyourself, you\x92re \x93on your own, buddy.\x94  \nWhen it comes to  Social Security, Republicans have been trying to \nprivatize it and cut back  benefits for three quarters of a century.   \nThis year, they are particularly keen on taking action to cut back what  \nthey call this \x93entitlement\x94 because they don\x92t want the wealthy to have to \ntake  a hit when it comes to closing the long-term structural deficit that \nthey  created with their massive Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, and two costly \nwars.  \nRepublicans  would much rather cut the pensions of middle class retirees \x96  \nto whom Social Security pays the princely  average of $14,000 per year -- \nthan they would see tax rates for the rich go  back to where they were during \nboom years of the Clinton Administration. That\x92s  because the Bush tax cuts \nfor the rich saved each of the tiny number of  taxpayers making over \n$1,000,000 per year over $100,000 per year in taxes. For  the truly wealthy \x93\nmasters of the universe\x94 on Wall Street we\x92re talking  millions of dollars. \nWho can blame them?  I\x92m sure  most voters would agree that it\x92s more \nimportant to save millions for the guys  who sunk the economy and still make $10 \nmillion dollar bonuses \x96 rather than  protect the income of $14,000 per \nyear retirees.  Actually, maybe not.  And that\x92s exactly why most seasoned  \nRepublican candidates keep their mouths shut about such things \x96 but not the \nTea  Party gang.   \nThen there is Nevada Senate candidate Sharon Angle\x92s support for the  \nproposition that Medicare should be abolished and replaced with vouchers for  \nprivate insurance.  No worry that  virtually every Medicare beneficiary you \ntalk to loves the program -- and that  almost everyone over 55 years old can\x92t \nwait to qualify so that they no longer  have to take their chances with \nravenous private insurance companies.   \nOf course, like  Social Security, Republicans have opposed Medicare from \nits very inception as  well.  In 1996, Bill Clinton ran  commercials of an \niconic speech by his opponent Bob Dole bragging about how \x93he  was there, \nfighting against Medicare.\x94  And there was Newt Gingrich\x92s famous pledge that \nMedicare should \x93wither  on the vine.\x94   That makes it  doubly absurd that \nRepublicans campaigned against health care reform by  repeating over and over \nthe false claim that it would \x93cut Medicare.\x94  But truthfulness has never \nbeen endemic  to the Republican approach to political debate.  \nIn fairness there are some major, establishment Republican leaders who  \nbelieve that they should actually argue the merits of their totally unpopular  \npositions on issue like Social Security, Medicare and tax cuts for the  \nrich.  Congressman Paul Ryan, who  would be Chairman of the House Budget \nCommittee if the Republicans were to take  back control of the House, has published \na detailed \x93Roadmap\x94 on how he would  privatize Social Security and \nabolish Medicare and replace it with vouchers for  private insurance.   Much of  \nthat \x93roadmap\x94 was actually included in the Republican budget alternative \nthat  Ryan convinced the Republicans to support last year.  Now that vote has \nbegun to come back to  haunt some of the Members who would just as soon keep \ntheir economic views  safely in the closet before the voters cast their \nballots.  \nOver the next 90 days many Republicans may rue the day that they took  that \nvote \x96 or were seduced into believing that they could safely take the  \ncovers off their true views on Social Security, Medicare and tax breaks for the  \nrich.  \nThe problem is  that many of those swing districts that they would so \ndearly like to win this  fall have lots of senior voters.  They had been counting \non scaring those voters into supporting Republican  candidates with visions \nof \x93death panels\x94 and lies about health reform-induced  cuts in Medicare.  \nMany of those  seniors don\x92t like \x93government spending\x94 \x96 but by that \nthey are definitely not  referring to their Social Security or Medicare.  They \nview both as social insurance \x96 as  programs they have paid into throughout \ntheir working lives in expectation that  they would be entitled to the \nadvertised benefits \x96 the same way they would  under any insurance plan.   In  \nfocus groups the moment you tell these voters that Republicans support  \nprivatizing Social Security or replacing Medicare with vouchers for private  \ninsurance, Republican support plummets.  \nThe public soundly rejected President Bush\x92s attempt to privatize Social  \nSecurity in 2005.  You\x92d think that  the experience of the stock market \nmeltdown where millions of people saw their  life\x92s savings go up in smoke would \nbe enough to convince even the most orthodox  right-winger that it\x92s a \nterrible idea to tie Social Security to the ups and  downs of the stock market. \nBut economic reality doesn\x92t seem to break through  the Repubican\x92s \nideological and self-interest blinders. \nMajor Progressive organizations have launched a new coalition to press  \nMembers of Congress to defend Social Security and Medicare, and the issue has  \nvaulted to the top of the issue agenda for Democratic candidates across the  \ncountry.  Democratic House Members  conducted over 100 events to \ncommemorate the 75th Anniversary of  Social Security over the last weekend \x96 and to \npledge their opposition to  privatizing Social Security or cutting its \nbenefits.  That includes commitments not to raise  the retirement age \x96 an idea \nthat is just terrific for guys who fly around in  corporate jets, but doesn\x92t \ngo over so well if you happen to haul bricks on  construction sites or flip \nmattresses in hotel rooms for a living.  \nAmericans United  for Change \x96 which was first organized to run the \nsuccessful campaign to defeat  Bush\x92s 2005 attempt to privatize Social Security \x96 \nhas launched a major new  initiative to stop the \x93Republican sneak attack on \nSocial Security and  Medicare.\x94  \nThe Republicans  have a lot to worry about when it comes to these issues.  \nPolls show that if the voters are  talking about Social Security and \nMedicare on November 2nd,  Republican fortunes will drop like a rock.  In fact, \nthese two issues are like kryptonite to Republican chances.  That\x92s why you\x92ll \nsee mainstream  Republicans scramble like mad to downplay their true \nintentions \x96 and change the  subject over the weeks ahead. Republican Leader John \nBoehner \x96 who completely  supports Ryan\x92s \x93Road Map\x94 -- made the mistake \nseveral weeks ago of blurting out  that he supported raising the Social \nSecurity retirement age to 70.  Since then he has ducked and weaved when  it \ncomes to Social Security. \nBut the issue won\x92t go away, and the Republican record is clear.  Tea Party \nextremists who haven\x92t learned  yet to moderate their language \x96 and \nearnest true believers like Paul Ryan who  think they can convince America that \nwhat\x92s bad for them is good for them \x96 have  complicated the Republican \nproblem.  But the real problem is that  Republicans don\x92t believe in Social \nSecurity and Medicare \x96 and if the spotlight  shines long enough on those \nsubjects, their true colors will ultimately show  through.  It\x92s up to us to make \nsure  that it\x92s not just a spotlight but a laser. \nRobert Creamer is  a long-time political organizer and strategist and \nauthor of the recent book:  \x93Stand Up Straight: How Progressives Can Win,\x94 \navailable on _amazon.com_ \n(http://www.amazon.com/Listen-Your-Mother-Straight-Progressives/dp/0979585295/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1206567141&sr=8-1)\n . \n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
