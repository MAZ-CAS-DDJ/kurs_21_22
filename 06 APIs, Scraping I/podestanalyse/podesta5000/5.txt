Reps. Ann Marie Buerkle (NY-24) and Dan Benishek (MI-1) are the first candidates named to the program, called the "Flat Earth Five." A new House incumbent will be named to the program each week over the next three weeks.\n\nEarlier this week, LCV Senior Vice President of Campaigns Navin Nayak was featured on MSNBC\'s Hardball with Chris Matthews, where he talked about the "Flat Earth Five."\xa0Click here to view the video: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=nm0lScv1o5E9GPTyCGDHIw .\n\n**********\n\n:: LCV, MCV, and Hunter and Anglers Announce Partnership to Defeat Rehberg\n\nEarlier this month, Montana Hunters and Anglers Leadership Fund, Montana Conservation Voters, and the League of Conservation Voters announced a major partnership to defeat Congressman Dennis Rehberg\'s bid to represent Montana in the United States Senate.\xa0 Last week, a $350,000 television ad campaign began airing, targeting Rehberg\'s record on issues related to Montana\'s outdoor heritage.\n\nThe ad, launched in the Billings, Missoula, and Great Falls markets, is sponsored by the Montana Hunters and Anglers Leadership Fund and will air through July.\xa0The League of Conservation Voters has spent an additional $337,053 on door to door canvassing to date in Montana.\xa0Click here to view the ad: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=-aV41Yj2VpfNvGsIefHgmQ .\n\n**********\n\n:: LCV Launches Major TV Ad Buy Criticizing Heller Votes\n\nThis week, LCV launched a major $150,000 television ad campaign criticizing Nevada Senator Dean Heller for voting to protect tax breaks for Big Oil at the expense of clean energy. The ad, which is running in the Reno market, asks constituents to contact Senator Heller and urge him to vote to end oil industry tax breaks, which continues to be one of LCV\'s top legislative\npriorities.\xa0Click here to view the ad: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=LxH0XK16HHb7PeXjPTrOMg .\n\nHeller\'s extreme voting record has earned him an abysmal 14% lifetime score on LCV\'s National Environmental Scorecard.\xa0The non-partisan scorecard is a nationally accepted yardstick used to rate members of Congress on environmental and clean energy issues.\xa0For more information, visit http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=9M-J2OD6qp1jX5mg_EtoOw .\n\n**********\n\n:: Safe Chemicals Act Passes Senate Committee\n\nWe are pleased to report that this week the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee passed the Safe Chemicals Act affirming the urgent need to reform the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) in order to protect public health and the environment from toxic chemicals.\xa0This week\'s vote was the first on significant TSCA reform in over 35 years, despite a growing body of scientific\nevidence that demonstrates the link between chemicals in our everyday products and rising incidences of health problems, particularly in children.\n\nThe public can no longer afford to wait while Congressional Republicans and the industry employ tactics of deception and delay.\xa0The time for action is now.\xa0Click here to urge your senators to pass the Safe Chemicals Act: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=kESiVbW9We2ykMR9Gag_Mw .\n\n**********\n\n:: GiveGreen: Because not all money is "green"\n\nWith only 100 days to go until Election Day, now is the time to donate to pro-environment political candidates and if you care about the environment, the best giving strategy is to "bundle" your contributions with contributions from others who share your environmental values.\xa0Bundling through LCV Action Fund\'s GiveGreen magnifies the power of your contribution by calling attention to the environmental values that drive you to support the candidate in the first place.\xa0LCV Action Fund has already raised and contributed over $1 million in support of environmental candidates this cycle.\xa0Help us reach our goal of raising at least $1.5 million.\xa0Visit www.givegreen.com today to support LCV Action Fund\'s featured environmental champions.\n\n\nUpdate Your Profile\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=ABfLeaEl-3Ud4QAAsPXjag\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=8W55-edjgCPUtLHx8tUVpicjZK4bAsY0&cid=0\n\n1920 L Street, NW Suite 800 \nWashington, DC 20036\n202-785-8683'
