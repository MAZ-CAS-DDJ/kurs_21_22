The only question is, will you be the person who changes the equation by picking up the phone?\n\nGrab your phone and click here to connect with voters in your area right now:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/30Minutes2?zip=20016\n\nWe're not the only ones who want to get voters out to the polls this election season.\n\nThe other side has a plan, too.\n\nTheirs is a plan that outsources its messaging to big special interest groups that don't have to disclose where they're getting their millions in donations.\n\nIt's a plan that thinks that big money deserves a big mouthpiece.\n\nAnd right now, it's a plan at work in close districts around the country.\n\nSo in this moment, you can choose whether or not to counter it with your voice.\n\nYou can join the thousands of supporters around the country calling from their kitchens and their living rooms -- coffee shops and cubicles.\n\nBecause we know that this is when our most important work is done. And we know that we are the very best ones to do it.\n\nThere are just two days left until Election Day  -- two days to have the kinds of one-on-one conversations that we know make the difference in close races.\n\nAnd right now, the single best way you can affect how many people are at the polls on November 2nd is by using your voice, right now.\n\nClick this link and get started today:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/30Minutes2?zip=20016\n\nThanks,\n\nMitch\n\nMitch Stewart\nDirector\nOrganizing for America\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for America, a project of the Democratic National Committee -- 430 South Capitol Street SE, Washington, D.C. 20003.
