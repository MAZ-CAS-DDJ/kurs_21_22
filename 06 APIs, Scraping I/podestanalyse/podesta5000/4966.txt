SB 535 is one of the most significant developments in the arena of climate justice. It mandates that 25% of proceeds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund go to projects that benefit disadvantaged communities. With revenues expected to be $1 billion annually, this amounts to $272 million for disadvantaged communities this year. The California EPA is using CalEnviroScreen (a cumulative impacts screening tool) to identify disadvantaged communities.\n\nEPA will lead a discussion with a unique panel of leaders from communities, government and academia at the National Environmental Justice Conference and Training Program. They will share the "backstory" of the efforts to conceive, pass and now implement SB 535. They will provide first hand perspectives on lessons regarding their successes and challenges-past and present, as well as implications for other parts of the nation.\n\nPanelists:\n\n    * Shankar Prasad, CalEPA/OEHHA (formerly with Coalition for Clean Air)\n    * Mari Rose Taruc, Asian Pacific Environmental Network\n    * Arsenio Mataka, California Environmental Protection Agency\n    * Colleen Callahan, UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation\n\nModerator: Charles Lee, US Environmental Protection Agency\n\nDate: March 13, 2015\nTime: 3:30-4:30 PM\nPlace: Washington Marriott at Metro Center\n775 12th Street, N.W.\nWashington, DC 20005\n\nQuestions or additional info, please contact:\n\nCharles Lee\nlee.charles@epa.gov\n202-564-2597\n\nCarlton Eley\neley.carlton@epa.gov\n202-566-2841\n\nPiyachat Terrell\npiya10@gmail.com\n703-231-4764\n\nFor more information about the National Environmental Justice Conference, visit http://www.thenejc.org/.\n\n00617\n\n#############################################################################################\nIf you are not already a member, the Office of Environmental Justice would like to invite you to join the EJ List Serve.
