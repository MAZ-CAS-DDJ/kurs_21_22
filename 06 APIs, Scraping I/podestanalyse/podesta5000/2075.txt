Everyone had a good time with it -- not\nmany people wanted to miss out on my mother\'s cooking.\n\nIn addition to being a hell of a chef, my mother had a top-notch BS\ndetector -- she didn\'t always like the politicians she had dinner with. But\nlet me tell you: She loved Hillary.\n\nMy mother got to see what a genuine, passionate person Hillary is. She got\nto know Hillary, and I know she would be first in line to support her for\npresident.\n\n\n\n*I want you to get to know Hillary the way my mother got to know her --\nthat\'s why we\'re flying out a few supporters and their guests to have a\nprivate dinner with Hillary.
