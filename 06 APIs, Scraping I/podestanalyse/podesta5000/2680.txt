john.podesta@gmail.comb'[HRIFinalGray]     [RFKHR logo]   [IHRLC Alumni]\n\nYou are cordially invited to a discussion on:\n\nThe Ten-Year Anniversary of the Yean and Bosico Case and\nContinued Statelessness in the Dominican Republic\n\nTuesday, November 17, 2015\n10:00 a.m. - 12:00 noon\n200 McDonough Hall\n\nTen years ago, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights first held the Government of the Dominican Republic accountable for violations of the right to nationality in the landmark case of Yean and Bosico, which the UC Berkeley International Human Rights Law Clinic helped litigate. Despite the judgment, statelessness continues to be a major problem that affects the enjoyment of other rights, such as the right to education, as documented in the 2014 Georgetown Law Human Rights Institute report "Left Behind: How Statelessness in the Dominican Republic Limits Children\'s Access to Education." Moreover, in 2013, Judgment 168-13 issued by the Constitutional Court of the Dominican Republic exacerbated the problem of statelessness by retroactively stripping hundreds of thousands of Dominicans - primarily of Haitian descent - of their nationality.\n\nA panel of experts will take stock of the impact the citizenship and migration policies of the Dominican government have on people\'s lives and the solutions to resolve issues regarding the right to nationality moving forward. Additionally, the panel discussion will be informed by a recent fact-finding trip by Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights to the Dominican Republic. Santiago A. Canton, Executive Director of RFK Partners for Human Rights at Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights and Adjunct Professor of Law at the Georgetown University Law Center, will provide introductory remarks and lead the panel discussion. Shaw Drake (L\'14), who co-authored Left Behind, will return to the law school as a panelist. Coffee and light refreshments will be provided.\n\nThe Georgetown University Law Center is located at 600 New Jersey Avenue, NW, in Washington DC.\nFor more information, contact HRI fellow Patrick Griffith at pwg7@law.georgetown.edu<mailto:pwg7@law.georgetown.edu>.\n\n\n'
