We will  have a summary of the whole program to talk through with you but there is no need to read that in advance.  Attached to this email are several items that lay out options for an expanded Wyss Foundation Democracy Agenda. Attached are three sets of documents describing in more detail the new elements of the plan, including:\n\n\n*         A memo from Bill Roberts and the climate funding community for a massive registration surge. (VR Memo) (he and I sent you earlier versions)\n\n\n*         A plan for a new organization, Protect your Vote, to run state campaigns on voting and registration rules that was developed by the campaign director of the recent, successful Montana Same Day Registration campaign.  (Protect our Vote)\n\n\n*         A plan from PICO for expanded field-based registration and GOTV by independent political organizations. (National IVE Program)\n\nWe look forward to your feedback on this outline and the new strategies this week.  Let me know when will work for you.\n\nThanks,\n\nMolly\n\n\nMolly McUsic | President\nThe Wyss Foundation\n1601 Connecticut Ave. NW, Suite 802 |  Washington, DC 20009\nPhone: 202-232-4418 Ext. 12 | Fax: 202-232-4419\nwww.wyssfoundation.org<http://www.wyssfoundation.org/>\n\n"
