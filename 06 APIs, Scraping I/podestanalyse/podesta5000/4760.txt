Btw I visited with mcauliffe yesterday in richmond and he seems to be in a good place on this.\n\n[cid:image001.jpg@01CF7C19.0F57E980]\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nMonday, June 2, 2014\nContact: Jeff Gohringer, 202-454-4573 or Jeff_Gohringer@lcv.org<mailto:Jeff_Gohringer@lcv.org>\n\n\nLCV Statement on EPA\x92s Proposed Standards for Existing Power Plants\n\n\nWASHINGTON, DC \x96 League of Conservation Voters President Gene Karpinski released the following statement in response to the EPA\x92s proposed standards limiting carbon pollution from existing power plants, a core pillar of President Obama\x92s Climate Action Plan:\n\n\x93This is the biggest step we've ever taken for the biggest challenge we've ever faced. It helps meet our moral obligation to future generations to act on climate change at a time when we\x92re seeing impacts on our health and our communities nationwide. This is a plan that can be shaped by the states, giving Governors the flexibility they need. The American people support these commonsense safeguards and are sick of the lie that pollution has to be the fuel of our economic engine. The desperate and dirty opponents of these safeguards are using a failed, outdated playbook to protect their profits.\x94\n\nPolling<http://www.lcv.org/issues/polling/recent-polling-on-youth.pdf> conducted<http://www.lcv.org/issues/polling/the-facts-on-epa-and-climate.pdf> for<http://www.lcv.org/issues/polling/11-state-polling-memo.pdf> LCV showed that 80 percent of young voters and 74 percent of voters in key battleground states support the Obama administration\x92s plan to address climate change by limiting carbon pollution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###\n\n"
