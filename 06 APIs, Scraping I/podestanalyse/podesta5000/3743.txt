john.podesta@gmail.comb'Friend,\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be brief. I\xe2\x80\x99m just getting ready to head out the door as I am sure many of you are, but I want to remind you that in a few short hours we close the books on our biggest fundraising deadline of the year. My team just informed me that we are $855 away from our goal and we need your help.\n\nFollow this link to contribute online.\n\nYour support, by midnight tonight, \xc2\xa0will ensure that we reach our goal and have the resources we need to win this election.\n\nPlease consider a contribution before midnight. Thank you for your continued support.\n\nHave a Happy New Year\xe2\x80\x99s,\n\nShelli\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|    Paid for by Shelli Yoder for Indiana.
