john.podesta@gmail.comb'Britain is something of the odd man out in immigration-devastated Europe,\nhaving also received large numbers of successful non-Western immigrants such\nas Hindus/Sikhs and Chinese. By sharp contrast, the UK\'s Muslims, blacks,\nRoma and other problem immigrant groups do no better than those on the\nContinent, as I will show with statistics at a later date.\n\nMuslim Immigration and Multicultural Madness have left a trail of misery and\nmayhem across Germany - with far worse to come because of demographics\n\n\xb7        Muslims make up only 9% of Berlin\'s population, yet account for 70%\nof young repeat criminals, revealed Berlin public prosecutor Roman Reusch\nhttp://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-51448987.html. To be more precise, 46%\nof Berlin\'s juvenile serial criminals are of Arab descent, while 33% of them\nhave Turkish ancestry\nhttp://www.bz-berlin.de/archiv/jugendkriminalitaet-article961342.html. In an\nun-German display of harsh-truth telling, Reusch said in Der Spiegel that\n"in parts [of Berlin], the population consist almost exclusively of problem\ncases." As he tells it, immigrant children as young as six or seven years\nold turn to crime and grow up to see honest hard-working people as targets -\nwalking sources of easy money. German society is completely powerless in the\nface of growing ruthless violence and crime. To describe the German police\nand criminal-justice system as a big joke would be unfair to big jokes. You\nwon\'t be surprised to hear that the outspoken public prosecutor has\nmeanwhile been sacked from his job and banned from talking to the media.\n\n\xb7        The German police admits that large immigrant areas of Berlin,\nHamburg, the Ruhr Area, etc. have become police no-go areas, where criminals\nand extremists have free reign. Within no time at all, a lone police patrol\ncar making a foray into Germany\'s ethnic war zones finds itself surrounded\nby a baying lynch mob, much like US soldiers in Baghdad at the height of the\ntroubles, added Roman Reusch.\n\nCheck out footage of Berlin\'s Wedding district, which has become too\ndangerous for a single police officer to work in, as told by a policeman\ndressed in civilian clothes for his own safety\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4ZLv84i3Gw\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4ZLv84i3Gw&feature=related>\n&feature=related. A ZDF report http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBgsqPgEcEk\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBgsqPgEcEk&feature=related>\n&feature=related explains that rapidly growing immigrant violence against\npolice officers is not confined to Berlin and Hamburg. The Ruhr Area, to\nmention another example, has also seen the emergence of ghettoized police\nno-go areas. That is confirmed by a Westen interview\nhttp://www.derwesten.de/politik/in-problemvierteln-fuerchtet-sich-sogar-die-\npolizei-id4926287.html with Bernhard Witthaut, the tightlipped chairman of\nGermany\'s largest police union, who knows so much more than he is prepared\nto let on.\n\n\xb7        A police spokesman points out Berlin\'s ever-worsening ultraviolent\nghettos on a map http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbXjKCJLAg\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CbXjKCJLAg&feature=player_embedded>\n&feature=player_embedded. In a few decades, he won\'t need to be so precise\nand can just wave in the general direction of Berlin. The operative word is\ndemographics - a concept alien to German Leftists, who suffer from a severe\ncase of innumeracy.\n\n\xb7        Whites are fleeing West Berlin to escape immigrant violence\nspecifically targeting native Germans. So says juvenile court judge Kirsten\nHeisig in a ZDF report http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sCxZZLWeUU\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sCxZZLWeUU&feature=related>\n&feature=related. Groups of heavily armed young Turks and Arabs routinely\nbeat white youngsters into pulp, especially their faces and teeth, while\nfilming the whole episode for distribution among their mates. The juvenile\ncourt judge provides the grisly details\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DHJouSioDU\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DHJouSioDU&feature=player_embedded>\n&feature=player_embedded.\n\n\xb7        Anti-white racism of the most virulent kind has become a fact of\nlife across Europe, but perhaps nowhere more so than in Germany. Kirsten\nHeisig\'s book When Patience Comes to an End details the visceral hatred many\nMuslims feel toward native Germans, who are subjected to a daily torrent of\nabuse and ethnic slurs in their own country. Even young Turkish women think\nnothing of calling native girls "German whores" and chanting that "Germans\nshould be gassed," she writes. Here young Muslim women shout "So sieht\nDeutscher Inzest aus" at police officers\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqeXMFrfVg8\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqeXMFrfVg8&feature=related>\n&feature=related.\n\nLone native students at Muslim immigrant-dominated vocational high schools\nquite often won\'t last a week and are lucky to escape their bullies\nphysically unhurt. In this footage, four immigrants mug a German man in a\nBerlin subway station, beating him into a coma and leaving him permanently\nbrain-damaged http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h33KeFIOk7A. The four\nperpetrators were teenagers from Albania, Kosovo, Iraq and Nigeria, who had\nearlier shouted "Schei\xdf-Nazis" and "wir hassen Deutsche" at the victim and\nhis colleagues. The fact that, in all likelihood, most or all of them are\nrefugees granted asylum by Goody-Goody Germany further adds to the heinous\nnature of the crime. I can give similar examples until the cows come home,\nand these are only the ones that somehow slipped past the censors. Clearly,\nGermany is now well beyond the banana republic phase and has entered the\nrealm of patsydom. Always lurching from one form of extremism to the next,\nGermans have now decided that the role of an \xfcber-schlemiel is a perfect\nfit. The New CorrectThink is: Deutschland unter alles!\n\n\xb7        As Green Party Co-Leader Cem \xd6zdemir acknowledges, anti-Semitism is\nrife and rampant among German Turks and other Muslims. Matters are no better\nin Turkey itself, if a Dutch English-language article is anything to go by\nhttp://www.investigativeproject.org/2075/resurgence-of-anti-semitism-in-turk\ney. This footage with English subtitles of two anti-Semitic incidents\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9nbKp1KJ1Y\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9nbKp1KJ1Y&feature=related>\n&feature=related was recorded in the Netherlands, but could just as easily\nhave been filmed anywhere else in Western Europe. Multicultural Europe is\nringing to the sound of Judenbeschimpfungen, and we ain\'t heard nothing yet.\nEven pre-Toulouse, various in-the-loop sources said that many if not most\nJews in Continental Europe were ready to flee to Israel or America at a\nmoment\'s notice. The German Left always hears echoes of the 1930s and 40s,\nand they don\'t know how right they are.\n\n\xb7        43% of gays in Berlin have experienced hate crimes perpetrated by\nMuslims in particular, while two thirds of Turkish high school students in\nBerlin display homophobia\nhttp://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,562638,00.html. The same\npicture can be seen in the rest of  Multicultural Europe. To quote the\nToronto Sun\nhttp://www.torontosun.com/comment/columnists/ezra_levant/2010/10/08/15630946\n.html, "If you think Amsterdam is the gay capital of Europe, you\'re\nhalf-right, but 10 years out of date. Today it\'s the gay-bashing capital of\nEurope." Although I can quibble over one or two remarks made in the article,\nits main thrust is spot on. \n\n\xb7        Yet another target group for young Muslim males consists of German\ngirls. I am not only referring to the large number of white sex slaves once\nor still held by German Muslim pimps\nhttp://www.zdf.de/ZDFmediathek/beitrag/video/1507644/Mit-Liebe-in-die-Falle-\ngelockt#/beitrag/video/1507644/Mit-Liebe-in-die-Falle-gelockt (the most\nconservative estimate for the Netherlands is 6,000), but also German girls\nand women in general. About 2.5 minutes into this clip\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDoOxBppK0U\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDoOxBppK0U&NR=1&feature=endscreen>\n&NR=1&feature=endscreen, Muslim feminist Seyran Ate\xfe explains that young\nMuslim men use the word Hure as an abusive term for German girls as a matter\nof course. Another favorite is Deutsche Schlampe.\n\n\xb7        Unlike the Multikultis, the German working class cannot block out\nor distort awful reality and needs to live in the real world. For example, I\nhave a hunch that there are precious few Multikulti converts to be found\namong German bus drivers http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21PUr8NBjBo\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21PUr8NBjBo&feature=related>\n&feature=related. In another clip, a German bus company spokesman explains\nthat even immigrant pensioners beat up bus drivers. Let me also show you\nimages of a 78-year-old German female shopkeeper hit 50 times in her face by\na 14-year-old Bosnian http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crWXxpjEbNg\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crWXxpjEbNg&list=UU6G0I-JHFGh94Sr7GRji3Ew&in\ndex=2&feature=plcp> &list=UU6G0I-JHFGh94Sr7GRji3Ew&index=2&feature=plcp. The\nyoung robber belongs to a family granted asylum by Germany. Heart-warming,\ndon\'t you think? \n\n\xb7        Der Spiegel\nhttp://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,654921,00.html reports\nthat a staggering 50% of Berlin\'s Turks live on the dole. But if you include\nstay-at-home Turkish women living indirectly off benefits, the unemployment\nfigure rises to about 70%! Everything I\'ve read about Berlin\'s Arabs\nsuggests to me that subsidized slothfulness among them is even worse. A\nhumorous sign in America\'s Rocky Mountain National Park sums up what is\nwrong with Welfarized Europe, "Please do not feed the squirrels. If you feed\nthe squirrels, they\'ll become overweight, and prone to disease. Their\npopulation will grow, and they\'ll lose their ability to forage for food on\ntheir own. They will expect you to feed them and will attack you if you\ndon\'t. They\'ll become like little welfare recipients, and you wouldn\'t want\nto do this to them."\n\n\xb7        A mind-mashing 63% of preschool immigrant children (often 4th\ngeneration!) in Berlin\'s Kreuzberg district speak little or no German and\nare theoretically inadmissible to an elementary school, reveals Professor of\nPedagogy Ali Ucar in Time magazine. That\'s what Muslim parents call "giving\nyour child a head start in life." The wider problem is that these kids bring\nalong zilch educational and character-building baggage, courtesy of\ncan\'t-be-bothered parents. The poverty of aspiration among welfarized Muslim\nimmigrants is a far greater impediment to progress than the poverty of\nwealth experienced by newcomers in the distant past. \n\n\xb7        At one Berlin vocational high school visited by Spiegel TV Magazin\nreporters http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sagPdsof1Hc\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sagPdsof1Hc&feature=player_embedded>\n&feature=player_embedded, up to 50% of immigrant students in some classes\nare unteachable, which may well be representative for Berlin. Not that the\nrest is Nobel Prize material, to use the understatement of the past\nmillennium. It\'s worth your while to view the whole report, which will leave\neven the most jaded observers shocked and depressed. Ordinary Germans will\npick up the tab in the form of astronomic welfare costs and an extremely\nviolent crime wave.\n\n\xb7        Young Turkish criminals have a vocabulary of 500 German words\nlargely devoid of any grammar. As a matter of fact, Time writes that most\nthird-generation Turks speak insufficient German (read: Mickey Mouse German)\nand that almost three-quarters of German Turks live in Turkish-speaking\nenclaves. You will be straining to follow any of the Turks in the featured\nclips, whose German is so dreadful as to be almost comical.\n\n\xb7        The language skills of Arab criminals (in Germany, Arab is catchall\ntag for anyone from that region) do not seem to be any better than those of\nTurkish street goons. Here you\'ve got a young Arab street thug in a TV\nstudio http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy9HCYs1V14 telling a German audience\nthat he routinely beats up Germans for money and for "giving him a wrong\nlook." However, his Street German is so bad that even Germans can hardly\nmake out what he is saying. He could well be a member of the untouchable\nKurdish-Lebanese 2,600-member Miri clan - one of many Arab clans and\nextended families who plunder and terrorize Germany with total impunity. The\nPC-straightjacketed German police strikes me as being no more effective than\nthe two bungling detectives in The Adventures of Tintin. \n\n\xb7        The cataclysmic language situation among Deutscht\xfcrken does not\nstop Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Prime Minister of Greater Turkey, from making\nthe beyond-bizarre demand that German Turks learn Turkish as a first\nlanguage and continue speaking Turkish in a foreign land. Pushing the\nenvelope like a bulldozer, he is now even clamoring for Turkish-only high\nschools in Germany. Well, why not? He is already in full control of all\nTurkish mosques in Germany and might just as well go the whole hog. During a\n2001 speech before German Turks in the city of D\xfcsseldorf, he even had the\ngall to tell them, "You\'re my citizens!" When will Germany, which is\nbeginning to look like a Turkish colony, come to its senses? \n\n\xb7        With a rapidly graying population of 82 million, Germany is now\nplaying host to 5 million Muslims. They divide into 4 million Turks\n(including 400,000 Turkish Kurds), 500,000 Arabs (a label used for just\nabout anyone from that part of the world), 300,000 Ethnic Albanians\n(originate in Albania, Kosovo and the Republic of Macedonia) and smaller\ngroups. That figure of 4 million Turks - which includes second-, third- and\nfourth-generation Turks - comes from Wikipedia, The Globe and Mail and other\nsources. Not factored in are the large numbers of illegal Turkish immigrants\nliving in Little Istanbuls across Germany and working in the black-market\neconomy.\n\nPredictably, I could not readily find reliable info on the future ethnic\nface of Germany. So for demographic clues, let\'s look at France, which is\nhome to 62 million people, including 6 million Muslims. A Jerusalem Post\narticle http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Article.aspx?id=170731 and\nother sources expect France\'s Muslim community to be the majority within 50\nyears. "If the low birth rate of indigenous French citizens and the prolific\ndemographic expansion of the existing 6 million Muslims continue," writes\nthe newspaper, "there is every likelihood that in 50 years France would\nbecome a predominantly Muslim nation." In actual fact, The Jerusalem Post is\nbeing wildly overoptimistic, having completely overlooked a game-changing\nevent: Turkey\'s probable entry into the EU, which is the herd of pink\nelephants in the immigration debate.\n\nLocally and regionally, Muslim dominance will make itself felt much sooner\nin Europe. For example, overwhelmingly Muslim immigrants already account for\nabout half of the population in the Netherlands\' four biggest cities, even\nforming a small majority in Amsterdam. An even more striking example is\nBrussels, Europe\'s Capital. Predominantly Muslim non-Western immigrants\nrepresent 70% of the Brussels population and will reach 85% within a decade,\naccording to sociologist Jan Hertogen, whose delight at this development\nknows no bounds. To put it vividly, Brussels has turned into one Big\nBanlieue, except for the EU & NATO Gravy Train, whose official religion of\nPCness could not contrast more sharply with dire reality across Western\nEurope. Belgium\'s second-largest city, Antwerp, will have a\nmajority-immigrant population within less than a decade, while other major\nBelgian cities are not that far behind.\n\n\xb7        A Turk with a sense of humor or realism has marked out future\n"Turkish Europe" on a map http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSb6BNRly5Q\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSb6BNRly5Q&feature=related>\n&feature=related. Actually, he is being modest! Indulging in a bit of\nwild-eyed speculation, I suspect that Turkey\'s PM envisages the creation a\n"Greater Turkey sphere of influence" along the lines of what is shown 40\nseconds into this clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Dzq_mKhok\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Dzq_mKhok&feature=fvwrel> &feature=fvwrel.\nAmong so much else, this includes the Great Seljuq Empire, the Ottoman\nEmpire, the Mogul Empire, all regions speaking a Turkic language (200\nmillion people have a Turkic language as their native or second tongue), the\nwhole Muslim world, plus rapidly growing "Satellite Dish Europe," which may\nwell double in number or much more on Turkey\'s likely admission into the EU.\nOnce the influx of Turks picks up momentum, the whole of Western Europe will\nfrantically wave them on in the direction of Germany, shouting at the top of\ntheir lungs, "Deutschland gut, Deutschland multikulti!"\n\n\xb7        While women\'s shelters are overflowing with terrified immigrant\nwomen, nutty-as-a-fruitcake German judges tell abused Muslim women that\ntheir inhumane treatment at the hands of their menfolk is all in the game\nfor Muslim females. "In Germany today," The Independent\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-ho\nw-multiculturalism-is-betraying-women-446806.html writes, "Muslim women have\nbeen reduced to third-class citizens stripped of core legal protections -\nbecause of the doctrine of Multiculturalism, which says a society should be\ndivided into separate cultures with different norms according to ethnic\norigin." Also bear in mind that most abused Muslim women are too terrified\nto ask for outside help in the first place and for good reason. Germany,\ntoo, has seen its fair share of reported honor attacks, which probably only\nform the top of the tip of the iceberg. It is much more difficult but not\nimpossible to hide honor murders. Given the shocking attitudes of young\nGerman Muslims toward honor crimes\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaBj0SSmXvo\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaBj0SSmXvo&feature=related>\n&feature=related, Germany must brace itself for much more of the same.\n\n\xb7        The German Multikulti Terror State is an extremely dangerous place\nfor the Politically Incorrect. To mention just four immigration critics,\nKirsten Heisig killed herself; Seyran Ate\xfe went into hiding after an attack\nin which no one lifted a finger to help her; Thilo Sarrazin will require\nbody guards for the rest of his life; while Roman Reusch has been demoted\nand media-muzzled. In the blink of an eye, I could Google together half a\ndozen prominent activists who have suffered similar fates. On top of that,\nthousands of second-tier dissidents have probably been ostracized and\nharassed out of existence. Hey, who needs the Stasi, when you\'ve got the\nMultikultis?!\n\n\xb7        Perhaps mentally exhausted from her lone uphill battle against the\nMighty Multikulti Mafia, juvenile court judge Kirsten Heisig committed\nsuicide in 2010. What will not have helped matters were the growing number\nof unbearably grisly cases she was facing on a daily basis, as well as the\ndeath threats and unimaginable invective directed at anyone foolish enough\nto speak out on the Immigration Disaster. This clip\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOQda5kOTUo displays an English-language text\nsaying that many believe that the judge was murdered and goes on to show\nGerman news footage of her with English subtitles. Her book When Patience\nComes to an End became a No. 1 bestseller in Germany and will spawn a movie.\n\n\xb7        At the same time, ghastly tidings from the rest of Western Europe\nkeep coming in thick and fast. A tiny selection from my bulging mailbag:\n100,000 girls and women mutilated by FGM practitioners in the UK; an\nimmigrant rape epidemic in Scandinavia; four Jews and three soldiers\nmurdered in France; predominantly black gangs have parceled up and terrorize\nLondon; Pakistani lover boys ply their awful trade in Britain almost without\nlet or hindrance; plus public-transportation workers, hospital staff,\nambulance employees, firemen and police officers across the Continent suffer\nfrom unbelievable levels of violence, threats and verbal abuse from\nimmigrants, with some of the most appalling scenes witnessed in Sweden,\nrated as having the worst immigration record in the whole of Western Europe\nby Elsevier magazine.\n\n\xb7        Almost all Turks in Germany and Turkey are in complete denial about\nDeutscht\xfcrken\'s atrocious behavior across the board and even bask in utterly\nrisible victimhood. What strikes me the most about a Turkish culture so\nobsessed with "honor" is the total absence of any shame over bringing so\nmuch hatred, aggression, crime, misery, urban decay, welfare costs and\ndysfunctionality in all areas of life to Germany and other European host\ncountries. In a brief window of opportunity - which was slammed shut in the\nwake of the media coverage surrounding the Far-Right Murders - German public\ntelevision made a few halfhearted attempts to debate catastrophic\nimmigration in Germany. If I heard this correctly while listening with half\nan ear, at the beginning of one program, a Turkish interviewee unblinkingly\ndescribed immigration in Germany as "ein Erfolgsmodel" (a success model),\nwithout eliciting roars of Homeric laughter from the studio audience. I\ncould almost hear the WDR journalist thinking, "Oh my God, we\'ve got a live\none here," before he went into full career-protection mode and managed his\nbest bullshit smile ever. One of the few exceptions in the Turkish community\nis feminist-social scientist Necla Kelek, who has defended Thilo Sarrazin,\nthe b\xeate noire of German politics, explaining that he addresses "bitter\ntruths" in his much-talked-about book.\n\nThe Multikulti Mullahs still have Germany in a chokehold, but for how much\nlonger? \n\nMulticulturalism - the human variant of mad cow disease - seems to have run\nits course in much of Europe, but is still going strong in Germany. Tune\ninto German television or visit German news websites, and it\'s like going\nback in time to much darker days. Most (but definitely not all!) German\nmedia coverage of Turkish and other Muslim immigrants is just one big blur\nof Multikulti twaddle. In fact, the reporting is so delightfully deceitful\nthat it becomes entertaining in a demented freaky sort of way. In strident\ndenial of staring-them-in-the-face immigration calamities, the vast majority\nof German journalists continue to preach the multicultural gospel with all\nthe religious fervor of snake-oil televangelists, threatening the growing\nnumber of apostates with fire and brimstone.\n\nFor example, the Hezbollah faction within the ZDF sees the subject of\nDeutschenha\xdf (hatred of Germans) as one big joke and uses its well-honed\nrapier wit to maximum effect http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MLzDMtmxmQ\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MLzDMtmxmQ&feature=related>\n&feature=related. The phrase cringe television does not even begin to do\njustice to Germany\'s Multikulti TV. Even worse than many journalists are\nGerman Leftwing politicians, who are to lying what Holland is to cheese.\nBaron M\xfcnchhausen cannot hold a candle to, say, SPD and Green politicians\nwaxing lyrical about immigration and rejecting the crushing facts of life\nwith deadpan delivery. To quote Canada\'s Globe and Mail newspaper\nhttp://m.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/angela-merkel-says-the-unsayable-on-\nmultikulti/article1381180/?service=mobile, "Like Canadians, Germans have\nbeen swamped by official propaganda celebrating the joys of ethnic\ndiversity. In both countries, expressing doubts over immigration policy has\nbeen socially verboten."\n\nAlthough Germany is now surrounded by smaller nations that are beginning to\nsee the light (the Netherlands, Flanders, Denmark, Switzerland and Austria),\nGermany remains trapped in the PC Dark Ages. Why is this so? Under Hitler\'s\nlooming shadow - which obliterates any well-informed and rational discussion\nof snowballing immigration problems - German Polite Society has long had an\neasy task of ruthlessly imposing its particular brand of PC Nastiness on the\nGerman masses. The frequent invocation of Hitler still serves as a nuclear\nweapon in the immigration debate, as infantile as that may sound to more\nmature and developed nations. German society is like a dog that has never\noutgrown its puppy phase, and the Left is hell-bent to keep it that way. Say\nanything deviating one syllable from Loopy Lefty orthodoxy, and you are\naccused of being a Nazi (quite often by folks with strong Leftwing Nazi\ncredentials), put your career at risk, face ostracization and become an easy\ntarget for violence and intimidation from Muslim Supremacists and Black\nBlockers. The German national character also comes into play. Most Germans\nare docile, group-oriented and fearful of authority to a degree that their\nnaturally rebellious and big-mouthed Dutch neighbors - the New Yorkers of\nEurope, if you will - would find side-splittingly hilarious.\n\nBut as Johan Cruyff famously observed, "Every disadvantage has its\nadvantage." The rapidly escalating immigration mess created by Germany\'s\nMultikulti-Narren has now become so horrendous that reality can no longer be\nhidden from view. Quite a few \xfcber-shocking media reports had slipped past\nthe PC censors, before the Far-Right Murders put a halt to that blast of\nglasnost. In three years\' time, a select group of German journalists with\nballs and brains will probably pick up where they left off and will once\nagain tell the unvarnished truth on immigration. Equally important, more\nthan half of Germans are now in revolt against the Leftwing Establishment,\nand their number will only increase in the face of the demographics-driven\nbanlieue-ization of their country. Germany has also produced a dozen\nimmigration critics of note, including those mentioned in my previous email.\nEven Angela Merkel, normally as cautious as a snail braking hard for a curve\nin the road, felt compelled to talk to the nation like a Dutch uncle\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKG76HF24_k. What is further working against\nthe Multikultis\' still-iron grip on power is that Germany is becoming the\nodd man out in its own neck of the woods. Thankfully, the sort of PC\nWackoism that is pretty much prevalent among Germany\'s Ruling Classes is\ngetting rarer by the day in Western Europe and is being steadily pushed out\nto the fringes of Western Europe (Britain and Sweden/Norway).\n\nThe demasqu\xe9 of the Multikulti Horror State is complete, but that news has\nnot yet reached the German powers that be\n\nPolish-born Henryk Broder is well aware that neighboring countries - left\nreeling from their own immigration experience - are beginning to regard\nGermany as la ris\xe9e de l\'Europe. In a TV appearance\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkvlT2dLSMs\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkvlT2dLSMs&feature=related>\n&feature=related, Broder makes a scathing assessment of German Polite\nSociety, which is incapable of accepting even the most basic home truths and\nhaving a productive public debate about an issue that, because of\nunrelenting demographics, will loom ever larger in Germany. The enfant\nterrible of German journalism takes the whole Multicultural Cabal to task\nand cuts through all the crap: Almost all immigrant problems in Germany are\nMuslim-connected. No number of red herrings fished up by the multi-billion\nDiversity Industry will ever change that Mother of All Facts. And no amount\nof starry-eyed rhetoric on the part of Green Party Co-Leader Cem \xd6zdemir,\nwho locks horns with Broder in the TV program, will ever make the slightest\nbit of difference. You might just as well try to wish gravity away.\n\nTragically, the immigration situation is so much worse than even Broder\nthinks in his lily-white innocence. Just take a load of the litany of human\ndisasters in Germany detailed above. Alternatively, examine the state of\naffairs in equally blighted neighboring countries. Let me quote a few facts\nand figures from the Netherlands - the only country in the world where\noft-devastating immigration statistics are fairly freely available.\nShockingly, 55% of all young Moroccan males in the Netherlands have been the\nsubject of a police investigation\nhttp://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=GIE2B2Q4K. Indeed,\nthe unofficial, yet reliable figure for Amsterdam is 70%! As if all of that\nweren\'t deeply troubling enough, psychologist Indra Boedjarath\nhttp://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4324/nieuws/article/detail/1394009/2007/10/27/Dubb\nelleven-Marokkanen-fnuikt-psyche.dhtml explains that many Moroccan\nyoungsters suffer from psychological problems, adding that numerous Moroccan\ncriminals are "slightly mentally handicapped." On and on it goes.\n\nAlthough I have only built up a very rough impression of the Dutch\nequivalent of the BBC\'s Crimewatch program (cannot bear to watch it for more\nthan a few seconds at a time), the common thread running through all\nepisodes seems to be that almost all of the thugs are non-Western immigrants\nand that almost all the victims are whites. The victims are often on the\nbottom rungs of society - from supermarket staff to frail senior citizens,\nwho have been intimidated, humiliated, robbed, beaten silly or stabbed with\nblood-curdling brutality in their own country. The crime-program makers have\neven developed their own PC language to identify the never-ending immigrant\nrogues\' gallery paraded on Dutch TV screens, week after deeply depressing\nweek. Moroccan suspects have a "North African appearance," while blacks have\na "negroid appearance." Not that long ago, one Dutch black comedian joked\nthat he watched this crime show to see what his mates had been up to, but\nfew Dutch people were laughing.\n\nThe newly published book The Immigration Taboo by Joost Niem\xf6ller discloses\nthat 50% of the Netherlands\' non-Western immigrants are unemployed, adding\nthat this percentage is seven times worse than that among natives.\nPresumably, he confines himself to those actually drawing unemployment\nbenefits. Throw in the little-discussed fact that almost all immigrant women\nin the Netherlands are unemployable according to the NRC newspaper, and real\nunemployment (all working-age people without jobs) among immigrants in\nHolland may well come out at 70% or thereabouts. Could it even be worse? Has\nNiem\xf6ller also counted all those immigrants who are jobless, yet have been\nfalsely declared "disabled"? Bear in mind that the tiny Netherlands holds\nthe per-capita world record for the number of people on various forms of\n"disability" benefits, aka the Scam of the Century, namely 715,000.\nEverything I write needs to be carefully fact-checked; I\'ve worked with\ngreat haste not only due to time restraints, but also because I find\nnon-Western immigration an excruciatingly depressing subject.\n\nMore broadly speaking, there is not even a single Western European country\nwith a successful Muslim community, as I\'ve shown with granite-hard facts\nand figures and will further substantiate with more of the same. Instead, in\nonly slightly varying degrees, Muslim immigration is just one long tale of\nwoe and misery for the long-suffering host countries, which are in for far\nworse to come in the decades ahead because of barely understood demographic\nrealities. Incidentally, the same sad observation can be made of the Black\nDiaspora in Western Europe, North America, Latin America and the Caribbean\n(see previous statistics-packed emails and upcoming info - you have yet to\nreceive these!).\n\nGermany\'s Immigration Disaster Deniers have as much credibility as alien\nabductees spirited away in a UFO with Bigfoot at the controls\n\nImmigration Disaster Denial has deep roots in German society and goes way\nbeyond the usual suspects - aging Communists in their last hurrah (so\nleft-over \'60s rabble and relics of the GDR dictatorship). Almost as fanatic\nand myopic are the folks called das liberale Bildungsb\xfcrgertum, to use Roman\nReusch\'s caustic epithet for Germany\'s Class of Educated Ignoramuses, who\nlive in a whites-only cocooned fantasy world and indulge in Gutmenscherei at\nthe expense of the vulnerable in society, slandered as "racists" when they\nhave the chutzpah to complain about their awful lot. Suffer in silence, will\nyou, and let us dream on! For example, I was aghast to learn that the\nflat-earthist book The Scaremongers: The German Fear of Islam had been\npenned by a journalist in the employ of the Frankfurter Allgemeine and not\nsome fringe Trot rag. Who would have thought? It\'s almost as if Germany\'s\nBabbling Classes wish to make up for their lack of humor and humanity with\nnonstop misguided moralizing and grotesque grandstanding. In my experience,\nthose who holler the loudest about morality possess the least amount of it.\n\nHistory will render a devastating verdict on the FAZ journalist and all\nother flat earthers, lampooning the PC Era as a period of moral and mind\nmeltdown of the sort Europe has seen so often in recent times. However, that\nis cold comfort to the many long-suffering victim groups described in my\nmessages, including white elderly people who are imprisoned in their own\nhomes in ethnic hellholes and are forced to live out their final days amid\nhorrific levels of vandalism, theft, vitriolic threats and violence from\neven very young immigrant children, backed up by bigger siblings and\nparents, as I heard in distressing accounts. I also witnessed some of these\nblood-boiling scenes in South Rotterdam. The very least that white senior\ncitizens across the multiculturally afflicted parts of Western Europe can\nexpect is name-calling and intimidation, as exemplified by footage with\nEnglish subtitles http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYqzy-QrQZM\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYqzy-QrQZM&feature=related>\n&feature=related of a white elderly woman in a city train in Copenhagen who\nis being bullied by a North African man (probably a Moroccan). One highly\nunusual comment to the Danish train clip reads, "My Muslim brothers are such\npigs, I understand why everyone hates them."\n\nIn various interviews, ex-public prosecutor Roman Reusch reserved special\nscorn for Germany\'s Clueless Cultural Classes, who sit pretty in their\naffluent whites-only enclaves far removed from all the ethnic misery and\nengage in exalted Multikulti-Moralreiterei to the severe detriment of the\nworking hoi polloi. He sharply contrasts the Multikultis\' lofty position in\nsociety with that of a lowly sales assistant who has already been robbed\nthree times by hordes of armed immigrants and needs to pop tranquilizers\nevery morning, so that she can get through another day in the multicultural\nwar zone http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aqc7mxcfJbI\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aqc7mxcfJbI&feature=related>\n&feature=related. In the words of German journalist Sabine Beppler-Spahl,\n"Being \'pro-immigration\' and \'pro-multiculturalism\' in Germany today is like\na lifestyle choice, a way of proving that you are culturally refined and\ncosmopolitan, unlike the supposedly uncultured, racist working classes."\nEvery German pays a hefty price for botched immigration through higher\ntaxes, but it is bottom-of-the-heap whites in the "war trenches of society,"\nwho figuratively and literally bleed for the ignorance, idiocy and\ncallousness of the Yapping Classes. Sadly, the working class is only one of\nvarious segments of German society increasingly hurting and suffering at the\nhands of Muslim immigrants. Other hard-hit victim groups include Jews, gays,\nthe old and frail, plus native young people. And matters are set to get so\nmuch worse for them, owing to dramatic demographics, including Turkey\'s\nlikely admission into the EU.\n\nThe info contained in my emails shatters this cozy image of a Multicultural\nUtopia, long flogged by Germany\'s Diversity Mongers. In one or two\nfollow-ups, I\'ll be presenting more details on the issues raised here plus\nnew material. In examining German immigration, you need to make a sharp\ndistinction between the country\'s Muslims (Turks, Arabs, etc.) and its\nnon-Muslim immigrants (Poles, Greeks, Italians, Vietnamese, etc.). By and\nlarge, the second group appears to be faring well. As part of a thick\nsmokescreen created around the Muslim Immigration Debacle, the German Left\nlikes to lump all immigrants together.\n\nMy Internet Blitz across Germany confirmed my very worst fears. All my\nwritings require thorough checking, investigation and consideration, though.\nTruth be told, I am no expert on Germany at all and only follow developments\nthere with a hundredth of an eye and ear, if that. There must have been a\npoint in my life when I simply gave up on a country whose Yapping Classes\nappear to have all the acuity of mind seen in a special-needs schoolyard and\nall the moral courage found in a weasel farm. To paraphrase that old JFK\nquip, when I digitally rampaged through Germany, the thing that surprised me\nthe most was that matters were as God-awful as I\'d been saying they were.\n\n'
