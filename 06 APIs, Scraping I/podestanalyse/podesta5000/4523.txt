That\'s why the key to building a\nlong-term, progressive cadre of national leaders with\non-the-ground foreign policy experience is to have a "deep\nbench," as they say in sports. In order to win House and Senate\nseats for years to come, we have to be able to put up candidates\nthat have years of political experience under their belts. \n\nSo today, we\'d like to introduce you to two of what we call our\n"Emerging Leaders" Missouri State House candidates Jason Kander\nand Stephen Webber. And, we\'d also like to ask you to help put\nthem in office by donating to their campaigns. \n\nDonate to Jason Kander and Stephen Webber by clicking here!\n[http://www.actblue.com/page/emergingleaders]\n\nJason is a Kansas City attorney who served as an Army officer in\nAfghanistan - and he\'s running to represent Missouri\'s 44th\nHouse District. Stephen served in the Marine Corps and completed\ntwo tours in Iraq - and now he\'s running to represent Missouri\'s\n23rd House District in Columbia. \n\nJason and Stephen are just two of our Emerging Leaders - a "farm\nteam" of progressive candidates with hands-on national security\nexperience. In this program, we recruit vets with little to no\npolitical experience and promote them in state and local races -\nwhether it\'s for the State Senate, State House, City Council, or\ndog catcher. The idea is to develop seasoned leaders who are\nmore than capable of not only running for higher office in the\ncoming years--should they choose to--but of winning. By\nfostering their political careers at the earliest stages, we\'ll\nhelp them to become our nation\'s leaders for years to come.\n\nThe reason we\'re focusing on these two superb candidates first\nis that they\'re nearing the end of their tough primaries and\nthey need immediate help. If they make it out of this primary,\nneither of them will face a general election opponent this fall.\nIf they can win on August 5th, they\'ll become members of the\nMissouri State Legislature. \n\nDonate to Jason Kander and Stephen Webber by clicking here!\n[http://www.actblue.com/page/emergingleaders]\n\nI know both these men personally, and I can assure you that they\nstand for the same ideals that the rest of us do at\nVoteVets.org. You\'ll be hearing more about them - along with the\nrest of our Emerging Leaders - soon.\n\nThank you for your support!\n\nSincerely,\n\nBrandon Friedman\nVice Chairman, VoteVets.org\nIraq and Afghanistan War Veteran\n\nP.S.
