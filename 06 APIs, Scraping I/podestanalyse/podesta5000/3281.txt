John McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin set to appear in Lebanon\ntomorrow, the Center for American Progress Action Fund released two new\nanalyses of the impact of their plans on Ohio.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC-A new report\n<http://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ohio-healt\nh-care.pdf> , John McCain\'s Radical Health Care Agenda, describes the\nconsequences of McCain\'s health care plan for Ohio. Millions of Ohioans\ncould lose the coverage they get from their jobs, forcing them to shop\nfor health coverage in a deregulated insurance market stripped of\nconsumer protections. Many Ohioans with health problems, such as cancer\nor diabetes, would find it particularly difficult or even impossible to\nfind adequate coverage. Millions of Ohio families, and more and more\nOhio families over time, would pay higher taxes on health premiums.\n\nA new fact sheet <http://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/state-stats-ohio/> ,\nThe McCain-Palin Plan for Ohio by the Numbers, provides a by-the-numbers\nexamination of what their agenda will mean for the citizens of Ohio:\n\n*\t6.6 million people in Ohio have employer-based health insurance\nand are at risk of losing it under John McCain\'s plan.
