Tom Daschle (D-SD)<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/11/19/daschle-hhs/>, President-elect Barack Obama\'s nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nIn advance of the confirmation, conservatives have been actively<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/12/05/heritage-rip/> filling<http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/nov/26/obamas-health-care-czar/> the nation\'s leading newspapers<http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/nov/26/the-coming-health-care-tsunami/> with editorials attacking<http://thinkprogress.org/2008/11/28/rove-health-insurance/> Daschle<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123128781030459191.html?mod=googlenews_wsj> and misrepresenting the consequences and implications of expanding access to affordable health care coverage.\n\nIn a recent op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, for instance, Karl Rove warned that Obama\'s health care appointments suggested that he would "run to the extremes<http://thinkprogress.org/2008/11/28/rove-health-insurance/> with government-run health care." Other conservatives have falsely suggested<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/12/31/wsj-mass-attack/> that Obama\'s health reforms would "build more federal bureaucracy, impose price controls, restrict medicines and technology, boost taxes, mandate the purchase of health insurance, and expand government health care."\n\nIn a new report released today, the Wonk Room identifies and debunks the right-wing\'s most widely circulated myths about reform. Here is a sampling<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/health-myths/>:\n\n- MYTH: "The Left\'s idea of limiting Medicare spending is to have bureaucrats tell Mom she cannot have the cancer treatment she wants." [Washington Times, 12/28/2008]\n\nREALITY: Research into the comparative effectiveness of treatments can identify the procedures that provide the best results at the lowest cost. Currently, at least one-third of medical procedures have questionable benefits, according to the Rand Corporation. [Rand Corporation, 1998]\n\n- MYTH: Affordable health reform would "cancel private coverage and care." [Heritage Foundation, 12/04/2008]\n\nREALITY: According to the Urban Institute, private insurers who "offer a superior product through high levels of efficiency, satisfaction in consumer preferences and ease of access to quality medical services" will thrive in a reformed market. The presence of a well-run and effective public plan will incentivize innovation in cost containment and service delivery. [Urban Institute, 10/03/2008]\n\nRead the full report here<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/health-myths/>.\n\nhttp://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/health-myths/\n\n\n-----\nAdam Jentleson\nCommunications Director\nThe Hyde Park Project, Center for American Progress Action Fund\najentleson@americanprogressaction.org<mailto:ajentleson@americanprogress.org>\najentleson (AIM)\n202-247-8614 (cell)\n\n\n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail lori@progressiveaccountability.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
