Tells story about Petraeus and\nwhat a great man he is.\nMCCAIN: Thank you for serving.  I am honored.  It\'s just hard to understand\nwhy Obama would not vote to condemn an ad by an organization that questions\nthe patriotism of such a great man as Petraeus.\n\nQ 2) Hillary Clinton -- you mentioned Obama, but not her.  Taxes on phone\nbills -- the tax that was originally intended to pay for the\nSpanish-American war.  Also, sales taxes from the mall don\'t stay in the\ncommunities.\nMCCAIN: I\'ll be glad to look into that.  By the way, there\'s many\nindividuals who want to tax the Internet.  Don\'t let them do it.\n\nFollow-up: Character issue.  Like you I was opposed to gay marriage -- I\nagree with civil unions.  Infidelity is a terrible cancer on this country. I\nthink if we are going to talk about gay marriage, we also need to talk about\nthe preservation of marriage.\nMCCAIN: I respect her, I admire her.  We have stark differences.  I respect\nthe campaign that she has run.\nI believe in the sanctity and unique status of marriage as between man and a\nwoman (cheers and small boos).\n\nQ 3) Iranian threat.  What would be your response to Iran if they were to\nbomb Israel?  And how would you fund faith based organizations.\nMCCAIN: I think faith-based organizations are great entities.\nI will never allow a second Holocaust.  I believe there are many measures we\ncan use to thwart Iran before taking any military action.\n\nQ 4) Tax cuts -- we need tax cuts and spending cuts.  Reads statement about\nBush tax cuts and how McCain in 2001 and 2003 said he was opposed to the tax\ncuts because they gave breaks to the wealthy.  As president, what kind of\ntax cuts that you do propose?  Do you have your own thoughts or are you\nsimply trying to make the Bush tax cuts permanent?\nMCCAIN: If you do not make the Bush tax cuts permanent -- you will\nessentially raising taxes for everyone.  At the time, I had my own\nspending-cut package in Congress.  We need to control spending -- I favor\nfurther tax cuts.  You can\'t dispute cutting the capital gains tax.  Obama\nwants to raise the capital gains tax.\n\nFollow-up: Those tax cuts are distributed to the wealthy.  Are you looking\nto do that different than what you said in 2001?\nMCCAIN: We\'re talking a lot of people.  The capital gains taxes affects more\nthan just wealthy people -- 100 million Americans report capital gains taxes\non their income.  I favor further tax cuts.  But first we have to get\nspending under control.\n\nQ 5) Military member -- Iraq, good news coming out.  Military is strapped\nthin however.  What will you do?\nMCCAIN: I think you are right.  The army and the marine core are smaller\nnow.  One of the mistakes that we made is not to increase the size of the\nmilitary.  I will do whatever it takes to increase the size of the military.\n\nQ 6) Military member - Only Republican in whole family.  I like you.  "I\'m\nthe only one in my family that likes you."  I wanted to know if I can get a\npicture with you.\nMCCAIN: I\'d be honored.  Tell the members of your family that you\'re the\nsmartest member.\n\nQ 7) Have you chosen your VP?\nMCCAIN: No.\n\nFollow-up: Can I make a suggest?\nMCCAIN: Sure.\nQUESTIONER: Our good friend, Fred Thompson.\n\nQ 8) Freedom from religion.  This country was founded on faith and God.\nWhat or who is the supreme authority in your life and how will it be evident\nin your presidency?\nMCCAIN: I think the experience I had here and faraway, the only reason I am\nhere today is because of my faith.  I believe I am here because I got one\nmore day, one more hour, one more minute.\nTells story from POW experience.  We were used as propaganda.  One of those\nmethods was to use rope to tie your arms back.  One night I was in that\nsituation.  A guy walked in -- a gun guard -- he loosened the ropes that\nwere holding me.  He came at the end of his shift and tightened them again.\nOn Christmas day, I was let out to walk outside, the guard drew a cross on\nthe ground. That\'s the one person I always wanted to see again.\n\nQ 9) Iraq war veteran and a poet.  I understand you are one of those\nSenators who did not read all of the intelligence report leading up to the\ninvasion of Iraq.  Can you tell me who the poet laureate of Arizona is?\nMCCAIN: I do not know.  You wanna tell me?\nQuestioner: That\'s all I needed to know.\nMCCAIN: I was briefed many, many times. And everything showed that Saddam\nhad WMD\'s.\nFollow-up: Inspirational authors to you?\nMCCAIN: Joel Austeen.  Ernest Hemingway -- because of serving a cause\ngreater than ourselves.  History.  I could go on and on.  I read all the\ntime.\n\nQ 10) Social conservatives are worried about your background on this.  Who\nwill you appoint to the Supreme Court?  And how will you combat judicial\nactivism?\nMCCAIN: Standard judiciary answer.  I\'d appoint people like Alito and\nRoberts.  Appointing judges is one of the most important jobs of the\nPresident.  In all candor, guys who know that very fact are Thomspon and\nFrist.\n\nQ 11) Thank you for your character.  Thank you for your service.  What is\nyour stand on immigration?  And will you autograph my book?\nMCCAIN: I think the people that inspire me are our founding fathers.\nI believe that are founding fathers in their writings and the most noble\nwords they\'ve written -- we\'re all created equal ....\n\nQ 12) Health care.  My aunt is 92 and suffers from chronic pain. A big\nproblem these days are doctors are being prosecuted by the federal\ngovernment for aggressively prescribing pain medication.  I want you to stop\nthe persecution and reverse this trend/policy.\nMCCAIN: Trials are not brought without evidence.  But we\'re lucky, we have\nBill Frist here -- what do you think Bill?\n\nFRIST: Chronic disease has to be the focus of health care policy.  It was\none of the biggest problems.  We must continue to invest in science so we\ncan help solve your problem.\n\nFollow-up: Many doctors are afraid to be aggressive because of the\nprosecutions that are happening.\nMCCAIN: I will look into it.  And do everything I can if there are abuses.\n\nQ 13) Thank you for your service.  I served as a nurse.  NARF -- about\nhealth care policy?  There needs to be more doctors that specialize in the\ntreatment of seniors.\nMCCAIN: I\'ll look into it.\n\n\n-- \nCammie L.
