But I think it will be hard to do on\nthis timeframe.  We could do a Telemundo or other Hispanic outlet interview\non health care.\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Sep 24, 2015, at 7:59 PM, Alex Hornbrook <ahornbrook@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nAmy Taylor just called me back. After consulting with their lawyers and\ndiscussing further internally they are now NOT comfortable moving forward\nwith the event on Monday.  Cecile is testifying before Congress on Tuesday\nand will be highlighting how their health work is not related to their\npolitical activity.  She is even highlighting an affiliate in CA (though\nnot the one HRC would visit). They are still very enthusiastic about the\nconcept but do not feel like this is the right time for this event.  Looks\nlike we are back to the drawing board for Monday morning. Given the short\ntime line I think we will need to stick with something in the small meeting\n/ OTR family of events.  Is there value in reconsidering a tech related\nmeeting or are there ideas in the healthcare space that would be feasible\nto pull off in this timeframe?\n\nOn Thursday, September 24, 2015, Alex Hornbrook <\nahornbrook@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\n> Just spoke with Amy.
