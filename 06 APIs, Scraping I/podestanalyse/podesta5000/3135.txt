john.podesta@gmail.comb'\r\nDear Huma,\r\n\r\nAs Matt already signaled in his introductory email, I am writing to you on behalf of the Leading European Newspaper Alliance (LENA), which brings together Die Welt from Germany, El Pa\xc3\xads from Spain, Belgium\xe2\x80\x99s Le Soir, La Reppublica from Italy and Swiss dailies Tages-Anzeiger and Tribune de Gen\xc3\xa8ve. Conversations are underway with France\xe2\x80\x99s Le Figaro. LENA is going public later this month, but I am already, as director of the Alliance, commissioning content to be published simultaneously in the above said newspapers (interviews, features, opeds). It is in this regard that I would very much appreciate it if you could consider the possibility of us having an interview with Secretary Clinton. There is plenty for the Secretary to say to the people of Europe. We do not have a set timeframe, and we are perfectly aware of how tight her schedule is. We also know that interviews get arranged by strict policies and guidelines and only if they serve the communication agenda of the Secretary. Nevertheless, if an interview could be arranged in the next days or even weeks, it would send a powerful message to a Continent in distress after the terror attacks in Paris.\r\nShould any questions or further queries arise, please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\nEagerly awaiting your positive response,\r\nJavier\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJavier Moreno Barber\r\n\r\nDirector Editorial/Chief Content Officer\r\n\r\n[Descripci\xc3\xb3n: Descripci\xc3\xb3n: cid:image001.png@01CF863D.E3F22CE0]\r\n\r\n\r\nT +34 91 337 84 86\r\n\r\nJMoreno@elpais.es<mailto:JMoreno@elpais.es>\r\n\r\nC/ Miguel Yuste, 40\r\n\r\n28037 Madrid\r\n\r\nwww.elpais.com<mailto:JMoreno@elpais.es>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDe: Matt Browne [mailto:mbrowne@americanprogress.org]\r\nEnviado el: viernes, 09 de enero de 2015 1:49\r\nPara: Huma Abedin\r\nCC: john.podesta@gmail.com; Moreno Barber. Javier\r\nAsunto: Introduction: Leading European Newspaper Allisnce\r\n\r\nDear Huma -\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy New Year,\r\n\r\n\r\nI trust this email finds you well. I wanted the opportunity to introduce to Javier Moreno, former Editor in Chief of El Pais, and new director of Leading European Newspaper Alliance (LENA).\r\n\r\n\r\nLENA is launching later this month to strive for the consolidation of an Europe-wide public opinion. Its members share a series of common values regarding the importance of quality journalism in the structuring of open, democratic societies with a message of economic progress, social justice and defence of individual civil liberties.\r\n\r\n\r\nDie Welt from Germany, El Pa\xc3\xads from Spain, La Repubblica from Italy, Le Soir from Belgium, and Swiss dailies Tages-Anzeiger and Tribune de Gen\xc3\xa8ve have already signed, each an opinion leader in their respective markets. Conversations with France\xe2\x80\x99s Le Figaro to join the alliance are underway. LENA has therefore a combined reach of many millions of readers, both in print and online, in four different languages and in five countries across Europe. LENA, therefore, assures a broad impact for any interview, oped or feature published simultaneously in all members of the Alliance.\r\n\r\n\r\nShould Secretary Clinton be interested in speaking to people across Europe, LENA would be delighted to facilitate this,\r\n\r\n\r\nVery best regards, and warmest wishes for a happy, healthy and prosperous 2015.\r\n\r\n\r\nYours ever -\r\n\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n________________________________\r\n"Este correo electr\xc3\xb3nico contiene informaci\xc3\xb3n confidencial amparada por el secreto profesional.
