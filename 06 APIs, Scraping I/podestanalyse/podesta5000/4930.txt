We\'ve been calling. But it\'s not enough. The\ninsurance companies and big corporations are fighting back - and they\njust won a U.S. Senate election and Supreme Court decision to give them\neven more power in their attempt to block health care reform. \n\nSo we must fight back harder than ever and tell Congress that now is the\ntime to stand up to corporate lobbyists and finish health reform. We\nneed them to finish it right and finish it now.\n\nThat\'s why we\'re having an emergency rally in Washington, DC, to send a\nmessage that Republican obstructionism and corporate lobbyists won\'t\nstop us from passing real reform - or stand in the way of environmental,\nworker rights, and other crucial reforms.\n\nCan you join us on Tuesday, January 26th at 12 pm? Click here for\ndetails and to RSVP.\n<http://healthcareforamericanow.org/page/m/3560de42/51358444/325b7298/78\n6f3f7a/1288322389/VEsH/> \n\nThe Chamber of Commerce has spent millions of dollars - laundered\nmillions from big insurance - to defeat reform. The the Supreme Court\nruling this week only makes matters worse, opening the floodgates to\nunrestricted corporate money into our political arena. \n\nOn Tuesday we will rally outside the Chamber to remind Congress that no\nmatter how much money is on the side of big insurance and big\ncorporations, we have the people. We will fight back with the voices of\nthose denied coverage and those burdened and bankrupted by skyrocketing\npremiums.\n\nCan you join us?
