Shell faced stiff resistance on multiple fronts and direct action anywhere their rigs went. Shell's reputation was becoming so toxic that they were kicked out of the very same corporate global leaders group they founded.\n\nCelebrate what we have accomplished together and inspire others to join the climate justice movement.
