Mu\xc3\xb1oz III, is a movement that builds power in the Latino community so that the faces and voices of Latinos are reflected at every level of government and in the policies that drive our country forward.\xc2\xa0Please join them and show your support today with a $10, $25 or $50 donation to my campaign.\n\nIn their announcement President, Crist\xc3\xb3bal Alex, says,"We are proud to endorse\xc2\xa0Joseline Pe\xc3\xb1a-Melnyk for Congress. Joseline will be the first Dominican-American to serve in Congress, she is a great leader who will fight for our community and the issues that matter to Latinos. As a city councilor and Maryland delegate, Joseline has demonstrated a strong record of putting her community first, and we know she will continue to do that in the halls of Congress."\n\nI am excited that LVF recognizes my work and the efforts of my campaign to fight for and address the issues that face our community. Our combined efforts, along with your support,\xc2\xa0will ensure that our voice will be heard.\n\nLet us keep this momentum going; join our efforts today. Please donate $10, 25, 50 to my campaign!
