Governor Branstad has recently indicated that he would support legislative efforts to put same-sex marriage up to a vote. And it's because he's interested in reversing the law.\n\nContribute $15, $20, or $50 if you want a leader who isn't interested in putting same-sex rights up to a vote.\nhttps://act.myngp.com/Forms/1688013522496456448\n\nWe don't put rights up to a vote, that's why they're rights. No majority should be able to pick how and when a minority of our population can live out their lives and dictate how much freedom they're allowed within the borders of Iowa.\n\nWe need a governor who respects all Iowan's right\xc2\xa0to be with the one that they love and knows that it's nobody elses business to decide that.\xc2\xa0As the next governor, I'll stand firm on the side of equality.\n\nThanks,\n\n\nJack Hatch\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nP.S. Contribute $15, $20, or $50 today to give us the resources we need to stop Branstad.\nhttps://act.myngp.com/Forms/1688013522496456448\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 Neighbors for Hatch, Inc.
