Nan supports Paul Ryan's budget even though our district would be one of the 10 hardest hit by the plan's drastic cuts to Medicaid and Social Security.  Don't let another Paul Ryan champion back to Washington - contribute now!\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20140429-lapd&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\n2. Nan wants to defund Planned Parenthood, cutting off millions from affordable birth control, cervical cancer screenings and testing and treatment for life threatening illnesses. Help me stand up for women's rights - contribute now!\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20140429-lapd&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\n3. Nan would withhold disaster aid to balance the federal budget. You and I both saw the damage done to our communities by Hurricane Irene and Superstorm Sandy. But Nan wants to hold disaster relief hostage unless we cut other programs! Help protect our communities when disaster strikes - contribute now!\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20140429-lapd&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\nBy now I hope you're convinced how totally out of touch Nan Hayworth is with our community's values. Click here to contribute $250 now and help me reach my $16,000 goal by midnight tomorrow so we can get on the air and let everyone in our district know!\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20140429-lapd&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\nIf you're not convinced yet, here's a bonus that should make you cringe:\n\nNan thinks she can buy this election. She's already contributed $100,000 of her own money to this campaign and brought in dozens of checks from Tea Party bigwigs like Paul Ryan. Show Hayworth the power of grassroots activism - contribute now!\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20140429-lapd&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\nNan Hayworth's policies are so extreme, they're downright dangerous. We need to fight back with everything we've got - and that means we need to meet every fundraising goal we've set so we can put our ads on the air and send our supporters to every door in the Hudson Valley. \n\nPlease contribute $250 now to help us meet our crucial goal by midnight tomorrow!\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20140429-lapd&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\nThanks so much for your help,\n\nSean\n\n\nContribute -- https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20140429-lapd&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.\nTo unsubscribe from the Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress email list, please click here: http://action.seanmaloney.com/unsubscribe\n\n\nPAID FOR BY SEAN PATRICK MALONEY FOR CONGRESS\n\n\n"
