And stopped.  After crossing the Atlantic we would fly for just 1-3 hours before stopping again to load/unload troops.  I didn\'t sleep much but instead made lots of progress in my dense book, The Social and Political History of Afghanistan.  I now feel a little more informed about where I\'m going but also much less optimistic about our prospects for turning around centuries of political and military turmoil in a country that hasn\'t seen a peaceful transition of power in 100+ years.\n\nA number of my friends from my Texas training were on the flight and it was nice to see some familiar faces.  I learned yesterday that a Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel I trained with will be the Senior Contracting Officer--Afghanistan and the Deputy Senior Contracting Officer--Afghanistan. In my naivety of all things contracting I hadn\'t realized when I was in Texas that they\'re kind of a big deal.  I figured it out when we landed here and were greeted by a welcome party to personally escort us to the "transient" part of camp. No one would have given two figs had I arrived alone so I\'m glad to be traveling with those two!\n\nAgain, the camp is insane.  I\'m writing from a large open tent in the center of camp.  Ringing the outside is a bar, a FoxSports bar, a gym, a media center, and a morale tent.  Wifi is readily available in the center of camp (but slow).  There is a Dunkin\' Donuts, a Baskin Robbins, a Subway, a Pizza Hut, and a DQ (conveniently located at the pool).  The Dining Hall is open 24/7 and is much larger and serves more options than any I ever saw while touring college campuses.  Civilian clothes are the norm here; I have none and stick out as "transient" like a sore thumb.  \n\nI should be here for at least another day or two.  I\'m not scheduled to fly out today and will only learn this evening if I am scheduled to fly tomorrow.  While I know that this will prove much, much nicer than what I can expect to find in Kabul, I nonetheless am ready to move on and get to my permanent temporary home.  Because I technically made it to the Area Of Responsibility yesterday, may 210 day counter has started (just 209 to go...).  \n\nLove and miss you all.  Gabe\n\nSent from my iPad'
