john.podesta@gmail.comb'John --\n\nWe\'re almost there -- just 19 days left.\n\nThe final three weeks of any election, and especially of this one, are about one thing -- getting out the vote. The math is simple: if the folks who voted in 2008 vote again in 2010, then Democrats keep both the House and Senate and we can keep moving America forward.\n\nYou and I have to make sure they don\'t stay home. All over the country, in all 50 states -- and in Washington -- OFA volunteers are rolling up their sleeves and asking their neighbors to commit to vote this fall.\n\nCan you make it out to take part on Tuesday?\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/page/content/event_rsvp/?url=http://my.barackobama.com/page/event/detail/vote2010event/gp34yv&zip=20003&date=October19th\n\nHere are the details:\n\n    What: Vote 2010 Event\n    \n    Where: Organizing for America - Washington, D.C.\n    430 South Capitol Street, SE\n    Washington, DC 20003\n  \n    When: Tuesday, October 19th\n    5:00 pm\n\nYes, I\'ll be there: http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/event_rsvp/?url=http://my.barackobama.com/page/event/detail/vote2010event/gp34yv&zip=20003&date=October19th\n\nI can\'t make it, but I\'d still like to help: http://my.barackobama.com/CantMakeIt\n\nI can\'t make it to that event, but I want to see if there are others near me: http://my.barackobama.com/Vote2010Events\n\nIf we succeed this November, we\'ll build on our past victories by continuing to improve the economy and get Americans back to work, fighting for clean energy, green jobs, and immigration reform. If we lose, the Republicans who have vowed to repeal Wall Street reform and phase out Social Security will take over our government -- and maybe even shut it down.\n\nThere are no two ways around it: to achieve the things we fought for in 2008, we need to win in 2010. And to win in 2010, we need to get out the vote.\n\nEarlier this week, the President held a town-hall meeting with some first time voters from 2008. He told them our involvement in democracy signals "a reaffirmation of a central American truth, which is our destiny is not written for us by somebody else -- our destiny is written by us."\n\nPlease do what you can to come out and volunteer in Washington:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/page/content/event_rsvp/?url=http://my.barackobama.com/page/event/detail/vote2010event/gp34yv&zip=20003&date=October19th\n\nThanks,\n\nJeremy\n\nJeremy Bird\nDeputy Director\nOrganizing for America\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for America, a project of the Democratic National Committee -- 430 South Capitol Street SE, Washington, D.C. 20003.
