john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear Huma and John \xe2\x80\x93\r\n\r\nI just wanted to follow up on this request.\r\n\r\nI spoke with Gerry Butts, Justin Trudeau\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff today. They understand that a meeting with Foreign Minister Baird has been scheduled, and are hopeful that a meeting can be arranged with Mr Trudeau too during the Ottawa visit.\r\n\r\nIt looks increasingly likely that he will be Prime Minister in a years\xe2\x80\x99 time. A string of national polls released this week suggests that the Liberal Party is pulling further away from both the Conservatives and NDP, and are thus the ever more likely the winners of the October 2015 election.

Both the Leader and Sophie will be in the crowd to hear the speech, but there is a strong desire to work on a private one-on-one with HRC during her visit.  Canada 2020 is unaware of her actual arrival and departure time on the 6th, so I am unsure if there is even time to work in a sit-down.\r\n\r\nDuring the meeting Mike and I had with Tim yesterday, it was clear that we would  need to drive this in order to see it happen.  The structure of the contract and arrangements is that Canada 2020 works through HRC\xe2\x80\x99s agent and are not dealing directly with her people.\r\n\r\nTim has reached out on our behalf to Desiree McGraw who does have a personal relationship with someone that is very close to the Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 to try that angle. I have spoken with Charles Bird who often will work for HRC when she visit to Toronto to put the bug in his ear that we would like a private one-on-one, and Kate Purchase was also reaching out to a connection that she has with Clinton.\r\n\r\nThese are merely the irons we currently have in fire.\r\n\r\nI think a multi-prong approach is the best one in this circumstance, so I am reaching out to this group to see if we can brainstorm other approaches, or connections, that might get us to the right individuals making the decisions.\r\n\r\nSuggestions?\r\n\r\nMarlene.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarlene Floyd\r\nDirector, Operations and Outreach /\r\nDirectrice, Op\xc3\xa9rations et rayonnement\r\n\r\nOFFICE OF THE LEADER OF THE LIBERAL PARTY OF CANADA /\r\nBUREAU DU CHEF DU PARTI LIB\xc3\x89RAL DU CANADA\r\n\r\n202 rue Sparks Street\r\nOttawa, ON  K1A 0A6\r\n\r\nDirect Line / Ligne directe : (613) 943-3750<tel:%28613%29%20943-3750>\r\nMobile : (613) 297-5844<tel:%28613%29%20297-5844>\r\nEmail / Courriel : marlene.floyd@parl.gc.ca<mailto:marlene.floyd@parl.gc.ca>\r\n\r\n'
