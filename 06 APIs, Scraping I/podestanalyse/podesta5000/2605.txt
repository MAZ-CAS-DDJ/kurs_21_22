john.podesta@gmail.comb'The Campaign for America\'s Future is launching an economic war room today to\nhelp frame the ongoing debate as the economy changes at an increasing pace\nand continues to get worse for millions of Americans. The operation will\ndeliver daily poll-tested talking points to candidates, elected officials,\ntalk show hosts, columnists, bloggers, labor leaders, activists and others,\ntying the latest research by think tanks like the EPI Policy Center to the\nfreshest opinion research by top strategists Celinda Lake and Drew Westen.\n\n \n\n \n   \n\n \n\nREADY FOR BATTLE WITH \'ECON WAR ROOM\'\n\n\n\nBy: Jeanne Cummings \nAugust 5, 2008 04:38 PM EST\n\n \n\nA Democratic activist group is expected to announce the opening of an\n"economic war room" tomorrow.\n\nThe Campaign for America\'s Future is planning to send daily dispatches to\ncandidates, bloggers, talk show hosts and others to bulk up their party\'s\neconomic messages.\n\nIn addition to daily message alerts, the group also is considering\nparachuting in additional resources into races where economic issues are\nmost salient.\n\nFor instance, the group could dispatch a blogger, train local bloggers and\norganize events around the economy that could draw local publicity. They\nhave no plans now for television advertising.\n\n"The change in the economy has been abrupt, serious and it\'s a created a\ndifferent kind of recession," said Robert Borosage, co-director of Campaign\nfor America\'s Future.\n\n"This is an issue that is obviously on the mind of voters, and it\'s\nimportant for candidates and activists to understand what is happening and\nto have messages that can work with voters," he added.\n\nBorosage will unveil the initiative tomorrow. Democratic polling expert\nCelinda Lake is working with Borosage to test messages and measure voter\nintensity on the issue.\n\nDrew Westen, an Emory University professor who has studied the way voters\nmake decisions, is also massaging the messages for highest impact.\n\nThe e-mail issue alerts will be sent to 108 Democratic congressional\nchallengers, 3,000 state and local officials and about 6,000 activists.\n\nThey will include a set of "hot facts" on a key issue - say, gas prices -\nthat could work well in speeches. The alert will also link to a more\ncomprehensive analysis of the problem and solutions if candidates need more\ndata.\n\nSome alerts will be tied to events, such as Labor Day, while others might be\ndriven in response to the national debate.\n\n"We are trying to provide real policy alternatives to the political\nmessaging" on the campaign trail, said Borosage.\n\nThe need for such a program became apparent when Borosage\'s organization\nbrought a few dozen candidates to town to discuss economic messaging.\n\nWhat he found was that the candidates were better versed at political\nmessages - "my opponent is owned by the oil companies" - but less so on\nsolutions and effective ways of communicating them to voters.\n\nTo illustrate how Campaign for America\'s Future\'s program can fine-tune\nDemocratic messaging, Borosage pointed to an expected debate over the need\nfor a second stimulus bill.\n\nRepublicans would likely argue that a stimulus package should include tax\nbreaks for businesses which could free cash to create jobs.\n\n"We would argue that we need on based on investments in public\ninfrastructure rather than corporate tax breaks. If you put the money in\npublic investments, you build things we need, put people to work and less\nmoney leaks across the world," he said.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nCampaign 2008\n\nTuesday, August 5, 2008\n\n \n\nLIBERAL GROUP STARTS WAR ROOM\n\n \n\nBy Aaron Blake\n\n \n\nThe liberal Campaign for America\'s Future is launching an economic war room\nto help congressional challengers, state and local officials and activists\nnavigate what is currently the top issue of the 2008 campaign.\n\n \n\nThe $440,000 project is set to deliver its message to about 50 congressional\ncampaigns and thousands of officials, bloggers and activists, said Campaign\nfor America\'s Future co-director Robert Borosage.\n\n \n\nBorosage said the war room approach is important because the economy is such\na fast-changing issue.\n\n \n\n"There is constant new information coming in; there\'s a constant set of\ndifferent hooks you can use to make the argument," Borosage said.\n\n \n\nThe war room is working in concert with author Drew Westen and Democratic\npollster Celinda Lake, and it will provide poll-tested talking points. The\nEconomic Policy Institute will also be providing facts, figures and\nopinions.\n\n \n\nThe project will be detailed in a conference call Wednesday. \n\n \n\n \n \n \nToby Chaudhuri\nCommunications Director\nCampaign for America\'s Future\n202-587-1653\n978-884-8626\n \n \n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
