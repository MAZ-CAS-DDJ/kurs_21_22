john.podesta@gmail.comb'She is having dinner with George Soros tonight.\nDo you know much about America Votes? As Greg Speed explained to me, they are the coordinated campaign for various outside groups. Soros is a big supporter of the group and hes going to ask her tonight if she will come to a fundraiser for them at his house in December. Thoughts?\n________________________________\nFrom: Greg Speed [GSpeed@americavotes.org]\nSent: Tuesday, September 16, 2014 11:42 AM\nTo: Huma Abedin\nCc: Lona Valmoro (lvalmoro.hrco@gmail.com); Evan Kost\nSubject: Invitation from America Votes\n\nHi Huma (and Lona):\nIt was wonderful to see you last week. Thanks so much again for making the time in a very, very busy week.\n\nAttached is an invitation for Secretary Clinton to join us at an evening reception at the home of George Soros in December. We would be thrilled to have her serve as honored guest and speaker at this gathering of our top supporters honoring America Votes\x92 work over the past 10 years and looking forward to the next decade.\n\nThanks so much in advance for your and the Secretary\x92s consideration of this request. We are now holding dates at Mr. Soros\x92 home in the middle of the month (Dec. 15-17) and hope we can find a mutually agreeable date during that window if possible or an alternative. Please let us know if we can provide any further information, address any questions, etc.\n\nThanks very much again and look forward to talking again soon.\n\nBest,\nGS\n\nGreg Speed\nPresident\nAmerica Votes\ngspeed@americavotes.org<mailto:gspeed@americavotes.org>\n202.962.7251 direct\n202.365.0594 mobile\n1155 Connecticut Ave., NW\nSuite 600\nWashington, DC 20036\n\nConnect with America Votes!\nFacebook<http://www.facebook.com/pages/America-Votes/136180176422660> | Twitter<http://www.twitter.com/americavotes> | Website<http://www.americavotes.org/>\n\n\n\n\n______________________________________\n\nNOTICE: This information is intended only for the use of the individual or entity to which it is addressed and may contain information that is privileged, confidential and exempt from disclosure under applicable law.
