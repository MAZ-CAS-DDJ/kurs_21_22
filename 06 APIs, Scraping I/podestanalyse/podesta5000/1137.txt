Laurel Andrew and Joe Bastian have agreed to be members of the committee.  I'm writing to invite your participation in this annual review.\n\nAttached are Teresa's goals and objectives for 2013-2014-and beyond.  Please review them and send me any comments you have on her performance this academic year in relation to these goals and objectives.  If you'd prefer to talk on the phone, let me know and we'll set up a time.  By the middle of April, I plan to review with the committee all the comments that we receive, so please respond by April 12.\n\nAfter the committee has reviewed the comments from trustees, I will prepare a verbal report for the May meeting of the Executive Committee, when Duke will begin discussing a recommendation for Teresa's salary.   At the June meeting of the board, I will make a final oral report on the annual evaluation and Duke will make a recommendation on Teresa's salary, for board approval.  Following the meeting, Duke will meet with Teresa to review the results of the annual evaluation and inform her of her salary for 2014-2015.\n\nIf you have any questions about the process or you would like to speak to me on the phone regarding Teresa's performance, please let me know.\n\nThanks,\n\nRichard\n\nRichard Riddell\nVice President and University Secretary\nDuke University\n919-684-2641\n\nPlease consider the environment before printing this email.  Thanks.\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to trustees-user+unsubscribe@knox.edu.\n"
