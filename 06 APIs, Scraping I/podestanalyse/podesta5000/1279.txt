Vogel\nJune 30, 2010 11:46 PM EDT\n\nA new political group conceived by veteran GOP operatives Karl Rove  \nand Ed Gillespie and launched to much fanfare earlier this year had  \nits first big fundraising month in June, raising millions and also  \nspawning a new partner outfit.\n\nAmerican Crossroads, a conservative group created in March to air ads  \nboosting Republicans, combined with a newer offshoot called American  \nCrossroads GPS to pull in nearly $8.5 million in June, according to  \nAmerican Crossroads president Steven Law.\n\n\x93For us it\x92s a down payment on what we expect to do in the months  \nahead, and we\x92re going to continue to be just as aggressive in  \nJuly,\x94 said Law, who found himself on the defensive a bit after  \nPOLITICO revealedthat American Crossroads raised just $200 in May.\n\nAmerican Crossroads, a so-called 527 group, debuted in March with  \npredictions it would raise $52 million to help Republicans. But its  \nreports to the Internal Revenue Service showed it had raised only a  \nlittle more than $1.25 million in total before its big June haul.\n\nThough American Crossroads will be required to disclose to the IRS its  \ndonors and expenditures for June in about three weeks, Law would not  \nimmediately reveal the precise fundraising division between it and  \nCrossroads GPS, which he said was incorporated about four weeks ago  \nunder section 501(c)4 of the IRS code. That section of the code  \nrequires far less disclosure and allows groups to withhold information  \non individual donors, which Law conceded was appealing for some of  \nGPS\x92s donors.\n\n\x93I wouldn\x92t want to discount the value of confidentiality to some  \ndonors,\x94 said Law. But, he added, \x93the genesis of it from our  \nperspective was that there are a number of things that are priorities  \nfor us that seemed to fit more into a 501(c)4 than a 527, such as  \ndoing very legislatively focused issue advocacy activity which we will  \nbe undertaking in the next few months\x94 and also \x93building out a  \nvery substantial grassroots activist network that we plan to organize  \nboth around issues and geographically, that we can deploy along with  \nour advertising strategy.\x94\n\nGPS will focus its issue campaigns on the implementation of the  \nDemocratic healthcare overhaul and stimulus package, as well as the  \nnational deficit and debt. The group, which likely won\x92t have to  \ndisclose any of its finances until May 2011 at the earliest, has hired  \nas its issues director Steven Duffield, who has worked as a policy  \naide to the Republican National Committee and the Senate Republican  \nConference.\n\nThe Crossroads 527 has already spent $360,000 on ads attacking Senate  \nMajority Leader Harry Reid\x92s reelection campaign in Nevada.\n\nAnd, in June, it announced 10 other Senate races in which it planned  \nto air ads criticizing the Democratic candidate or boosting the  \nRepublican, including Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky,  \nMissouri, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington state.\n\n\n\xa9 2010 Capitol News Company, LLC\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
