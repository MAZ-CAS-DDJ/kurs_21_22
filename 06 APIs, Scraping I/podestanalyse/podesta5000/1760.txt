We saw huge wins on health care and marriage\nequality last month, the EPA's Clean Power Plan to fight\nclimate change is being finalized later this summer, and\nthere's plenty more on the horizon.\n\nOrganizers have been working for decades for the kind of\nprogress we're seeing. This is a great time to stop and\ncelebrate how far we've come -- by sending your well-wishes\nto the Organizer-in-Chief.\n\nSo take a moment today, John, and sign OFA's birthday card\nfor President Obama:\n\nhttps://my.barackobama.com/Happy-Birthday-President-Obama\n\nThanks,\n\nSara\n\nSara El-Amine \nExecutive Director \nOrganizing for Action\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for Action\n\nContributions or gifts to Organizing for Action are not tax deductible.\n\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo update your address, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/change-address?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe from these messages, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscription\nOrganizing for Action, P.O.
