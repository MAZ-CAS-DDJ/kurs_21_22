Taylor\n\nCell: 702-809-9069\n\nReturned your call today. Going to be in DC on 28th (of course, you won't\nbe)\xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99s not in Vegas that much.  He\xe2\x80\x99s also in Chicago a fair amount.\n\nNeera\n\nCell: 202-492-2970\n\nWould appreciate a call back (from today at 3:30 pm)\n\n\nMeeting Requests:\n\nRobert Roche: asked if you have some time at the end of this week or\nsometime next week to continue our conversation about the role of Business\nForward and the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s outreach to the business community.\n\nNorah O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell (CBS): Karen Finney reached out to Milia about drinks with\nNorah O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell the week after next when she\xe2\x80\x99s in town. Tentatively\nscheduled for the 20th with Jen and Kristina, but you are not confirmed.\n\nRussell Sage / Amtrak Travel Question:\n\nHeather let us know you are going to the Russell Sage Lunch on Monday July\n13 from 12:30 - 1:30 pm.  Russell Sage office is in Lenox Hill, and in\ntraffic, it can be up to 23 minutes to get from there to Penn Station.  *If\nthe meeting runs even slightly long, you likely would miss the 2 pm train\noption. Which train do you want to switch to on Monday?*\n\n\n\n-2:00pm Acela, Arrives WAS at 4:53pm\n\n-There is no 2:30 pm NE Regional option (rather, it is inexplicably at 2:05\npm)\n\n-3:00pm Acela, Arrives WAS at 5:53pm\n\nBecause this was booked through CAP's AmTrav agency, we do not have the\nflexibility to call and change on a whim--need about an hour\xe2\x80\x99s notice.  You\ncan, of course, change your ticket at the station, but last minute changes\nwill be difficult if you need them. Please let us know what you would like\nto do.  CAP will allow Acela because you are not costing them any lodging,\nand because it\xe2\x80\x99s you.\n\n-- \nMilia Fisher\nSpecial Assistant to the Chair\nHillary for America\nmfisher@hillaryclinton.com\no: 646.854.1198 c: 858.395.1741\n"
