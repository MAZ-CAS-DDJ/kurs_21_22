john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\nThis is the guy we wanted to select for Media Director.   We interviewed a LOT of people and Oren was our consensus candidate.  He has the experience and is also a low drama/head low type.  Mandy thought he did a good job managing egos and pushing back on consultants at DGA.  \nLet me know if you want to discuss or have thoughts. \n\n\n\n\n'
