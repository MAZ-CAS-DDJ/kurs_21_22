john.podesta@gmail.comb'ICYMI -- below is an op-ed from Rep. Elijah Cummings calling on Republicans\nto stop derailing the Benghazi committee.\n\n\n\n\n*Washington Post opinion: Republicans must stop derailing the Benghazi\ncommittee\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-must-stop-derailing-the-benghazi-committee/2015/06/11/8c6e5486-0e26-11e5-9726-49d6fa26a8c6_story.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Elijah Cummings\n\nJune 11, 2015 5:50 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\n*The writer, a Democrat, represents Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s 7th Congressional District\nin the House, where he is the ranking member on the Select Committee on\nBenghazi. *\n\n\n\nNow that the State Department has released former secretary of state\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s e-mails relating to the attacks in Benghazi, the American\npeople can see for themselves that there is not a scrap of evidence to back\nup claims that Clinton issued a \xe2\x80\x9cstand-down\xe2\x80\x9d order or any of the other\nbaseless allegations that Republicans have been making about her for years.\n\n\n\nThis is exactly what Reps. Adam Smith (Wash.), Adam Schiff (Calif.), Linda\nSanchez (Calif.), Tammy Duckworth (Ill.) and I \xe2\x80\x94 the Democratic members of\nthe Select Committee on Benghazi \xe2\x80\x94 have been saying since we obtained\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s e-mails in February. And it\xe2\x80\x99s why all five of us believe the time\nhas come to voice the grave concerns we share over the extremely partisan\nand misguided direction this committee has taken.\n\n\n\nFor those keeping track, the committee has spent more than a year and more\nthan $3 million trying to find evidence to damage Clinton and her\npresidential campaign, even as it continues to come up empty-handed.\n\n\n\nAlready, the committee has lasted longer than the investigations of the\nIran-Contra affair, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the\nattack on Pearl Harbor and Hurricane \xc2\xadKatrina.\n\n\n\n Yet the committee\xe2\x80\x99s chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), may not release\nhis findings until just months before next year\xe2\x80\x99s presidential election,\naccording to news reports.\n\n\n\nAt this glacial pace, the Benghazi investigation will last longer than the\nWatergate investigation and the 9/11 Commission, and it will squander more\nthan $6 million in taxpayer funds.\n\n\n\nBut that has not stopped Republicans from dragging out the committee\xe2\x80\x99s\nwork, offering new excuses at every turn, and \xe2\x80\x94 in an astonishing and\ndisgraceful display \xe2\x80\x94 seeking to raise campaign funds off the deaths of\nfour brave Americans.\n\n\n\nNow, House Republicans want to withhold nearly $700 million from the State\nDepartment\xe2\x80\x99s operational budget in an Orwellian attempt to improve the\ndepartment\xe2\x80\x99s document production processes.\n\n\n\nThat simply makes no sense. Withholding two-thirds of a billion dollars\nfrom the department\xe2\x80\x99s budget \xe2\x80\x94 more than all of the salaries of all of the\nemployees working on document production \xe2\x80\x94 would only grind the process to\na halt.\n\n\n\nThe committee should stop blaming others for its own delays. It waited more\nthan six months to send a request for new documents to the State Department\nand nearly a year to send new document requests to the Pentagon and the\nCIA. The committee has not held a single hearing in 19 weeks, despite the\nchairman\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that there would be public hearings on a monthly\nbasis. It refuses to set a date for Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, although she has\nbeen willing to appear since last year.\n\n\n\nPushing this taxpayer-funded political attack further into election season\nsacrifices any chance that the American people will see it as serious or\nlegitimate. As Greta Van Susteren of Fox News has warned, the committee\xe2\x80\x99s\nfindings \xe2\x80\x9cwill forever be plagued by allegations of unfairness and\n\xc2\xadpolitics.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRecognizing this fact, Republicans are becoming more desperate to justify\nthe committee\xe2\x80\x99s existence, and they are resorting to strong-arm tactics\nstraight out of the partisan playbook of discredited GOP investigations of\nthe past.\n\n\n\nFor example, the committee majority recently issued a completely\nunnecessary subpoena without first contacting the witness. It clearly\nleaked this news before the subpoena was served and sent armed marshals to\nthe witness\xe2\x80\x99s home to confront his wife \xe2\x80\x94 all just to get a cheap headline.\n\n\n\nThese actions directly contradict the spirit of the chairman\xe2\x80\x99s previous\nstatement that compelling the testimony of cooperative witnesses such as\nClinton \xe2\x80\x9cjust seems a little heavy-handed,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as his claim that\n\xe2\x80\x9cserious investigations do not leak information.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAfter nine reports on the Benghazi attacks from seven congressional\ncommittees and the independent Accountability Review Board, how many more\ntimes will Republicans investigate Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 and how much more will we be\nforced to spend \xe2\x80\x94 before they stop trying to prove that she engaged in some\nsort of conspiracy?\n\n\n\nThis slow-walked and abusive political charade on the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 dime is\nexactly the opposite of what we promised the families of those killed in\nBenghazi.\n\n\n\nIf there is any minuscule chance left to salvage the Benghazi committee\xe2\x80\x99s\nplace in history, we need to return immediately to our core mission of\nimplementing concrete reforms designed to help protect our diplomatic corps\naround the world.\n\n-- \nMary Rutherford Jennings\nDeputy Communications Director\nCorrect The Record\nmjennings@correctrecord.org\n501-920-6844 (cell)\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to ctrfriendsfamily+unsubscribe@correctrecord.org.\n'
