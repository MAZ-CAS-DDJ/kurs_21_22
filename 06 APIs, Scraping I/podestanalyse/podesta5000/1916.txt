On Thursday, Obama hosted an economic event geared to women\nin northern Virginia.\n\nAt the Hudson event, McCain was accompanied by his wife, Cindy. The local\nbusinesswoman who introduced McCain -- company Chief Executive Officer\nLouAnne Reger -- joked about fashion, dieting and her two divorces as she\nwarmed up the crowd.\n\n"I know you all want to know how to lose five pounds in one week. All you\nhave to do is host a town hall for John McCain," Reger told the crowd,\ndrawing laughter.\n\n"Do you want to know how to lose 30 pounds?" Cindy McCain said a few moments\nlater. "Help your husband run for president."\n\nThe hundreds in the audience were overwhelmingly women.\n\n"Yesterday (Thursday) in New York, Senator Obama went on at great length\nabout how much he cares about women\'s issues," McCain said. "I believe him.\nBut when you cut through all the smooth rhetoric, Senator Obama\'s policies\nwould make it harder for women to start new businesses, harder for women to\ncreate or find new jobs, harder for women to manage the family budget, and\nharder for women and their families to meet their tax burden."\n\nMcCain supports extending the Bush tax cuts and also proposes a cut in\ncorporate taxes and a doubling of the child credit. Obama has proposed a\nseries of tax cuts for middle-income earners and below, while favoring\nhigher income and capital gains taxes on people making more than $250,000.\n\nMcCain sought to assure voters in Hudson he felt their economic pain,\nespecially after published comments this week by his longtime friend and\nadviser Phil Gramm that the United States has become a "nation of whiners"\nand the country is in a "mental recession." Gramm said later that he was\nreferring to "our leaders" when he said that, not average people.\n\n"Juggling family and career can be hard," McCain told his audience. "Now you\nhave to deal with the rising costs of both running a business and raising a\nfamily."\n\nPay legislation \'flawed\'\n\nDemocrats criticized McCain this week for opposing legislation in Congress\naimed at ensuring pay parity for women; McCain has said the legislation was\nflawed.\n\n"We have not done enough. I\'m committed to making sure that there is equal\npay for equal work," McCain told the crowd Friday.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Obama senior adviser Anita Dunn said: "Senator Obama\nbelieves every woman deserves equal pay for equal work. He has a plan to\nhelp working women by guaranteeing seven paid sick days to the 22 million\nwho currently have none, and by providing child tax credits, additional\nafter-school programs, and a tax cut for 71 million working women and\neliminating capital gains taxes for 8.7 million women who own small\nbusinesses or start-ups. Senator McCain thinks the Supreme Court was right\nto make it harder for women to challenge pay discrimination at work, and he\nopposed legislation that Obama co-sponsored to reverse that decision."\n\nIn an Obama campaign call with reporters Thursday in advance of the McCain\nvisit, U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-Madison) said, "There could not be a\nstarker difference (between the two), both with regard to working women and\npay equity."\n\nBaldwin said that for "all the strain that the middle class in Wisconsin and\nthe rest of the nation is feeling right now, Senator McCain is not offering\nany meaningful short-term (stimulus) plan or meaningful middle class tax\ncut."\n\nA recent report by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that McCain\'s tax\ncuts would go far more to upper earners, while Obama would raise taxes on\nupper earners, but lower them more than McCain for people below the highest\nbrackets. McCain argues that his plan would do more to stimulate job\ncreation, and thereby benefit Americans broadly.\n\nThird visit to Wisconsin\n\nMcCain\'s visit was his third to Wisconsin in the general election campaign\nand brought him to what is easily the fastest-growing part of the state, St.\nCroix County, which gave President Bush a nine-point cushion in 2004.\n\nHigh-growth suburbs have proved fertile for the GOP in recent elections.\nBush won Wisconsin\'s six fastest-growing counties four years ago (although\nhe badly lost the biggest top-10 county in growth, Dane).\n\nSince Hudson is in the Twin Cities media market, the visit is also a media\ntwo-fer, drawing heavy coverage in Minnesota and Wisconsin, both states that\nDemocrats narrowly carried in 2004 and that McCain would like to flip from\nblue to red.\n\n"This is a battleground state. There\'s no doubt that Wisconsin will be one\nof those states that decide who the next president of the United States is,"\nMcCain said Friday, although most recent polls have given Obama a\ndouble-digit lead in both states.\n\nThe crowd at Friday\'s event was made up largely, but not entirely, of McCain\nsupporters. Some people interviewed supported Obama or were undecided.\n\nThe McCain campaign said seats were mostly allocated through a group of\npro-McCain women in the state who recruited friends, phone-tree style, to\ncome.\n\nAlso greeting McCain was a now customary contingent of costumed and\nnon-costumed demonstrators: a Citizen Action cow ("Got Health Care?"), and\nMcCain and Bush impersonators from One Wisconsin Now play-acting around a\ngiant mock rubber stamp.\n\nTo see more of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, or to subscribe to the\nnewspaper, go to http://www.jsonline.com.\n\nCopyright (c) 2008, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\nDistributed by McClatchy-Tribune Information Services.\nFor reprints, email tmsreprints@permissionsgroup.com, call 800-374-7985 or\n847-635-6550, send a fax to 847-635-6968, or write to The Permissions Group\nInc., 1247 Milwaukee Ave., Suite 303, Glenview, IL 60025, USA.\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
