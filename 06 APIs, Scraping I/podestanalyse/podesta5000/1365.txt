john.podesta@gmail.comb'Here rough  notes on the call Benenson just did for the DNC talkers today.  Though he said it, he didn\x92t mention \x93moving America forward\x94 much, he focused on the contrast and the middle class.\n\n\nMoving America forward not backwards.  This is a CONTRAST around the middle class vs. what people essentially believe about GOP helping corporate special interests.\n\n-Raise the consequences of Republicans gains and control.\n\n-The contrast is designed to raise the consequences of what it is the GOP will do.  We tap into what people like and fundamentally believe about on the values side.\n\n-The things we have done should not be used as in \x93here\x92s what we have done for you\x94 the things we talk about should allow us to drive a direct contrast about who you stand for.\n\n-Elections are about choices.  Make this a choice about fighting for the middle class vs. GOP protecting their big corporate special interests.  Have to be clear that they will go back to giving big corporate interests free reins.\n\n-People believe the GOP will go back to the Bush-era economic policies (I am not suggesting we attack the personalized version of George Bush, but what he was advocating for \x96 the policies that drove us into the dish)  We need to make these guys the defenders of tax breaks for the wealthiest.  There was a story today about a $100,000 tax break for millionaires.\n\nI am not suggesting that we should just say \x93here\x92s what we have done here\x92s what we have accomplished\x94 \x96 we need to contrast things (some examples)\n\n-We won the battle against wall street. They sided w. Wall street and  the big banks\n-We fought for middle class Americans\n\n-We cut taxes for 95% of all working families.  GOP opposed those biggest tax cuts for middle class Americans\n-We have passed 8 separate tax cuts and expanded lending to 60,000 small businesses\n\nForwards not backwards\nFighting for the middle class vs. taking us back to bush-era policies\n\n-We made it illegal for corporations to deny women equal pay for equal work. (80% of people more favorable to Democrats, generates strong antipathy for GOP around country)\n\n-Protecting SS from privatization, whole lot of Republicans who are ready to go to vouchers for SS.  This information is very rattling to seniors.\n\nLast piece want to touch on\x85. There isn\x92t a poll out there that doesn\x92t show that we should give the law a chance.  This may or may not be an issue we want to lean into . . The components of the health care bill are extremely popular \n\n-stood up for average Americas against insurance companies who were denying coverage.  GOP voted against that in lock step\n\n-All over the country GOP candidates taking pledges on upholding tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas.  Ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas is very popular \x96 this is part of the made in America economy.\n\nQ and A\n*Joel on public polling \x93monkey polls\x94 does anyone believe the President\x92s approval rating swung 8 points in two weeks?\n\n*On professional left\x85 progressives have a job to do and a role to play and that is to push the party as hard as they can with out compromise\x85  Wall street reform tested on the charts throughout\x85. \n\n*after mi event, saw an uptick in the polls \r\nSent via BlackBerry from T-Mobile'
