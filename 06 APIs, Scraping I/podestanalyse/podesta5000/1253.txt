john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear Law Center Community,\r\n\r\nLike many of you, I have been watching the events unfolding in Baltimore over the last week with concern and sadness.  This has been a difficult and tragic year across the nation, with events in Ferguson, Staten Island, Cleveland and now Baltimore raising stark questions about racial injustice in America.  As this academic year comes to a close, it is an appropriate moment for us to learn from the lessons of the last year and talk collectively about how to address these pressing problems.  I invite our students, staff and faculty to come together on <x-apple-data-detectors://12> May 15, 2015 at noon<x-apple-data-detectors://12> in McDonough 201 for a discussion of what can and should be done moving forward, within and beyond the academy and the legal system.   A light lunch will be served.  I hope to see many of you there.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I wish you a successful exam period and peace in our communities.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nBill\r\n\r\n'
