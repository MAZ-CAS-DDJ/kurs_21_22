john.podesta@gmail.comb'I hope so.  She hasn\'t done much to date, but in fairness the\npresentation she\'s supposed to be doing is difficult to define and will\nbe helped by seeing others work.  That said, I wouldn\'t say that she\'s\nbeen running at the opportunity perhaps because she feels that it\'s not\nsufficiently well defined.\n\n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: john.podesta@gmail.com [mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com] \nSent: Wednesday, October 01, 2008 8:34 PM\nTo: Steiner, Joshua\nSubject: Re:\n\n \n\nIs Karen K doing anything for you?\n\nSent via BlackBerry from T-Mobile\n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: "Steiner, Joshua" <Joshua.Steiner@quadranglegroup.com>\nDate: Wed, 1 Oct 2008 19:18:43 -0400\nTo: Amias Gerety<amiasmg@gmail.com>; Dan Tarullo<tarullos4@yahoo.com>;\nDouglas Elmendorf<delmendorf@brookings.edu>; Jack\nLew<jack.lew@citigroup.com>; Jon Orszag<jorszag@compasslexecon.com>;\nKaren Kornbluh<kornbluh@hotmail.com>; Robert\nGreenstein<greenstein@cbpp.org>; William\nDaley<william.m.daley@jpmchase.com>\nCC: <john.podesta@gmail.com>\nSubject: \n\nJust a quick note about tomorrow\'s meeting.\n\n \n\nWe\'re scheduled to go from 4-830 although I know some of you may need to\nleave a little early.  \n\n \n\nI would propose going through the materials in the following order with\nthe following time allocations (I will try to be pretty strict about\nenforcing these).  I don\'t want to suggest that some matters are more\nimportant than others, but also think that realistically we need to\ndevote time to those subjects that will benefit the most from group\ninput and where I suspect the transition leadership will be most focused\non our work:\n\n \n\n*\tBudget (75 minutes)\n*\tStimulus (75 minutes)\n*\tFinancial (75 minutes)\n*\tInternational (20 minutes)\n*\tMisc (Jon will just cover the pieces that fit with the financial\ncrisis) (20 minutes)\n\n \n\nIn addition, Karen has been working on some materials about how the\nactual transition would work, which I don\'t think she\'ll be ready to\npresent in detail, but could I\'m sure benefit from your thoughts.\n\n \n\nJon has arranged for people to show PP slides, but it would be helpful\nif you could bring hard copies for everyone as well.\n\n \n\nFinally, John Podesta may join us for part or all of the session.\n\n \n\nThanks.\n\n_____________________________________\nJoshua L.
