Forcht Bank, based in Lexington, Ky., is owned by Terry Forcht, who also owns several other businesses, including a chain of nursing homes.\n\nOne of them, Hazard Nursing Home Inc., was charged in August with failure to report abuse after one if its 88-year-old female residents, who has Alzheimer\'s, was allegedly sexually abused by a male resident. The home was allegedly told of the abuse in August 2009, but never reported it to authorities.\n\nIt was Conway, the Democratic opponent of Crossroads-backed Rand Paul, who brought the charges. The reports of abuse had been highly publicized<http://www.kentucky.com/2010/07/25/1362652/a-failure-to-protect-sexual-abuse.html#storylink=mirelated> in the Kentucky press months earlier.\n\nCrossroads has spent $1.2 million<http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/indexpend.php?cycle=2010&cmte=C00487363> on anti-Conway ads in Kentucky. Forcht -- a major donor who, along with relatives, associates and employees has given $1.1 million<http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20101025/NEWS01/310250008/Businessman-Terry-Forcht-employees-give-big-to-candidates> to political campaigns since 2002 -- has given $2,400 to Paul, and bundled more than $21,000 for the candidate from employees in just the last five days of June, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal.\n\n"It is my hope that today\'s charges send a message to nursing home operators and administrators that they have an obligation to notify authorities if a resident is abused while in their care," Conway said when announcing the charges<http://ag.ky.gov/pressrelease.htm?PostingGUID=%7b96553429-8054-45BF-B436-342D60459926%7d>.\n\nThe nursing home and its administrator, Sheila Noe, pleaded not guilty<http://www.kentucky.com/2010/09/14/1433445/nursing-home-official-pleads-not.html> to the charges last month.\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: bigcampaign@googlegroups.com [mailto:bigcampaign@googlegroups.com] On Behalf Of Aniello Alioto\nSent: Thursday, October 28, 2010 11:26 AM\nTo: Marge Baker\nCc: Diallo Brooks; virtualwar-room@googlegroups.com; bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\nSubject: [big campaign] Re: Crossroads donor in KY in legal battle with Conway\'s AG office\n\nGood catch Marge!\nThis story is also breaking at http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/rove-ally-terry-forcht-targets-jack-conway/story?id=11974168\nOn Thu, Oct 28, 2010 at 11:16 AM, Marge Baker <mbaker@pfaw.org<mailto:mbaker@pfaw.org>> wrote:\n\nhttp://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2010/10/28/conway_kentucky_terry_forcht/index.html\n\nThursday, Oct 28, 2010 09:58 ET\nCampaign finance conflict revealed in Ky. Senate race\nA businessman who is being sued by Attorney General and Senate hopeful Jack Conway is funding Rand Paul Video\nBy Justin Elliott<http://www.salon.com/author/justin_elliott/index.html>\n\nKentucky Senate candidates, Democrat Jack Conway, left, and Republican Rand Paul, before a debate in Louisville, Ky.\n\nABC reports<http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/rove-ally-terry-forcht-targets-jack-conway/story?id=11974168> on a campaign finance conflict in Kentucky, where state Attorney General Jack Conway faces Republican Rand Paul:\n\nIn the bitter U.S. Senate race in Kentucky, a local millionaire has helped launch a barrage of ads attacking the Democratic candidate - a candidate who, as the state\'s attorney general, is prosecuting the businessman\'s nursing home for allegedly covering up sexual abuse, records show.\n\n...\n\nIn addition to donating personally to Republican Rand Paul\'s upstart campaign, Forcht is the banker handling funds for American Crossroads.\n\nSo basically Forcht, whose Hazard Nursing Home is alleged<http://www.kentucky.com/2010/08/06/1378702/hazard-nursing-home-charged-in.html> by Conway to have covered up the sexual abuse of a senior, is now targeting Conway in the campaign. He\'s doing this as a donor for Paul and as the banker for Crossroads, the group tied to Karl Rove that is spending big against Democrats around the country -- including Conway.\n\nThe ABC piece<http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/rove-ally-terry-forcht-targets-jack-conway/story?id=11974168> also floats the possibility that Forcht has donated to Crossroads\' partner group, American Crossroads GPS, which is organized under a section of the tax code that allows it to keep donors anonymous. It\'s possible Forcht is a donor to GPS, but (barring an extraordinary leak) we will never know. This highlights one of the problems with lack of disclosure: potential conflicts can pretty easily be hidden from public view.\n\nHere\'s one of the Crossroads ads against Conway:\n\n\n\n\n\n--\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n\nThis is a list of individuals.
