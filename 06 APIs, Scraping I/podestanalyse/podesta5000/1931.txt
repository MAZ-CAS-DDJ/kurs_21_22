I know that, for many of you, this news about Katherine\x92s dire health situation is a shock.  Friendly and open by nature, but also quite private about her life, Katherine did not want people to worry about her.\n\nKatherine has been a wonderful, selfless colleague and a great friend.   She has contributed to the Law Center in countless ways, she has brought all of us who know her great joy, and her warmth and concern for others have been an inspiration.  It is a privilege to know her.\n\nShe is not receiving visitors. Please keep Katherine in your thoughts and prayers.\n\nSadly,\nBill\n\n\n'
