john.podesta@gmail.comb'Thanks, all. This is great. I\'m happy to engage with code.org on STEM\npolicy ideas and totally agree, Teddy, that we should continue to make a\nbig deal about need to solve this gender gap.\n\n\nAnn O\xe2\x80\x99Leary\nSent from my iPhone\n(510) 717-5518 (cell)\n\nOn May 10, 2015, at 9:06 AM, Teddy Goff <tgoff@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\nLast year it was December.
