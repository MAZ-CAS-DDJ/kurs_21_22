The feminist in me is horrified, but I suspect the married\npeople in the bunch might want to dispute both the sentiment AND the facts\nthere.\n\n\n\n*From:* Brian Fallon [mailto:bfallon@hillaryclinton.com]\n*Sent:* Thursday, June 18, 2015 3:55 PM\n*To:* Jake Sullivan; Jennifer Palmieri; Kristina Schake; Amanda Renteria;\nJohn Podesta; Marlon Marshall; Christina Reynolds; Robby Mook\n*Subject:* Politico on TPP and WJC comments on Daily Show\n\n\n\nAnnie Karni has been pitched a story by organized labor that, with WJC\nmaking positive comments about free trade last night on the Daily Show, the\nClintons are deliberately trying to have it both ways on trade. I have\ndissuaded her from making that accusation the lede, but she will still\nframe the story as WJC muddling/complicating HRC\'s message from Iowa on\nSunday, even if Karni is convinced that it is not a deliberate two-step.\n\n\n\nThe story will also still denote labor\'s conspiracy theory by including a\nblind quote from a union official saying it is insulting to voters to try\nto so clearly play to both sides in the debate.\n\n\n\nI would like to provide the below to dispute the premise that her position\nis muddled:\n\n\n\n"No president would be a tougher negotiator on behalf of American workers \xe2\x80\x93\neither with our trading partners or Republicans on Capitol Hill -- than\nHillary Clinton. She was very clear in her comments in Iowa about what she\nbelieves must occur in the ongoing trade negotiations."\n'
