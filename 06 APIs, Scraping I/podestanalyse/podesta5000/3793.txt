She hints at her presidential ambitions with\nwink-and-a-nod asides like the one in Iowa: "It is true, I\'m thinking about\nit."\n\n\n\nYet in framing what she described Friday as her "long career of fighting\nfor women, and children, and fairness, and equality, and justice," Clinton\nhas nearly mastered the art of avoiding controversy, offering dry speeches\nand a pitch that seems intended to be inoffensive.\n\n\n\nRather than staking out attention-grabbing positions or wading into policy\ndebates, Clinton seems focused on humanizing an image that has suffered in\nthe past from accusations of brittleness. She rarely misses an opportunity\nto suggest that her soon-to-arrive grandchild is inspiring her to take\nanother look at politics.\n\n\n\n"I\'ve been thinking a lot about family, because, you know, I\'m on grandbaby\nwatch," she wryly told a mostly female audience at a Democratic conference\nFriday.\n\n\n\n"We will certainly do everything possible to prepare this child, protect\nthis child. But I want that for everybody\'s child, and everybody\'s\ngrandchild." Pivoting into what began to sound like a campaign speech, she\nadded: "I want every one of our children to feel that they are inheriting\nthe best of America ... that this country is on your side; that this\ncountry will give you the fighting chance, the fair shot you deserve."\n\n\n\nThose sorts of gauzy statements have become Clinton\'s hallmark this year.\n\n\n\nThe former secretary of State has said little, for example, about the\npresident\'s controversial strategy for defeating Islamic State militants in\nIraq and Syria \xe2\x80\x94 or where she might draw the line on the mission of U.S.\ntroops, a fraught issue after her Senate vote authorizing the use of force\nin Iraq in October 2002 complicated her last presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nHer recent speech on energy policy avoided hot-button topics like the\nKeystone pipeline and was largely devoid of any new policy prescriptions:\n"Good ideas are everywhere you look," she said in one typical line.\n"Imagine what we can do as a country if we all roll up our sleeves and get\nto work."\n\n\n\nWhen confronted by an activist on the rope line in Iowa about whether she\nagreed with President Obama\'s decision to delay until after the election\nhis promised executive action on immigration, she deliberately sidestepped\nthe issue before moving on: "I think we need to elect more Democrats," she\ncrisply told the young woman, who identified herself to Clinton as "a\nDreamer," brought to the U.S. illegally as a child.\n\n\n\nSo far, Clinton\'s lack of specificity has made it difficult to discern what\ndistinct argument she would make for her candidacy. A potential rival from\nthe left, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who recently published her\nbook "A Fighting Chance," cuts a sharp contrast with Clinton in that sense\n\xe2\x80\x94 she is succinct as she rails against banks and Wall Street for "cheating\nfamilies."\n\n\n\nWarren, who so far has insisted she will not run for president, brought\ncheering activists to their feet in Detroit this summer with an\nimpassioned, populist speech declaring that "the game is rigged" against\nworking Americans: "If we push back against the biggest, strongest, most\nruthless lobbying effort in the country," Warren said of big banks, "if we\npush back hard, we can win."\n\n\n\nClinton drew a more muted response with her somewhat meandering speech at\nIowa Sen. Tom Harkin\'s annual steak fry last weekend, which seemed to pull\nthreads from her husband\'s presidential campaigns in 1992 and 1996 \xe2\x80\x94\ndusting off his signature line about championing Americans who "work hard\nand play by the rules," and worry that their children will be worse off\nthan they were.\n\n\n\nThe one area where Clinton has been most visibly passionate \xe2\x80\x94 throughout\nher career and now as she ponders another bid to be the first woman\npresident \xe2\x80\x94 has been her advocacy for the rights of women and girls around\nthe world. That subject will be showcased at the Clinton Global Initiative\ngathering, which begins Sunday night in New York.\n\n\n\nWhen she was introduced this week by Harkin and Democratic National\nCommittee Chairwoman Debbie Wassermann Schultz, both recalled Clinton\'s\ngroundbreaking 1995 speech at a women\'s conference in Beijing, in which she\ndeclared, "Let it be that human rights are women\'s rights, and women\'s\nrights are human rights, once and for all."\n\n\n\nClinton closed her 2008 presidential candidacy with a concession speech\nthat played on her historic effort, saying that although she and her team\n"weren\'t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time\xe2\x80\xa6\nit\'s got about 18 million cracks in it."\n\n\n\nAs a potential reprise nears, Clinton seems to be attempting to expand that\nmantra from breaking barriers herself to her desire to create greater\nsecurity for the middle class through initiatives such as raising the\nminimum wage, expanding access to childcare and ensuring that women and men\nare paid equally.\n\n\n\n"We talk about a glass ceiling," she said during a panel Thursday at the\nCenter for American Progress. "These women don\'t even have a secure floor\nunder them."\n\n\n\nBy the next day, at the Democratic gathering in Washington, she had\nsharpened the line: "No wonder so many families are hurting today. For too\nmany women, for too many families, they don\'t just face ceilings on their\ndreams \xe2\x80\x94 it feels to them as though the floor has collapsed beneath their\nfeet."\n\n\n\n"These aren\'t just women\'s issues, they are family issues," she added.\n"They are American issues, and they hold back our entire economy."\n\n\n\nIt seemed to be the seed of a 2016 message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Hill: \xe2\x80\x9cFive key Hillary Clinton players to watch\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://thehill.com/homenews/presidential-campaign/218384-five-key-hillary-clinton-players-to-watch>*\n\n\n\nBy Amie Parnes\n\nSeptember 21, 2014, 7:00 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton is known for having perhaps the most loyal inner circle in\npolitics, sometimes loyal to a fault.\n\n\n\nWith the speculation of another Clinton bid for the presidency rising to a\nboil, The Hill looks at five insiders who promise to play a big role in the\nwould-be campaign.\n\n\n\n*Cheryl Mills*\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most trusted aide in Hillaryland, Mills served as chief of\nstaff and counselor during Clinton\'s tenure at the State Department,\nhandling everything from personnel matters to management and operations at\nFoggy Bottom.\n\n\n\nThe Stanford University Law graduate is close to both Clintons, having\ndefended the former president during his impeachment trial and remaining\nclose in recent years. But more than anything, Mills is known as a straight\nshooter, something the former first couple values.\n\nThose familiar with the Clinton operation say that if there\'s anyone who\nget the wheels greased in the lead-up to a potential presidential bid for\nClinton, it will be Mills.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe holds the keys the castle,\xe2\x80\x9d one former Hillary aide said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\'s\none singular go-to for the Secretary, she\'s the one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Minyon Moore*\n\n\n\nA senior adviser to Hillary Clinton during her 2008 run, expect Moore to\nplay an even bigger role in a second campaign.\n\n\n\nWhile she now works as a strategist at Dewey Square Group in Washington,\nshe has a constant and direct line of communication with the former\nsecretary of State on both professional and personal matters.\n\n\n\nLike Mills, Moore also has long-running ties to the former first couple.\nShe served in the Clinton White House as assistant to the President and\ndirector of White House Office of Political Affairs as well as the White\nHouse public liaison director.\n\n\n\nMoore doesn\'t have an outsized personality, and prefers to stay behind the\nscenes more often than not. But those inside the operation say Moore would\nhave a role in piecing together the initial phases of a campaign.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn terms of inner circle, Minyon easily falls into that pot,\xe2\x80\x9d a second\nformer Hillary aide said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\'s always been fiercely loyal to both the\npresident and the secretary. And I wouldn\'t expect that to change ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Jake Sullivan *\n\n\n\nA relative newcomer to Hillaryland in 2007, Sullivan helped Clinton prepare\nfor the Democratic primary debates, serving as an adviser for all-things\npolicy.\n\n\n\nBut when she entered the State Department, the Minnesota native became her\nall-purpose senior aide where he not only ran Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Policy and Planning\nshop, but also dealt with communications and personnel issues.\n\n\n\nWhen Clinton traveled to 112 countries as Secretary of State, Sullivan was\nconstantly at her side. So it only made sense that when Clinton left Foggy\nBottom, he was instantly snatched up by the White House, where he served as\nVice President Biden\'s national security adviser.\n\n\n\nSullivan left the White House recently to teach at Yale Law School this\nfall. But, Clinton insiders expect him to return if a Clinton campaign\nbegins.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton thinks Sullivan has chops for his own White House run one\nday, as she told a crowd in 2012.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told my husband about this incredibly bright rising star \xe2\x80\x94 Rhodes\nScholar, Yale Law School \xe2\x80\x94  and my husband said, \xe2\x80\x98Well, if he ever learns\nto play the saxophone, watch out,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\n*Maura Pally*\n\n\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton officially joined the Clinton Foundation in 2013, one\nof her first hires was Pally, who would serve as the executive director for\nher office at the Clinton Foundation.\n\n\n\nSince then, Pally has run many of Clinton\'s initiatives and projects\nincluding \'No Ceilings,\' focused on Women and Girls, and Too Small to Fail,\nan initiative helping the health of young children.\n\n\n\nPally, like other Hillarylanders, began in the Clinton White House serving\nas a special assistant in the counsel\xe2\x80\x99s office. She would go on to serve as\ndeputy counsel during Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 presidential run.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is probably one of the most capable people on staff,\xe2\x80\x9d said one Clinton\ninsider. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing Maura can\'t do. I think the secretary is well\naware of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n*Dan Schwerin*\n\n\n\nAmong the youngest staffers on Team Clinton, Schwerin, an early\nthirty-something, got his start in Hillary\'s Senate office, serving as a\npress aide.\n\n\n\nHe went on to work on the 2008 presidential campaign before landing at the\nState Department as a speechwriter to Clinton.\n\n\n\nBut Schwerin, who has inarguably spent more time with Clinton than any\nother aide this year, had perhaps his biggest task ahead of him when he\nhelped Clinton pen her tome Hard Choices, which was released earlier this\nsummer.\n\n\n\nClinton insiders expect that will be just the beginning of Schwerin\'s\ntrajectory up the Clinton ladder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Hill blog: Ballot Box: \xe2\x80\x9cHarkin: 2016 \'weighing heavily\' on Hillary\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/218416-harkin-2016-weighing-heavily-on-hillary>*\n\n\n\nBy Scott Wong\n\nSeptember 20, 2014, 12:48 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nRetiring Sen. Tom Harkin doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know if Hillary Clinton will run for\npresident in 2016.\n\n\n\nThe Iowa Democrat said the decision is \xe2\x80\x9cweighing heavily" on Clinton, who\nhas \xe2\x80\x9cmore chapters\xe2\x80\x9d to write in her book.\n\n\n\nHis remarks Friday during an interview with Iowa Public Television, come\nnearly a week after Bill and Hillary Clinton headlined his final steak fry\nin Indianola, Iowa, fueling presidential talk in the first-in-the-nation\ncaucus state.\n\n\n\nBefore taking the stage at the event \xe2\x80\x94 Harkin, who\xe2\x80\x99s spent nearly 40 years\nin Congress, \xe2\x80\x94 said Hillary\'s eyes lit up when she watched him play with\nhis grandchildren. The longtime senator asked Clinton, a soon-to-be\ngrandmother, to take a photograph with his entire clan in a shed at the\nannual event.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she just wistfully said to me, \xe2\x80\x98It just looks so wonderful,\xe2\x80\x99 she said,\n\xe2\x80\x98because now I\'m going to have grandchildren,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Harkin explained.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\'ve got to think it weighs heavy,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, she has\nbeen first lady of Arkansas, first lady of the United States, U.S. senator,\nsecretary of State, that\'s a lot of public service. And if you\'re going to\nrun for President that\'s a ten year commitment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHarkin, who lost to Bill Clinton in the 1992 Democratic presidential\nprimary, said he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe Hillary has already decided to run.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople say, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, she has already made the decision.\xe2\x80\x99 I don\'t think so,\xe2\x80\x9d\nHarkin said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think this is weighing heavily on her. I wouldn\'t be\nsurprised if she went one way or the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s only daughter, Chelsea, announced her pregnancy\nlast spring and is due to give birth sometime in the fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*CBS News: \xe2\x80\x9cRand Paul not waiting for 2016 to take on Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rand-paul-not-waiting-for-2016-to-take-on-hillary-clinton/>*\n\n\n\nBy Rebecca Kaplan\n\nSeptember 21, 2014, 10:16 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, isn\'t waiting until the 2016 election to\nformally kick off to start tearing into Hillary Clinton, the most prominent\nface among Democrats who might seek the nomination.\n\n\n\nReferencing a 2008 primary ad in which Clinton suggested then-candidate\nBarack Obama will not prepared to handle a major overnight crisis as\npresident, Paul suggested the former secretary of state had proven herself\nincapable of doing so either.\n\n\n\n"I think she had a 3 a.m. moment. She didn\'t answer the phone, and I think\nit absolutely should preclude her from being [president]," he said at the\nCalifornia Republican convention, where he was speaking Saturday, according\nto the L.A. Times. Paul had just described Clinton\'s actions in the lead up\nto the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya,\nwhich Paul offered as proof of her failure.\n\n\n\nPaul also lit into President Obama, an unsurprising choice of target given\nthe president\'s low approval ratings which threatens to drag down Democrats\nduring the midterm elections.\n\n\n\nThe Kentucky Republican pointed to the Affordable Care Act and Mr. Obama\'s\ninitial plans to take unilateral action on immigration (which was\nultimately delayed until after the November elections) to argue that he was\nrunning roughshod over the Constitution.\n\n\n\n"It is a terrible tragedy, it is a danger to us as a country, and we need\nto do everything we can to stop him from abusing our laws," Paul said.\nLater, he added, "We have a president who basically has created a lawless\natmosphere in Washington."\n\nThough the midterm elections are less than two months away, Paul did not\nuse the speech to fire up California Republicans about this year\'s\ncandidates. Instead he focused mostly on laying out his own priorities for\nthe GOP.\n\n\n\n"When our party looks like America -- with earrings and without earrings,\nwith ponytails and without ponytails, with tattoos and without tattoos --\nwhen we look like the rest of America -- white, black, brown -- we\'re going\nto win again," Paul said as he argued that his party needs to expand its\nappeal to win in places like California again after decades of losing.\n"We\'ve got to go out and we\'ve got to broaden our party, and when we do,\nwe\'ll be a national party again. We will win again."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Hindustan Times: \xe2\x80\x9cEye on future?

And the Clintons live in Chappaqua,\nnear New York city.\n\n\n\nNo other details were available of the meeting except, according to\nmultiple sources in New York and New Delhi, that the prime ministe will\nreceive the couple in his hotel.\n\n\n\n>From all accounts, Modi has never met either of the Clintons before,\ndespite the fact that they travel to India frequently \xe2\x80\x94 Hillary Clinton was\nthere just this past July.\n\n\n\nSo was the former president, separately, in connection with a project run\nby his foundation in Jaipur. He has been a regular, since his first visit\nas president in 2000.\n\n\n\nAnd they have both said they have been impressed by Modi, for their own\nreasons. The former president, who is something of a policy wonk, liked the\nprime minister\xe2\x80\x99s economic policies.\n\n\n\nAnd the former secretary of state has said she was impressed \xe2\x80\x94 no prizes\nfor guessing \xe2\x80\x94 by Modi\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy savvy in inviting SAARC leaders to\nhis inauguration.\n\n\n\nTo put their meeting in perspective, Modi doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any other past\npresidents on his schedule \xe2\x80\x94 and there are three, George H Bush, Jimmy\nCarter and George W Bush \xe2\x80\x94 so far.\n\n\n\nBut he is certainly meeting another Presidential hopeful, vice president\nJoe Biden, who is hosting a state lunch for the visiting prime minister in\nWashington DC.\n\n\n\nIt couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be confirmed if the prime minister was meeting any of the\nRepublicans contemplating a run for the White House \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s a crowded and\nunclear field right now.\n\n\n\nIn September 2000, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was in New York\nfor the UN general assembly, spoke with then Republican candidate George W\nBush over phone.\n\n\n\nThe meeting with the Clintons will be special thus.\n\n\n\nPresident Clinton is widely credited with setting the foundation for new\nrelations between the two countries, which were largely on opposite sides\nduring much of the Cold War.\n\n\n\nHe intervened during the Kargil War by forcing Pakistan to back off, and\nfollowed it up with a successful visit to India in 2000, with a rockstar\nreception in Parliament.\n\n\n\nBut key to this meeting, said sources, will be Secretary Clinton, who has\nnot announced she is running, but she will most likely, according to her\nsupporters, rivals and most political hacks.\n\n\n\nThey felt further convinced recently when she and her husband attended a\nDemocratic party event in Iowa, where Barack Obama beat her in the 2008\nprimaries and turned the race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*CNN: \xe2\x80\x9cBill Clinton on Fareed Zakaria GPS\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2014/09/21/bill-clinton-on-fareed-zakaria-gps-2/>*\n\n\n\n[No Writer Mentioned]\n\nSeptember 21, 2014, 11:10 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nCNN\xe2\x80\x99s FAREED ZAKARIA GPS features an interview with Bill Clinton.

He\'s in an interesting place in life. Almost 14\nyears after leaving the White House, he has settled in to a new way of\neffecting change around the world.   His Clinton Global Initiative will\nhold its 10th annual meeting next week.  The organization claims that in\nthose 10 years they have improved the lives of 430 million people in 180\ncountries. He\'s also set to soon become a grandfather. We\'ll get to all of\nthose matters later in the show, but first I wanted to ask him about the\nstories that are atop the news.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: President Clinton thank you so much for joining us.\n\n\n\nBILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Glad to do it.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: So I\'ve got to ask you about ISIS. I saw you on "The Daily Show"\nsay that you thought we had to respond to these brutal executions of\nAmericans. But I want to press you. Isn\'t that what ISIS wants? Isn\'t\n\xe2\x80\x93wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the purpose of the executions to bait us?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: No. But there\'s a difference in, for example, using targeted\ndrones and airstrikes as we did against al Qaeda effectively for years to\ntry to take down their leadership and infrastructure and let them know they\ncan\'t just decapitate people for the cheap thrill of the global media\nresponse and horrifying people and get away with it and getting bogged down\nin the kind of war they would like us to get bogged down in that would cost\nus a lot of lives and a lot of treasure and inevitably lead to greater\ncivilian casualties, which is why I think the president\'s strategy has a\nchance of succeeding, because the Iraqi government is now more inclusive\nthan it has been since the fall of Saddam Hussein and that seems to be\nawakening, if you will, the willingness of the Sunni tribal leaders to\nparticipate in fighting. We know the Kurds and the Peshmerga are willing to\nfight. If we can help them and support them, I think the larger fight\nagainst ISIS can continue as it should as a local struggle for the freedom\nand liberty of the people.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: You talked about the Iraq part of the strategy, which strikes -\nyou\'re right, it\'s - it\'s viable. There\'s an Iraqi Army that could be\nbetter - made more effective if there were fewer loyalists and more\nprofessional officers in it and more inclusive. There are the Kurdish\nforces. The Syria part is the real puzzle.\n\n\n\nCLINTON: It\'s much harder.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: This is fierce civil war in which the stakes are very high.\nGenerally moderates don\xe2\x80\x99t do well in those circumstances.  Turks have been\ntrying to stand up moderate Syrians for a long time.  How do you think we\nshould handle it?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Well, I support giving the forces that we most closely identify\nwith greater capacity to fight ISIS. The whole question about the Syrian\ngovernment is really academic, between the Iranians and the Russians and\nothers, they\'ll give them enough money and military capacity to do what\nthey have to do.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: So do you think Assad is going to stay?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: I don\'t know. But I think that the worst enemy right now is ISIS.\nAnd I don\'t think we should be in a position of directly coordinating with\nor cooperating with Assad, but I think we all recognize what would happen\nif ISIS had like a monster like state that included most of Syria and Iraq.\nAnd - but I don\'t - I think, therefore, that when the president said we\'d\ncooperate with the moderate Syrian forces, they\'re the only people we have\nto try to empower there, to do their part in this struggle.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: Do you agree with the former secretary of State, who said that\nperhaps if we had helped them three years earlier, it might have been - it\nmight have had or would this - would those funds and arms have ended up\nwith ISIS?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: I agree with her and I would have taken the chance. I also agree\nwith her when she said we can\'t know whether it would have worked or not.\nAnd that\'s why you have to be careful when you make these commitments,\nbecause you can\'t know.  But since ISIS has plenty of money, is one of the\ngreat bank robbers in human history, among other things, they were going to\nget their weapons one way or the other. So I would risk it. And besides,\nwhen we were talking about doing it, there was no ISIS. However, it was a -\nan argument she lost within the administration and she admitted then and\nacknowledged in her book that she can\'t know that if her recommendation had\nbeen followed, it would have worked. That\'s one of those things you can\'t\nknow. This - that\'s why all of these decisions are hard.\n\n\n\n///\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: Next on GPS, much more with Bill Clinton. Russia, Ukraine and the\nWest, and much more.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: Back now on this special edition of GPS, more of my interview with\nBill Clinton.\n\n\n\n///\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: Ukrainian officials - high Ukrainian officials have said that\nRussia, in effect, invaded Ukraine over the last month, that somewhere\nbetween 3,000 and 10,000 Russian soldiers crossed the border.  Do you think\nwe should call this an invasion and act in a way, in a sense appropriately?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Well, really, there\'s no question they invaded Ukraine. And\nthere\'s no question what Mr. Putin has tried to do. They\'ve also armed the\nEastern Ukrainians, as they\'ve done all those things.  But I think Ukraine\nelected a very prudent and strong president. He\'s trying to negotiate an\nend to this that enables them to have a relationship with Russia without\nparalyzing their turn to Europe and their attempt to reap the economic and\npolitical benefits that would entail.  And I think the United States should\nsupport building Ukraine\'s capacity to defend itself, but even more\nimportantly, we should be doing what we can, including groups like our\nGlobal Initiative, to help them succeed economically, to reward their\nchoice to be free and independent.  I think it\'s very important that the\nworld not buy the propaganda that is going over the Russian media that\nUkrainians wanted to have an adversarial relationship with Russia. That\'s\nsimply not true. All they wanted to do was to have a good relationship with\nRussia and a good relationship with Europe and the West and be a bridge\nbetween the two. Why he doesn\'t want that remains something of a mystery to\nme. I mean I think he\'s got an outdated view of how to get more influence\nand accumulate more wealth. But the - he\'s in these negotiations now and I\nthink those of us who are outside it should not complicate his job by\nsaying too much until we see what he can negotiate.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: You know, a lot of Russians, including Mr. Putin, blame you, in a\nsense. They say NATO expanded, we were told NATO wouldn\'t expand, they\nexpanded very close to our borders. Then the Clinton administration,\nintervened in Kosovo, over our objections. So they argue that you pushed\nout so now don\'t be surprised that you get a backlash.\n\n\n\nCLINTON: If you can find one Polish citizen who agrees, I\'ll be glad to\ntake that seriously. I mean, look, first of all, I never told them NATO\nwouldn\'t expand. I ran for president advocating the expansion of NATO in\n1992.  And I had a conversation with Boris Yeltsin, whom I respected very\nmuch and who was a much better president than he got credit for, as we all\nnow see. And I said, look, I don\'t think you\'re going to invade Eastern\nEurope, but you\'re not going to be there forever. President Yeltsin, in\nreturn for Ukraine getting rid of all of its nuclear weapons and sending\nthem to Russia, signed an agreement with me and the then president of\nUkraine saying that Russia would always respect Ukraine\'s territorial\nintegrity. President Putin said it was an agreement, not a treaty,\ntherefore I\'m not bound by it. I just think it\'s a bum rap that expanding\nNATO caused all this. You know, that - you made me invade Georgia and you\nmade me invade Ukraine because they were the only two countries on my\nborder that weren\'t part of NATO? I mean come on, it just - it\'s not a\ncredible thing\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: Coming up in a moment, more Bill Clinton.  If Hillary Clinton were\nto run and win, what would life be like as the "first man"?  I\'ll ask him\nto consider.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: Welcome back to GPS. Here\'s more of my interview with Bill\nClinton, 42nd president of the United States and Founder of the Clinton\nFoundation.  One of the foundation\'s main projects is the Clinton Global\nInitiative which brings together world leaders, business leaders,\nphilanthropists and non-profits, to work on solving what it calls "the\nworld\'s most pressing challenges".  Next week, the power-packed group will\nhold its 10th annual meeting.\n\n\n\n///\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: Let me start with something that really affects The Clinton\nFoundation and The Clinton Global Initiative. You worked a lot on issues\nlike disease and disease prevention.  What lesson do you think we should\ndraw from this outbreak of Ebola and the speed and kind of pace with which\nits spread?  When you look at it, what is it that you - you can tell us\nabout maybe the potential for pandemics or - or anything?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Well, first, like anybody else who\'s involved, we have a big\npresence in Liberia and three of our people, our top people, have stayed in\nLiberia to help organize the response. So we\'ve all got to figure out, you\nknow, how to coordinate it better. We\'re going to have a special session on\nit at CGI. But the lesson we should draw, the lessons are twofold.  One is\nwe have to do a much better job in building the health care infrastructure\nin these countries. We have to increase their capacity, including the\ncapacity to have community health workers go out in these villages and have\ncredibility with people. You know, this tragic story of the health workers\nbeing killed in Guinea, it\'s just terrible.  But if we have more capacity,\nwe can deal with it quicker. So that\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing.  The second thing\nis we\'re going to have to get quicker and nimbler at developing biomedical\nresponses, you know, the vaccines or whatever or cures.  And the third\nthing is the wealthy countries have got to reexamine how we fund the World\nHealth Organization, because I think they do a marvelous job. But\nincreasingly, as development ministries get more expertise in given areas,\nthey want to fund specific projects in specific countries. And it\'s clear\nthat the World Health Organization needs a pot of money that can be\nmobilized in a hurry for emergencies while we wait for the inevitable time\ndelay when America and the U.K. and France and Scandinavia, we all kick in\nmoney.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: I\'ve got to ask you about some politics, are the Democrats going\nto hold the senate?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: I think so, but it\'s going to be close. And it depends frankly on\nwhether we can continue to match the money provided by all these outside\ngroups. I think the Koch brothers are going to spend about $300 million in\nthe last couple of months. And it depends on who turns out.  We have got\nsomehow, sooner or later, to convince the people that vote in presidential\nelections for our side they have to vote in the Congressional elections.\nAnd if they don\'t, they can\'t complain when they lose governorships, state\nlegislators and members of Congress and the senators who happen to be up in\nthat year. We\'ve got a lot more senators up this year than the Republicans\ndo. And we have them up in states that President Obama did not carry in\n2012. But they\'re running great campaigns and we seem to be doing\nreasonably well.  But it - if you look at all these polls, which are all\nover the place, they\'re all accurate - that is the real question in polling\ntoday is the sample you pick based on who you think will vote. And the\nquestion - the answer to that is, no one knows. So if we can get our\nturnout up, we\'ll be fine and they\'ll hold the Senate.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: Along those lines, when I talk to Democratic grassroots activists,\nthe one person who energizes them is Elizabeth Warren.  Do you think she\'s\nthe future of the Democratic Party?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: I think she\'s an important part of it. And I think the American\npeople are - the Democrats, at least - are worried about people having an\nequal shot at prosperity. And, you know, when I was president, I\xe2\x80\x99ve told\nyou this before - one of the things I was most proud of is we moved 100\ntimes as many people from poverty into the middle class as moved under\nPresident Reagan. The bottom 20 percent (INAUDIBLE) increased 23.6 percent,\nthe top 20 percent increased 20.5 percent.  And everybody else in the\nmiddle did better than they did in the Reagan years.  You had to have more\nbroad-based prosperity. So I think anybody who\'s arguing for that is going\nto find a receptive ear in the American electorate, not just among\nDemocrats. I mean we - we\'re going to have a vote in my native state of\nArkansas in raising the minimum wage and I\'ll be surprised if we don\'t get\na majority of Republicans to vote for it, even though their politicians\nare, by and large, against it.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: There are certain circumstances in - in the next presidential\nelection that might produce a very unusual outcome. And I\'m wondering have\nyou given any thought to what it would be like to be back in the White\nHouse in a different role?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: No. No, I haven\'t. I think that in general, if you\'re a spouse,\nyou ought to support. If you\'re a former president, you ought to do\nwhatever the current president asks you to do, if you can do it in good\nconscience. But I have given it no thought beyond that. I - this is my life\nnow, this foundation. And I have poured my heart into it for 14 years and\nthis is our tenth annual Clinton Global Initiative. We\'ve raised, you know,\n$80 billion and helped 400 million people plus in 180 countries. It\'s my\nlife now. And I do politics at election time if they want me for people I\nbelieve in I think I can help. But otherwise, I\'m happy doing what I\'m\ndoing and if that\'s what I\'m asked to me, I\'d be happy as a clam if that\nwere the case, too. I\'ll do whatever I\'m asked to do.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: And do you have any specific thoughts about being a grandfather?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Yes, I can\'t wait. And I\'m - we\'re on watch now. I hope by the\nfirst of October, I\'ll be a grandfather. I - I...\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: Do - do you care if it is a boy or a girl?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: No. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: Do you really not know?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: No, no. And there are - my daughter and son-in-law decided not to\nknow. They want to be surprised. So we\'re all just sitting around waiting.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: Mr. President, we usually have an end segment where I recommend a\nbook of the week. We are blowing it out all for you, so I\'m giving you the\nlast word, which is what book would you recommend? You\'re a voracious\nreader. You\'ve read stuff. If you were to tell our readers what should they\nread?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: If you\'ll give me two.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: Sure.\n\n\n\nCLINTON: First, I\'d like readers to read "Abundance," the Peter Diamandis\nbook with his coauthor, because if they did that, they would see that while\nthe headlines are really bad in the world today, the trend lines are pretty\ngood. Extreme poverty is down. The health care is improving dramatically\naround the world. There are developments now which make me believe we might\nbe able to do what we did in the 90s which is to use technological\ndevelopments to create more jobs than we lose. For the last few months, for\nthe first time in literally more than a decade, 40 percent of the new jobs\nhave been in higher wage categories. I think people should read this and\nget some good ideas. The other book is "The Social Conquest of Earth" by\nE.O. Wilson.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: Yes.\n\n\n\nCLINTON: He\'s a Nobel Prize winning microbiologist, but he writes as best\nhe can from all the known evidence about the history of life on Earth from\nsingle-cells organisms to the present day. The reason I would like them to\nread that is that he said if you look at all the species that have ever\nlived on Planet Earth, the most successful were ants, termites, bees and\npeople. Why? Because they\'re the greatest cooperators. And even - and I saw\nthe other day a story about how there are 25,000 species of spiders on\nEarth and for reasons nobody understands, a couple of dozen of them have\nstarted cooperating and they build stronger, better webs. Cooperation will\nsave the future. And America should lead it. Every time humanity has been\nin danger of extinguishing itself, our consciousness and our conscience\nhave led us to come together. That\'s the big issue of the 21st century.\nThat\'s the great fight of the next 25 years.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: So Congress should learn from spiders, that - that\'s\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nCLINTON: They will - I spent a lot of time with spiders in my early life. I\njust think, you know, the - "The Constitution" could be subtitled, "Let\'s\nMake A Deal." The founders understood it. We need to remember it.\n\n\n\nZAKARIA: Bill Clinton, a pleasure to have you on Mr. President.\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Associated Press: \xe2\x80\x9c2016 May Loom, But Jeb Bush Is Focused on Business\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ecc0ceb1ca954820ac7b808eaf643483/2016-may-loom-jeb-bush-focused-business>*\n\n\n\nBy Michael J. Mishak and Steve Peoples\n\nSeptember 20, 2014, 10:41 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nCORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 While other Republicans considering the 2016\npresidential race are openly laying the foundations of potential campaigns,\nformer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is busy tending to a growing personal business\nempire.\n\n\n\nIt\'s a break in style from recent candidates who distanced themselves from\nthe sometimes politically risky business of making money before running.\n\n\n\nA Republican establishment favorite, Bush is chairman of a Florida-based\nprivate equity and business advisory group, and is a managing partner of at\nleast eight other separate companies that dabble in ventures ranging from\nprivatized emergency response to real estate to driverless cars, according\nto state and federal records.\n\n\n\nIn the past three years, regulatory filings show that he and his partners\nat the private equity firm, Britton Hill Holdings, have branched out into\nnearly a dozen different investment entities and raised at least $66.4\nmillion from domestic and foreign investors. That includes several million\nthis past April from a group that included a privately owned Chinese\nconglomerate, a deal first reported by Bloomberg.\n\n\n\nBush says he will make a decision about 2016 by year\'s end. Should he run,\nthis son and brother of the past two Republican presidents will face\npressure to disclose years of personal tax returns and details about his\nprivate business activity, as well as to unwind his ownership in the\nbusiness network he began building after leaving office in 2007.\n\n\n\nFor now, in much the same way he is quietly working to support GOP\ncandidates in the November elections, Bush\'s business deals are made out of\nthe spotlight. There is no suggestion any are improper. Because they are\nprivate enterprises and disclosure laws require only basic information,\npublic documents offer few details about their exact nature.\n\n\n\nThey are, however, reminiscent of the GOP\'s last presidential nominee, Mitt\nRomney, who struggled at times to explain the often complicated and\nsometimes controversial ways he made a living. Romney, as well as Bush\'s\nfather and brother, wound down personal business affairs years before\nrunning for president.\n\n\n\n"It is a legitimate issue to think about," said Ron Kaufman, a former\nRomney adviser who is close to the Bush family. "In a perfect world, would\nhe be better served if (the presidential race) was four years away? Sure.\nBut it\'s not."\n\n\n\nBush declined a request for an interview.\n\n\n\nThose close to him say that after his two terms as governor, he has worked\naggressively to improve his personal finances, a common practice for\npoliticians after public service.\n\n\n\nBush "is not currently a candidate for office. He\'s a businessman," said\nhis spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell. "If he makes a decision to run for\npresident, he would certainly review his work engagements at that time."\n\n\n\nOther Bush confidants caution against reading too much into his business\ndealings. They believe he is well positioned to wait longer than other\ncandidates to make a call on a campaign because of his political\nconnections and deep fundraising network.\n\n\n\n"You don\'t put your life on hold or call a time out. You move on until you\nmake a decision," said Al Cardenas, a Bush friend and adviser. "He enjoys\nwhat he\'s doing. Investors trust him. So why would you put a stop to that?"\n\n\n\nOperatives in both parties said the calculus isn\'t that simple.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Romney was attacked by other Republicans as a "vulture\ncapitalist," which helped create the portrait of job-destroying buyout\nchief who enjoyed a lower tax rate than most people in the United States.\n\n\n\n"It is a target-rich environment for opposition research teams to pour\nthrough and begin to build a narrative that you\'re out of touch," said\nSouth Carolina-based Republican operative Hogan Gidley. "It sounds like\nhe\'s doing everything right, everything above board. But the political\nreality exists that it still might hurt him."\n\n\n\nCardenas rejects the comparison to Romney, whose Bain Capital held a\nmajority stake in dozens of companies and directly oversaw management\ndecisions. Bush, unlike Romney, will not be defined by his "fairly modest"\ninvestments, Cardenas said, adding that comparing the two is "the\ndifference between running a gas station and running Texaco."\n\n\n\nFriends and former aides say Bush\'s behavior is consistent with the way he\nhandled his business affairs while contemplating runs for governor in 1994\nand 1998.\n\n\n\n"Before he was a candidate, he was a businessman, and he conducted his\nbusiness sort of not thinking about his next (political) move. He just did\nit," said Phil Handy, a Florida businessman who was chairman of Bush\'s\ngubernatorial campaigns. "I think it reflects his ambivalence about running\nfor office, but I don\'t think it\'s at all unusual."\n\n\n\nStill, at this point in their political careers, Romney and the previous\nBush presidents had all but exited the business world.\n\n\n\nBush\'s father, former President George H. W. Bush, turned his financial\naffairs over to a blind trust once he became vice president. Jeb Bush\'s\nbrother, former President George W. Bush, sold stocks with connections to\nMideast oil companies roughly a decade before running. He later put the\nmajority of his assets into treasury notes and a blind trust.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush\'s business obligations sometimes have conflicted with the\npolitical calendar.\n\n\n\nWhen some possible contenders, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul, spoke at the Conservative Political Action\nConference in Washington this year, Bush declined to appear because of\nundisclosed business commitments.\n\n\n\nBut Bush has traveled the country this year raising money for Republicans\nand continues to work on education issues at his foundation.\n\n\n\nHe has headlined more than two dozen private fundraisers, including events\nto help the governors of Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada, three of the\nfirst four states to hold presidential primaries. This past week he\nattended fundraisers for Illinois gubernatorial hopeful Bruce Rauner and\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\n\n\n"He\'s quietly active. He just doesn\'t go out and bang the drum," said Mel\nSembler, a Florida real estate developer and top Republican fundraiser.\n"He\'s doing all the right things, and I think he\'s going to be a serious\ncontender."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sec.
