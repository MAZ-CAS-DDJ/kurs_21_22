The movement asks colleges and universities to withdraw investments from coal, oil, and natural gas companies. More importantly, it aims to turn the endowment into a billboard for virtue signaling and to recast the university as a political weapon. This fall, divestment activists are using divestment to seed a radical campaign to push for a strong climate pact at the UN climate summit in Paris this December. This report closely examines the movement\'s structure, critiques its goals, and offers the most exhaustive encyclopedia of its activity, successes, and failures to date.\n\nRegister\n\nSpace is limited.
