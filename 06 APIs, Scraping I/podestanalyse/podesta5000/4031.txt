Since Clinton\'s exit, Obama\'s lead with women has grown by 7\n-- Obama now leads McCain among women by 13 points. He\'s made significant\ngains with older and married women, groups McCain was eying.\nhttp://www.gallup.com/poll/107806/Obama-Gains-Among-Women-After-Clinton-Exit.aspxJune\n11, 2008 Obama Gains Among Women After Clinton Exit Now running as strongly\nvs. McCain among women as Clinton did by Jeffrey M. Jones\n\nPRINCETON, NJ -- Since Hillary Clinton decided to concede the Democratic\nnomination to Barack Obama last week, Obama has established a lead over\nRepublican John\nMcCain<http://www.gallup.com/poll/107791/Gallup-Daily-Obama-Lead-Appears-Stabilize.aspx>in\ngeneral-election polling. Obama\'s gains have come more from women than\nmen, though he has picked up among both groups in recent days.\n\n Obama\'s lead among women has now expanded from five percentage points to\n13, while his deficit among men has shrunk from six points to two.\n\nThese figures are based on aggregated Gallup Poll Daily tracking interviews\nwith national registered voters conducted May 27-June 2 (the week\nimmediately before Obama clinched the nomination on June 3), which showed\nObama and McCain tied at 46%, and June 5-9 (the five days since it was\nreported that Clinton would suspend her campaign), which show Obama ahead,\n48% to 42%. Obama clinched the nomination on the evening of June 3, and the\nnews media reported Clinton would suspend her campaign on the evening of\nJune 4. Thus, the data give a clear picture of voter support before and\nafter Clinton\'s exit.\n\nWhile campaigning for president, Clinton demonstrated an especially strong\nappeal to women. She led McCain by 52% to 40% in her final full week as a\ncandidate, exactly equal to the average since mid-March. By comparison,\nObama held only an average 47% to 42% lead over McCain among women during\nthe same time span. At least for now, he seems to be matching Clinton\'s\nperformance among women versus McCain, given his current 13-point lead among\nfemale voters.\n\nOne of Clinton\'s core groups of supporters during the nomination phase of\nthe campaign was older women. During the last few days of her active\ncandidacy, Clinton led McCain by 51% to 41% among women aged 50 and older,\nwhile Obama *trailed* McCain among this group, 46% to 43%.\n\nSince Clinton suspended her campaign, older women\'s vote preferences have\nshifted toward Obama, so that he now enjoys a six-point advantage over\nMcCain.\n\nObama had always run much better among younger women, in large part because\nof his strong appeal to younger voters. But his support has also risen among\nwomen aged 18 to 49 in the past few days, further expanding his already\nformidable 52% to 40% lead over McCain to 56% to 35%.\n\nObama has made major gains in the past few days among married women, erasing\nMcCain\'s former 52% to 40% lead and pulling into a 45% to 45% tie.\nMeanwhile, the vote preferences among married men (a solid McCain group) and\nunmarried men and women (solid Obama groups) have changed little since\nClinton decided to end her White House bid.\n\nObama has also seen his support among non-Hispanic white women increase\nmodestly, though McCain still holds a slim 46% to 43% advantage among this\ngroup. Prior to Clinton\'s departure, McCain led Obama by 50% to 41% among\nwhite women.\n\nInterestingly, while white women were a major part of Clinton\'s primary\nconstituency, she maintained only a slim (if any) advantage in\ngeneral-election trial heats versus McCain among this group. In the last\nweek of her campaign, she only tied McCain among white women, at 47%. Thus,\nher strong performance against McCain among all female voters in\npresidential trial heats was primarily because of strong support from\nminority women.\n\n*Implications*\n\nObama\'s recent gains in the polls have been greatly aided by increased\nsupport from female voters. Now that Clinton is no longer campaigning and\nthe focus of voters\' decision-making is a choice between Obama and McCain,\nfemale voters may be taking a second look at Obama. Indeed, his current\n13-point advantage over McCain is essentially the same advantage that\nClinton held over McCain throughout her active candidacy.\n\nObama\'s challenge in the general-election campaign will be to bring core\nDemocratic groups that did not strongly support him in the primaries --\nwomen, voters with less formal education, and conservative Democrats -- back\ninto the fold. He appears to be already doing that among women. However, it\nis not clear whether this is just a temporary rally in support for him upon\nclinching the nomination, or whether he will be able to sustain a high level\nof support from female voters for the duration of the campaign.\nhttp://www.gallup.com/poll/107791/Gallup-Daily-Obama-Lead-Appears-Stabilize.aspx\nJune 10, 2008 Gallup Daily: Obama\'s Lead Stabilizing Leads McCain 48% to 41%\nin latest presidential trial heat\n\nPRINCETON, NJ -- Barack Obama has a 48% to 41% lead in the latest Gallup\nPoll Daily tracking\n<http://www.gallup.com/tag/Gallup%2bDaily.aspx>presidential election\ntrial heat, based on June 7-9 polling.\n\nVoting preferences have been fairly stable over the last three individual\ndays of tracking polling, all conducted since Hillary Clinton officially\nsuspended her candidacy and publicly endorsed Obama for president on\nSaturday.\n\nThe seven percentage point advantage is Obama\'s largest to date since Gallup\nbegan tracking the general election in March. In turn, McCain has led Obama\nby as many as six percentage points in early May.
