I keep you and Hallie in my thoughts and prayers daily.   I am hoping that I can get a yes or no from you on how to move forward re: below 2 questions.\r\n\r\nJohn \xe2\x80\x93 if you have any guidance otherwise please advise.  This is an update from our last conversation.  Unfortunately question 1 cannot await your return from China.\r\n\r\nQuestion 1\r\nThis building has approx 23k rentable square feet available on floor 2 but as John knows, they need to know today if we are serious about taking all 25k b/c they have a serious offer for part of the floor.  This is the only available space in the building.  After meeting and receiving guidance from Huma last night that HRC is not prepared to commit to a big footprint within CF water street and is unsure whether she will need anything but a possible small footprint of office space at Water Street, I recommend the following:\r\n\r\n\r\na.       We let Goldman move forward with their serious tenant to take approximately 8000 rentable square feet on 2 b/c without a big footprint for HRC we cannot use the entire floor.\r\n\r\nb.      We ask Goldman to give us first rights to consider the remaining approximately 15000 rentable square feet on 2 while we discuss our expansion needs (including but not limited to a possible small footprint for HRC).  I will put together a memo that outlines what I believe to be our growth needs + a possible small footprint for HRC that Huma and I discussed to help inform this decision.\r\n\r\nCan I proceed as recommended above?\r\n\r\nQuestion 2\r\nCVC, BC, HRC and others have expressed the desire to move our Harlem personnel (10 total and all employed by CESC) to Water Street now.  I have David Beale exploring the options of fitting them in with the 18th floor at Water street including related costs and possible displacement of CF related but separately incorporated entities in the following order:  AHG, CHAI, CGSGI.  I expect to get his proposal sometime next week. Some considerations before we decide:\r\n\r\n\r\na.       Do we want to move these personnel from Harlem?  Keep in mind that we risk exposure because it will mean GSA is paying for an empty 8600 square feet until August 2014, our first out option.  We have landlords who aren\xe2\x80\x99t happy we moved most of our operations out of their building and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind leaking an empty floor to the press.\r\n\r\nb.      If we are okay with taking the exposure risk, do we envision the auditors coming back and recommending (and BC accepting) that CESC should not operate within CF space even with a sub-lease agreement?\r\n\r\nc.       The advantages of course are obvious \xe2\x80\x93 better business continuity, management, etc.\r\n\r\nShould I proceed with exploring moving our Harlem personnel to Water Street within next few months?\r\n\r\nThanks Laura\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLaura Graham\r\nChief Operating Officer\r\n& Chief of Staff to President Clinton\r\nThe Clinton Foundation\r\n55 W 125th St, NY, NY 10027\r\n212-348-1779 phone\r\n212-348-9855 fax\r\nLgraham@clintonfoundation.org<mailto:Lgraham@clintonfoundation.org>\r\nLaura@presidentclinton.com<mailto:Laura@presidentclinton.com>\r\n\r\nPlease consider the environment before printing this e-mail\r\n\r\n"
