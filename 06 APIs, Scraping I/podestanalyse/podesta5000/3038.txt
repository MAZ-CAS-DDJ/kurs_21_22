Our military can accomplish such a task, should it be\nassigned, if it uses all elements of U.S. military power, focused on our\nland forces\' proficiencies in maneuver warfare and logistics.\n\nThere is significant disagreement and confusion about the time necessary to\nwithdraw all U.S. military forces from Iraq. Proponents of an indefinite\nU.S. military presence in Iraq have asserted that a withdrawal of over\n140,000 American troops and equipment would be fraught with risk,\nuncertainty, and overwhelming logistical complications. According to a\nrecent ABC News piece, several commanders in Iraq stated that there was "no\nway" a withdrawal of one to two brigades per month could work\nlogistically\x97although none of them agreed to be quoted on the record.\n\nThe debate over how to conduct an American withdrawal has gravitated back\nand forth between those arguing that there must be either a rapid,\nprecipitous withdrawal, and those advocating for a long, drawn-out\nredeployment. Many who argue for an extended redeployment over several years\ndo so simply in order to "stay the course" in Iraq, and cherry-pick\nlogistical issues to make the case for an extended U.S. presence.\n\nDeciding between a swift or extended redeployment, however, is a false\nchoice. Both options are logistically feasible, but this report will\ndemonstrate that an orderly and safe withdrawal is best achieved over an 8\nto 10 month period. This report, written in consultation with military\nplanners and logistics experts, is not intended to serve as a playbook for\nour military planners; it is a guide to policymakers and the general public\nabout what is realistically achievable. A massive, yet safe and orderly\nredeployment of U.S. forces, equipment, and support personnel is surely\ndaunting\x97but it is well within the exceptional logistical capabilities of\nthe U.S. military.\n\nIt is necessary now more than ever for the United States to commit to a\nresponsible phased withdrawal. This must be done because, as many analysts\nhave noted, the American invasion and occupation of Iraq has produced\nseveral unintended consequences. A large and indefinite military presence in\nIraq has allowed Al Qaeda and the Taliban to reconstitute itself, diverted\nU.S. attention from the war in Afghanistan, weakened the United States\'\nability to project its hard and soft power around the world, and\nstrengthened Iranian influence throughout the greater Middle East.\n\nThe latest unintended consequence is widespread Iraqi opposition to the\nseemingly indefinite American troop presence. The Bush administration\'s\npositions on the bilateral Status of Forces and Strategic Framework\nAgreements has created a broad Iraqi political consensus in favor of a U.S.\ncommitment to withdraw its forces from the country.\n\nRecent calls from Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, his cabinet, and the\nmajority of the Iraqi Parliament for a specific timetable for the withdrawal\nof American forces from Iraq represents the beginning of a broad\ncross-sectarian parliamentary bloc that could provide the organizing\nprinciples for accommodation in the short term and eventual reconciliation.\nNo such consensus yet exists among Iraqis as to what the new Iraq will be,\nbut broad consensus does exist around the belief that no genuine,\nsustainable Iraqi unity can develop while the Iraqi government continues to\nbe underwritten by a large foreign military presence.\n\nDespite Maliki\'s many statements supporting a timetable for a U.S. troop\nwithdrawal, many supporters of remaining in Iraq mistakenly argue that\nMaliki is just pandering to his constituents. Many of these same people\nthought we would be greeted as liberators when we invaded and occupied Iraq,\nignoring the fact that resistance to foreigners is an integral part of\nIraq\'s national identity and that it is the Iraqis, not the United States,\nthat will determine their fate.\n\nThe United States must therefore move beyond a discussion about the effect\nof the surge, and seize this opportunity offered by the Iraqis to take\ncontrol of their own security by beginning a responsible phased withdrawal\nof U.S. combat troops from Iraq. Such a withdrawal gives the United States\nthe best opportunity to achieve its goals in Iraq and advance overall U.S.\nsecurity interests in the greater Middle East.\n\nIraqi leaders are increasingly eager and able to take over their own\naffairs. Unlike during the Iraqi elections in 2005, scores of Sunni\npolitical parties are preparing to run in the provincial elections\noriginally scheduled for this fall, and Iraqi Security Forces have taken the\nlead in several operations from Mosul to Basra. Lt. Gen. James Dubik, the\nAmerican officer currently in charge of training Iraq\'s security forces,\ntold Congress last month that the Iraqi Army and police will be ready to\nassume responsibility for Iraq\'s internal security as early as April 2009.\n\nThose opposed to a timetable for withdrawal make the argument that setting\nsuch a timetable will undermine the gains made by the surge of 30,000\nAmerican troops into Iraq in the first half of 2007. According to Gen. David\nPetraeus, the situation in Iraq is too volatile to project a withdrawal\ndate. In fact, Petraeus has it exactly backward. It is not listening to the\nIraqi government that will endanger the gains we have made in the last year.\n\nThere can be no doubt that violence has reached its lowest levels since\n2004, but supporters of maintaining an indefinite American troop presence in\nIraq attribute the current reduction in violence solely to the simple\nincrease in American combat forces and ignore other factors that have\ncontributed to today\'s improved security environment. These other factors\nwere either directly linked to the prospect of an American withdrawal or had\nnothing to do with the surge in the first place. Not setting a date will\nactually undermine these gains.\n\nThe recent decline in violence in Iraq from the record levels of 2006 and\nearly 2007 is due in large part to the emergence of Sunni "awakening" groups\nand Sons of Iraq militias. These groups were co-opted by U.S. forces in the\nearly fall of 2006, long before the surge even began, and were in part a\nresponse to the widespread belief by Sunni\'s in Anbar that the United States\nwould not be remaining in Iraq indefinitely.\n\nAccording to commanders on the ground, the prospect of a U.S. withdrawal was\nthe main impetus for Sunni cooperation. Major General John Allen, a Marine\nCommander in Anbar, has stated that the rising pro-withdrawal sentiment in\nthe United States, which was reflected in the victory in the 2006 midterm\nelection of pro-withdrawal candidates, had a major effect on the Sunnis.\nAccording to Allen, the election "did not go unnoticed....They talked about\nit all the time." He went on to say that the Marines in Anbar, "from top to\nbottom, reinforced the message sent by the [2006 election results] by\nsaying, \'We are leaving.... We don\'t know when we are leaving, but we don\'t\nhave much time, so you [the Anbaris] better get after this.\'"\n\nBrigadier Gen. Sean McFarland, who had been a colonel in command of the\nArmy\'s First Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division in Al Anbar province\nfrom January 2006 until January 2007, credited the "growing concern that the\nU.S. would leave Iraq and leave the Sunnis defenseless against Al-Qaeda and\nIranian-supported militias [which] made these younger [Sunni] leaders open\nto our overtures" as the main reason for the turn around in Al Anbar.\n\nIn other words, the Sunni Awakening forces began cooperating with U.S.\nforces in late 2006 because they believed we were leaving. The perception\nthat we will main\xactain a large presence in Iraq indefinitely will endanger\nthis cooperation.\n\nThe unilateral standdown of Shia cleric Muqtada al Sadr and his Mahdi Army,\nwhich began in February 2007, was also key to reducing violence. This\ndevelopment, like the co-option of the "Sons of Iraq" militias, was not a\nresult of the U.S. troop build-up, nor was it instigated by the Iraqi\ngovernment. It had much more to do with Sadr positioning himself for the\nupcoming election.\n\nWhile Sadr\'s power and influence have been weakened over the past year, his\npolitical movement still remains popular among many Shiites, and the cleric\nstill possesses a military wing, the Jaish al-Mahdi, which is capable of\ncausing problems for the government of Prime Minister Maliki and his\nsupporters in Parliament\x97the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq and the Dawa\nParty. Absent a timetable for withdrawal, this struggle for power can become\nviolent again.\n\nSurge proponents point to the marked drop in ethno-sectarian violence, in\nparticular, as a reason for maintaining the Bush administration\'s current\npolicy. Yet this decline in violence resulted as much from the completion of\nethnic and sectarian cleansing and the near homogenization of Baghdad\nneighborhoods as from the U.S. troop build-up.\n\nThe surge proponents\' final claim, that recent troop reductions are what\nPresident Bush calls "a return on success," is also misguided. The surge of\ncombat troops ended not because of conditions on the ground, but because the\nPentagon could not maintain 20 brigades in Iraq and keep the current level\nof forces in Afghanistan without extending the tours of the surge brigades\nby more than 15 months.\n\nBut debating how much the escalation of 30,000 troops was responsible for\nthe current levels of violence in Iraq is beside the point. The real issue\nis where do we go from here.\n\nThe reduction in violence has produced a tenuous security balance in Iraq,\nbut it has not yet resulted in the kind of sustainable equilibrium that\nlocks in the security and political gains that have been made in the\ncountry. Absent an incentive to truly take over their own affairs, the Iraqi\ngovernment has not made satisfactory progress toward national\nreconciliation, nor have they implemented critical power or revenue sharing\nlaws.\n\nIn fact, a continued large-scale U.S. presence in Iraq has allowed Iraq\'s\nwarring factions to stall on making the tough choices that they would have\nto make if faced with a timetable for U.S. withdrawal. Provincial elections,\noriginally scheduled for October 2008, are a case in point, as they are not\nlikely to take place this year.\n\nThe United States can truly take advantage of what security gains have been\nmade over the last 18 months by using a withdrawal timetable as a lever to\nforce political change in Iraq, while pushing Iraq\'s competing powers to\nrecalculate their self-interest in light of a U.S. withdrawal. By putting\nthe Iraqi government and its neighbors on notice that they\x97not the United\nStates\x97will be responsible for the consequences of any instability in Iraq,\nthe United States will give all players involved an incentive to begin\nacting constructively in Iraq.\n\nPresident Bush and his supporters, undeterred, continue to reject setting a\ntimetable for withdrawal. The White House justified a recent agreement that\nsets a vaguely worded "general time horizon for withdrawal," by asserting\nthat the "success" of the surge necessitates an indefinite large-scale U.S.\npresence in Iraq. This is the wrong course.\n\nIn order to solidify recent security gains and bring about meaningful\nreconciliation, the United States must move beyond the surge and begin a\nwithdrawal of all American troops as soon as possible from Iraq. This is\nwhat the majority of the American people and the Iraqi people want.\n\nWithdrawal will not only improve the chances of stabilizing the region; it\nwill allow the United States to reset its entire Middle East policy. Over\nthe past seven years, U.S. influence throughout the greater Middle East has\ndiminished to such a degree that we are no longer liked, feared, or\nrespected.\n\n*Read the full report*<http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2008/08/pdf/how_to_redeploy.pdf>(pdf)\n\n*Video: How to Redeploy*<http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2008/08/redeploy_video.html>\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
