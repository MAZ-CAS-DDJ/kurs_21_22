They also reached out to Lyle Canceko (Political) about this\ntoday and he wanted to make sure that he gave you the backstory before you\nmake the call. See the below email from Marlon last month, which pretty\nmuch lays out the whole thing. Basically Currie wants a title for either\nhimself or for Kelly, which Marlon is not inclined to grant, and there\'s\nbeen some difficulties around that negotiation process.\n\nLyle walked me through it tonight so I\'m happy to talk though tomorrow\nmorning if you need more context after Marlon\'s email. Can also get Lyle or\nMarlon on the phone.\n\nLyle put me on email with Kelly about scheduling a call, so will proceed to\nput something on the books for tomorrow afternoon.\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Marlon Marshall <mmarshall@hillaryclinton.com>\nDate: Thu, Sep 3, 2015 at 10:48 PM\nSubject: Fwd: Joint Fundraising Agreement\nTo: Robby Mook <re47@hillaryclinton.com>, John Podesta <\njp66@hillaryclinton.com>, Huma Abedin <ha16@hillaryclinton.com>\nCc: Lyle Canceko <lcanceko@hillaryclinton.com>, Brynne Craig <\nbcraig@hillaryclinton.com>, David Huynh <dhuynh@hillaryclinton.com>\n\n\nFYI\n\nThe NJ State Party is a trip.  You all have seen the emails.\n\nWell they wanted us to agree for the the Chairman to be the Campaign Chair\nin order for them to sign the Joint Fundraising Agreement.  I told them we\nwere not doing that, but we could continue those conversations if we ever\nwere.  Then they wanted to talk delegates and think about how that could be\ntied together to the JFA.  I told them I would schedule a call so we could\ndiscuss what that means. So we got on the phone with them and they wanted a\nagreement for a person to be our authorized representative.  Problem is, we\nare not at that point to pick those people AND they wanted the person to be\na state party employee, which presents a conflict of interest because an\nauthorized rep works with the state party.  It\'s not something we would\nnormally do.\n\nAll that being said, I told them we would pass at this time but lets keep\ntalking about everything.  Of course, to them this means we reneged on a\ndeal but we never made a deal.   They said they wanted it to be a certain\nway and we said we would get back to them.\n\nAnyways, I will continue to try to smooth this over with them but the whole\ntying an authorized rep who works for them to the JFA didn\'t sit well, is a\nconflict of interest, and is shady.  We just wanted to work with them on a\nJFA.  Just want to flag cause I am sure that John Graham, who emails us\nconstantly, will be speaking up on this.\n\nAnyways, wanted to flag and happy to answer any questions.\n\nMarlon\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Marlon Marshall <mmarshall@hillaryclinton.com>\nDate: Thu, Sep 3, 2015 at 10:41 PM\nSubject: Re: Joint Fundraising Agreement\nTo: Christopher James <chris@njdems.org>\nCc: David Huynh <dhuynh@hillaryclinton.com>, Lyle Canceko <\nlcanceko@hillaryclinton.com>, "jgraham@fairviewinsurance.com" <\njgraham@fairviewinsurance.com>\n\n\nChris,\n\nI am sorry that you feel as though a promise was reneged.  As we discussed\non the phone today, I said the general details of what you discussed\nsounded good but I wanted to get our team on the phone so we could get into\nthe weeds on the delegate and what that meant.\n\nWe have not started talking about authorized representatives in any state\nas of now as we are not at that point in the campaign.  I am not at all\nsaying that we cannot continue to have this conversation and/or ultimately\nget to the same place.  You all have been fantastic in your support of the\nSecretary and we appreciate that.  However, I do not want to rush what we\nare still figuring out in order to meet the JFA deadline and tie the two\ntogether.\n\nThis is NO WAY is a statement on us wanting to continue to work together to\ndiscuss any potential future staffing as we talked about, any political\nstructure, and an authorized rep.  We are just not there on those things\nyet.  So I am not comfortable tying all that together.  I still want to\nhave those conversations with you as we continue to move forward in the\ncampaign.\n\nAs mentioned in the previous email, rumors of a potential NJ chair continue\nto be false.  We have appreciated all the work you have done and hope we\ncan continue to discuss.  As Lyle and David mentioned on the call, they\nwanted to run the thoughts by me.  Understanding that this is something\nthat is a little off our timeline, I want to wait to have that conversation\nand lock in details, but I still want to have it.\n\nI understand if that precludes you from signing the JFA right now.\nHowever, I hope you realize we are not trying to renege on a promise or\ndeal.  I wanted to get to a place where we could meet and understood your\nconcerns from today, however knowing we can\'t move as fast as you would\nlike on those pieces, I wanted to be an honest broker with you just as you\nwere with me.\n\nI hope we can continue to keep the lines of communication open for the\nthings we discussed.  We do appreciate all your support and I hope that us\nsticking to our timeline doesn\'t change our working relationship.  I do\napologize for any confusion or inconvenience and am happy to relay that on\nthe phone to anyone.\n\nThanks Chris,\n\nMarlon\n\nOn Thu, Sep 3, 2015 at 10:12 PM, <chris@njdems.org> wrote:\n\n> Marlon,\n>\n> This is a major problem.
