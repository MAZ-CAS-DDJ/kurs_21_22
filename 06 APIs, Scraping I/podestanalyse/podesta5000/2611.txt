john.podesta@gmail.comb'\nMy friend and disability rights champion,\nNational Council on Disability (NCD) Executive Director Rebecca Cokley \nexpressed support for the national launch of the \n#RevUp #VoteDisabilty campaign held February 25th in Houston, Texas:\n\n"I send my personal greetings to all of you who are gathered at the Rev Up Texas rally \nand I wish I could be there today! \nThe ADA insures full participation and community integration of all people with disabilities. \nInvolvement in the democratic process is a Constitutionally guaranteed right. \nParticipating in that process and voting for the candidate of your choice, \nno matter which party, is fundamental in exercising our rights. \nMy dad\xe2\x80\x99s family was from Texas, and I know he\xe2\x80\x99d get a kick out of you all gathering there today. \nAs a child I remember walking his ballot in from his wheelchair accessible van to the polling place \nbecause the location wasn\xe2\x80\x99t accessible. \nThe volunteers on Election Day would ask him repeatedly why he wouldn\'t vote absentee \nand he\'d say "I have the right to GO and vote. \nI\'m damn well going to exercise it!" \nThat the case in 1988 and is still the case for voters with disabilities almost 30 years later.\nRegister to vote, educate yourself and others on the issues, \nand most importantly go to the polls and vote. \nCelebrate ADA. Celebrate disability rights. Lead on."\nLike LikeLoveHahaWowSadAngry\nwww.aapd.com/REVUP'
