LERNER | 3/11/15 11:45 AM EDT | Updated 3/11/15 2:16 PM EDT Any starry-eyed conservatives hoping that Jeb Bush\'s rhetoric on income inequalitymight woo the French leftist economist and liberal rock star Thomas Piketty are fresh out of luck. Piketty reportedly slammed the 2016 GOP presidential contender and the party atlarge in typical academic fashion during an interview with MSNBC slated to run later Wednesday. "[T]here\'s a lot of hypocrisy in this conservative rhetoric about the skill gap and education gap," Piketty said, in comments first reported by Salon. "If they are really serious about the skill gap and the education gap, then they cannot at the same time cut tax on the rich." The French economist wasn\'t shy about naming names either. He referred specifically to Jeb Bush\'s policies on so-called school choice and said the former Florida governor simply "doesn\'t want to invest more resources into education." "He just wants more competition," Piketty continued. "There\'s limited evidence that this is working. And I think most of all what we need is to put more public resources in the education system." ALSO ON POLITICO Jeb Bush, anti-drilling crusader ANDREW RESTUCCIA After his tome "Capital in the Twenty-First Century" was published in English last year, Piketty enjoyed widespread critical acclaim among America\'s liberal intellectual elite. His book quickly became Harvard University Press\' best-selling title ever and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle award for nonfiction. As of January, the book had sold 1.5 million copies in all languages. The book argued for a system of progressive taxation to prevent income inequality, which Piketty views as an inevitable feature of capitalist economies. In the MSNBC interview, Piketty also argued against conservatives claims that the "skills gap" is responsible for growing income inequality, a central focus of his book. "The minimum wage today is lower than it was 50 years ago, unions are very weak,so you need to increase the minimum wage in this country today," the French economist said.\n'
