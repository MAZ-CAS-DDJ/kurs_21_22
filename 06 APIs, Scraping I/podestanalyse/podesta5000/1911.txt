Our response is the same as it was\nthen: Made in the USA is the way to go. So is kindness. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sad day when\nAmerica Rising has to be reminded of that.\n\n*BACKGROUND:*\n\n*Romney: \xe2\x80\x9cI have watched the astounding impact of this Initiative from\nafar.\xe2\x80\x9d* \xe2\x80\x9cSince serving as President here in America, President Clinton has\ndevoted himself to lifting the downtrodden around the world. One of the\nbest things that can happen to any cause, to any people, is to have Bill\nClinton as its advocate. That is how needy and neglected causes have become\nglobal initiatives. It is that work that invites us here today. As I have\nwatched the astounding impact of this Initiative from afar, I have been\nimpressed by the extraordinary power you have derived by harnessing\ntogether different people of different backgrounds, and different\ninstitutions of different persuasions. You have fashioned partnerships\nacross traditional boundaries -- public and private, for-profit and\nnonprofit, charitable and commercial.\xe2\x80\x9d [Romney remarks to CGI, Wall Street\nJournal, 9/25/12; Video]\n\n*Romney: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Clinton Global Initiative has also demonstrated the\neffectiveness of entrepreneurship and social enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d* \xe2\x80\x9cThe Clinton\nGlobal Initiative has also demonstrated the effectiveness of\nentrepreneurship and social enterprise. You endeavor to not only comfort\nthe afflicted, but to also change lives [through] freedom, free enterprise,\nand the incomparable dignity of work. Free enterprise has done more to\nbless humanity than any other economic system not only because it is the\nonly system that creates a prosperous middle class, but also because it is\nthe only system where the individual enjoys the freedom to guide and build\nhis or her own life. Free enterprise cannot only make us better off\nfinancially, it can make us better people.\xe2\x80\x9d [Romney remarks to CGI, Wall\nStreet Journal, 9/25/12; Video]\n"
