john.podesta@gmail.comb"I spent a good deal of time yesterday and today making calls about a column\nI might write for The Hill next Thursday, the day HRC testifies, calling for the\nHouse Ethics Committee to investigate the House Benghazi Committee,\nand calling on Trey Gowdy to recuse himself from the Ethics Committee or\nvoluntary leave the committee entirely.\n\nIn my inquiries, which only mentioned Gowdy to one person and were focused\non Ethics investigating Benghazi. every single person in the loop totally\nclamped down and appeared almost afraid to discuss the subject.  I spent\nmany years working for Congressional leaders, know a great deal about how\nthese matters work, and am very ethical/careful to frame questions to sources\nin ways they should be able to safely answer.\n\nThe responses I received were so non-responsive and the body language\nof the answers seemed so nervous, that my personal opinion, with 75%\ncertainty but zero actual knowledge.....is that there is probably some form of\ninquiry or investigation by Ethiics C'Tee of Benghazi C'tee already in progress.\n\nI have no hard evidence of this, but  the responses were so eerily silent and\nnervous I can think of no other reason to explain it.....Brent\n\nSent from my iPad"
