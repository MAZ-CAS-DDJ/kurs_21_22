I hope that indicates that it's getting some\nserious attention. In my view, as you well know, the overwhelming challenge\nfor Democrats is to give hard attention to the demographic discussed, which\nonce was and still should be part of our coalition, but whom we've ignored\nor shunned, and certainly have failed to connect with---and to the red\nstates in which they predominate and where we've recently had almost zero\nelectoral success. The latter we can't afford to concede indefinitely.\n\nHope you guys had a happy Thanksgiving.\n\n\nChuck\n\n\nChuck Herz\nherzchuck@gmail.com\nH: (307) 732-0987\nC: (307) 690-0747\n\nOn Wed, Nov 25, 2015 at 8:00 AM, Sandler, Herbert <hms@sandlerfoundation.org\n> wrote:\n\n> I trust you noticed that the writer is a ProPublica journalist.\n>\n> Sent from my iPad\n>\n> On Nov 25, 2015, at 5:45 AM, Michael Wald <mwald@law.stanford.edu> wrote:\n>\n> A very interesting take on a key puzzle\n>\n>\n>\n> http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/opinion/sunday/who-turned-my-blue-state-red.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&smid=nytcore-ipad-share\n>\n> Michael S Wald\n> Professor of Law Emeritus\n> 415 564 0153\n>\n> On Thu, Nov 19, 2015 at 3:27 PM, Sandler, Herbert <\n> hms@sandlerfoundation.org> wrote:\n>\n>> An early review of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s Book\n>>\n>> this from the Times Higher Education Supplement.\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>\n"
