He\'s a\ngreat kid, and I\'m very proud of the public school teachers,\ncounselors, and other great people that work with him every day.\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=XvZpT9YxwoVD7FLkL26rtw\n\nAs a parent, there is no more important investment than the one I make\nin my child\'s future. And we all depend on good schools to\neducate the next generation. I want my son to have a better life than\nI have, just like my father worked to provide for me. And I want our\nstate and nation to have the same goal--to keep us economically\ncompetitive and prosperous.\n\nTo do that, we need to make an investment. This November we\'ll\nfinally have the chance.\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=BCAxxbUHwSzxsD1apEqwHg\n\nToday, Colorado spends thousands of dollars less per year on our\nstudents than neighboring states. We spend almost $2,500 less than\nKansas, over $4,000 less than Nebraska, and amazingly, $9,500 less\nthan Wyoming. That\'s per student. [1] Everybody knows money\nisn\'t everything in education, but the fact is that Colorado has\nbeen shortchanging public education for years. The signs of strain are\neverywhere, from the growing list of fees parents must pay each fall\nto class sizes that seem to get bigger every year.\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=VfUbydju8UEwYbrJ5qk_PQ\n\nAt the same time, Colorado has imposed many new reforms and mandates\non our public education system in recent years. If we don\'t give\nour public schools the resources they need to meet those standards,\nwe\'re setting them up for failure.\n\nFor all of these reasons and more, I\'m joining Gov. John\nHickenlooper, business and community leaders, and concerned parents\nfrom across Colorado in the Colorado Commits to Kids campaign. This\nNovember, Colorado will vote on a comprehensive fix for our\nstate\'s chronic shortfalls in public education funding. This is\nno "Band-Aid," but a permanent solution to add almost a\nbillion dollars a year in funding for our public schools.\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=1uo2M0BA0JCEwP8DWxBa9A\n\nClick here to join the Colorado Commits to Kids campaign, and get the\nfacts on this initiative.

This is the opportunity we\'ve been waiting\nfor to solve a decades-old problem, and finally get our schools on the\nsound footing every kid needs to succeed. Roland deserves it, and\nI\'ll bet there\'s a kid in your life who does, too.\n\nI look forward to seeing you as we campaign for a better future this\nfall.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlan Franklin\n\n\n\n\xa9 2005-2011 ProgressNow Colorado.
