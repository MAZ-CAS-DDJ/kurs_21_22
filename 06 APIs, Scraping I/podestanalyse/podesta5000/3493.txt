The review, in the form of a Programmatic Environmental Impact\n> Statement (PEIS), will take a careful look at issues such as how, when, and\n> where to lease; how to account for the environmental and public health\n> impacts of federal coal production; and how to ensure American taxpayers\n> are earning a fair return for the use of their public resources.\n>\n> \xe2\x80\x9cEven as our nation transitions to cleaner energy sources, building on\n> smart policies and progress already underway, we know that coal will\n> continue to be an important domestic energy source in the years ahead,\xe2\x80\x9d\n> said Secretary Jewell. \xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t undertaken a comprehensive review of the\n> program in more than 30 years, and we have an obligation to current and\n> future generations to ensure the federal coal program delivers a fair\n> return to American taxpayers and takes into account its impacts on climate\n> change.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>\n> Consistent with the practice during two programmatic reviews of the\n> federal coal program that occurred during the 1970s and 1980s, the Interior\n> Department will also institute a pause on issuing new coal leases while the\n> review is underway. The pause does not apply to existing coal production\n> activities. There will be limited, commonsense exceptions to the pause,\n> including for metallurgical coal (typically used in steel production),\n> small lease modifications and emergency leasing, including where there is a\n> demonstrated safety need or insufficient reserves. In addition, pending\n> leases that have already completed an environmental analysis under the\n> National Environmental Policy Act and received a final Record of Decision\n> or Decision Order by a federal agency under the existing regulations will\n> be allowed to complete the final procedural steps to secure a lease or\n> lease modification. During and after the pause, companies can continue to\n> mine the large amount of coal reserves already under lease, estimated to be\n> enough to sustain current levels of production from federal land for\n> approximately 20 years.\n>\n> \xe2\x80\x9cGiven serious concerns raised about the federal coal program, we\xe2\x80\x99re\n> taking the prudent step to hit pause on approving significant new leases so\n> that decisions about those leases can benefit from the recommendations that\n> come out of the review,\xe2\x80\x9d said Secretary Jewell. \xe2\x80\x9cDuring this time,\n> companies can continue production activities on the large reserves of\n> recoverable coal they have under lease, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make accommodations in\n> the event of emergency circumstances to ensure this pause will have no\n> material impact on the nation\xe2\x80\x99s ability to meet its power generation needs.\n> We are undertaking this effort with full consideration of the importance of\n> maintaining reliable and affordable energy for American families and\n> businesses, as well other federal programs and policies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>\n> Today\xe2\x80\x99s action builds on Secretary Jewell\xe2\x80\x99s call last March for an open\n> and honest conversation about modernizing the federal coal program, which\n> led to a series of public listening sessions across the country in 2015.\n> The listening sessions and public comment period solicited a broad range of\n> responses to complex questions, including: Are taxpayers and local\n> communities getting a fair return from these resources? How can we make\n> coal leasing more transparent and more competitive? How do we manage the\n> program in a way that is consistent with our climate change objectives?\n>\n> Secretary Jewell also announced today that the Interior Department will\n> undertake a series of good government reforms to improve transparency and\n> administration of the federal coal program. These reforms include\n> establishing a publicly available database to account for the carbon\n> emitted from fossil fuels developed on public lands, requiring Bureau of\n> Land Management offices to publicly post online pending requests to lease\n> coal or reduce royalties, and facilitating the capture of waste mine\n> methane.\n>\n> These actions build on existing efforts to modernize the federal coal\n> program, including the Office of Natural Resources Revenue\xe2\x80\x99s work to\n> finalize a proposed rule to ensure that the valuation process for federal\n> and American Indian coal resources better reflects the changing energy\n> industry while protecting taxpayers and American Indian assets.\n>\n> The programmatic review will include extensive opportunities for public\n> participation. The PEIS will kick off with public sessions in early 2016 to\n> help determine the precise scope of the review. The Interior Department\n> will release an interim report by the end of 2016 with conclusions from the\n> scoping process about alternatives that will be evaluated and, as\n> appropriate, any initial analytical results. The full review is expected to\n> take approximately three years.\n>\n> Additional information on today\xe2\x80\x99s announcements can be found here\n>
