Biera, ill have to take you w/\n   me wherever i go. thank you for your service. can i begin by asking how\n   about Sarah Palin last night? [crowd cheers] how about the job she did? come\n   here! come here! look at this. Viva la Barracuda! [laughs] thank you. i\n   almost felt a little sorry last night for my friend joe biden. she\'s the\n   news for the me-first country-2nd crowd in Wall Street and Washington -\n   we\'ve got a msg - change is coming and they\'re not gonna like it. and so, im\n   so proud of her performance last night. more proud that she\'s been an\n   inspiration to so many americans - you can have great family, you can serve,\n   be a mayor, a city councilor, PTA - and we\'ll clean up Washington, a team of\n   2 mavericks\n   - and btw next wkend we\'ll have a town hall wkend and youll learn a lot\n   about who\'s the liberal and who\'s the conserv. and who will raise your taxes\n   and who can bring reform, prosperity and peace. i have the record. he has\n   the rhetoric not the record. its not an accident he has the most liberal\n   voting record. he voted present in IL state senate. you dont get to vote\n   present as presidnet.\n   - *as a citizen of AZ, thank you for the water, thank you for the\n   water, thank you for the water, we appreciate [thank you, i appreciate it,\n   \'atta girl]. jokes in AZ trees chase the dogs. btw i will never seek a\n   renegotiation of CO water compact. i will not do that. water is too\n   precious.*\n   - im honored. CO is important, we will win on nov. 4th, weve got to win\n   this state\n   - about this financial crisis we\'re in. no one doubts the depth of this\n   crisis. no one doesnt know someone struggling w/ jobs, health care,\n   education. this is the most severe crisis we\'ve faced in our lifetime. our\n   first and only goal is to help Main Street and not Wall Street and not the\n   corruption in Washington either. before a short while ago, most of who\n   probably didnt know who Fannie and freddie were.* 2 yrs ago i said we\'ve\n   got to fix them, and i pushed for legislation to fix them. the Dems and some\n   GOPs in congress pushed back and kept it from passing, thats\' why we\'re in\n   this mess* - we have to hold them accountable.\n   - we have to fix the problem. a vote in the House right now - an\n   unprecedented plan, up to $1T - it has to help Main Street - ppl are having\n   trouble getting a loan - i am a proud conservative, a proud opponent of\n   waste - but govt has to step in right now and save Main Street from\n   challenges and crisis thats looming - restore ppl\'s lives - some straight\n   talk, this is a turniquet, not a cure - we have to reform the way we do\n   business in Washington -\n   - 1 of the ways we\'re gonna get our economy going --* there\'s a jobs\n   report that came out today and some straight talk it\'s a terrible situation\n   in america, i cant give a rosy picture* - but energy will create jobs, we\n   have to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, eliminate $700B overseas\n   incl. to countries that dont like us very much. 1 solution is clean coal\n   technology - we are sitting on 1 of world\'s largest reserves of coal.\n   there\'s 9 coal mines in CO and it provides jobs. we can develop the\n   technology. obama says we MIGHT drill offshore. we have to drill offshore\n   and drill now, exploit the resources. we need all of the above. [lists them]\n   i said the other day the fund. strength rests in our workers, we have the\n   most productive workers, we can get them jobs\n   - nucl. pwr is clean, reduces greenhouse gas emissions. the British, Fr,\n   and Japanese reprocess spent nucl fuel. obama says he\'s for nucl pwr but he\n   opposes storing or reprocessing it. we always want to imitate the french -\n   they reprocess spent nucl. fuel.\n   - we also have to cut spending. we must. and the earmark porkbarrel\n   spending in Washington is out of control and disgraceful. and its led to\n   corruption, members in Cong in jail. outrageous things liek $3M to study DNA\n   of bears in MT. we have to stop it. i will veto 1st earmark porkbarrel that\n   comes across my desk.\n   - we\'ll examine every agency of govt and get rid of ones that dont work.\n   govt has grown 40%. we GOPs came to pwr to change govt and govt changed us.\n   we\'re gonna return to principles of Reagan, T. Roosevelt and Lincoln.\n   - we\'ll deliver tax relief, double child exemption, $5k refundable tax\n   credit to buy Health ins. fams want anywhere in america - obama wants govt\n   to do that job, he wants to stand between you and your family doctor; its\n   another big govt solution. he wants higher taxes, big govt, more spending.\n   thats not good for america and we wont let it happen. ive stood up against\n   my party, against its leadership. obama has never stood up to party\n   leadership in short time he\'s been in office. thats just his record. are we\n   going to elect obama based on promises that are oppo of his record or those\n   who have record of reform?\n   - i see in audience some brave and patriotic americans. im always honored\n   to be in their company. im most proud of their support. can vets stand for\n   recognition? thank you!\n   - id like to end up by telling you ill bring our troops home from iraq\n   but theyll come back in victory and honor. [usa! usa! USA! USA!] my friends,\n   the surge is succeeding in iraq and that\'s a fact. after the war being badly\n   mishandled we have a great general and teh war is succeeding. but we are all\n   saddened by sacrifices. im always saddened meeting fam members of those who\n   have sacrificed. a yr ago last aug in NH, mother asked mccain to wear\n   bracelet with KIA in iraq son, matthew stanley\'s name on it - make sure his\n   death didnt die in vain. i know what war is like and i hate war. no one\n   hates war more than the vets here. i know how to keep us out of war and i\n   know how to win the peace. i want to be pres. b/c i believe i can inspire a\n   generation of americans.\n   - we have 32 days. who\'s counting? and im the underdog, i love being\n   underdog. we\'ll need to put you to work. youve got to get out all your\n   friends, pueblo is important. ill be counting on you. we will disagree on a\n   specific issue from time to time and that\'s good and healthy. but i will\n   always put my coutnry first. thank you and god bless you for being here.\n\n\n*Question and Answer*\n\n   - 1Q) [vietnam vet] re: PTSD - our troops are serving 2-3 tours [how many\n   tours have you served [to friend next to time]] - i have a friend who\'s\n   served a few tours, he has severe PTSD, Army cut his pay b/c he wasn\'t able\n   to serve - his fam is hurting, we\'re trying to help from American LEgion.\n   read his letter. what are you gonna do?\n      - MCCAIN: this is a tough war, toughest war. the strain is incredible,\n      patrolling constantly, keeping areas secure. and early on in surge, there\n      was an increase in casaulties as we mvoed into areas controlled by\n      extremists, AQ, etc. ill do my best. theres an increase in combat-related\n      wounds. we\'re able to get ppl from battlefield to care quicker\nthan ever. VA\n      is great. we appreciate the Am. Legion and VFA and all those.\nbut we have to\n      increase the capabilities of military medicince and VA to treat PTSD and\n      combat-related wounds and those injuries directly related to military\n      injuries. but there are many who have to wait in line to wait in\nline. for\n      routine health care, give plastic card and let them go to doctor of their\n      choice.\n      - and one minor-- not minor-- additional pt. more women serving. we\n      need to address their care. we just had a woman appted 4 star general.\n   - 2Q) [former USAF] re: rescue plan, i heard sen. biden say last night\n   that we should help ppl with interest rates keep their homes b/c thats where\n   this crisis came from. i lost a house to foreclosure last yr myself so this\n   is clsoe to my heart. before we bail out the banks, why not help the ppl\n   keep in their homes  - this would also help the banks? what do you think?\n      - MCCAIN: it doesnt take a lot of talent to get shot down. beginning\n      of this crisis was the housing crisis, fannie and freddie. as palin said\n      last night- they talked ppl into buying homes for 2x as much. *its\n      obviously more complex than that. *you mentinoed adjustable rate\n      mortgages. ppl had planend on value of home to be integral part\nof lives and\n      retirements. we have to stop and stabilize the continued decline in home\n      values as 1st step to recovery. id like to go out and allow any\nhomeowner to\n      go to FHA and get 30-yr guaranteed mortgage. this "rescue" is designed to\n      shore up mkt where liquidity has dried up and have credit. lets make sure\n      homeowners can stay in home and shore up mortgages where value\nplummeted. im\n      not interested in helping Wall Street. the ppl who took the risks, theyll\n      suffer the consequences. but the innocent bystander/ homeowner has to be\n      shored up. we have to buy up these instruments so they have\nvalue. we have\n      to make sure taxpayer is first one paid back once mkt improves.\ntheres got\n      to be oversight. we have to assure ppl that this measure will at\nleast stop\n      bleeding of our economy.\n      - and if we stabilize this mkt, hopefully we\'ll see less expenditure\n      of taxpayer\'s dollar.\n   - 3Q) i\'m a high school student - a lot of us here today. on our behalf,\n   what can you do to better education in this nation?\n      - MCCAIN: 1st, on overall issue, particularly k -12, choice and\n      competition. we have im happy to tell you, we have ensured equal\naccess to\n      schools to all citiizens. but whats value of equal access to\nfailed system.\n      charter schools work, homeschooling. we need to find bad\nteachers a new line\n      of work. in AZ, we have a lot of charter schools - some were bad\nand failed\n      others are taking off. NOLA is taking off with charter schools\npost-katrina.\n      - college- you shouldnt have to pay off debt immediately following\n      graduation. need to make sure we have Pell grants that fully\nfund to state\n      institution.s and with current crisis, we have to make sure that\nfunds are\n      available- with liquidity issues.\n   - 4Q) we heard pelosi and Dems making derrogatory comments to you,\n   etc. Washington ppl, when you and palin go in jan, you clean house and you\n   expose those ppl who have taken us to the cleaners and you become next\n   president of our country.\n      - MCCAIN: theres very little i can editorialize on that except to\n      promise that this is all about restoring trust and confidence in\ngovt. cong\n      approval rating has been in \'teens. we\'ve got to restore trust and\n      confidence and get country on right track again by reforming way\ngovt does\n      business. we\'ve got that record. thank you Cong. Bob Schaeffer\nfor running\n      and good luck in running for Senate.\n   - it\'s so important for me to do well in CO, we may be up late waiting\n   for your vote to come in. i need your help and support. lets get fired up\n   for last 32 days. thank you!. im honored.\n\n\n-- \nSara DuBois\nTracking / Communications Manager\nProgressiveAccountability.org\nsara@progressiveaccountability.org\n202-609-7681 (office)\n410-967-7306 (cell)\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
