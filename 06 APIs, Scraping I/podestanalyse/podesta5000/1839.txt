john.podesta@gmail.comb'Some of you all have been following our members\' campaign in ND to pressure\nConrad to support the public option. We\'ve escalated the pressure today with\na new radio ad, a direct mail piece, and rallies tomorrow.\n\nWorth noting that since the campaign began, the state Dems have passed a\nresolution supporting the public option.\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce (same one trying to block health reform) went up\nwith ads supporting Conrad yesterday.\n\n\n\n\n\n *MoveOn.org*\n\nPolitical Action\n\n\n\n*FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**:*              *\n**CONTACT:* Doug Gordon, (202) 822-5200\n\nOctober 13th, 2009\n\n\n\n**** Listen to the Ads Here: http://pol.moveon.org/nd_theresa/  ****\n\n*Campaign For Public Option Escalates In North Dakota:*\n\n*New Ad, Rallies and Direct Mail To Pressure Conrad  *\n\n**\n\n*Radio Ad Features North Dakotan Mother Supporting Public Option, *\n\n*Report Detailing Campaign Contributions To Be Released At Rallies Around\nthe State *\n\n\n\nA new radio ad and a new campaign finance report ask Senator Conrad to side\nwith North Dakotans, and not the health insurance industry, by supporting a\npublic health insurance option in the health care reform debate. The radio\nad was released today by MoveOn.org in advance of the report that will be\nunveiled at rallies around the state tomorrow. This week, the organization,\nwhich boasts over 5,000 members in North Dakota, also sent a direct mail\npiece to 12,000 people in North Dakota asking Senator Conrad to do the best\nthing for North Dakota and support a public health insurance option. The\nmailer can be viewed here: http://s3.moveon.org/pdfs/conrad_mail.pdf\n\n\n\nThe radio ad is the second in the last month and disputes the assertions\nmade by Senator Conrad last week that the campaign to support the public\nhealth insurance option is run by \x93out-of-state special interest groups.\x94\nThe ad features Theresa Mogard, a Minot resident and MoveOn.org member, who\nsupports a public option after being bankrupted by health care bills. The ad\nasks Senator Conrad to stop protecting the health insurance industry and\nsupport a public health insurance option for the good of North Dakotan\nfamilies.\n\n\n\nTomorrow rallies are being held in Fargo, Grand Forks and Minot where\nparticipants will release a report detailing the amount of campaign\ncontributions Senator Conrad has received from insurance and HMO interests\nduring his career. At the rallies, participants will also ask Senator Conrad\nto return campaign contributions from Blue Cross Blue Shield North Dakota,\nin light of the recent scandals around corporate waste.\n\n\n\nSenator Conrad recently voted twice against the public health insurance\noption in the Senate Finance Committee. The health insurance and HMO\ninterests have been fighting against comprehensive health care reform, with\nspecial attention paid to defeating the public option.\n\n\n\n*Minot:*\n12:00 PM, U.S. Federal Building, Room 105, 100 1st Street SW\nMinot, ND 58701\n\n*Fargo:*\n12:00 PM, U.S. Federal Building, Room 306, 657 2nd Avenue North\nFargo, ND 58102\n\n*Grand Forks:*\n1:30 PM, U.S. Federal Building, Room 104, 102 North 4th Street\nGrand Forks, ND\n\n**\n\n"Senator Conrad needs to side with his constituents on this,\x94 said Theresa\nMogard of Minot, ND, who is featured in the radio ad. \x93We want him pass a\nbill with a strong public option that will make lives better for the\nfamilies and small businesses of this state. North Dakota has waited long\nenough."**\n\n* *\n\n\n\n*MoveOn.org Political Action is a political action committee powered by 5\nmillion progressive Americans.

Hacker* *and published by Berkeley\nSchool of Law and the Institute for America\x92s Future: \x93(\x85) public insurance\nhas a better track record than private insurance when it comes to reining in\ncosts while providing inclusive, stable coverage with broad choice of\nproviders. Our nation\x92s largest public insurance plan, Medicare, has greatly\nimproved its cost-control record over the last generation, and like other\nprograms of public insurance, it has done so with low administrative costs\nwhile offering wide choice of medical providers.\x94 (\nhttp://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf)\n\n\n\nAccording to Health Care for America Now: \x93A public health insurance option\nincreases competition, something that is sorely lacking in health insurance\nmarkets today\x85 By introducing competition into the marketplace, the public\nhealth insurance option does two things. First, it lowers cost for everyone\x85\nSecond, a public health insurance option will keep the insurance industry\nhonest\x85 Without a public health insurance option, there will be no incentive\nto control costs or play by the rules because there will be no competition.\nIf everyone is forced to by insurance, and the government gives people\nsubsidies to help everyone pay for it, what incentive do insurers have to\nlower their prices or stop their abuses? However, by increasing competition\nand giving people a true choice, a public health insurance option can lower\nyour premiums and the cost to government, as well as make sure insurers play\nby the rules.\x94\n\n(\nhttp://blog.healthcareforamericanow.org/2009/09/14/the-public-health-insurance-option-what-how-and-why/)\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the White House, a public health insurance option would \x93foster\ngreater competition; lower costs; and give consumers a greater variety of\naffordable choices.\x94 http://www.whitehouse.gov/realitycheck/faq#i2\n\n\n\nAccording to former secretary of labor and professor at the University of\nCalifornia, Robert Reich:  \x93without a public option, the other parties that\ncomprise America\'s non-system of health care -- private insurers, doctors,\nhospitals, drug companies, and medical suppliers -- have little or no\nincentive to supply high-quality care at a lower cost than they do now.\x94\n(Wall Street Journal, June 24th, 2009,\nhttp://online.wsj.com/article/SB124580516633344953.html )\n\n\n\nAlso, a public insurance plan would forces private companies to compete with\nthe government option, ultimately reducing costs for consumers.  See for\nexample the Urban Institute\x92s study \x93Can a Public Health Plan Increase\nCompetition and Lower the Costs of Health Reform?,\x94 10/3/08, available at\nhttp://www.urban.org/publications/411762.html.\n\n\n\nAccording to a report by health care expert and Yale Professor Jacob Hacker,\nand released by the Institute for America\x92s Future,  a robust public option:\n\x93is available to anyone who lacks employer-provided health insurance\x97rich\nand poor alike, and whether working for a small or large employer,\nself-employed, or unemployed.\x94\n\n(http://www.ourfuture.org/files/Hacker_Public_Plan_August_2009.pdf )\n\n\n\nNobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman wrote about cooperatives: \x93For\nthe record, neither regional health cooperatives nor state-level public\nplans, both of which have been proposed as alternatives, would have the\nfinancial stability and bargaining power needed to bring down health care\ncosts.\x94\n\n(New York Times, June 22, 2009,\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/22/opinion/22krugman.html )\n\n\n\nAnd according to Robert B. Reich, former secretary of labor and professor at\nthe University of California: \x93But such cooperatives would lack the scale\nand authority to negotiate lower rates with drug companies and other\nproviders, collect wide data on outcomes, or effect major change in the\nsystem.\x94\n\n(Wall Street Journal, June 24, 2009,\nhttp://online.wsj.com/article/SB124580516633344953.html )\n\n\n\nOn September 29th 2009, Senators Kent Conrad voted against two amendments\ntaken up by the Senate Finance Committee that would have created a public\nhealth insurance option.\n\n(http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/health/policy/30health.html?hp )\n\n\n\nHealth and insurance interests have been vocal in their opposition to the\npublic health insurance option, and have spent millions of dollars lobbying\nagainst it.\n\nAccording to a recent report, health insurance and HMO interests are\nspending nearly $5 million per week fighting against health care reform, and\none of their top targets is the public health insurance option.\n\n(http://www.campaignmoney.org/HMO_insurance_spend_to_kill_reform)\n\n\n\nAccording to The Hill, the two trade associations that represent the\ninsurance industries sent a letter to key members of Congress stating their\nopposition to the public health insurance plan. The letter was signed by\nAmerica\x92s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) President and CEO Karen Ignagni and\nBlue Cross Blue Shield Association (BCBSA) President and CEO Scott Serota.\n\n(The Hill, 3/24/09,\nhttp://thehill.com/business--lobby/insurance-groups-pen-letter-against-obama-health-plan-2009-03-24.html)\n\n\n\nAccording to the Associated Press about the industries opposition to the\nplan: \x93Industry lobbyists are using influential allies, a thick wallet and a\nstrategy of avoiding blatant confrontation to block or weaken the proposal,\nwhich Democrats say would drive down costs by offering an alternative to\nprivate companies.\x94\n\n(Associated Press, 8/6/09,\nhttp://www.startribune.com/politics/national/congress/52594712.html?elr=KArks8c7PaP3E77K_3c::D3aDhUec7PaP3E77K_0c::D3aDhUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU)\n\n\n\nAnd according to the Politico:  \x93\x85insurers have played the inside game,\nspending about $40 million on an army of lobbyists and lavishing campaign\ncontributions on Democrats and Republicans to kill the public option. In\nall, the health industry spent $133 million in the second quarter alone,\nmore than a million bucks a day.\x94 (Politico, 7/25/09,\nhttp://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/25709.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nIlyse G.
