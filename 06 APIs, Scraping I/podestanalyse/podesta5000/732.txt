The\nmeeting will begin promptly at 8:00 am and will end at 9:15.\n\n\n\nWe have invited a select group of leading New York progressives to join us\nfor a strategy discussion about the Role of Media in the 2008 Election.  As\nyou well know, despite significant improvements, progressives still have a\ntremendous structural disadvantage in this area.  And over the next several\nmonths even our best efforts will only reach a fraction of Americans\nindividually.  Most of the information about this election will be seen\nthrough the "lens" of the mainstream media.  The bias of the media is well\ndocumented (Eric Alterman\'s What Liberal Media or David Brock\'s The\nRepublican Noise Machine).  Mitigating this bias is critical to our efforts\nand doing so now before the 08 "narrative" has been set is one of the most\nimportant tasks of the weeks ahead.\n\nWe invite you to take a look at the Progressive Media USA website -\nwww.progressivemediausa.org <http://www.progressivemediausa.org> .  In the\ncoming weeks, more of their work will be showing up online, but in the\nmeantime, you can check out their latest television advertisement tying\ntogether John McCain and George Bush\'s economic policies <\nhttp://www.progressivemediausa.org/feature/multimedia/#tv> .  Or you can\nwatch one of our web ads, "Pop-Up DoubleTalk <\nhttp://www.progressivemediausa.org/feature/multimedia/#web> " which we just\nreleased last week.\n\nI hope you will make every effort to join us for this discussion.  Rsvp is\nrequired and the invitation is non-transferable.  If you have any questions,\nplease feel free to call me at (212) 868-4080.\n\n\n\nAll my best,\n\nJill\n\n\n\n************************\n\nJill S.
