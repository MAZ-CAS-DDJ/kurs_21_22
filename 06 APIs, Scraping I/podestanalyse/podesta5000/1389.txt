john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear Neera (and John)\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\nSo my 25-year-old Michael DeLong has applied for a Firearms Safety Policy job at CAP\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\nI think he is a very, very strong candidate on the merits, given what he has been doing in Portland at Ceasefire Oregon in the three years since he graduated from Reed College, and how effective he has been there. But I find myself somewhat anxious the somebody already in Washington and with better connections might crowd him out\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\nMay I beg you to reassure me?\n\n\nYours,\n\n\nBrad DeLong\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nJ.
