john.podesta@gmail.comb'===============================\nLeague of Conservation Voters\nhttp://action.lcv.org/ct/VdzLkNK1GmG3/\n===============================\n\nDear John, \n\nI can\'t overstate what is at stake in this election. \n\nWe are standing on the brink of environmental catastrophe. The\nEarth can\'t withstand 4 more years of inaction; by that time\nmany of the effects of global warming could be irreversible. \n\nThat\'s why the League of Conservation Voters is fighting hard to\nelect environmental leaders this November, but we need your help\nto seize this historic opportunity. \n\nClick below to make an online gift today that will help the\nLeague of Conservation Voters put Sen. Barack Obama in the Oval\nOffice.\nhttps://secure.ga4.org/01/Obama_c4/ne1zLkNKq85CG?\n\nPlus, if you give before July 31, we\'ll send you a free "New\nHope, New Energy" car magnet. But you must make your donation by\nJuly 31!\nhttps://secure.ga4.org/01/Obama_c4/ne1zLkNKq85CG?\n\nThe records of McCain and Obama are very different on the\nchallenges of energy and global warming. Barack Obama plans to\nraise fuel efficiency, invest billions in clean energy\ntechnology, increase production of renewable energy, and\nimplement a cap and trade program that will reduce global\nwarming pollution by 80%.\n\nSenator McCain supports billions of dollars in tax breaks for\nbig oil companies, opposes new fuel efficiency laws, opposes a\nnational renewable electricity standard, and offers only $300\nmillion for the development of clean technologies.\n\nBarack Obama\'s plan for global warming and energy independence\nis the most substantive plan ever put forward by a nominee for\npresident. At LCV, we are ready to unleash an aggressive\ncampaign program to make sure Barack Obama is elected president.\n\nWe maximize our impact by identifying independents and swing\nvoters in key states. Through the media and a powerful\ngrassroots effort, we persuade them to vote for our endorsed\ncandidates. In a close race like this one, we can make a\ndifference - with your support.\n\nClick below and help us elect Sen. Obama president this\nNovember. Donate before July 31 and receive our "New Hope, New\nEnergy" car magnet.\nhttps://secure.ga4.org/01/Obama_c4/ne1zLkNKq85CG?\n\nWe\'ve done this for years, and we have a proven track record of\nwinning. In 2006 your support helped us elect a green majority\nin Congress. In 2008, with your help again, we can bring change\nto the White House. \n\nYou don\'t want to sit on the sidelines for this one,\nJohn. We all want to wake up on November 5 and know\nthat we did everything in our power to win this pivotal\nelection.
