john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi Mr. Podesta,\n\nJust had a quick "sighting" of you this weekend at Johnson\'s and I wondered if you happen to have a particular interest in gardening? Or just doing a little sprucing up? Something of a regular hobby?\n\nI might include the tidbit in my Thursday column in case you had a comment. My deadline is 2pm tomorrow.\n\nThanks much,\nkate\n\n\nKate Glassman Bennett\n\nPOLITICO\n\nThe KGB File\nKbennett@politico.com | 703-341-4653 (d) | 702-460-9606 (m)\n\n'
