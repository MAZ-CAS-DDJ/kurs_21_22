john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John and Mary,\nThank you for a truly wonderful evening.  Great company and delicious food. (Calling it a home cooked meal somehow does not do it justice!) Ancestral investigations to be continued...\nWe hope to reciprocate soon in NY or DC.\nAs ever,\nAntonio and Susannah\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
