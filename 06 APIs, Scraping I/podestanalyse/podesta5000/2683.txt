john.podesta@gmail.comb'Team \xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n\nWanted to send around an AZ paid media update.\n\n\n\nAs folks may know, over 240,000 early ballots have already been returned by\nDemocrats (this is more than half the total number that voted in 2008) and\nwe believe that Vote-By-Mail will end up accounting for roughly 80% of\ntotal ballots casted.  We believe we\xe2\x80\x99re leading among these early voters by\nabout 18 points.  We can probably expect roughly 25,000 ballots to come in\nevery day going forward - so our fundamental objective during this last\nweek is to target those voters who have not yet voted (older women,\nHispanics).  While Sanders has now started spending heavily on TV, we do\nnot believe that he is running a VBM or VBM chase program.\n\nLeaving nothing to chance, in paid advertising, we\xe2\x80\x99re moving on the\nfollowing:\n\n\n\n1.       TV: we\xe2\x80\x99ll be placing heavier buys over the next three days, while\nballots are being submitted at their heaviest levels:\n\na.       New AZ-specific education ad:\n*https://hfa2016.box.com/s/zas19ybl2x0c4qdi1bydhq5m21k42ol4\n<https://hfa2016.box.com/s/zas19ybl2x0c4qdi1bydhq5m21k42ol4>  *\n\nb.      Brave: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvFWQOesPDo&feature=youtu.be\n\nc.       Gabby gun spot:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAGr0UrRTl4&feature=youtu.be\n\n\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll then assess our point levels later in the week to determine how heavy\nwe need to be up over the final 4 days. We\xe2\x80\x99ll also consider additional\ncreative.\n\n2.       Spanish language TV ads \xe2\x80\x93 shipping two ads today:\n\na.       Valent\xc3\xada: https://youtu.be/5qEno4T19I8\n\nb.      Una de mis heroes (featuring Delores Huerta):\nhttps://youtu.be/Q0sB0XrH9XM\n\n3.       A new Spanish language radio ad, featuring Rep. Gallego and\npushing off Trump/Aprioa \xe2\x80\x93 which can be heard here:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/hillary-clinton-976818877/otro-joe-hillary-clinton/s-xLrxW\n\n4.       Mail team dropped the Giffords gun-contrast piece to persuasion\ntargets who have not yet submitted their ballots (pro-gun universe\nsubtracted).  Ballot chase cards are also hitting over 200,000 targeted\nmailboxes.\n\n5.       Digital advertising \xe2\x80\x93 a suite of creative and mobilization\napproaches, focused first and foremost on addressable mobilization targets\nwho have ballots in hand but have not returned them.  Then on GOTV with key\ndemographics, specifically Latinos and older women.  This will include:\nSpanish-language video (Huerta/Valentina/Brave), Giffords \xe2\x80\x93 both a guns and\nGOTV message, social networking ballot chase in English and Spanish and\nbanner/search drop-off and locate ads.\n\n6.       Newspaper ads: We placed ads in Hispanic newspapers in Phoenix in La\nVoz\n<https://drive.google.com/a/hillaryclinton.com/file/d/0B3JWt7FV0OMZdVktdjBnWDJwTFU/view?usp=sharing>\nand La Prensa\n<https://drive.google.com/a/hillaryclinton.com/file/d/0B3JWt7FV0OMZeU9QVlFEUHNIUGM/view?usp=sharing>\nand in Tucson in La Estrella\n<https://drive.google.com/a/hillaryclinton.com/file/d/0B3JWt7FV0OMZcjgtSnBjV2R0bGs/view?usp=sharing>\nwith a total circulation of 170,369.\n\nLots of moving pieces. Please let us know if you have questions/concerns.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nOren\n'
