HRC reported record-breaking fundraising\nnumbers with over $45 million since she announced in April. Sanders is pure\nin his views, authentic, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to get votes but the polls still\nshow HRC with a strong lead. Noted HRC will be the nominee of the\nDemocratic Party and that her fundamental views on the erosion of the\nmiddle class, lack of economic mobility, and inequality are not far from\nSanders\xe2\x80\x99. Said Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 turnout shows that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Beltway\xe2\x80\x9d may be settled on\nBush and Clinton but the voters are \xe2\x80\x9cstill shopping.\xe2\x80\x9d Chris Matthews\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t think Biden will join the race. Mentioned that most Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t\ngo to rallies and that Sanders is drawing these crowds in places like\nMadison but not sure if he will be able to pull off something like that in\nIowa and New Hampshire. On what HRC should do, they said she\xe2\x80\x99s already\ntalking about income inequality and made that the centerpiece of her\ncampaign. They advised HRC to not overreact although the trade deal is\ngoing to be tough for her. They said in a crowded primary you default to\nsomeone you think is going to win, so even if voters agree with Sanders and\nhis approach, in the end can you really run a democratic socialist against\nJeb Bush? Pragmatism comes into play here. Noted that in 08 HRC was\nsupposed to be a \xe2\x80\x9cshoo in\xe2\x80\x9d and Obama beat her. Said Sanders needs to\nbroaden his issue base (such as HRC showed up with Charleston and he did\nnot). On the Republican side, Christie got a boost in his bid to win over\nNew Hampshire conservatives when Maine Governor Le Page endorsed him. David\nAxelrod said Trump is not going to be the Republican nominee for president.\nTrump can make noise and Republicans on the debate stage with him are going\nto have to embrace his views or stand up to them. Specifically cited Bush\ncoming after Trump on Mexico comments because of his wife. Trump stays on\nmessage and has great name recognition.\n\n*CNN's New Day:* Nearly ten thousand show up for Bernie Sanders in Colorado.\nPaul Begala of HRC super pac claims that the campaign will not spend money\non attacking Sanders. Begala claims that there will never be a coronation\nin the party. Begala claims that it is better for the Democratic Party to\nhave a tougher primary. Reporters claim that progressives that support\nSanders know that HRC will be the inevitable nominee. Donald Trump does not\nback down on his racist comments. Reporters claim that Trump may be taking\nthe stage from more credible candidates. Trump is drawing conservative\nsupport. Reporters claim that the damage is done. Trump is hurting the\nRepublican Party. Reporters claim that other Republican candidates should\nbe worried about the party image.\n\n*Fox News' Fox and Friends:* Segment about companies and entities severing\nties with Donald Trump after he made inflammatory comments about Mexican\nimmigrants; Doocy played a clip of his interview with Trump yesterday,\nwhere Trump criticized Macy\xe2\x80\x99s for dropping his clothing line from their\nstores, as well as Univision and NBC; Doocy quoted a Politico article that\nagreed with Trump, saying that the Mexican immigrants who are coming to\nAmerica are less educated and poor; Hasselbeck reported (inaudible due to\ncorrupted video); Kilmeade said Trump has nothing against Mexicans, just\nthe people, \xe2\x80\x9c80 percent of which come across the border on a regular\nbasis\xe2\x80\x9d; Doocy said Trump has been talking about the problem at the southern\nborder for years; Doocy reported Eva Longorio compared Trump to Hitler;\nDoocy said POTUS mentioned \xe2\x80\x9cgangbangers\xe2\x80\x9d in a speech about immigration in\nNashville, but there was no backlash there. Segment about live polling\nduring speeches by Christie, Trump, and Sanders; Kilmeade spoke with Lee\nCarter, a partner at Maslansky and Partners; Lee Carter said Christie\xe2\x80\x99s\nrollout seemed good, but voters want to know if Christie will be the bully\ncandidate or the advocate candidate; live polling showed Christie was not\npolling well with live viewers; Carter said voters still have reservations\nabout Christie\xe2\x80\x99s bully demeanor and the Washington Bridge scandal (part of\nthe clip inaudible due to corrupted video); Live polling showed Trump\npolling even worse than Christie among live viewers (suddenly cut to\nSanders due to corrupted video); Sanders polling very well with both\nDemocrat and Republican viewers; viewers say they like Sanders because he\nhas no baggage, and because he\xe2\x80\x99s somebody new.\n"
