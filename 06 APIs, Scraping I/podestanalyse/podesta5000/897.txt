As indicated on my enclosed resume outlining campaign and related experience, I have been a loyal Democratic Party member, who has compiled a long record, often volunteer, of support for Party members\xe2\x80\x99 election campaigns.\n\nI was laid off from full-time work in 2014 and have since been working part-time in various capacities. I have also attached a sample cover letter and general resume outlining my full-time professional work experience.\n\nI appreciate your offer of assistance to provide me with inspiration and advice to obtain full-time employment in this arena. I would prefer to remain in the metropolitan DC area unless I receive a salary commensurate with my work experience, education, and qualifications that will enable a smooth transition to another residential area.\n\nThank you, in advance, for your support. Feel free to email me at cheryldixon@gmail.com or call at (240) 461-4002, at any time.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nSincerely,\t\t\n\nCheryl L. Dixon \n'
