The WSJ is writing on it this\nevening and will probably publish tonight on line.\n\n\n\nMight want to pass along to the economic team.  I suspect Democrats will\nappreciate the part that talks about how smaller firms are being left\nbehind by big companies.  Republicans will seize on the paper\xe2\x80\x99s thesis that\nregulation has contributed to widening that differential.\n\n\n\nJake\n\n------------------------------\nThis e-mail may contain information that is confidential, privileged or\notherwise protected from disclosure.
