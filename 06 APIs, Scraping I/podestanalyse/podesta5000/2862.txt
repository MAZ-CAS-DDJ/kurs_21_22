john.podesta@gmail.comb'"Mitt Romney to stump for John McCain in Mesa"\n-- The Arizona Republic, 12/5/2015\n\nJohn,\n\nWith a string of weak poll numbers and deep unpopularity, John McCain is struggling for something -- anything -- to boost his campaign. \n\nAnd it looks like he came up with Mitt Romney. \n\nYou remember Romney. In 2012, he infamously said that 47% of Americans pay no income tax, are "dependent upon government," and believe that they "are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it." \n\nHe also said that it was not his "job" to "worry about those people."\n\nThis is the man that John McCain wants to boost his campaign -- someone just as out-of-touch as he is. We need to make it EXCEPTIONALLY clear that neither of them stand for Arizona. \n\nIn honor of Mitt "47%" Romney\'s visit to Arizona, we\'re going to do something special -- we\'re going to raise $4,700 by midnight TONIGHT to keep fighting. Can you contribute $5 or more now?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ake151212am?refcode=ake151212am_M&recurring=true&amount=25.00\n\nOf course, it\'s not surprising that John McCain would buddy-up to Mitt. \n\nMitt Romney, while running for president, didn\'t think he had to care about 47% of the country. John McCain, as a U.S. senator talking about certain U.S. jobs, said "frankly they shouldn\'t be protected." \n\nNeither are in touch with the lives and needs of real Arizonans.\n\nAnn is a 3rd-generation Arizonan who knows what Arizona families need. And while Mitt Romney is busy trying to prop up McCain, we\'re going to spend our time working even harder by hitting this one-day goal. \n\nHelp us hit $4,700 by midnight tonight. Give what you can. \n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ake151212am?refcode=ake151212am_M&recurring=true&amount=25.00\n\nWe\'ll keep you updated throughout the day. \n\nTeam Kirkpatrick\n\n\n\n----\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.\n\nTo unsubscribe, go to: \nhttp://kirkpatrickforsenate.com/subscriptions\n\n\nPaid for by Kirkpatrick for Senate\n\n'
