In a stream of consciousness fashion, Trump is going to go\nafter everyone and the party is going to have to grapple with the things he\nsays and his ability to dominate the news any day he wants. Trump has\nalready been embraced by people in the Republican Party (Romney, Rick\nScott, etc.) Trump has base support and energy on the ground. A lot of\npeople look at the Mexican border the way he pronounced it yesterday and\nthat affords him an opportunity to be on that stage but to also say\nsomething that is going to make the party very uncomfortable over the next\nfew months. Joe says Ben Carson is at the top of the polls and Chuck Todd\nsays Carson is actually trying to run for President and Joe says Carson\nkeeps comparing America to Nazi Germany. New polls this morning show that\nthe race is tightening for HRC in battleground states. In Florida, Rubio\nperforms best against HRC, just slightly better than Bush, and in Ohio,\nKasich polls a little better than HRC. In Pennsylvania, Paul leads Clinton\nby one point. Looks like Rubio is strongest among Republicans but Rand Paul\nconsistently does well against HRC and yet he\xe2\x80\x99s always seen as second tier\nafter Walker, Bush, and Rubio. Said HRC is having problems in Pennsylvania\nand Ohio because she left too much of the middle to Republicans and those\nare states with a lot of conservative voters. Today, the only person who\ncan win each of the four states is Rand Paul. Should HRC be worried about\nBernie Sanders? New poll shows Sanders surging in New Hampshire. HRC only\nhas a 10 pt lead over Sanders. There\xe2\x80\x99s a clear gender gap with Sanders\ntrailing by 20 points with female voters. Sanders is drawing large crowds\non the campaign trial. Iowa is even more selective and progressive. Chuck\nTodd compares Sanders to McCarthy which is dangerous to HRC because if he\xe2\x80\x99s\npopping now, Joe Biden may look around and say HRC is not a juggernaut and\nI can be the plausible alternative to HRC. As much as HRC has gone left, he\nis further to the left and more authentic about it. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley is\ngoing to try to catch that left-wing flame and the voters will start to see\nhim as the go-to alternative to Hillary. HRC is going to have to battle\nboth of them while Republicans are tearing at her from the other side.\nPanel argued that if you\xe2\x80\x99re listening to Sanders in a crowd, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nsound like a socialist, he sounds like someone addressing the needs of\neveryday Americans and if HRC did an oppositional research dump on him, it\nwould backfire. Sidney Blumenthal said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t write the content in\nemails to HRC about intelligence in Libya. He told the select committee\nthat Intel came from a former top official with the CIA that officials\nreported was part of a group looking to do business in the country.\nCommittee chairman Trey Gowdy says he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned that Blumenthal acted on\nbehalf of someone who may have only had a financial interest and cast doubt\non HRC\xe2\x80\x99s claims that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t solicit the email. Showed footage of Rep.\nGowdy and Sidney Blumenthal. There also appeared to be some fireworks\nbetween Issa and Gowdy.\n\n*Fox News' Fox and Friends:* Doocy, Kilmeade, and Hasselbeck talked about\nDonald Trump running for President; Hasselbeck played a clip of Trump\ntalking about Vladimir Putin on The O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly Factor, in which Trump said he\nwas willing to bet he could build a great relationship with Putin; George\nWill and Charles Krauthammer wrote that Trumps candidacy demeaned the GOP\nfield; Hasselbeck, building off of Kilmeade, said Trump is also promising\nto give Americans jobs, \xe2\x80\x9cmake the Mexicans to build their own wall,\xe2\x80\x9d and\ntake on Vladimir Putin.Nauert reported that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cgrilled\xe2\x80\x9d Sidney\nBlumenthal, \xe2\x80\x9cone of HRC\xe2\x80\x99s closest friends,\xe2\x80\x9d for 9 hours yesterday, asking\nhim questions about dozens of emails that had not been previously disclosed\nto law makers; Blumenthal admitted giving HRC un-vetted intelligence about\nLibya; Nauert said it was unclear whether HRC, or the State Department, had\nwithheld these emails.
