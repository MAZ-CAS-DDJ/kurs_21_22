john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hello All,Just got off the phone with our tracker, Ryan, on the ground in\nBethlehem. Below are the notes from our call.\n\nBig Highlights\n\n   - Intro speaker (chair of county GOP Bill Plait (sp?)) says Barack\n   "Hussein" Obama 2x\n   - Cindy says I wasn\'t happy that Obama voted not to fund my son during\n   his service. It sent a cold chill through my body. Obama should change\n   shoes with me for just one day so he could see what it means to have a loved\n   one in harms\' way.\n   - McCain and Palin pause and smile as crowd angry shouts\n      - Someone yells "beat him up" while Palin talks about last night\'s\n      debate\n      -  McCain says Obama is going to raise taxes on sm. businesses -\n      someone yells "Off with his head," crowd laughs\n      - McCain asks "Who\'s the real Barack Obama?" - someone yells\n      "blowhard"\n      - McCain says Obama called the subprime loans a \'good idea\' - someone\n      yells, "liar!"\n      - OTHER: Someone yells "Sarah\'s hot!" Palin asks, "What does that have\n      to do with anything?"\n   - McCain: I don\'t need lessons about telling the truth to the American\n   people. If I ever were to need improvement in that regard, I probably\n   wouldn\'t seek advice from a "Chicago politician."\n   - Palin attacks Obama for changing position on drilling: he\'s not willing\n   to drill for energy, but he\'s willing to drill for votes\n   - McCain says Obama hasn\'t applied the same standards of clarity to his\n   campaign that I have, he attempts to distract you from the fact he won\'t\n   answer questions\n\nBethlehem, PA: McCain/Palin Rally 10/08/08\n(Disclaimer: The following are notes, not direct quotes.

It sent a cold chill through my body.* Obama should change shoes\nwith me for just one day so he could see what it means to have a loved one\nin harms\' way.\n\n\n\nSpeech Highlights\n[Palin highlights]\n\n\xb7      Thank you so much. It\'s great here to be with the next first lady,\nCindy Mac\n\xb7      TY PA, (someone in crowd yells, \'We love you, Sarah!\')\n\xb7      Talks about local hockey team \x96 says they should change team name to\n\'The Mavericks\'\n\xb7      W/your help, we\'ll send JMac to the WH\n\xb7      So *y\'all* caught the debate last night, right?\n\xb7      BHO  refused the town hall invitations and now we know why - The\ntruth won out last night, the path to victory is clear [someone yells "beat\nhim up"]\n\xb7      Obama-Biden looks to past b/c that\'s where you can find blame - he\nchoice is b/t a politician who puts his faith in gov\'t and a leader who puts\nhis faith in you.\n\xb7      The choice b/t some inspiring words and some inspiring deeds.\n\xb7      BHO is a guy who\'s trying to just kinda talk his way inot the WH and\nJMac is an American hero with a record of honorable deeds\n\xb7      We find solutions in the American people and J Mac offers real\nsolutions!\n\xb7      J Mac offered a new plan that will help us keep our homes and bring\nstability to our market. He is the man.\n\xb7      Predatory lenders have targeted Americans and we\'re going to help fix\nthose mortgages\n\xb7      J Mac has a plan to get our econ back on track\n\xb7      We\'ll also get on the track to energy independence\n\xb7      Cost of living and groceries increases as your paycheck\'s worth\ndecreases and that\'s because of energy\n\xb7      In McCain-Palin admin we\'ll develop new alt. energy sources\n\xb7      We\'ll build new nuke plants\n\xb7      Harnessing those alternative sources like energy, wind and solar\n\xb7      We do need to drill here and drill now\n\xb7      BHO has always opposed offshore drilling, but last night he changed\nthat too.\n\xb7      He\'s not willing to drill for energy, but he\'s sure willing to drill\nfor votes.\n\xb7      Crowd chants \'Drill, baby drill!\' as Palin says, \'Yes. You\'re right.\'\n\xb7      In a McCain-Palin admin we\'ll achieve energy security, which means US\nn.r.g, brought to you by American workers. (Crowd chants, \'USA!\')\n\xb7      JMac talked about real solutions and BHO talked about why he\'d rather\nrun against GWB \x96 that strategy is starting to wear pretty darn thin \x96\nmccain didn\'t just come out of nowhere \x96 people of USA know JM. The\nAmericans know JMac is a maverick and that\'s what scares our opponents most\n\xb7      You in PA know McCain is his own man, doesn\'t run with the DC herd\n(crowd laughs). His background: from an enemy prison camp to halls of\nCongress, McCain  has always put his country first\n\xb7      He\'s the only one who will help the working class, cut taxes and\ncreate jobs\n\xb7      He\'s the only man in this race that talks about the wars America is\nfighting and isn\'t afraid to use the word \'Victory.\'\n\xb7      Last night we heard BHO lecture mccain on the stakes involved with US\nwar \x96 let me remind BHO that JMac served our nation in uniform for 22 years\n - God bless McCain, he spent 5 yrs as a POW and knows the cost of war b/c\nhe\'s paid those costs himself\n\xb7      As a mother of one of those troops, that\'s exactly the kind of man I\nwant as POTUS\n\xb7      Those of you who have served in the past, let us thank you. Raise\nyour hands. (Palin literally points out servicemen, says, \'Thank you.\') You\ndo deserve that standing ovation for your sacrifice. \'God bless ya.\'\n\xb7      What JMac and I believe in is what Ronald Reagan believed in\n\no   We believe in a culture of life\no   We believe that America\'s workers are the best in the world\no   We believe that America is a good and honorable nation and a beacon of\nhope for those seeking freedom and equal rights\no   We can be that shining city on a hill, as Reagan said\n\n\xb7      Since JMac won\'t say it himself, I\'ll say it for him. He\'s the only\none who has actually fought for you. Biden and BHO are lying when they say\nthey will.\n\n\n[McCain highlights]\n\n-       Glad to have SP introduce me, but I can\'t wait to introduce her to\nDC\n-       TY Cindy and Meghan\n-       w/ your support, *Sarah\'s gonna help me* put US econ back on track\nto job creation for US workers\n-       We need your vote, we need your support, we need you!\n-       How\'d we do last night? Okay? (Chuckles)\n-       Last night I set forth a critical step we must take\n-       There\'s a big problem (someone in crowd yells \x96 \'It\'s Barack!\')\n-       The dream of owning a home should not be crushed under the weight of\na bad mortgage\n-       This moment requires a government act and I intend to act quickly\nand decisively so you can realize the American dream\n-       The status quo is not on the ballot. We\'ll see change. The question\nis, in what direction will we go?\n\no   In short: who is ready to lead? (Crowd: \'You are!\')\no   Who will put our country first? (Crowd: \'You will!\')\n\n-       I\'ve kept my promise to level with you about my plans to reform DC\nand get this country moving again\n-       As a Senator, I\'ve seen the corrupt ways of Washington and abuses of\npower. As prez I\'ll end those practices, whatever it takes.\n\no   I\'ll get rising costs of living under control\no   I\'ll help struggling students (crowd loves it)\no   I\'ll propose a spending freeze\n\n-       You and I together will confront the deficit and balance the budget\nby the end of my term in office\n-       BHO hasn\'t applied the same standards of clarity to his campaign\nthat I have (Crowd chants: \'NObama!\')\n-       BHO attempts to distract you from the fact he won\'t answer the\nserious questions asked of him\n-       I don\'t need lessons about telling the truth to the American people.\nIf I ever were to need improvement in that regard, I probably wouldn\'t seek\nadvice from a Chicago politician.\n-       BHO\'s record before this crisis was to aid and abet this corruption\nand current wave of unsustainable debt\n\no   I called for tighter restrictions on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae\no   BHO\'s dem allies in congress opposed efforts to rein in the FMac and\nFMae\no   BHO called the subprime loans a \'good idea\' [someone yells, "liar!"] and\nthey\'ve now plunged us into the worst crisis since the Great Depression\no   The execs of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae advised BHO and he\'s taken money\nfrom their campaign. He\'s received more $$$ than any other senator in\nhistory.\no   Why didn\'t BHO support the regulations that could have prevented these\nregulations? He won\'t tell you, but you deserve an answer.\n\n-       On health care he\'s almost misrepresented his own plans as much as\nmine\n\no   BHO wants single-payer insurance plans (someone yells:\n\'socialism!\')that will fine employers who don\'t put their employers in\nhis plan\no   BHO promised to raise taxes on everyone with a dividends\no   BHO\'s plan will raise taxes on half the small businesses [someone yells\n"off with his head!", crowd laughs] and kill jobs and the backbone of our\necon. When I\'m president, they\'re taxes will go down and not up. We\'ll help\nthem create jobs.\n\n-       BHO has a record on tax increases he tries to hide. He voted to\nraise taxes on individuals making $42k. If he\'s such a defender of the\nmiddle-class why does he want to raise their taxes?\n-       BHO thinks taxes are too low and I think spending is too high\n-       According to 3rd-party estimates, BHO will increase debt by $800B\n-       In BHO\'s 3 short years in the senate, he\'s requested $1M for every\nday he\'s been in office.\n-       BHO has been eager participant in this corrupt system\n-       He sought a lot of $$$ for overhead projector at planetarium in his\nhome town and the man who ran it pledged to raise $$$ for BHO \'08\n-       Who is the real BHO? [someone yells: "blowhard"] The candidate who\npledges to cut taxes or the politician who raised them? Is it the candidate\nwho pledges to fix econ or the politician who took money from Fannie and\nFreddie. We can\'t change the system with someone who has never fought the\nsystem.\n-       BHO has never once bucked his own party\n-       The American ppl know I\'ll change things in DC b/c I\'ve done it\nbefore\n-       I\'ve delivered relief to the middle class\n-       I\'ll fight for you and put gov back on the side of the people\n-       TY and g-d bless and I need your vote. Proud to be with you.\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nSara DuBois\nTracking / Communications Manager\nProgressiveAccountability.org\nsara@progressiveaccountability.org\n202-609-7681 (office)\n410-967-7306 (cell)\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
