Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton family friend and\npolitical supporter, said that he sees "no need" for Hillary Rodham Clinton\nto begin her 2016 presidential campaign right away and that she benefits by\navoiding a bruising Democratic primary challenge.\n\n\n\n"Listen, I\'m very happy with the situation," McAuliffe said Saturday in an\ninterview with The Washington Post. "She doesn\'t have to get in right away.\nIt\'s saving a lot of time, effort and money. Let the Republicans all get\nin."\n\n\n\nMcAuliffe, who served as national co-chairman of Clinton\'s 2008\npresidential campaign and as the Democratic National Committee chairman\nduring the 2004 presidential primaries, said he knows from experience that\nlaunching a campaign early can be draining. He pointed out that in the 1992\ncampaign, Bill Clinton did not announce his candidacy until October 1991.\n\n\n\n"Having done this for many years, the second you get in and open up a\ncampaign account, let me tell you, that money just goes out the door,"\nMcAuliffe said. "There\xe2\x80\x99s no need at this point. We\xe2\x80\x99re in a very good\nposition, so she can take her time on her timetable, which is spectacular."\n\n\n\nMcAuliffe, who once sat on the board of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea\nClinton Foundation, defended the charitable foundation\'s decision to accept\ndonations from foreign governments.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the biggest attack on Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s going to be that she raised too much\nmoney for her charity, okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that," he said. "No one\xe2\x80\x99s alleging\nanything beyond that she raised money and people gave her money and foreign\ngovernments gave her money. At the end of the day, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. It went to\na charity. It helped a lot of people."\n\n\n\n McAuliffe\'s comments come amid much discussion in Democratic circles about\nClinton\'s timetable for what her allies think is a certain 2016 White House\nrun. Clinton\'s team has signaled that she is likely to begin raising money\nas early as April but may delay aggressive campaigning until the summer.\nSome Democrats believe she is wise to hang back and wait, while others want\nto see her fighting now to erase any impressions that she may be taking the\nDemocratic nomination for granted.\n\n\n\nAt this stage in the 2008 campaign, the Democratic field already had taken\nshape, with announced candidacies of Clinton, Barack Obama and John\nEdwards, among others. But this time, Clinton does not face a serious\nprimary threat.\n\n\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) has insisted that she is not running, despite\nan effort by some liberal activists to draft her into the race, while Vice\nPresident Biden is not actively preparing for a candidacy, although he has\nnot shut the door on a run. Maryland Gov. Martin O\'Malley, Sen. Bernie\nSanders (I-Vt.) and former senator Jim Webb (Va.) have been making waves\nand visiting early primary states, but none has launched a campaign.\n\n\n\n"People are going to make their decision," McAuliffe said. "If they run,\nthey run. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t, they don\xe2\x80\x99t."\n\n\n\nMcAuliffe said he disagreed with the view of some Democrats that a\ncompetitive primary campaign would be good for Clinton and would help\nprepare her for the rigors of the general election.\n\n\n\n"What\xe2\x80\x99s going to go on on the Republican side is going to be intense and\ntough," McAuliffe said. "I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see that on the Democratic side\n\xe2\x80\x94 of course not, if we can avoid it. It\'s going to be a long, tough slog\nfor them."\n\n\n\nMcAuliffe was asked to assess the early moves of former Florida governor\nJeb Bush, who has locked up many of the Republican Party\'s prominent donors\nand policy thinkers in the two months since he formed a leadership PAC to\nexplore a bid.\n\n\n\n"None of that surprised me," McAuliffe said. "At the end of the day, it\xe2\x80\x99s\nstill hard because of, obviously, the negative issues around his brother,\nthe issues of the war in Iraq and all that. That\'s still going to linger\nout there. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to remember, when President Obama took office, you\nthink of the job losses that occurred under President [George W.] Bush\xe2\x80\x99s\nterm and contrast that to the millions of jobs created under President\nObama. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that contrast."\n\n\n\nMcAuliffe continued, "Jeb Bush, who wants to pretend he can distance\nhimself, cannot distance himself from that failed economic record and\nfailed foreign policy record. All of the issues that we had before will\ncome back to [the] fore.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n As for what role McAuliffe may play in a Clinton 2016 campaign, he said he\nwould be her loudest cheerleader in Richmond.\n\n\n\n"I have the job I\xe2\x80\x99ve always dreamed of," McAuliffe said. "I love being\ngovernor, as you probably can tell." In 2007 and 2008, he said, "I spent\n500 days on the road. I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that again. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a job here."\n\n\n\n"You know what?" he continued, "to be honest with you, I\xe2\x80\x99m personal friends\nwith them. They want me to be successful. Honestly, [the] president calls\nall the time. I talk to Hillary all the time. They want me to be successful\nas a governor. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing I can do."\n\n\n\nHe said that Virginia is poised once more to be a top general election\nbattleground and that he would focus on helping Clinton win his home state.\nMcAuliffe is preparing for state legislative races this year and is trying\nto help Democrats regain control of the state Senate.\n\n\n\n"I\'m laying the groundwork and putting all the pieces in place for \'15 to\nget my Senate back," McAuliffe said. "But that same team I\xe2\x80\x99m putting in\nplace and operations will be a set-up to make sure that [in 2016]\nVirginia\xe2\x80\x99s blue."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Huffington Post: Hillary Clinton And The Not Too Bitter, Not Too Smooth,\nJust Right Primary\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/22/hillary-clinton-primary-challenge_n_6724440.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Jason Linkins\n\nFebruary 22, 2015 7:30 a.m. EST\n\n\n\nEvery election cycle can be considered, first and foremost, a monument to\nhype. With every passing week, the political world is a blizzard of brash\npredictions, bold pronouncements and bad advice. This year, your\nSpeculatroners shall attempt to decode and defang this world with a regular\ndispatch that we\'re calling "This Week In Coulda Shoulda Maybe." We hope\nthis helps, but as always, we make no guarantees!\n\n\n\nIt shouldn\'t be controversial to say that at this point in the 2016 race,\nformer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton enjoys virtually every possible\nadvantage in the Democratic primary field. She\'s the best-known candidate\nwith the highest level of name recognition and visibility. She has a\nlong-nurtured campaign apparatus and the ability to call campaign\ninfrastructure into being on the fly. Against the rest of the Democratic\nfield, she\'s the overwhelming favorite in every poll that\'s ever been\nconducted.\n\n\n\nOf course, anytime we talk about a "Democratic field," we should really\nsay, "insofar as one exists." Her competition -- so far a dimly lit\nconstellation of long shots (and perhaps the current vice president) --\nisn\'t shaping up as a particularly robust challenge. Clinton plays a role\nin that simply by looming on the landscape. As has been discussed\npreviously, Clinton has the power to "freeze the field" -- meaning that her\ndominance is such that Democratic party elites and mega-donors are loath to\ninvest in a competitor, creating a sort of vicious cycle in which no viable\ncompetitors can truly present themselves.\n\n\n\nThere is a very real possibility that Clinton could face only a nominal\nchallenge in a Democratic primary, and potentially none at all. And that\'s\nproduced an interesting phenomenon among the members of the political media\nwho, expecting a competitive primary to generate monetizable content and\ngrist for "The Narrative," find themselves somewhere in the middle of a\nstory that doesn\'t seem to have started. This is how you can understand the\nconstant attention given to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- a woman\nwho is not running for president -- as a "foil" for Clinton. Every great\nprotagonist needs an antagonist, and the political press would dearly love,\nif possible, to will one into being.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, there are the Hot Takes, suffused by the media\'s drug of choice,\ncounter-intuition. Are all the advantages that Clinton secretly holds\nactually disadvantages in disguise? Is Clinton\'s ability to quelch all\nviable contenders for the Democratic nomination actually the Achilles heel\nthat will lead to her undoing? A better question might be: Are all the\npeople offering that opinion simply planting a flag for a future "Told ya\nso" story down the line?\n\n\n\nI think it\'s fair to say that most of us, if we wanted something important\n(like, say, a job), wouldn\'t spend much time regretting the news that we\nwere the only person in the running. Just about everyone would prefer to\nwin in a blowout. At the same time, there is something that we all\nunderstand instinctually about the nature of competition: It tests mettle.\nAnd the old eyeball test informs us of the virtues of tested mettle. When\nwe look at the 27-1 Gonzaga University men\'s basketball team alongside the\nother basketball teams in the top four of the NCAA\'s national rankings,\nmany of us downgrade the Bulldogs because we know that they didn\'t play\nagainst the same level of competition as Kentucky, Virginia and Duke did.\nSo, in the back of our mind, Gonzaga looms as a paper tiger.\n\n\n\nThat said, eventually Gonzaga is going to have ample opportunity to show\nthat they\'re superior to their competition -- just like Clinton will, even\nif she runs in an uncontested primary.\n\n\n\nOf course, the fact that there isn\'t already vigorous competition for\nClinton to face tells us a few potentially ominous things. First and\nforemost, it shows that the Democratic Party\'s bench is not terribly deep\nright now. Elections are, at bottom, a competition of ideas -- one in which\na losing candidate\'s vision may persist beyond the candidate\'s own\nelectoral hopes. That\'s a good thing for any political party. Furthermore,\na quickly decided primary could negatively impact state-level political\norganizing, which in turn would impact the vitality of down-ticket\ncampaigns.\n\n\n\nBut let\'s stick with the question: Is Hillary running virtually unopposed a\nbad thing? As Vox\'s Matt Yglesias points out, having a competitive primary\nmeans "real debates, real media strategy, real policy rollouts, and all the\nother accompaniments of a presidential nominating congress." He goes on to\nnote that "competition" in this instance goes well beyond simply having\nother credible opponents:\n\n\n\nA vigorous primary campaign is a means through which, among other things,\nthe key potential vulnerabilities in a candidate\'s biography get aired. Was\nClinton lying about her opposition to gay marriage the way David Axelrod\nsays Obama was? Have too many years at the pinnacle of American politics\nleft her out of touch with middle class struggles? Can she distance herself\nfrom Obama administration foreign policy initiatives that didn\'t work out\n(settlement freeze? Russia reset?) without sounding disloyal or\nineffectual? Can she answer questions about the complicated finances\nunderlying her husband\'s foundation?\n\n\n\nAs long as she\'s "not running," we just don\'t know. And the closer she gets\nto obtaining the nomination without answering the questions, the more\nvulnerable the position she leaves herself in for the general election.\n\n\n\nHere\'s the thing: All of that is smart-sounding stuff. It\'s thoughtful\nargument that appeals to our instincts. You can take that to a Beltway\nsoiree or the set of a Sunday morning talk show, and with a little charm,\nyou\'ll hold up. And yet, it\'s still really just gut feelings. It\'s still\nthat instinct that pushes you to take an at-large team from the ACC deeper\nin the tourney than the one-loss Western Conference champions -- a good\nenough gamble that could, nonetheless, leave your bracket in tatters.\n\n\n\nAnd it\'s worth pointing out that over on the GOP side, Republican elites\nare making their own set of gambles with their primary. The Republican\nNational Committee\'s interpretation of their 2012 cycle woes has led them\nto believe that the long primary cost them dearly. The RNC believes that\ntheir primary afforded too many fleeting also-rans too much media coverage,\nthat the length of the competition provided too many opportunities for\ntheir party to be shown in a bad light, and that ultimately, everything\nconspired to force their nominee into a bunch of positions from which the\nextrication was too difficult. They have, subsequently, undertaken a number\nof moves to "fix" this problem, and while they\'ve not created a situation\nin which one candidate has a massive advantage over everyone else, it\'s\nstill a drive toward limiting the competition, all based on some gut\nfeelings.\n\n\n\nCan we get closer to the truth of how, if at all, a competitive primary\nbrings benefits -- or pitfalls -- to candidates? Well, if we turn to\npolitical science, there seems to be one constant notion: A competitive\nprimary is very good for candidates, right up to where the competitive\nprimary becomes a divisive primary, at which point the benefits of\ncompetition tend to fade.\n\n\n\nThe virtues of competitive primaries are hotly debated, as it turns out.\nBack in February of 2008, The Monkey Cage\'s John Sides embarked on an\nexploration of the topic, noting that the most relevant research at the\ntime pointed to other factors as being far more determinative of success in\na general election. From a gambler\'s point of view, the health of the\neconomy and the popular regard for the presidential incumbent matter a lot\nmore than what happens during a primary.\n\n\n\nBut Josh Putnam, proprietor of Frontloading HQ, nevertheless saw something\ninteresting in the notion that a competitive primary could take a dark,\nblowback-producing turn. Just as the RNC concluded after the 2012 cycle,\nthe factor that fascinated Putnam in 2008 was timing -- the notion that on\na long enough timeline, a competitive primary eventually, maybe inevitably,\nturns divisive. Per Putnam:\n\n\n\nAt what point does the positive competitiveness of the race for delegates\nturn into the negative, party-splitting divisiveness? Should Clinton do\nwell in Ohio and Texas on Tuesday, then 2008 may have reached that point\nfor the Democrats. But in the Super Tuesday era (1988/1992-2004), no\nchallenger has been afforded such an opportunity. That era was marked by\nfrontrunners who were able to snuff out insurgencies before competitiveness\nturned to divisiveness. ... [Walter] Mondale quelled Gary Hart before a\nmovement started (No, this isn\'t within the era I defined above but it is a\ngood example.). George W. Bush kept [John] McCain at bay. And [John] Kerry\nsilenced John Edwards. Competitiveness yielded to reality in all three\ncases before divisiveness took hold or could attempt to take hold.\n\n\n\nIt\'s almost as if there\'s a sort of "uncanny valley" phenomenon happening,\nin which competition elevates everyone until it gets too hot or turns too\npersonal. There\'s a sweet spot: Ideally, you want your level of competition\nto be challenging, but not bedeviling. You want the primary race to look\nlike a collegial bit of tire-kicking, not a campaign in which you\'re\nsending arsonists out to torch the rival dealership. So maybe all of the\npeople who continually pen that "Elizabeth Warren versus Hillary Clinton"\nfan fiction are onto something, instinctually: They have a sense that the\nJim Webbs and Martin O\'Malleys of the world might not make it out of Iowa\nand that Clinton needs someone who can stay in the game long enough to make\nit to Super Tuesday. But not much further than that.\n\n\n\nIn the end, that data-driven conclusion about competitive primaries that we\nreally want remains elusive -- or at the very least, not strong enough to\ntalk us out of our horse-sense feelings on the matter. But let\'s return to\none last study, cited by The Monkey Cage\'s Jonathan Robinson, about that\n2008 competition between Clinton and Barack Obama:\n\n\n\nUsing a survey that tracked individual voters from the primary to the\ngeneral election, Michael Henderson, D. Sunshine Hillygus, and Trevor\nThompson ... examine whether and why Clinton supporters did or did not\nsupport Obama in the general election. They find that 71% of Clinton\nsupporters ended up voting for Obama. Moreover, supporters of Clinton and\nthe other Democratic candidates were no more likely to stay home on\nElection Day. The most important factors that predicted a vote for McCain\namong supporters of the other Democratic candidates were not frustration\nwith the primary election\xe2\x80\x99s outcome but ideology and political issues,\nespecially the Iraq War.\n\n\n\nAll of that suggests that even though the 2008 Democratic primary got\nfiercely competitive, it still stoked an energy that lasted throughout the\nelection cycle, ensuring that Democratic voters stayed engaged over the\nlong haul. Perhaps what a political party, ideally, wants out of a primary\nis a contest where the competitiveness fosters some amount of voter\nengagement without tipping into a grotesque spectacle that leaves those who\nhad engaged with it feeling nauseous, discouraged and just plain done with\npolitics for the year.\n\n\n\nHandled the right way, a contested primary creates a number of "products"\norganically that would need to be manufactured by other means in a\nnon-contested primary. Competition helps to present those Big Ideas to the\nelectorate, a vision of the future for which to fight. It breeds passion\nand gets voters to start using those muscles of commitment, which\neventually get them out of the house and to the polls on Election Day.\nPerhaps most importantly, it allows the candidates to make connections with\nthose activist members of the electorate, who\'ll use their muscles to make\nsure those committed voters know how to get to those polls on time.\n\n\n\nAt this point, it sure looks like Hillary Clinton can grab the nomination\nwithout too much trouble. Trouble is, some trouble might be a nice thing to\nhave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*ABC News: One Thing That Might Surprise You About Hillary Clinton\n<http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2015/02/one-thing-that-might-surprise-you-about-hillary-clinton/>*\n\n\n\nBy Benjamin Bell\n\nFebruary 21, 2015 3:08 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nThis week, we asked Amy Chozick, national political reporter for the The\nNew York Times, who covers Hillary Clinton, about when the former secretary\nof state might announce her 2016 intentions, her possible competition and\none thing that surprised Chozick about Clinton.\n\n\n\nRead our conversation below before Chozick appears on the \xe2\x80\x9cThis Week\xe2\x80\x9d\nroundtable Sunday.\n\n\n\n1] Hillary Clinton has not said she is running for president, although\nobviously many people assume she will. If she does, what do we know about\nwhen she might announce?\n\n\n\nAmy Chozick: The conventional wisdom is that she would establish some sort\nof exploratory committee to begin raising money in April. She could then do\na splashy public rollout of an official campaign later in the spring or\nearly summer. But the exploratory committee would give Clinton the legal\napparatus to begin to raise and spend money for a political campaign.\n\n\n\n2] Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter account has been closely watched since she started\ntweeting. Do we know who is in control of that account and the strategy\nbehind it?\n\n\n\nAmy Chozick: I think we might be overanalyzing. Clinton, apparently,\nhandles her own Twitter account and enjoys the medium. Just look what it\ndid for her with the \xe2\x80\x9cTexts from Hillary\xe2\x80\x9d meme. Tweeting allows her to\ncomment (albeit in 140 characters) on events of the day in a very\ncontrolled, but heavily disseminated way. That beats the unpredictability\nof a press conference, at least for now.\n\n\n\n3] The New York Times reported Clinton met with Sen. Elizabeth Warren in\nDecember. Do they [team Clinton] perceive her as a threat to a possible\nClinton candidacy for president? And if so, how large? Also, is there a\nspecific Republican that team Clinton perceives would pose the biggest\nchallenge to Clinton should she decide to run and secure the nomination?\n\n\n\nAmy Chozick: Sen. Warren says she is not running for president, but she has\nhad a significant impact on the national conversation, especially about\nWall Street and inequality and how Clinton and the Democratic Party writ\nlarge address those issues. On the Republican side, Jeb Bush is currently\nperceived as the biggest threat. He has name recognition, appeals to\nLatinos, and has deep coffers and some centrist appeal.\n\n\n\n4] At this point, who are Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s closest advisers? Should Clinton decide\nto run for president, who might be at the top of the power structure? Who\nmight run her campaign?\n\n\n\nAmy Chozick: Many of the same loyal aides who have been with Clinton since\nthe White House (when her team was known as Hillaryland) continue to serve\nas her closest advisers, but a lot of newcomers will come on board for a\n2016 campaign. John Podesta, who worked in former President Bill Clinton\nand President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s administrations, is expected to serve as a campaign\nchairman.\n\n\n\n5] Covering Clinton, what is one thing that has surprised you about her?\n\n\n\nAmy Chozick: Hmm. She likes to drink. We were on the campaign trail in 2008\nand the press thought she was just taking shots to pander to voters in\nPennsylvania. Um, no.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Politico: Bernie Sanders not eager to \xe2\x80\x98tilt at windmills\xe2\x80\x99 in 2016\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/bernie-sanders-not-eager-to-tilt-at-windmills-in-2016-115395.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Caitlin Emma\n\nFebruary 22, 2015 11:53 a.m. EST\n\n\n\nVermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders has been in Iowa again, railing\nagainst the Koch brothers, calling for economic justice and trying to gauge\nwhether there\xe2\x80\x99s enough grassroots support for a presidential run.\n\n\n\nSanders didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention the presumed Democratic frontrunner, Hillary\nClinton, by name in an interview that aired Sunday on ABC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThis Week,\xe2\x80\x9d\nbut said, if he decides to seek the White House, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t sure he would run\nas a Democrat.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that I\xe2\x80\x99m in Iowa, which is a caucus state, maybe speaks for\nitself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I haven\xe2\x80\x99t made that final decision. And I got to\ntell you that a lot of my strong supporters say Bernie, \xe2\x80\x98Stay out of the\ndamn Democratic Party. Run as an Independent.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSanders is the longest serving Independent member of Congress at 24 years.\nIn Iowa, he told supporters that he was ready to take on the \xe2\x80\x9cbillionaire\nclass,\xe2\x80\x9d railing against the corrupting influence of money in politics.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe United States government has got to start working for the middle class\nand families of this country and not just millionaires and billionaires,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is likely that within a very short period of time, the Koch\nbrothers themselves will have a stronger political presence than either the\nDemocratic or Republican Party.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAsked whether he could win a presidential race, Sanders said it was a \xe2\x80\x9cfair\nquestion.\xe2\x80\x9d He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to \xe2\x80\x9ctilt at windmills,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, or attack\nimaginary enemies like the famous literary character Don Quixote.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got so much to do,\xe2\x80\x9d the senator said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I just think that out\nthere, there are so many people who are hurting, so many people who are\ndisillusioned, so many people who are viscerally upset that they work long\nhours for low wages and the billionaires are getting richer.

"How do you\nclothe those who have no clothes? That is a conservative position to help\nthem get on their feet so they then can assume their rightful place in our\nsociety."\n\n\n\nIn Kentucky, he added, "maybe everybody\'s fine, maybe there aren\'t people\nwho are suffering these problems." The state had the seventh-highest\npoverty rate in the U.S. (including the District of Columbia) in a\n2011-2013 average, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\n\nAsked about Clinton, Kasich said, "You know, I like Hillary, but I\'m not\never going to be for her for president."\n\n\n\nHe suggested that he\'d continue to speak out on foreign policy, in which\nClinton was involved as President Barack Obama\'s secretary of state from\n2009 to 2013. "Hopefully whether I do this or not, I can have somewhat of a\nvoice when it comes to the fact that America, you know, it just seems to be\nin retreat," he said.\n\n\n\nWhether Kasich will meet Paul in the presidential primary is unclear.\n\n\n\n"All my options are on the table, and it\'s a process that I, you know, have\nreally not spent an enormous amount of time studying internally," said\nKasich, who has been traveling to campaign for a balanced-budget amendment\nto the U.S. constitution.

And despite the handwringing on the right and left, his\nwords don\'t really harm anyone.\n\n\n\nNot the Republican brand, not his own reputation or even any of the\nRepublicans who have backed his statements. However he did just HELP\nHillary Clinton, and if the GOP is serious about 2016 they should be\nworried about any statements actions or thoughts that get her closer to the\nWhite House.\n\n\n\nThis all started last week when Giuliani was giving a speech at a posh\nManhattan Dinner party for likely Presidential candidate Scott Walker last\nWednesday, when Rudy said: "I do not believe \xe2\x80\x94 and I know this is a\nhorrible thing to say \xe2\x80\x94 but I do not believe that this President loves\nAmerica."\n\n\n\nApparently that didn\'t bring the point home enough because the former mayor\nof New York city kept going in on Obama, with any media outlet that\'d let\nhim talk.\n\n\n\nOn Fox & Friends: "What I\'m saying is, in his rhetoric I very rarely hear\nthe things that I used to hear Ronald Reagan say, the things that I used to\nhear Bill Clinton say about how much he loves America. I do hear him\ncriticize America much more often than other American Presidents. And when\nit\'s not in the context of an overwhelming number of statements about the\nexceptionalism of America, it sounds like he\'s more of a critic than he is\na supporter."\n\n\n\nHe added, "You can be a patriotic American and be a critic, but then you\'re\nnot expressing that kind of love that we\'re used to from a President."\n\n\n\nBasically by the end of the week Giuliani was doing everything short of\nasking for another copy of Obama\'s birth certificate and asking for his\nwhereabouts on the morning of 9-11. Many in the press and some Republican\ncommentators have said Giuliani\'s comments are harmful to the Republican\nbrand, and slowly but surely Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush have come\nto not quite critique Giuliani but claim that their disagreement with Obama\nhas always been more about policy than whether he loves America.\n\n\n\nGovernor Bobby Jindal and former Congresswoman Michele Bachmann have come\nout in support of Giuliani\'s statements and have earned praise and scorn\nfor their courage or cowardice depending on how you lean politically.\nUltimately none of this matters, and this entire tempest in a teapot is\nprobably giving the Clinton campaign goosebumps.\n\n\n\nFirst, Rudy Giuliani is not saying anything new, not for him, and not for\nmany people in the Republican party base. From conservative commentators\nlike Mark Levin to rank-and-file Republicans, the belief that Obama doesn\'t\nlove America is not new, and it didn\'t take us losing the war against ISIS\nfor many conservatives to question his patriotism, faith and love of\ncountry. It\'s just a very common belief system among the base of the modern\nRepublican party.\n\n\n\nThe best way to tag the party nominee of a two term president is to claim\nthey\'ll essentially be that president\'s third term. The more the GOP makes\nthis race about Obama, the easier it\'ll be for Hillary Clinton to draw\ncontrasts between herself and his administration.\n\n\n\nRemember the whole \'flag pin\' incident? Yes we all know from a moral and\nstatesmanship perspective that this kind of language is racist and\ncounter-productive for the United States but when in the last 7 years have\nwe seen anyone in American campaign politics benefit from trying to be the\nadult in the room? Obama\'s "Dad-in-Chief" routine hasn\'t helped against the\nRepublican Congress, or during campaigns.\n\n\n\nGiuliani\'s comments are no different than Steve Scalise hanging out with\nKlan members. The GOP knows who their base is, but for some reason we\'re\nall supposed to feign shock and disgust when we\'re reminded. While most\nRepublicans don\'t hold beliefs this far to the racist right the fact is the\nlast guy who tried to split the needle with the GOP base by saying "Obama\nis a good man with bad ideas" ended up losing.\n\n\n\nAnd speaking of losing, that\'s what this is really all about, the\nRepublicans should be worried about losing to Hillary Clinton in 2016, and\nthis kind of rhetoric is exactly what would lead to her and Bill Clinton\nmarching back into the White House. Yes, there\'s the obvious problem, that\nthis kind of language from a prominent Republican is alienating to young\nvoters, minority voters and independents, but it actually goes a bit deeper\nthan that.\n\n\n\nThe best way to tag the party nominee of a two term president is to claim\nthey\'ll essentially be that president\'s third term. The more the GOP makes\nthis race about Obama, the easier it\'ll be for Hillary Clinton to draw\ncontrasts between herself and his administration.\n\n\n\nDoes anyone other than the far right believe Hillary doesn\'t love America?\nDoes anyone other than the far right believe Hillary was influenced by\ncommunists? Or doesn\'t want to stop ISIS?\n\n\n\nIf Republicans can\'t get over their Obama derangement syndrome it just\nmakes it that much easier for Hillary to say "Obama isn\'t on the ballot!"\nand define herself. It\'s already going to be hard to tag her with the Obama\nadministration because everyone knows she disagrees with the President a\nlot.\n\n\n\nIf Republicans respond to every attack on the president like it\'s a leaked\naudio tape, Hillary will be waltzing right back into the White House,\nwhether she loves America or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*New York Times opinion: Hillary, Jeb and $$$$$$\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/opinion/sunday/frank-bruni-hillary-clinton-jeb-bush-and-fund-raising-for-the-2016-presidential-race.html?_r=0>*\n\n\n\nBy Frank Bruni\n\nFebruary 21, 2015\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush and Fund-Raising for the 2016\nPresidential Race\n\n\n\nThere are firm and necessary laws against American candidates accepting\nforeign donations. There\xe2\x80\x99s no such prohibition for a philanthropy like the\nClinton Foundation, which undeniably does much essential, heroic work\naround the globe.\n\n\n\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s a philanthropy headed by a woman who\xe2\x80\x99s most likely running for\npresident and by her husband and daughter. Their requests and their\ngratitude cannot be separated entirely from politics. There\xe2\x80\x99s inevitable\noverlap and blending.\n\n\n\nAs The Washington Post wrote, the foundation \xe2\x80\x9chas given contributors\nentree, outside the traditional political arena, to a possible president.\nForeign donors and countries that are likely to have interests before a\npotential Clinton administration \xe2\x80\x94 and yet are ineligible to give to U.S.\npolitical campaigns \xe2\x80\x94 have affirmed their support for the family\xe2\x80\x99s work\nthrough the charitable giving.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd this isn\xe2\x80\x99t some minor wrinkle of the foundation\xe2\x80\x99s structure and\nworkings. \xe2\x80\x9cA third of foundation donors who have given more than $1 million\nare foreign governments or other entities based outside the United States,\nand foreign donors make up more than half of those who have given more than\n$5 million,\xe2\x80\x9d according to The Post\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.\n\n\n\nThat analysis also showed that \xe2\x80\x9cdonations from the financial services\nsector\xe2\x80\x9d represented the \xe2\x80\x9clargest share of corporate donors.\xe2\x80\x9d In other\nwords, the foundation is cozy with Wall Street, which has also funneled\nClinton some of her enormous speaking fees.\n\n\n\nThe Journal noted that \xe2\x80\x9cat least 60 companies that lobbied the State\nDepartment during her tenure donated a total of more than $26 million to\nthe Clinton Foundation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA few prominent Democrats with whom I spoke were spooked, not because they\nbelieved that Clinton would feel a pressing need to repay these kindnesses,\nbut because the eventual Republican nominee had just been handed a potent\nweapon against her.\n\n\n\nAnd in the income-inequality era, how does a candidate crowned with this\nmany dollar signs put herself forward persuasively as a woman of the people\nand a champion of the underdog?\n\n\n\nTHE answer \xe2\x80\x94 and her salvation \xe2\x80\x94 may be that we\xe2\x80\x99ve all become so accustomed\nto the tide of money washing through politics that we just assume all\ncandidates to be equally (and thoroughly) wet. We give in. And we stop\nacknowledging frequently or urgently enough that American elections, which\nshould be contests of ideas and character, are as much (if not more)\ncontests of cold, hard cash.\n\n\n\nCertainly those of us in the news media are somewhat guilty of this,\nbecause something that\xe2\x80\x99s no longer new is no longer news.\n\n\n\nSure, we publish stories about the dizzying, obscene heights of spending by\nmajor donors, like one written in The Times last month by Nicholas\nConfessore. He noted that the Koch brothers had drawn up a budget of $889\nmillion for the 2016 election cycle.\n\n\n\nBut we discuss the damage being done to Chris Christie\xe2\x80\x99s presidential\ndreams by the defection of potential donors without digressing to\nunderscore the perversity of a small circle of people having so much\nconsequence.\n\n\n\nWe report, as we did in January, on how well or poorly Rand Paul, Marco\nRubio and Ted Cruz performed when they spoke at a gathering put together by\nthe Kochs in Southern California. But we don\xe2\x80\x99t flag the oddity of these\nauditions, the chilling bizarreness of the way the road to the White House\nwinds not only through the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary but\nalso through plutocrats\xe2\x80\x99 posh retreats.\n\n\n\nAn astonishing bounty of the comments and developments that make headlines\nemanate from the arena of fund-raising. We learned that Mitt Romney might\nenter the 2016 race because he was telling donors as much, and we learned\nthat he had decided otherwise because he was letting donors know. In\nneither instance did we take sufficient note of that.\n\n\n\nWe articulate misgivings about how much of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s or Bush\xe2\x80\x99s thinking may\nbe rooted in the past. But the bigger issue, given the scope of not just\ntheir own political histories but also their relatives\xe2\x80\x99, is how heavy a\nduffel of i.o.u.s each of them would carry into office.\n\n\n\nTheir prominence is commensurate with their debts. And only so many of\nthose can be forgotten.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Washington Post: The making of Hillary 5.0: Marketing wizards help\nre-imagine Clinton brand\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-making-of-hillary-50-marketing-wizards-help-reimagine-clinton-brand/2015/02/21/bfb01120-b919-11e4-aa05-1ce812b3fdd2_story.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Philip Rucker and Anne Gearan\n\nFebruary 21, 2015 6:18 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nIs Hillary Rodham Clinton a McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s Big Mac or a Chipotle burrito bowl?\nA can of Bud or a bottle of Blue Moon? JCPenney or J. Crew?\n\n\n\nAs she readies her second presidential campaign, Clinton has recruited\nconsumer marketing specialists onto her team of trusted political advisers.\nTheir job is to help imagine Hillary 5.0 \xe2\x80\x94 the rebranding of a first lady\nturned senator turned failed presidential candidate turned secretary of\nstate turned likely 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n\n\nClinton and her image-makers are sketching ways to refresh the\nwell-established brand for tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s marketplace. In their mission to\npresent voters with a winning picture of the likely candidate, no detail is\ntoo big or too small \xe2\x80\x94 from her economic opportunity agenda to the design\nof the \xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x9d in her future campaign logo.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the same as selling an iPhone or a soft drink or a cereal,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Peter Sealey, a longtime corporate marketing strategist. \xe2\x80\x9cShe needs to\nuse everything a brand has: a dominant color, a logo, a symbol. . . . The\nsymbol of a Mercedes is a three-pointed star. The symbol of Coca-Cola is\nthe contour bottle. The symbol of McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s is the golden arches. What is\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s symbol?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s challenge is unique. Unlike potential Republican challengers of\nrelatively middling fame who are introducing themselves to a national\naudience for the first time, Clinton is almost universally recognized. Love\nher or loathe her, potential voters know who she is after more than two\ndecades in public life.\n\n\n\nOr they think they know.\n\n\n\nAs Clinton and her advisers conceptualize her 2016 image, her own history\nshows the potential for peril.\n\n\n\nIn politics, authenticity can be a powerful trait, and it is one that\nsometimes has escaped Clinton. In her 2008 presidential campaign, despite\nsome raw displays of emotion, she often came across as overly programmed.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, a challenge for Clinton will be adapting to the political moment\nwith a fresh image while remaining true to her settled identity. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at\nBudweiser,\xe2\x80\x9d said a former campaign adviser to President Obama, who spoke on\nthe condition of anonymity to talk candidly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what Hillary Clinton\nis. She\xe2\x80\x99s not a microbrew. She\xe2\x80\x99s one of the biggest, most powerful brands\never in the country, and recognizing that is important.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAhead of her campaign launch, Clinton has tapped some of the Democratic\nParty\xe2\x80\x99s star strategists as well as two of corporate America\xe2\x80\x99s branding\nwizards: Wendy Clark, who specializes in marketing age-old brands such as\nCoca-Cola to younger and more diverse customers; and Roy Spence, a\n\xc2\xaddecades-long Clinton friend who dreamed up the \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Mess With Texas\xe2\x80\x9d\nanti-littering slogan as well as flashy ad campaigns for Southwest Airlines\nand Wal-Mart.\n\n\n\nClark took an unpaid leave in January from Coca-Cola, where she ispresident\nof brands and strategic marketing for carbon\xc2\xadated beverages in North\nAmerica, to help Clinton in what Clark called \xe2\x80\x9ca passion project.\xe2\x80\x9d Spence\nis co-founder and chairman of GSD&M, an Austin-based corporate ad firm, and\nhas experience in politics, including with Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 campaign.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s words suggest that her 2016 campaign will stress economic\nfairness \xe2\x80\x94 the level playing field for the middle class implied by her\nTwitter message last month praising Obama\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we need to step up & deliver for the middle class. #FairShot\n#FairShare,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton wrote.\n\n\n\nBut the plans for Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s rebranding are not yet clear, nor are the\ninfluences of the Madison Avenue sensibility Clark and Spence bring to her\noperation.\n\n\n\nClinton spokesman Nick Merrill declined to comment on the branding strategy\nor the specific work of Clark and Spence.\n\n\n\nPeople familiar with Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s preparations said Clark and \xc2\xadSpence are\nfocused on developing imaginative ways to \xe2\x80\x9clet Hillary be Hillary,\xe2\x80\x9d as one\nperson said, and help her make emotional connections with voters.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just want America to know the Hillary Clinton I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jerry\nCrawford, a friend and the Iowa chairman of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nwant as many people as possible to get to know the woman I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen behind\nclosed doors. She\xe2\x80\x99s bright, disciplined, quick to throw her head back and\nlaugh \xe2\x80\x94 just a very, very attractive person.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSpence, who got to know Bill and Hillary Clinton when they worked in Texas\non George McGovern\xe2\x80\x99s 1972 presidential campaign, tried to steer Clinton out\nof a rough patch in 2008 after her early losses to Obama. He is credited\nwith her provocative \xe2\x80\x9c3 a.m. phone call\xe2\x80\x9d ad but also with soft-focus\ninitiatives to reveal what he called \xe2\x80\x9cHillary\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMark McKinnon, a friend and competitor of Spence and a media strategist\nwith George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaigns, said: \xe2\x80\x9cSpence and Clark have\na lot of experience refreshing established, well-known brands like AT&T,\nCoca-Cola and Wal-Mart. Should come in handy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSpence and Clark have been credited with creating three-dimensional\npersonalities around otherwise dull consumer brands. At Coca-Cola, Clark\nspearheaded the \xe2\x80\x9cShare a Coke\xe2\x80\x9d campaign to put names such as Brittany and\nZach on soda cans, a marketing move that boosted sales among millennials.\nSpence helped \xc2\xadDoubleTree Hotels make the freshly baked chocolate chip\ncookies the chain serves guests upon check-in an icon for its sales pitch\nof warm comfort for beleaguered travelers.\n\n\n\nBut Fred Davis, a Republican advertising guru, said that if Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nrebranding \xe2\x80\x9cseems like a craven attempt to try to put fresh paint on an old\nhouse, then it will backfire.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think most voters are actually pretty intelligent, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll see\nthrough any blatant attempt to change,\xe2\x80\x9d Davis said. \xe2\x80\x9cHer only hope, to me,\nis not a rebranding, but it\xe2\x80\x99s actual policy positions and ideas that are\nfresh and new \xe2\x80\x94 and because those are fresh and new, voters might think,\n\xe2\x80\x98Wait a minute, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give her another chance.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSome Clinton allies agreed. They dismissed the suggestion that refreshing\nher brand alone will make the candidate seem current. They said Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nparamount challenge is to answer two questions: why she is the right person\nto step into the Oval Office, and what she would do when she\xe2\x80\x99s there. If\nshe does that, they said, her image will take care of itself.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think people are looking for someone who\xe2\x80\x99s being reinvented or\nrebranded,\xe2\x80\x9d said Steve Elmendorf, a top Democratic lobbyist who was a\nstrategist for Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 bid and other presidential campaigns. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\nis somebody they know, whom they have confidence in, and the question is,\ncan she lead us to a better place over the next four years? That\xe2\x80\x99s her\nbiggest challenge. What are the new ideas? . . . It can\xe2\x80\x99t be yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s\nprogram.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSealey, who is credited with the successful \xe2\x80\x9cAlways Coca-Cola\xe2\x80\x9d campaign in\nthe 1990s, said that Clinton, like Coke, \xe2\x80\x9chas incredible top-of-mind\nawareness, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge asset.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe issue is: What is her promise?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWith Mercedes, it\xe2\x80\x99s quality.\nWith Volvo, it\xe2\x80\x99s safety. With Coca-Cola, it\xe2\x80\x99s refreshment. If you can get\nher promise down to one word, that\xe2\x80\x99s the key.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSpence\xe2\x80\x99s business partner, Haley Rushing, said their approach to all\nclients, corporate and political, \xe2\x80\x9cstarts with them at the center,\xe2\x80\x9d rather\nthan market trends. \xe2\x80\x9cWe always start from the inside out, not the outside\nin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nRushing and Spence \xc2\xadco-founded the Purpose Institute, where Rushing\xe2\x80\x99s title\nis \xe2\x80\x9cchief purposeologist\xe2\x80\x9d and the staffers act as \xe2\x80\x9corganizational\ntherapists\xe2\x80\x9d uncovering the central purposes of their client organizations.\nRushing said she is not working on the Clinton effort but that she\nenvisions a Clinton brand built around years of experience. She said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything emanates from, \xe2\x80\x98What is Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s purpose in the world?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton has faced that question before, with mixed results.\n\n\n\nAfter a complicated tenure as first lady, Clinton reinvented herself as a\npotholes-and-pork senator from her adopted state of New York. Then she ran\nfor president as a tough woman in the mold of Margaret Thatcher. Failing\nthat, she had a careful run as the country\xe2\x80\x99s top diplomat under Obama that\nallies believe raised her stature.\n\n\n\nPerhaps her most significant rebranding came in 2000, when she became a\npopular elected official in her own right after her husband\xe2\x80\x99s Monica\nLewinsky scandal and after a controversial tenure as first lady. Clinton\nwas ridiculed as a dilettante and a carpetbagger, but she won over critics,\neven some Republicans, with a dogged commitment to local issues.\n\n\n\nIn 2008, however, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s rebranding went badly, starting with a\nmisreading of the zeitgeist that had her stressing her \xc2\xadcommander-in-chief\nqualifications when the public preferred Obama\xe2\x80\x99s promise of hope and change.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s advisers were divided then about how to bust the caricature of\nClinton as remote and brittle. Some begged Clinton to reprise a campaign\nfeature that had charmed New York voters, in which she stayed in ordinary\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s homes while traveling around the state. But Clinton insisted that\ndoing so in Iowa or New Hampshire would come across as forced.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, an online compilation of testimonials meant to showcase\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s humanity and relatability fell flat. Too cheesy, some advisers\nsaid; at odds with her strength-and-competence message, others said.\n\n\n\nA rebranding that stuck: Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s workmanlike turn as secretary of state,\nduring which she visited more countries than most of her predecessors \xe2\x80\x94 and\nused her celebrity to draw attention to women\xe2\x80\x99s empowerment and human\nrights issues.\n\n\n\nNow, Clinton will try to refresh her image once more so that voters see her\nas a champion for the middle class amid deep concerns about income\ninequality. Rohit Deshpande, a marketing professor at Harvard Business\nSchool, offered a fast-food giant as a case study.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRefresh with the times is the issue McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s is facing right now,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s considered tired, and the marketplace has moved on. \xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFabian Geyrhalter, a corporate branding consultant, also drew a parallel\nbetween McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s and Clinton: \xe2\x80\x9cThere has been a brand value proposition\nover so many years, and suddenly she needs to shift that legacy into\nClinton 2016: \xe2\x80\x98This is what I stand for now.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Associated Press: For Clinton, her family foundation may pose campaign\nrisks\n<http://news.yahoo.com/clinton-her-family-foundation-may-pose-campaign-risks-125132967--election.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Ken Thomas\n\nFebruary 22, 2015 12:10 p.m. EST\n\n\n\nThe foundation launched by former President Bill Clinton more than a decade\nago has battled HIV and AIDS in Africa, educated millions of children and\nfed the poor and hungry around the globe. It also has the potential to\nbecome a political risk for Hillary Rodham Clinton as she moves toward a\nsecond presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nThe former secretary of state has struggled with some recent bad headlines\nover large donations given to the foundation by foreign governments in the\npast two years, and the $200 million-plus the organization has raised since\n2013, ahead of her anticipated White House campaign.\n\n\n\nRepublicans contend that foreign governments donating to a foundation led\nby a potential U.S. president creates unacceptable conflicts of interests.\nAlso, the involvement of big money reinforces a long-standing narrative\npushed by the GOP of the Clintons as a couple who frequently mix business\nand politics.\n\n\n\n"Unless Hillary Clinton immediately reinstates the ban on foreign countries\ngiving to her foundation and returns the millions of dollars these\ngovernments have already donated, she\'s setting an incredibly dangerous\nprecedent," said the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince\nPriebus. "The American people are not about to elect a president in Hillary\nClinton who could expose them to the demands of foreign governments because\nthey dumped massive sums of cash into her foundation."\n\n\n\nThe foundation, which is scheduled to hold events in Morocco and Greece\nthis spring, defended its financial support and addressed how it might\nfunction if Clinton runs for president. If she seeks office again,\nsomething taken as a given by most, the foundation said it would ensure its\npolicies and practices are "appropriate, just as we did when she served as\nsecretary of state."\n\n\n\nIn 2009, when Clinton became President Barack Obama\'s chief diplomat, the\nfoundation stopped raising money from foreign governments. The fundraising\ninvolving non-U.S. entities resumed in 2013, after she left the his\nadministration.\n\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal last week reported the foundation had received\nmoney in 2014 from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman and others.\nThe Washington Post reported the charity has raised nearly $2 billion since\nthe former president started it in 2001. About one-third of its donations\nof $1 million or more come from foreign governments or non-U.S. entities,\nthe newspaper found.\n\n\n\nDemocrats say the Clintons can defend their work at the foundation because\nof its track record and history of tackling some of the world\'s biggest\nproblems, from AIDS and clean water to hunger, educational opportunities\nand the protection of endangered wildlife.\n\n\n\nThey also note that the foundation voluntarily discloses its donors \xe2\x80\x94\nnonprofits are not required to do \xe2\x80\x94 and say there is no evidence the\nClintons have used it to enrich themselves. Nearly 90 percent of the\nfoundation\'s money goes toward its programming.\n\n\n\n"The foundation has done amazing work," said Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy, a\nDemocrat who campaigned with Bill Clinton last year. "It has been a\nunifying force in our national affairs and in our international affairs."\n\n\n\nYet the influx of corporate and foreign money just before a potential\nHillary Clinton campaign has caused some anxiety within her party.\n\n\n\n"There was a reason they stopped taking foreign government donations when\nHillary was secretary of state," said Mike Carberry, a Johnson County,\nIowa, supervisor and former county Democratic chairman. He said the\nfoundation should reinstate the policies used from 2009 to 2013. "It\ndoesn\'t seem right."\n\n\n\nThe foundation has strong ties with several corporations and other large\nfoundations. Last September\'s annual meeting in New York was sponsored by\nan array of companies that regularly lobby the federal government,\nincluding financial firms HSBC Bank USA, Barclays and Deutsche Bank, as\nwell as Fortune 500 companies such as Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Monsanto,\nProcter & Gamble and ExxonMobil.\n\n\n\nGoldman Sachs, whose corporate officers have played leading roles in the\nTreasury Department in recent years, has worked with the Clinton Foundation\non the 10,000 Women Initiative aimed at helping female entrepreneurs around\nthe globe access capital.\n\n\n\nMany of the same donors to the Clintons\' political campaigns have given\nmoney to the foundation. Dennis Cheng, a former Hillary Clinton campaign\nfundraiser, recently left the foundation as its chief development officer\nand is expected to be a top fundraiser for her expected campaign.\n\n\n\nThe examination of the foundation\'s finances come as many Democrats want\nClinton to take on a more populist economic agenda that would demand more\noversight of Wall Street firms. It also follows efforts by Democrats to\nscrutinize Republican Mitt Romney\'s business practices in 2012 and tie\nRepublican candidates to millions of dollars provided by the Koch Brothers\nand their business interests.\n\n\n\nBeyond the headlines, many Democrats say it shows the need for Clinton to\nbegin actively campaigning and build an apparatus better suited to rapidly\nrespond to these types of critiques.\n\n\n\n"There\'s a vacuum," said Tom Henderson, the chairman of the Polk County,\nIowa, Democrats, who noted potential candidates such as former Maryland\nGov. Martin O\'Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb are visiting soon.\n"She isn\'t doing anything" in Iowa, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sec.
