Among them, Clinton led Bernie Sanders 86 percent to 14 percent, according to the exits. For context, the first black president beat Clinton 78 percent to 19 percent among South Carolina blacks during their face off.\n\nIt is sweet vindication for Hillary. She lost South Carolina to Obama by 29 points in 2008 and beat Sanders there yesterday by 47.5 points (with 100 percent of precincts now reporting). Then-Senator Obama\xe2\x80\x99s victory in the Palmetto state gave him the advantage among pledged delegates. While the race dragged on for five more months, and she won big states at big moments, he would never again trail in the pledged delegate count.\n\nDonella Wilson, who is\xc2\xa0106,\xc2\xa0voted for Hillary because she loves the idea of seeing the first black president and the first woman president in her lifetime:\n\n<http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6193350.382689/aHR0cDovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vdmlkZW8vcG9saXRpY3MvMTA2LXllYXItb2xkLXNjLXZvdGVyLWNhc3RzLWJhbGxvdC1mb3ItY2xpbnRvbi8yMDE2LzAyLzI3LzkxMWZkZGU4LWRkYWEtMTFlNS04MjEwLWYwYmQ4ZGU5MTVmNl92aWRlby5odG1sP3dwbW09MSZ3cGlzcmM9bmxfZGFpbHkyMDI/5483d5bc3b35d0d76d8c549cC4cf96809>\n\n106-year-old S.C. voter casts ballot for Clinton\n\n-- White liberals do not a winning coalition make: Hillary will very likely win all the states with large black or brown populations. Bernie will win a bunch, but by no means all, of the states that are overwhelmingly white. (Hillary actually carried whites 54-46 in the South Carolina). Game it out, and factor in the establishment-minded super delegates, and Clinton now appears virtually certain to become the Democratic nominee.\n\n-- Non-white voters will account for more than 40 percent of Democrats who vote in the 11 contests on Tuesday.\nBlack voters could be determinative in six Southern states that day: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. (It\xe2\x80\x99s not like South Carolina was an outlier: she won black voters by 54 points in the Nevada caucuses.)   Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 strategists thinks he can win in five of the 11 states that vote Tuesday: Minnesota, Massachusetts, Vermont, Oklahoma and Colorado. Minorities will make up a relatively small percentage of the electorate in all but one of them.   Texas, the biggest delegate prize <http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6193350.382689/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL2dyYXBoaWNzL3BvbGl0aWNzLzIwMTYtZWxlY3Rpb24vcHJpbWFyaWVzL3N1cGVyLXR1ZXNkYXktcHJldmlldy9kZW1vY3JhdGljLz93cG1tPTEmd3Bpc3JjPW5sX2RhaWx5MjAy/5483d5bc3b35d0d76d8c549cCf943dabf> on Tuesday, will be a telling window into how much traction Sanders has gotten among Hispanic voters. His campaign is adamant that they won Latinos in Nevada last weekend; the Clinton team is just as adamant that the entrance polls were wrong. Texas, where Clinton beat Obama 51-47 in 2008, will tell us who is right.\n-- Noting the aforementioned\xc2\xa0dynamics,\xc2\xa0many pundits basically began calling the race for Clinton last night:\n\n<http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6193350.382689/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9kYW5wZmVpZmZlci9zdGF0dXMvNzAzNzM3MzY1ODc4MDM0NDMyP3dwbW09MSZ3cGlzcmM9bmxfZGFpbHkyMDI/5483d5bc3b35d0d76d8c549cCef45d812>\n\nThe host of "Meet the Press" called Clinton\'s numbers "astonishing" and "Obama-esque":\n\n<http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6193350.382689/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9jaHVja3RvZGQvc3RhdHVzLzcwMzczNjc0MzYyNzk4ODk5ND93cG1tPTEmd3Bpc3JjPW5sX2RhaWx5MjAy/5483d5bc3b35d0d76d8c549cC7d1c4bb7>\n\n<http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6193350.382689/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9OYXRlU2lsdmVyNTM4L3N0YXR1cy83MDM3MTA4NTI4NzcyNTg3NTI_d3BtbT0xJndwaXNyYz1ubF9kYWlseTIwMg/5483d5bc3b35d0d76d8c549cC07332178>\n\n<http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6193350.382689/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9yaWNra2xlaW4vc3RhdHVzLzcwMzc0MTQ0NDE4NDU0NzMyOD93cG1tPTEmd3Bpc3JjPW5sX2RhaWx5MjAy/5483d5bc3b35d0d76d8c549cC350b1f40>\n\n<http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6193350.382689/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9hbm5pZWthcm5pL3N0YXR1cy83MDM3NDk2MTMxNDEwMjg4NjQ_d3BtbT0xJndwaXNyYz1ubF9kYWlseTIwMg/5483d5bc3b35d0d76d8c549cCf53b1705>\n\n-- Sanders may have spent relatively little time on the ground over the past week, but his campaign invested quite heavily <http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6193350.382689/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL2hpbGxhcnktY2xpbnRvbi1lYXNpbHktZGVmZWF0cy1iZXJuaWUtc2FuZGVycy1pbi1zb3V0aC1jYXJvbGluYS1wcmltYXJ5LzIwMTYvMDIvMjcvNmU5Nzg3ZmUtZGQxOC0xMWU1LTg5MWEtNGVkMDRmNDIxM2U4X3N0b3J5Lmh0bWw_d3BtbT0xJndwaXNyYz1ubF9kYWlseTIwMg/5483d5bc3b35d0d76d8c549cCf96e28f6> in the Palmetto State: He had about 200 field staffers, opened 11 offices and spent $1.7 million on TV and radio ads. His team hoped to exceed low expectations; instead, they underperformed them. They will not be able to put these kinds of resources into any of the upcoming states.\n\n-- Hillary anchoring herself to the president is paying dividends: Seven in 10 South Carolina Democratic voters said they want the next president to continue Obama\xe2\x80\x99s policies, rather than pursue a more liberal agenda. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of progress in the last eight years, and Hillary is the best person out there to continue the progress,\xe2\x80\x9d Al Tucker, a 67-year-old African American, told one of my colleagues in Columbia.\xc2\xa0The Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s Molly Ball <http://link.washingtonpost.com/click/6193350.382689/aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aGVhdGxhbnRpYy5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvYXJjaGl2ZS8yMDE2LzAyL2NsaW50b24tc291dGgtY2Fyb2xpbmEvNDcxMjc2Lz93cG1tPTEmd3Bpc3JjPW5sX2RhaWx5MjAy/5483d5bc3b35d0d76d8c549cCd90f16c1>, who spoke with dozens of voters around South Carolina over the past week, argues that \xe2\x80\x9ca sense of familiarity\xe2\x80\x9d was another key factor that drove African Americans to Clinton. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99d heard of Sanders and heard his ads, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel they knew him personally,\xe2\x80\x9d she relays.\n\n-- The youth vote did not come through for Sanders this time. Clinton actually won black voters under 45 by a three-to-one margin, and there were not that many white voters under 45. Voters under 30 made up a smaller share of the electorate in South Carolina (about one-sixth) than any of the first three states. \xc2\xa0\n\n-- South Carolina Democrats were less liberal than their counterparts in Iowa, New Hampshire or Nevada. Only 23 percent described themselves as \xe2\x80\x9cvery liberal.\xe2\x80\x9d And while Sanders won this group by double digits in the first two contests, Clinton it in South Carolina by 40 points.\n\n-- \xe2\x80\x9cHillary crushed Bernie among voters who agree that our economic system favors the wealthy.

When I was in Little Rock, I interviewed his Arkansas state director, Sarah Scanlon, about their organizing efforts in Clinton Country. They have two offices in the state, and volunteers have made hundreds of thousands of phone calls. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have people who have been with the Clintons since Day One and always be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Scanlon, who recalled volunteering for Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s gubernatorial campaigns. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then you have people who are galvanized by Sen. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 message.\xe2\x80\x9d She argued that the delegate allocation rules, which are based on congressional districts, work to their advantage because Sanders is strong in rural areas and on campuses. \xe2\x80\x9cThree quarters of the people we\xe2\x80\x99re working with have never been engaged before,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. That night, musician Stephen Bishop appeared as a Sanders surrogate at a dinner put on by the Arkansas Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s Black Caucus.\n\n-- The latest gender gap: Sanders won white men 56-44. Clinton won white women 60-40, per the exit polling.\n\nSome of the many women at Hillary\'s party\xc2\xa0in Columbia last night.\xc2\xa0(Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\n-- Last night Hillary, slightly hoarse, signaled that she\xe2\x80\x99s eager to shift her focus from Sanders to Donald Trump.
