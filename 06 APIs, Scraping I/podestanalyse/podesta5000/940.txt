No worries on the dash. Hope we made it mildly easier for you.\r\n\r\nHannah very happy with her race and pleased as punch to have been able to run. She ran the whole way with her dad, Paul.\r\n\r\nJimmy beat me by a minute or so. I finished at around 85 minutes, so God willing it was lower than that and I beat you! Anna and ian came in a couple minutes behind us.\r\n\r\nIn all, a terrific morning and a fun race.\r\n\r\nGood luck up there.\r\n\r\nDM\r\n\r\nFrom: John Podesta [mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com<javascript:_e(%7B%7D,'cvml','john.podesta@gmail.com');>]\r\nSent: Sunday, October 11, 2015 10:53 AM\r\nTo: DMCOS\r\nSubject: Re: Make your flight?\r\n\r\nOn the plane. Sorry I had to dash. Fun to go down with the clan. I ended up with a good time. 1:24:35.  Everybody in your crew do ok? Your niece have a good race? She was worried about the distance.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, October 11, 2015, DMCOS <DMCOS@who.eop.gov<javascript:_e(%7B%7D,'cvml','DMCOS@who.eop.gov');>> wrote:\r\n"
