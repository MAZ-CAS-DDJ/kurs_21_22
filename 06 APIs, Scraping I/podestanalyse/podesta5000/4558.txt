Presidents \nCarter, Bush 41, Clinton, Bush 43 and Obama will speak.  Big shing dings.\n\n\nThe Civil Rights topics include "Heroes of the Civil Rights Movement" and \n"LBJ and MLK Fulfilling a Promise, Realizing a Dream."  Pretty heady - no?\n\n\nBut the focus is not only race. Other civil rights topics include: "Women: \nHow High is the Glass Ceiling?"; "Gay Marriage: A Civil Right?"; "Pathway \nto the American Dream: Immigration Policy in the 21st Century;" and \n"Education: the Ultimate Civil Right."  No dispute with those groups and \nissues.\n\n\nAlso, we should not forget "Sports: Leveling the Playing Field" and "Music \nand Social Consciousness."  No idea how they squeezed in.\n\n\nIs something missing?  Waldo?\n\n\nYes, NOTHING about disability.  Let\'s be clear.  Disability is NOT \nconsidered a disability on civil rights par with race, gender, gay \nmarriage, or immigration.  Forget the ADA\'s 25 anniversary in 2015.  Will \nthese Presidents attend?  Will the LBJ Foundation arrange for Sports for \nthe disabled - oh, fear not, the national TV networks will cover it.\n\n\nUnreal?  Outrageous?  Depressing?\n\nMaybe the organizers thought Austin is too far for Lex Frieden to travel \nfrom Houston.  After all, Lex was at the ADA\'s signing with the President \nin 1990, as was Justin Dart, another Texan.  Probably too far for Bob \nKafka and Stephanie Thomas, two leading ADAPT organizers, to drive across \nI-30 from the east side of Austin.  That\'s probably why no person with a \ndisability was not invited to be a speaker.\n\n\nIs it really believable that the organizers of the LBJ Library did not \nthink about disability?  No way, since Texas ADAPT is in the face of the \nlegislature and city officials all the time. The Texas press covers it.\n\n\nHow about something simpler?  In the organizers\' minds, disability is not \na civil right worthy of being, and not in fact, on par with race, gender, \nimmigration, or sexual orientation.  Disability is not as important or \npowerful as the other civil rights.\n\n\nAs depressing as those thoughts may be, why have our "national disability \nleaders" been so publicly quiet? Why haven\'t they publicly demanded the \nsame respect as people with disabilities and the disability movement gives \nother civil rights groups?  Can you imagine how John Lewis, Julian Bond, \nAndrew Young would have publicly reacted if they were as dissed as \ndisability leaders have been?\n\n\nOh well, maybe a pat on the head is all we deserve. Hmmmmmmm.\n\n\nPower concedes nothing without a struggle. Where is the disability POWER?\n\n\nSteve Gold, The Disability Odyssey continues\n\n\n\n\nBack issues of other Information Bulletins posted after 10/2013 can be\nfound only at http://stevegoldada.blogspot.com/\n\nInformation Bulletins before 10/13 are available online at\nhttp://www.stevegoldada.com with a searchable Archive at this site divided\ninto different subjects.\n\nTo contact Steve Gold directly, write to\nstevegoldada1@gmail.com<stevegoldada@cs.com>or call 215-627-7100.
