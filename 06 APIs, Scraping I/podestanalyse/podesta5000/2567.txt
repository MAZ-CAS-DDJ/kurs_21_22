Clinton also beat out\nall of her theoretical Republican challengers in a more recent\nMcClatchy-Marist poll. More than 80 percent of Democrats would be either\n"excited" or "satisfied" with a Clinton run for president, according to a\nCNN/ORC poll.\n\n\n\nIn fact, at the end of 2013, Gallup found Clinton was the "most admired\nwoman" in America -- for the twelfth consecutive year. (Oprah Winfrey came\nin second, by a wide margin.)\n\n\n\nBut Ball\'s September 19 article largely ignored Clinton\'s widespread\npopularity to instead claim that there is widespread fatigue with the\nformer secretary of state. Ball\'s argument centers around the idea that\nClinton is not producing enough "spark" or "vision," and criticized her for\nagreeing with a "laundry list of well-worn leftish ideas" discussed at a\nrecent event at the Center for American Progress, "from raising the minimum\nwage to paid family leave and affordable childcare":\n\n\n\nGranted, these are substantive proposals, and they are controversial in\nsome quarters. But they are broadly popular, and the overall message--that\nwomen ought to prosper--is almost impossible to disagree with. The\ndiscussion\'s only spark came from Kirsten Gillibrand, the senator from New\nYork, who made a rousing call to action. "I think we need a Rosie the\nRiveter moment for this generation!"\n\n\n\nSo Clinton supports popular, substantive proposals that many can agree on\n-- ideas that have been stymied by a recalcitrant Republican Congress --\nand this is a problem, because Ball isn\'t entertained?\n\n\n\nRecently NBC\'s Chuck Todd discussed "one thing" he thinks Washington media\ngets wrong: this idea of "Clinton fatigue." "There is a Clinton fatigue\nproblem," Todd noted, "but it\'s in the press corps. I think there is much\nless Clinton fatigue in the Democratic Party than there is in the press\ncorps."\n\n\n\nThe excitement for Clinton -- and her own "well-worn leftish ideas" --\namong Democrats was apparent at another of Clinton\'s appearances this week,\nthe September 19 Women\'s Leadership Forum, hosted by the Democratic\nNational Committee. Clinton received a standing ovation before and after\nher speech, and her support for policies such as paid sick leave, equal pay\nfor equal work, affordable childcare, and a living wage received cheers and\napplause.\n\n\n\nA majority of Americans, both Republicans and Democrats, support raising\nthe minimum wage and mandating paid sick leave. These ideas that seem tired\nto Ball are specific policy proposals that Americans want. It would\ncertainly be more interesting for journalists if Clinton decided to support\nwildly unpopular new proposals, but it\'s unclear why any politician\'s\npriority should be entertaining reporters rather than promoting policies\nthey think will help the country.\n\n\n\nOf course, this is a perfect example of what Media Matters has previously\ntermed the "Goldilocks approach to campaign journalism." When Clinton bores\njournalists by repeating a popular and substantive platform, she gets\ncriticized, but if she did do something surprising or new, the press will\npounce on her for that as well.\n\n\n\nA press corps that is constantly looking for a new angle to parse, whether\nit\'s Clinton\'s charm, or body language, or clothing, is going to be bored\nwhen there\'s nothing to say and overly-eager to twist controversy out of\nanything that seems new.\n\n\n\nAnd a media that is quick to attribute its own personal fatigue to the rest\nof the nation is going to miss out on the real story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Hill opinion: Basil A. Smikle Jr.: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton\'s commitment to\ncivil rights\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/civil-rights/218382-hillary-clintons-commitment-to-civil-rights>*\n\n\n\nBy Basil A. Smikle Jr.\n\nSeptember 20, 2014, 6:00 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nOn a subfreezing morning in January 2003, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton\n(D-N.Y.) walked to the pulpit of Trinity Baptist Church\'s Martin Luther\nKing Day celebration in the Bronx to make a startlingly rousing speech to\ntheir predominantly African-American congregation. Typically, such speeches\nare principally aspirational \xe2\x80\x94 they acknowledge that society has largely\nrebuked racial discrimination\'s ugly past but urge steadfastness in\ntackling challenges that lay ahead. But it was Clinton\'s stirring\nrepudiation of Trent Lott, then the Republican Senate Majority Leader from\nMississippi who a month earlier praised Strom Thurman\'s 1948\npro-segregation presidential campaign, that enthused the audience. Her\nremarks suggested changes in leadership alone will not eradicate racism and\ndiscrimination but the rigidity of the pathways to political and economic\nenfranchisement must acquiesce to the strength inherent in this country\'s\ndiversity.\n\n\n\nShe echoed these themes in two important appearances this week at the Legal\nAid Corporation\'s 40th anniversary and a panel on women\'s economic security\nat the Center for American Progress. By delving into Clinton\'s\nunderstanding of both the egalitarian principals of the civil rights\nmovement and the need to confront the challenges of systemic inequality, we\nshould be able to forestall skepticism about her social justice agenda.\n\n\nBack at Trinity Baptist Church, Clinton focused attention on the pernicious\nbehavior of those looking to reduce the rights of individuals seeking to\nparticipate in the electoral process. Such concerns have not been\ncompletely eradicated and comments during another round of these tactics\nseveral years ago seemed to heighten her resolve: "We know that there are\nstill those who do not want every American to vote, and want to make it\nvery difficult for every American to vote. ... The more things change, the\nmore things stay the same. ... There are many insidious efforts under way\nto intimidate voters, to make it difficult for voters to actually appear at\nthe ballot box and vote."\n\n\n\nWhile in the Senate, she introduced the Count Every Vote Act of 2007 to\ncombat a "history of intimidation." Fighting against voter ID laws, Clinton\nsaid that "By trying to require not just photo identification but proof of\ncitizenship \xe2\x80\x94 proof that thousands of American citizens can\'t produce\nthrough no fault of their own \xe2\x80\x94 cynical Republican lawmakers are trying to\nbuild new walls between hundreds of thousands of eligible senior, minority,\nand low-income Americans and their civil right to choose their own leaders.\nRepublicans claim that these requirements are needed to prevent fraud, but\nthe reality is that they do little more than disenfranchise eligible\nvoters."\n\n\n\nIn an interesting juxtaposition with Trent Lott\'s incendiary comments,\nClinton, a few months earlier, stood with the widow of Supreme Court\nJustice Thurgood Marshall at a podium alongside former Detroit Mayor Dennis\nArcher, who was being sworn in as the first African-American President of\nthe American Bar Association in its 124-year history \xe2\x80\x93 60 years after they\nlifted a ban on black members. Her appearance this week at the Legal\nServices Corporation and her board chairmanship of that organization in the\nearly 1970s reaffirmed a longstanding commitment to support low-income\ncommunities and people of color in the courtroom and at the highest levels\nof legal advocacy.\n\n\n\nBack in 2007, speaking of the Jena 6 in Louisiana, Clinton said, "I am\ndeeply concerned about reports of potentially disparate treatment of white\nyouths and African-American youths in the criminal justice system. ... And\nI have long been troubled by a history of disparate treatment of African\nAmericans in our criminal justice system." And regarding the unrest in\nFerguson, Mo., her remarks to a mostly white audience were considered some\nof the most substantive: "Imagine what we would feel, what we would do if\nwhite drivers were three times as likely to be searched by police during a\ntraffic stop as black drivers."\n\n\n\nWhile those statements are often in response to highly publicized events,\nother advocacy work may have been less known but correspondingly\ntransformative. Considering the importance of pathways to opportunity for\nyoung people and the deleterious effects of the school-to-prison pipeline,\nClinton worked with community leaders in New York affiliated with the\norganization 100 Black Men to open an all-boys single sex school in the\nSouth Bronx. Teaching predominantly black and Latino young men, David\nBanks, the founding principal, sees his mission as "empowering at risk\ninner-city young men to become academic achievers, engaged citizens and\nresponsible men." Eagle, now with six high schools in New York City and\nNewark, N.J., has graduation rate of over 95 percent.\n\n\n\nWhether pushing for race to be considered in higher education admissions\npolicies or fighting against the use of race-neutral "percentage plans" in\nfederal affirmative action proposals, there are aspects to Hillary\nClinton\'s activism that exist across multiple policy and political venues\nas well as at the community level. Experience and broad relationships help\ndilate corridors to equal opportunity and social justice, which should\nallay the fears of understandably restive voters concerned about the impact\nof 2014\'s elections and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Washington Post blog: The Fix: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton is pretty close to having\na great campaign stump speech\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/09/19/hillary-clinton-is-pretty-close-to-having-a-great-campaign-stump-speech/>*\n\n\n\nBy Nia-Malika Henderson\n\nSeptember 19, 2014, 2:32 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nWondering when Hillary Clinton might hit the campaign trail to campaign for\nembattled Democrats? Well, after her speech at the Democratic National\nCommittee\'s Women\'s Leadership forum event Friday, she might not have to.\nDuring a 20-minute speech, she name-dropped Mary Burke, Wendy Davis, Alison\nLundergan Grimes, Staci Appel, Martha Coakley and Maggie Haasan -- to name\njust a few.\n\n\n\nShe went on at length about Burke, who is running against Gov. Scott Walker\n(R),  saying that "she is offering a choice between more angry gridlock and\nprogress that will actually make a difference for Wisconsin families.\nBetter wages, better jobs, better schools."\n\n\n\nClinton\'s speech, and particularly the passage above, is significant not\njust for what it means for Burke -- we\'re sure Burke\'s consultants are\nalready cutting a Clinton ad -- and other female candidates, but for what\nit reveals about what might be a key argument for a Clinton presidency when\n(oops, if) she runs in 2016.\n\n\n\n"When women participate in politics, the effects ripple out far and wide.\nWeren\'t you proud when a coalition of women senators broke the logjam\nduring last year\'s government shutdown?" she said. She then quoted Sen.\nPatty Murray (D-Wash.), who told her that politics comes down to compromise\nand building relationships: "You work together and you get the best outcome\nthat you can."\n\n\n\nIn talking to pollsters who hold focus groups and try to get at how voters\nview women candidates, they say that often voters tend to look at women as\nbetter at compromising and at bringing people together. Yes, it\'s a bit of\nstereotype: Woman as kumbaya nurturer. And, most candidates who run for\nnational office, male or female, tend to focus on "bringing people\ntogether."\n\n\n\nBut it could also be that voters might believe women candidates a bit more\nwhen they say it.\n\n\n\nOf course, Hillary Clinton isn\'t just any other candidate. And in 2008, she\nran probably more than Obama did as a fighter who had trained in the\nClinton war room. She\'s also been among the most polarizing political\nfigures of the past two decades.\n\n\n\nOver the last few days, with her Iowa-I\'m-Back speech, and now the two on\nwomen\'s issues, this much is clear: Clinton has the makings of pretty good\ncampaign stump speech. She has found a way to adequately praise President\nObama (he signed the Lilly Ledbetter law), but framed herself as someone\nwho can get beyond the partisan gridlock and harness a new type of politics\nthat doesn\'t look anything like a bunch of guys fighting in Congress.\n\n\n\nThe trick will be how she captures the it\'s-time-for-a-woman-president vibe\nwithout playing the gender card too obviously.\n\n\n\nOne thing might make it pretty easy: If no other women run, then it will be\nHillary Clinton against a field of men saying she is a candidate of the\npast -- an argument that in large part would be blunted by her gender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Associated Press: \xe2\x80\x9cObama, Clinton Urge Women to Back Democrats\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_DEMOCRATS_WOMEN?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT>*\n\n\n\nBy Ken Thomas\n\nSeptember 19, 2014, 4:26 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nHeading into President Barack Obama\'s final midterm election in the White\nHouse, Democrats on Friday sought to energize female voters, pointing to\nwomen as key to the party\'s future.\n\n\n\n"We do better when we field the whole team. When women succeed, America\nsucceeds," Obama said at an annual forum sponsored by the Democratic\nNational Committee.\n\n\n\nObama, Vice President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary\nRodham Clinton headlined the daylong Women\'s Leadership Forum aimed at\ngenerating excitement for the party\'s candidates. Democrats are trying to\nhold onto a slim majority in the Senate and are defending several female\nincumbents - Kay Hagan in North Carolina, Mary Landrieu in Louisiana,\nJeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire - while seeking to mobilize women, who\ntypically vote in smaller numbers in nonpresidential elections.\n\n\n\nThe president said the economy had made strides since the recession,\ntelling more than 500 of the party\'s top female donors that voters would\nsee two different visions for America\'s future in the elections.\nRepublicans, the president said, would offer an agenda that would help the\nwealthy, big banks and polluters while Democrats had sought to give people\na "fair shot."\n\n\n\nRepublicans, who run the House and are vying for Senate control, said Obama\nand his allies were spending "all of their time pointing fingers at others"\ninstead of seeking solutions for women. "Voters are now turning on the\nDemocrats," said Kirsten Kukowski, a Republican National Committee\nspokeswoman.\n\n\n\nDemocrats cited Republican opposition to raising the minimum wage, which\nthey said has a disproportionate effect on women, efforts to repeal Obama\'s\nhealth care overhaul and last year\'s partial government shutdown.\n\n\n\n"If we don\'t keep these great women in the Senate and we don\'t make gains\nin the House, then we\'re going to lose the chance to make the next step in\nprogress which is waiting because America is about to explode\neconomically," Biden said.\n\n\n\nClinton received a rousing welcome at the forum, which she co-founded in\n1993 with Tipper Gore.\n\n\n\nThe party\'s leading presidential contender in 2016 if she runs, Clinton in\nher speech plugged several female candidates on the ballot this fall, a\npreview of campaigning she\'s expected to do before the election.\n\n\n\nClinton listed several reasons why the upcoming congressional races would\nmatter, criticizing the Hobby Lobby decision by the Supreme Court for\npulling "the rug out from beneath America\'s women." The decision said\nemployers with religious objections could opt out of the health care law\'s\nrequirement to cover birth control.\n\n\n\nShe noted the recent 20th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act,\nlegislation Biden pushed and her husband, president Bill Clinton, signed\ninto law. The legislation was viewed as a big step forward to address the\nissue, and she said its anniversary was tempered by "outrages of the NFL"\nand assaults on women in uniform and on college campuses. The NFL has been\ncriticized for its handling of the domestic abuse case involving star\nrunning back Ray Rice.\n\n\n\nClinton said Democrats have 10 women running for the Senate and six women\nrunning for governor. "If I could vote for all of them, I would," she said.\n\n\n\nShe urged support for Iowa Democrat Staci Appel, who could become the first\nwoman from that state elected to the House and made a special appeal for\nMary Burke, who is challenging Republican Gov. Scott Walker in Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nWalker\'s presidential ambitions could hinge on whether he wins re-election.\n\n\n\nBurke, Clinton said, "is offering a choice between more angry gridlock and\nprogress that will actually make a difference for Wisconsin families:\nbetter jobs, better wages and better schools," she said, without mentioning\nWalker by name.\n\n\n\nObama, Clinton and Biden all offered praise for DNC chair Debbie Wasserman\nSchultz, a Florida congresswoman who has led the committee since 2011.

Knowing they are on the ballot, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cgives me\nhope.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe singled out Democrat Mary Burke, who is running for governor in\nWisconsin against incumbent Scott Walker, a Republican.\n\n\n\nShould he win re-election, Mr. Walker would be positioned to vie for the\nRepublican presidential nomination in 2016.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton drew a contrast between Wisconsin and neighboring Minnesota,\nwhich is led by a Democratic governor, Mark Dayton.\n\n\n\nShe said the \xe2\x80\x9cevidence is in: smart, progressive policies in Minnesota led\nto more job creation and more economic growth.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWisconsin deserves better and with Mary Burke it will get better,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\nClinton said.\n\n\n\nRepublicans rejected the assertion that they are impeding women\xe2\x80\x99s progress.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery day we are talking to women about the issues we all care about \xe2\x80\x93\nempowering women at work and at home, creating good paying jobs, building\nthe economy, increasing workplace flexibility, addressing workplace\ndiscrimination and modernizing job training,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirsten Kukowski,\nspokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the other hand,\nPresident Obama and the Democrats have spent all of their time pointing\nfingers at others instead of working toward solutions and pushing policies\nthat have made life more difficult for women.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAs a speaker, Mrs. Clinton tends to be most comfortable when she sticks to\npolicy. And her address Friday was rife with references to Supreme Court\nruling and legislation pending in Congress.\n\n\n\nBut she struck a more personal note, too, mentioning her daughter Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s\npregnancy.\n\n\n\nShe said she is on \xe2\x80\x9cgrandbaby watch,\xe2\x80\x9d noting that her family will do all it\ncan for the newest member of the family. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I want that for everybody\xe2\x80\x99s\nchild and everybody\xe2\x80\x99s grandchild,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*MSNBC: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton dives into midterms by supporting Democratic\nwomen\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-dives-midterms-supporting-democratic-women>*\n\n\n\nBy Alex Seitz-Wald\n\nSeptember 19, 2014, 2:28 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton waded deeper into the 2014 midterm elections Friday, using\nher first televised remarks at a national party event to heap praise on a\nlong list of female Democrats on the ballot this year.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I know they might not be as glamorous as presidential elections, but\nthese upcoming midterm elections are crucial,\xe2\x80\x9d the former secretary of\nstate, who has presidential elections on her mind, told the Democratic\nNational Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Women\xe2\x80\x99s Leadership Forum Conference in Washington.\n\n\n\nClinton, who was in Iowa last Sunday, lauded Staci Appel, a Democratic\ncongressional candidate in the state. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is a great mom who worked her\nway up from minimum wage to management, and with enough support, she could\nbe the first woman ever elected from Iowa to the U.S. House of\nRepresentatives,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n\n\n\nAppel is one of more than 100 Democratic women running for Congress this\nyear, along with 10 Democratic women looking for Senate seats and six\nrunning for governor. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I could vote for all of them, I would!\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton\ncheered.\n\n\n\nShe also took a moment to give special attention to Mary Burke, who is\nchallenging Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is offering a\nchoice between more angry gridlock and progress that will actually make a\ndifference for Wisconsin families,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cWisconsin deserves\nbetter, and with Mary Burke, it will get better for the people and families\nof Wisconsin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBurke has fired a campaign consultant amid allegations that the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s\njobs plan appears to have been plagiarized from other candidates.\n\n\n\nClinton shouted out almost every female Democrat running statewide in the\ncountry. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have so many reasons to be hopeful. Mary Burke gives me hope.\nMaggie Hassan gives me hope. Martha Coakley and Wendy Davis give me hope.\nAlison Lundergan Grimes, Kay Hagan, Mary Landrieu, Michelle Nunn, Jeanne\nShaheen, Natalie Tennant, they all give me hope,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton, a potential 2016\npresidential candidate, said.\n\n\n\nClinton didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention Shenna Bellows, who is facing an uphill battle\nagainst Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, and Amanda Curtis, the\nDemocrat running for Senate in Montana after the party\xe2\x80\x99s favored candidate\ndropped out. She also skipped Gina Raimondo, the party\xe2\x80\x99s gubernatorial\nnominee in Rhode Island.\n\n\n\nBorrowing a bit from the populist message that has propelled some in her\nown party, Clinton presented Democrats as the ones who will look out for\naverage Americans. \xe2\x80\x9cAt a time when the deck does seem stacked against\nmiddle-class families in so many ways, we have a choice to make,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\nof the November elections.\n\n\n\nClinton, who spoke Thursday on women in politics at an event at the Center\nfor American Progress, went on to decry the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s Hobby Lobby\ndecision, saying it \xe2\x80\x9cpulled the rug out for America\xe2\x80\x99s women\xe2\x80\x9d just as the\nAffordable Care Act was coming online to help them. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a slippery slope\nwhen we start turning over a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to her own health care decisions\nto her employer. Any my question is, will Congress do anything about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe former first lady said.\n\n\n\nShe also lamented that the celebration around the anniversary of the\nViolence Against Women Act \xe2\x80\x9cwas tempered by troubling news on many fronts,\nfrom the outrages of the NFL to assaults against women in uniform and on\ncollege campuses.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton was introduced by DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who has\nfaced questions this week after Politico published a highly negative piece\nabout her tenure.\n\n\n\nWasserman Schultz was the co-chair of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 presidential campaign,\nand like Vice President Joe Biden, who spoke before her, Clinton went out\nof her way to praise the embattled Wasserman Schultz.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDebbie wears so many hats so well,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said at the beginning of her\nremarks, noting that Wasserman Schultz beat breast cancer and then passed\nlegislation to help women who suffer from the disease. This week, Wasserman\nSchultz received an award from Susan G. Koman foundation for her work on\nthe issue.\n\n\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9can example to us all,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe fights for women, for\nkids, for families. So let\xe2\x80\x99s give our chair another round of applause.\xe2\x80\x9d The\naudience gave Wasserman Schultz a warm ovation.\n\n\n\nAfter her speech, Clinton stuck around to shake hands for about seven\nminutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Hill blog: Ballot Box: \xe2\x80\x9cClinton: Midterms key for women\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/218347-clinton-casts-midterms-as-key-election-for-women>*\n\n\n\nBy Ben Kamisar\n\nSeptember 19, 2014, 1:43 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton painted the 2014 midterm election as a watershed moment for\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s issues, calling in a Friday speech for Democrats to make sure their\nfemale candidates are elected this fall.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVoters have a choice this November,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at a Democratic National\nCommittee event in Washington. \xe2\x80\x9cA choice between those who blocked paycheck\nfairness, who applauded Hobby Lobby, who tried to stop the renewal of the\nViolence Against Women Act, or leaders who will fight for women and girls\nto have the same opportunities and rights that they deserve.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the DNC\xe2\x80\x99s Women\xe2\x80\x99s Leadership Forum, a committee initiative that\nshe helped start in 1993 as first lady, Clinton made her case for doubling\ndown on efforts to bring women to the table. She also called for raising\nthe minimum wage, fighting pay discrimination and expanding access to birth\ncontrol.\n\nThe way to achieve those goals, she said, is through a win for Democrats in\nthe midterm elections.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than 100 Democratic women [are] running for the House this year and I\ncant think of a better way to make Congress start working for American\nfamilies again than electing every last one of our women candidates come\nNovember,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n\n\n\nShe also praised the coalition of women senators that helped forge a\nbipartisan compromise to end 2013\xe2\x80\x99s government shutdown and the role of\nSen. Patty Murray [D-Wash.] in a compromise with Rep. Paul Ryan [R-Wis.] to\npass a budget later that year.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen women participate in politics, the effects ripple out far and wide,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said.\n\n\n\nHer comments came against the backdrop of the question that\xe2\x80\x99s dogged her\nfor months: will the former secretary of State, senator and first lady run\nfor president in 2016? Clinton is the front-runner for the nomination after\na failed bid in 2008.\n\n\n\nShe joked that the audience of largely female Democratic donors should not\ndiscount the midterm elections, even though she knows \xe2\x80\x9cthey may not be as\nglamorous as presidential elections.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhile Clinton enjoyed high favorability ratings while she was secretary of\nState, her numbers have fallen since leaving that post.  A Wall Street\nJournal/NBC News poll released Sept. 9 shows her favorable/unfavorable\nratings at 43/41 among registered voters, down from a high of 59/22 in\nFebruary 2009.\n\n\n\nClinton, like President Obama and other speakers at the event, also used\nher address to praise DNC Chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz [D-Fla.]\nafter a story by Politico Wednesday reported she\xe2\x80\x99s lost support from the\nWhite House and Democrats.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer courage in beating breast cancer, and going onto pass groundbreaking\nlegislation that is helping other women beat it too, is an example for us\nall,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said, referring to Wasserman Schultz\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to help pass\nthe Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*National Journal: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Emergence of Hillary Clinton, 2014 Cheerleader\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/the-emergence-of-hillary-clinton-2014-cheerleader-20140919>*\n\n\n\nBy Emma Roller\n\nSeptember 19, 2014\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\'s speech before the Democratic National Committee\'s Women\'s\nLeadership Conference on Friday afternoon was nearly cookie-cut from\nremarks she gave Thursday about economic inequality in the U.S.\n\n\n\nBut this time around, her pitch about economic equality had more of a\npolitical bent. After being criticized for not stumping for Democratic\ncandidates earlier in 2014, Clinton seems to finally be picking up the\npom-poms and cheering for her party\'s candidates\xe2\x80\x94particularly women\ncandidates\xe2\x80\x94if still just in her capacity as a civilian, not a candidate\nherself.\n\n\n\nShe also worked to prod women into action, in a midterm election cycle that\ntypically sees flagging turnout from women and minorities. Between 2008 and\n2010, voter turnout among unmarried women dropped 26 points. Clinton quoted\nRep. Nancy Pelosi in her speech Friday: "When women vote, America wins."\n\n\n\nClinton also used her speech to reel off the names of the women running in\nhotly contested Senate, House, and state leadership races, focusing\nparticularly on Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke.\n\n\n\n"The midterms really matter," she told the crowd Friday. "It\'s a chance to\nelect Democrats who will fight every day to make sure our economy works for\neveryone."\n\n\n\nOtherwise, Clinton stuck to her script and continued to beat the drum for\nmore progressive policies to protect working mothers and victims of sexual\nassault. Here\'s a selection of the lyrics to Clinton\'s 2014 fight song:\n\n\n\nOn the DNC Women\'s Leadership Conference, which she founded with Tipper\nGore 20 years ago: "We\'ve brought the concerns and hopes and dreams of\nwomen from the margins to the mainstream of American public life."\n\n\n\nOn President Obama\'s record on women\'s issues: "This president has been a\ntireless advocate for women and families."\n\n\n\nOn the need for better child care services in the U.S.: When Clinton was an\nattorney in Arkansas, she struggled to find last-minute child care for\nChelsea.\n\n\n\nOn workforce equity: "If we close the gap in workforce participation\nbetween men and women, our GDP would grow by nearly 10 percent by 2030."\n\n\n\nOn the Supreme Court\'s Hobby Lobby decision: "It\'s a slippery slope when we\nturn over a woman\'s right to make her own health care decisions to her\nemployer."\n\n\n\nOn gender equity in Congress: In Iowa last weekend, Clinton met with Staci\nAppel, a Democratic candidate who could become Iowa\'s first female\nrepresentative elected to the House. Clinton had met Appel before, at a\npork dinner seven years ago.\n\n\n\nOn Mary Burke, who is running against Gov. Scott Walker: "She is offering a\nchoice between more angry gridlock and progress that will actually make a\ndifference for Wisconsin families."\n\n\n\nOn Emma Sulkowicz, the Columbia University student who pledged to carry her\nmattress everywhere she goes until her alleged rapist leaves Columbia:\n"That image should haunt all of us, and i\'m very pleased that President\nObama is supporting a new effort to address sexual assault on campuses\nacross the country."\n\n\n\nClinton will likely continue to trumpet her work to give women a leg up in\nthe economy, pitting corporate interests against family interests. But for\nsome progressives, she still has past sins to atone for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Salon: \xe2\x80\x9cYou can thank women for Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s economic platform\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.salon.com/2014/09/19/you_can_thank_women_for_hillary_clintons_economic_platform/>*\n\n\n\nBy Katie McDonough\n\nSeptember 19, 2014, 2:53 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] Clinton\'s focus on women and the economy isn\'t an experiment on\nvoters, it\'s her going where women have led her\n\n\n\nLike most of the rest of the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton is now\nspending time talking about women and labor. The New York Times has a piece\non Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s apparent pivot \xe2\x80\x94 now that we have entered the final months of\nspeculation about whether or not she\xe2\x80\x99ll run for president \xe2\x80\x93 from talking\nabout foreign policy to discussing domestic issues like the minimum wage\nand paid sick leave. And over at Vox, Matthew Yglesias pointed out\nsomething that\xe2\x80\x99s been true for a long time, but is just now gaining\nmainstream traction: The division between \xe2\x80\x9csocial issues\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic\nissues\xe2\x80\x9d is completely made up. But contrary to Yglesias\xe2\x80\x99 framing of this\nmove as some kind of experiment to influence voters (\xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nplan to use feminism to sell big government\xe2\x80\x9d), it seems to me that Clinton\nis actually just going where the public has led her.\n\n\n\nClinton doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to make the case that there are real structural\nbarriers keeping them from earning the money they need to survive or that\ngovernment programs that support women and families are shrinking. Women\nalready know. Polling data reflects women\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about the economy,\nwhich is exactly what Clinton is responding to. As Yglesias noted, Clinton,\nspeaking on a panel this week, articulated a connection that feminists,\nparticularly feminists in the labor and reproductive justice movements,\nhave long been making. \xe2\x80\x9dWomen hold two-thirds of all minimum wage jobs,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe talk about a glass ceiling, but these women don\xe2\x80\x99t even have a\nsecure floor under them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd this lack of a secure floor touches every part of women\xe2\x80\x99s lives. Which\nis why, when you apply a little pressure, the idea that women\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csocial\xe2\x80\x9d\nand \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic\xe2\x80\x9d can be separated out falls away pretty quickly.\n\n\n\nOne in 3 women are living in or on the verge of poverty, and are holding\ndown two out of every three minimum wage jobs. More than 25 percent of\nlow-wage and low-income workers are also single mothers. That means a woman\nwho works full-time is only making an average of $14,500 each year. That\xe2\x80\x99s\n$4,000 dollars less than the poverty level for a mother of two children.\n\n\n\nSo what other issues might this woman, heading a household and working a\nminimum wage job, confront in her daily life? If she\xe2\x80\x99s living in poverty,\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s likely facing food insecurity. And food assistance programs like SNAP\nwere cut this year, so she\xe2\x80\x99s now working with less than before. Which\nprobably means she\xe2\x80\x99s skipping meals. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we find in our research is that\nwhen someone is going to have to do without, it\xe2\x80\x99s usually women,\xe2\x80\x9d Lindsey\nSpindle, a communications officer at an anti-hunger nonprofit recently told\nGlamour. \xe2\x80\x9cThey sacrifice their meals for their children, for their spouse,\nfor their parents. So what we\xe2\x80\x99re anticipating with these cuts is that\nfamilies will be left vulnerable, but women in particular will do a lot to\nshield their families.\xe2\x80\x9d Which might help explain why a recent poll revealed\nthat 56 percent of women surveyed \xe2\x80\x9cdisapproved\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly disapproved\xe2\x80\x9d\nof gutting food assistance programs at a moment when people need them more\nthan ever. Or why 61 percent of women surveyed said that widening income\ngaps undermine opportunity.\n\n\n\nAnd this hypothetical woman, struggling as she is to support her family,\nmight also be thinking about ways to avoid pregnancy. So she\xe2\x80\x99s probably\npaying attention when the Supreme Court says that her boss can dictate what\nmethods of contraception she should have access to. And she\xe2\x80\x99s paying\nattention when her state rejects the Medicaid expansion. Or when her\nrepresentatives target family planning clinics that provide basic\nhealthcare like abortion, contraception or cancer screenings. Because those\nare things she\xe2\x80\x99s struggling to afford, right along with housing and food.\n\n\n\nDemocrats have been smart to focus their platforms on the challenges women\nface in their daily lives, and to follow women\xe2\x80\x99s lead in breaking down\ndivisions between \xe2\x80\x9csocial\xe2\x80\x9d issues like reproductive healthcare and\n\xe2\x80\x9ceconomic\xe2\x80\x9d issues like a living wage or universal preschool. (In fact, it\nseems the only candidates currently holding tight to that false division\nare Republicans trying to find favor with women voters by talking about\nanything but their platforms on contraception.) So while Yglesias gets it\nright that this is indeed Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s strategy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s Clinton\nwho\xe2\x80\x99s planning to \xe2\x80\x9cuse feminism\xe2\x80\x9d to sell a more robust social safety net. I\nthink it\xe2\x80\x99s feminism \xe2\x80\x94 and the power of women\xe2\x80\x99s votes \xe2\x80\x94 using Clinton.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Washington Post: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton to headline fundraiser for Maryland\ngubernatorial hopeful Brown\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/hillary-clinton-to-headline-fundraiser-for-maryland-gubernatorial-hopeful-brown/2014/09/19/3e9b4aea-4057-11e4-b03f-de718edeb92f_story.html>*\n\n\n\nBy John Wagner\n\nSeptember 19, 2014, 7:59 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton is coming to Maryland later this month for a\nfundraiser for Democratic gubernatorial nominee Anthony G.

Doherty\'s friend and executor of his estate, Sean Lake,\nfiled a separate claim seeking a little over $1 million.\n\n\n\nDoherty, a former Navy SEAL, grew up in Winchester, Massachusetts, and was\n42 when he died. He was among four Americans killed in Benghazi, including\nthe U.S. ambassador to Libya, when militants stormed the diplomatic post on\nthe night of Sept. 11, 2012, and later fired on a nearby CIA compound.\n\n\n\nSeparately, Doherty\'s family and Lake filed a lawsuit in state court in\nCalifornia last week over a death benefit on a policy Doherty was required\nto take out as a CIA contractor who performed security work overseas in\nhazardous areas. The lawsuit seeking unspecified damages claims that the\nbroker was negligent because its staff failed to tell Doherty that the\npolicy was essentially worthless to him: It would only pay a death benefit\nif he had a dependent such as a wife or child, but Doherty was divorced\nwith no children.\n\n\n\nDean Boyd, a spokesman for the CIA, said the agency would have no comment.\nThe State Department also declined to comment.\n\n\n\nMichael Mortenson, a California attorney representing the Doherty family\nand Lake, said that under federal law, the claims for damages are required\nbefore a lawsuit against the government can be filed. Mortenson said that\nif the claims are denied, they may file a lawsuit within six months.\n\n\n\nDoherty\'s family argues that both locations that came under attack in Libya\nlacked adequate security resources and personnel despite repeated requests\nfor more. Doherty was killed by mortar rounds that hit the roof of the CIA\nannex.\n\n\n\nMortenson said Doherty\'s family has reached out to the U.S. government over\nthe last two years "to try to reach a resolution," but no agreement has\nbeen reached. In July, five Congress members sent a letter to CIA Director\nJohn Brennan urging him to do everything he can to "provide the appropriate\nassistance to the Doherty family."\n\n\n\n"We must ensure that Mr. Doherty\'s service to his country is honored\nappropriately, and that his family\'s sacrifice is recognized," read the\nletter, signed by the two U.S. senators from Massachusetts, Edward Markey\nand Elizabeth Warren, U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, U.S. Rep.\nKatherine Clark of Massachusetts and U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier of California,\nwhere Doherty had been living.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Doherty\'s mother said the family is "reluctantly ... now\nproceeding to pursue those legal avenues open to us."\n\n\n\n"We know Glen would have done anything to support the United States and\nprotect our freedom as Americans. Two years after the Benghazi attack, our\nfamily has not received the symbolic justice all families of such American\nheroes deserve," said Barbara Doherty, who lives in Woburn, near Boston.\n\n\n\nThe Benghazi attacks stirred fierce partisan debates in Washington. Some\nRepublicans have said the military held back assets that could have saved\nlives and that President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary\nRodham Clinton lied to the public about the nature of the attack.\nDemocrats, Republican-led congressional investigations and military\nofficers have said it\'s untrue that U.S. forces were ordered to "stand\ndown" during the attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*MTV: \xe2\x80\x9cPharrell Williams Wants Hillary Clinton To Read His Stan Smiths\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.mtv.com/news/1936843/pharrell-hillary-clinton-sneakers/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+MTVNewsLatest+(MTV+News+Latest+Headlines)>*\n\n\n\nBy Jessie Peterson\n\nSeptember 19, 2014\n\n\n\nChances are you\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen the first of three collaborations that\nPharrell Williams is expected to do with Adidas, featuring eye-popping Stan\nSmiths and matching track jackets.\n\n\n\nWhat you may not have seen, however, is Skateboard P\xe2\x80\x99s latest set of\ncustomized kicks.\n\n\n\nWhile Pharrell hand-painting a pair of sneakers isn\xe2\x80\x99t new\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ve become\nsomething of a style signature for the artist, second only to his Vivienne\nWestwood hat\xe2\x80\x94the message on them is.
