I particularly like the\nformulation on why she is running for President and tying that back to the\nMethodist creed.\n\nIt achieves some, but not all of our speech take aways.  Still needs a\nslogan, needs more on Dorothy, and I not sure it gives you the clear sense\nof where she would take the county.\n\nI don't think it quite captures HRC's vision.  The theme I see emerging is\nthat making progress is hard and you have to stick with it - as opposed to\nHRC's belief that talent is universal, everyone has a role to play,\nunlocking potential, etc..\n\nDan is going to add more on Dorothy and the HRC vision to the Lissa draft\nand send that back around to this group tonight and to HRC.\n\nRobby, John's and my belief is that Dan should have the pen going forward\nand manage edits with input and writing from Lissa and Jon.  I called Lissa\nto tell her that Dan would manage the process going forward.  She thinks\nthat is a mistake and does not believe it will work.  Just want to be\nupfront about that. I assume Joel and Mandy will hear from her, too. I\nstill believe having Dan manage the process is best of not great options at\nthis point.  If HRC has a different reaction after seeing the speech, we\ncan adjust.\n\nWhat's everyone's reaction to the new draft?\n"
