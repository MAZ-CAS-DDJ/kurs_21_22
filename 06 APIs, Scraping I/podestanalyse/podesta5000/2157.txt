I will send a summary of the JPPI BDS survey of US college campuses, and my recommendations to the PM and Israeli Cabinet on how to combat it.\r\nI assume the BDS letter is still being drafted?\r\nStu\r\n\r\nFrom: Eizenstat, Stuart\r\nSent: Monday, June 29, 2015 2:14 PM\r\nTo: Daniel B. Shapiro (ShapiroDB@state.gov)\r\nCc: 'HarleyJ@state.gov'\r\nSubject: Meeting with the Prime Minister and Israeli Cabinet Sunday, June 28, 2015 (Sensitive)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Ambassador/Dear Dan,\r\n\r\nThanks to you (and Joyce) for the prompt return of my email note and phone call to Joyce. I enjoyed our conversation on Thursday, June 25, as always.\r\n\r\nI want you to know that Dennis Ross and I, along with Avinoam Bar-Yosef, had a hour-plus meeting Sunday, June 28, with the Prime Minister and the full cabinet, to present our Annual Assessment of the State of the Jewish People for JPPI. I can have the Hebrew version sent to me, or I can send the English version in a few weeks. It is really very important. It includes some fascinating and surprising demographic data; an analysis by Avi Gill of key \xe2\x80\x9cdrivers\xe2\x80\x9d impacting the US-Israel-Diaspora triangular relationship; an examination of BDS on US campuses; a summary of the 45 community survey we did on Diaspora views on Israel\xe2\x80\x99s use of force in Gaza and ethical dilemmas; and much more.  I will send you the detailed press statement on the Annual Assessment. I had interviews on the Assessment and Cabinet meeting with Voice of Israel and The Jerusalem Post.\r\n\r\nIn a pre-meeting with Dennis, he felt that if a deal is signed, it was critical that the US send a signal that it was unacceptable at any time, during or after the agreement, for Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon; that the US should provide Israel with the means to defend itself, including the Mission Ordinance Penetration (MOP) bombs plus a B52 to deliver it, as a signal to Iran; and that the US would support action by our allies if Iran undertook such an effort.\r\n\r\nI want you to know that and I was able to get in several of the points we discussed in our phone call.. Dennis took the lead on Iran and made it clear that notwithstanding his Washington Institute letter on the problems with the emergency Iran nuclear deal, he expected it would be concluded, although sometime after the June 30 deadline, and that President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s veto of a likely congressional disapproval, would not be overridden. I took the lead on a presentation to the Cabinet on BDS. In addition to a summary of our findings on college campuses (e.g. Students for Justice in Palestine operate on 300 campuses, and 20, mostly in elite institutions in the northeast and in California, are hotbeds of activity; in a lunch a week ago Sunday with former Ambassador Dan Kurtzer, I learned about an active movement in Princeton)., I made a number of specific suggestions on how to counter the BDS movement. One which I made explicitly, and with Dennis did as well, was that the Cabinet had to recognize that its settlement policy and policy toward the Palestinians was used as a recruiting tool for the BDS leaders. While the leaders want nothing less than the end of the Jewish State, many of those on campuses, EU officials, and European public opinion could be swayed away from BDS if they saw Israel taking affirmative steps toward a two state process in word and deed. Dennis said explicitly that the announcing a policy of building only within the established settlement blocs would be an important step in beginning to defang the ability of the BDS leaders to recruit. I also stressed that Diaspora unity was essential, but that now the Jewish community was tearing itself apart on Israel issues, and those on the liberal/left side, who are pro-Israel and anti-BDS are being shunted aside. I said that even Ben-Gurion and Begin put aside their differences at a critical time in the 1948 War, No less is needed now.\r\n\r\nThis elicited a great deal of discussion in the Cabinet.  The Prime Minister made the following responses:\r\n\r\n1. Israel \xe2\x80\x9cwill not accept an Iran deal\xe2\x80\x9d along the lines being considered. It will leave Iran as a \xe2\x80\x9croaring\xe2\x80\x9d and emboldened presence in the region, which is a direct threat to Israel. thus, Israel will need to defend itself. This is the first priority.\r\n\r\n2. On BDS, Israel should move from the defense to the offense. It should be attacked on moral grounds. It is \xe2\x80\x9cunjust\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccruel\xe2\x80\x9d. Israel must attack its attackers.  The best defense is a good offense: \xe2\x80\x9cattack, attack, attack\xe2\x80\x9d. Changing policy won\xe2\x80\x99t help, but \xe2\x80\x9cit may be useful for other reasons\xe2\x80\x9d (I found this an interesting qualification)\r\n\r\nHe said that there are several lines of defense:\r\n\r\n(1) The Jewish community itself, where unity is necessary and \xe2\x80\x9call Jews\xe2\x80\x9d should be included;\r\n(2) Israel \xe2\x80\x9cneeds a Hispanic alliance\xe2\x80\x9d. He meets with any Hispanic group that comes to Jerusalem.\r\n(3) There needs to be outreach to Asian Americans.\r\n(4) Evangelicals, not just in the US. They are 22% of the population of Brazil; there are 60 million in China.\r\nHe said there is a \xe2\x80\x9clot of energy\xe2\x80\x9d in the anti-BDS movement now.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n\r\nStu Eizenstat\r\n"
