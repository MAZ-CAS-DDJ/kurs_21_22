john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear Colleagues,\n\nAs we approach the Fourth of July holiday, I would like to thank you for all your hard work and dedication to the Law Center throughout the year.\n\nAs a small token of my appreciation, the Law Center will be closing at 1:00 p.m. on Thursday, July 2nd.  So that all essential departments are appropriately staffed, please consult with your supervisors, who have discretion to approve leave to assure that all departments are properly staffed in the case of an emergency.\n\nI hope you enjoy a nice holiday.\n\nBest,\n\nBill\n\n\n\n'
