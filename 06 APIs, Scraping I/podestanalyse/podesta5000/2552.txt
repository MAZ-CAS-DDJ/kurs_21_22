john.podesta@gmail.comb' \nDear Governor Brown,\n \nOur  problem SB 128 is not about truly terminally ill people having \npalliative care  or even a way to end their lives. Our problem is with what medical \nchoices will  be made for People with Disabilities whose lives are not \nconsidered valuable, by  many, and are seen as a drain on rationed medical \nresources for more "whole  people."\n \nIt  was said that the "health committee" meeting that the disability rights \n community was reached out to, and that our concerns were allayed. They are \n not.\n \nJoin the IHSS Consumers  Union on Facebook at \n \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/IHSSConsumersUnion2/\n \n"I decided after 41 years of battling this curse that attacks  children of \nall ages, I would put myself in that chair, that steel imprisonment  that \nlong has been deemed the dystrophic child\'s plight. . . . I realize my life  \nis half, so I must learn to do things halfway. I just have to learn to try to \nbe  good at being half a person." -- Jerry Lewis \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_Diane Coleman_ (https://www.facebook.com/ndycoleman)  JD -- President and \nCEO Of Not Dead Yet says: Singer is  advocating the denial of medical \ntreatment to infants with disabilities. As some  here have pointed out, this is \nconsistent with his long held views. About 200  NDY activists protested \nPrinceton\'s hiring of Singer in 1999, and 14 were  arrested as reported in the NY \nTimes. We contend that Singer\'s words violate  Princeton\'s policy against \nhate speech. Today, our Singer expert Stephen Drake  is working on a petition \nwhich we hope will gain overwhelming support in the  disability community \nand force the University to  respond.\n \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/\xe2\x80\xa6/protest-over-princeton-s-new-ethic\xe2\x80\xa6\n \n (http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/22/ny\nregion/protest-over-princeton-s-new-ethics-professor.html) \n \n_Protest Over Princeton\'s New Ethics  Professor_ \n(http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/22/nyregion/protest-over-princeton-s-new-\nethics-professor.html&h=MAQGWN7Ov&s=1) \n \nDemonstrators opposed to Princeton\'s hiring of Peter  Singer, who has \nwritten in support of euthanasia for some disabled infants and  is the \nuniversity\'s first professor of bioethics, protested his inaugural day  of...\n \n \n \nNYTIMES.COM|BY BY NEIL  MACFARQUHAR \n \nTop of  Form\n\n_Like_ (https://www.facebook.com/groups/IHSSConsumersUnion2/)  \xc2\xb7 _Comment_ \n(https://www.facebook.com/groups/IHSSConsumersUnion2/)  \xc2\xb7 _Share \n\n_ (https://www.facebook.com/groups/IHSSConsumersUnion2/) \n\n\n\n\n'
