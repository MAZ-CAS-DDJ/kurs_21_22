But what did we get from the U.S. Senate? Nothing. \xa0\n\nI'm convinced we need more focus on key solutions -- like electing new leaders. Leaders who will again pick up the fight for strong climate policies that crack down on corporate polluters and transition us to a clean energy economy.\n\nWill you join me?

Then the Senate left town without even voting on a bill to hold BP responsible for the catastrophe in the Gulf.\n\nAn unquestionably broad majority supports moving to clean energy and addressing climate change. But again and again, Big Oil, Dirty Coal and their allies in Congress, led by the Republican leadership stand stubbornly in\nthe way of progress.\xa0\n\nThey have polluted the halls of Congress long enough.\xa0 \n\nBecause of their obstruction, we're sending $1 billion overseas to buy oil every single day.\xa0 Because of their defiance, we have more pollution but fewer green jobs.\xa0 Because they've been bought by the special interests, Big Oil\nand Dirty Coal's cronies in Congress have more to say about U.S. energy\npolicy than you or I.\n\nBut we can fix this, John. We don't have to tolerate this attack on our energy future.\xa0 Election Day 2010 gives us our chance to bring to U.S. Senate new environmental champions - like Paul Hodes, Robin Carnahan and Joe Sestak - who will fight for the laws we need to protect the planet.\xa0\n\nWhen it comes to educating the public about environmental issues, no one runs a better program than the League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund.\xa0 I\ncan assure you that your gift will be a sound investment in a shrewd strategy and the most state-of-the-art campaign tactics.\xa0 But in order to have all the\npieces in place, all the money needs to be in the door by September 20.\xa0\n\nGive to the LCV Victory Fund today and contribute to an early retirement for the Dirty Dozen.\n\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=2z3I80I8hemFUCfMD_DTHA..\n\nThis is an opportunity to finally break the vice grip that the Big Polluters have\non our environmental laws.\xa0 Together, we can make an impact.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRobert Redford\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nTo review our Privacy Policy,  click here .\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=MVDZeyRbf8IuPnZ7GLKUCg..\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=jbqR8DbuK6ikkYSR79CZARIlPOPa34UT&cid=0\n\n"
