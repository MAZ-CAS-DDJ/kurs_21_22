The time is now. Please make a small donation before midnight.\n\n32 to go -- ARE YOU IN?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/foustq42014?refcode=em_FR_2014.10.21_b2_admin_ldnd&amp;recur_weekly=true&amp;amount=25&amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=DC&amp;zip=20016&amp;phone=2162818851&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=\n\nThanks,\n\nFoust HQ\n\n\n\nThis message was emailed to: podesta@law.georgetown.edu\n\nTo unsubscribe from this email list, please paste this URL into your browser: \nhttp://act.foustforvirginia.com/unsubscribe\n\nPaid for by John Foust for Congress\n\n"
