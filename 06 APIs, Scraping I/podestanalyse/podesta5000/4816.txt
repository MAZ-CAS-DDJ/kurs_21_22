That task fell to a longtime business\npartner, Mustafa Abu Naba\'a.\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/07/us/politics/07mccain.html\n\n*Win Points for McCain!

Sargeant, who runs a major defense contractor,\nhas delivered more than $50,000 in contributions to McCain\'s campaign. So\nfar, so what. McCain is the third candidate to benefit from Sargeant\'s\nnetwork of donors this election cycle -- the other two being Rudy Giuliani\nand Hillary Clinton -- for a grand total of more than $100,000. That, too,\nis not remarkable. Hotshot bundlers often deliver for multiple\ncandidates.
