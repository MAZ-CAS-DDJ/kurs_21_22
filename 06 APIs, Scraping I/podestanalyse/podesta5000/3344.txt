john.podesta@gmail.comb"John --  \n\nOne year ago today, you made history.\n\nWe all knew that electing Barack Obama President was only the opportunity to bring about change; that we would all have to keep working to fulfill the promise our victory offered.\n\nAnd you've come through -- by making hundreds of thousands of calls to Congress to push health reform forward, by pouring your effort into seemingly insurmountable challenges time and again, and, since January, by building on the power of our campaign to create Organizing for America. \n\nAnd now, with the finish line on health reform in sight, we need your voice more than ever before.\n\nTo mark this special day, President Obama just recorded a video for supporters like you -- please watch his message, and sign up to join OFA in your community today:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Year\n\nThank you so much for fighting so hard and giving so much to make the promise of a stronger, more just and prosperous America in the years ahead a reality.\n\nDavid Plouffe\n\n\nPlease donate: https://donate.barackobama.com/OneYearDonate\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for America, a project of the Democratic National Committee -- 430 South Capitol Street SE, Washington, D.C. 20003.
