He fought to preserve the key elements of reform as a member of the subcommittee on health care in the Education and Labor Committee, and by holding numerous town halls and summits over the past three years -- ten this past August -- to explain the benefits of this effort to provide access to affordable, quality health care to all Americans.\n \nWhile working hard for comprehensive reform, Joe strongly supported measures to care for the most vulnerable Americans as he:\n\n    * Co-sponsored and passed legislation to lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries;\n    * Voted multiple times to override President Bush\'s vetoes of bills to reauthorize and strengthen children\'s care through SCHIP; and\n    * Authored legislation to diagnose and treat PTSD as an astonishing number of Veterans return home with mental challenges.\n\nArlen Specter is known for his staunch opposition to healthcare reform and that did not change when he switched parties. On Meet the Press he unequivocally opposed a public plan that would lower costs. When asked to confirm his answer he responded, "That\'s what I said and that\'s what I meant." His position was no surprise to those who remember the last concerted attempt at comprehensive reform when Arlen derailed President Clinton\'s Democratic health care plan in the 1990s without offering an alternative.\n \nWhen it mattered most, Arlen Specter stood with his Republican leadership. As millions lost their insurance, prices skyrocketed - nearly 90 percent in just the last eight years -- and more families had to worry about access to treatments they need, Specter specifically worked against the interests of even the most vulnerable Americans. He voted:\n\n    * Against seniors and the disabled by supporting legislation to cut Medicare by $270 billion and Medicaid by $182 billion;\n    * Against children\'s care by opposing full funding of SCHIP; and\n    * Against an amendment to provide funding to treat Veterans with mental illness, post-traumatic stress disorder, or substance abuse issues.\n\nAfter 45 years as a loyal Republican leader, Arlen Specter can change his registration, but not his record. Without Joe Sestak\'s leadership to follow, Specter leaves little doubt that he will oppose a healthcare system that provides affordable, accessible and quality coverage to all Americans.\n \nClick here to learn more about the records of Joe Sestak and Arlen Specter on health care: http://joesestak.com/contrastpdf/healthcare.pdf\n\nTo see the sharp contrast between the records of Joe Sestak and Arlen Specter on supporting our workers, serving our Veterans, gender equality, and protecting our environment, visit http://joesestak.com/contrast.\n\nUnsubscribe: http://JoeSestak.com/unsubscribe | Powered by Democracy in Action\n\nPaid for by Sestak For Senate\n\nSestak for Senate | PO Box 1936 | Media | PA | 19063 | (610) 891-8956 | Powered by Democracy in Action'
