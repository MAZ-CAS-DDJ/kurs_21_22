Economic Policy Working Group\n>\n>\n>\n> On our weekly call, we approved the work plan for the economic policy\n> group.  The goal of this group is to provide senior policy advisors with\n> clear, vetted policy options and recommendations for decisions to be\n> made during the first year of the new administration.  Over the next two\n> and a half months, the group will remain engaged with the campaign\n> policy staff without interfering with their day-to-day responsibilities.\n>\n>\n>\n> The economic policy group will focus on these areas:  budget (including\n> taxes); stimulus/growth plan; trade; financial markets (including GSEs);\n> and other miscellaneous issues such as labor.  There will be team\n> leaders for each of these focus areas.  The work product of these teams\n> would be reviewed informally by a group of "wise men and women," such as\n> Paul Volcker and Larry Summers.\n>\n>\n>\n> Bill Daley is working with Josh Steiner on this economic working group.\n>\n>\n>\n> III.           Code of Conduct\n>\n>\n>\n> After much discussion, the board is close to approving a code of conduct\n> to govern people working on the transition.  This code of conduct is\n> based on the ethics principles you have stated during the campaign.\n> Among other things, the code of conduct would require the following:\n>\n>\n>\n> *         Disqualification from involvement in any particular matter in\n> which the individual has lobbied over the past 12 months or that poses a\n> financial conflict of interest, to the individual herself, or her family\n> members, partners, clients, or business associates.\n>\n>\n>\n> *         Prohibition on transition personnel lobbying federal agencies\n> over which they have substantial responsibility during the duration of\n> the transition.  For 12 months after serving on the transition,\n> personnel may not lobby a federal agency on any particular matter over\n> which the individual has had substantial responsibility.\n>\n>\n>\n> *         A ban on receiving gifts from people seeking government\n> positions, federal employees, or other people with an interest in the\n> work of the transition.\n>\n>\n>\n> *         A ban on federal lobbyists making financial contributions to\n> the transition or holding leadership positions on the transition\n>\n>\n>\n> *         A ban on foreign agents working on the transition.\n>\n>\n> IV.       Next Meetings\n>\n>\n>\n> The transition board and staff are scheduled to meet on August 25 in\n> Denver.  We will also meet again on September 2 in D.C. with working\n> group leaders.\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> -----------------------------------------------------------\n>\n> Chris Lu\n>\n> Obama for America\n>\n> (312) 505-4864 (cell)\n>\n>\n>\n>\n\n-- \nSent from Gmail for mobile | mobile.google.com\n'
