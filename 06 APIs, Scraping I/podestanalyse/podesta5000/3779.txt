john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hey Guys, I just want to flag that we\'re having problems getting our\noutside counsel to be as responsive as we need. I\'m contemplating\nadding another firm or changing counsel. This is after I spoke with\nthem about it.\n\nWe need a bigger firm with more than 2 lawyers. I also think the DNC\noptics with Sandler could create problems. He is really the DNC\nGeneral Counsel and then has some other clients. But we are using\ncounsel on a day to day basis now so we need somebody more focused on\nus.\n\nI think I\'d engage with Larry Gold at Lichtman, Trister, Singer &\nRoss. Larry represents mostly unions, 527s and c4s. No party\ncommittees and only a few candidates. He was Associate General Counsel\nat the AFL-CIO when I was there so I have a good working relationship\nwith him. He has also been one of the most aggressive advocates for\nthe free speech rights of advocacy groups in election years including\nas one of the litigants in the lawsuit that broke some of the BCRA\nrestrictions last year.\n\nSee exchange below about Sandler issues.\n\nI\'m going to go forward with talking to Larry unless folks have\nconcerns and want to discuss this.\n\n-Tom\n\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Malea Stenzel <malea@campaigntodefendamerica.org>\nDate: Thu, Mar 6, 2008 at 7:28 AM\nSubject: RE: FW: McCain Hub- please approve\nTo: tom@zzranch.com\n\n\nSandler assumed you were using express.\n\n I see two problems with the communication with Sandler:\n        1.  He isn\'t paying close enough attention to our questions-\n        2.  He has been too busy and isn\'t on the same page with Neil.\n\n Hope to get the questions of issue advocacy, electioneering and express\n worked out on Friday.  As much as it is a bad week for this to come up, on\n Friday we (hope) to be on the same page and all staff will have written\n guidelines they can follow (which I have already done for Issue Advocacy).\n\n FYI- Christina was not ready for the site to go as written yesterday at 3pm-\n don\'t know is she was comfortable releasing it today.\n\n\n Malea Stenzel\n malea@campaigntodefendamerica.org\n Direct: 202-609-7675\n Cell: 651-261-3166\n Fax:  888-712-7990\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n From: tmatzzie@gmail.com [mailto:tmatzzie@gmail.com] On Behalf Of Tom\n Matzzie\n Sent: Thursday, March 06, 2008 7:10 AM\n To: malea@campaigntodefendamerica.org\n\n\nSubject: Re: FW: McCain Hub- please approve\n\n Hey, why are we getting mixed signals with this?
