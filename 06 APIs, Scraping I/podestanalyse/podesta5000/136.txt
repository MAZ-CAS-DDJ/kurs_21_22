Without mentioning our recent talk about it, I said I didn't think so. I also told her that I already put Steve in touch with CGI this week (CGI says they could use his advice but are not sure they want to pay him). Ruby said Steve is probably going to move on. \r\n\r\nShe also said she is preparing a proposal for the MacArthur Foundation, in relation to protection of the Mekong River delta. She said CCI is preparing to submit a proposal for the same grant, and she said she may ask us to intervene with CCI to get them to submit one, combined proposal. I asked her what the proposal would be, and she said she had asked you about it and you had approved. I said if you were fine with it, of course I'm fine with it. Between us, I didn't really understand what we'd be doing if we get the money, or if it fits with WJC/your vision for climate programs at CF. \r\n\r\nJust wanted to be sure to update you, and I'm happy to go back to Ruby to ask for more information about the MacArthur proposal if it would be helpful/appropriate.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAmi"
