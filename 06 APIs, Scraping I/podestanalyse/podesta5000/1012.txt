NEW BEGINNING\r\n\r\nThe time has come for a new beginning \xe2\x80\x93 a new dawn of American leadership to\r\novercome the challenges of the 21st century, and to seize the opportunities\r\nembedded in those challenges. We will strengthen our capacity to defeat our\r\nenemies and support our friends. We will renew old alliances and forge new\r\nand enduring partnerships. We will show the world once more that America is\r\nrelentless in defense of our people, steady in advancing our interests, and\r\ncommitted to the ideals that shine as a beacon to the world: democracy and\r\njustice; opportunity and unyielding hope.\r\n\r\nPresident-elect Obama believes we need new strategies that balance and\r\nintegrate all elements of American power  diplomacy, military, intelligence,\r\nand law enforcement and the power of our moral example. He's picked just the\r\nright team to carry that out.\r\n\r\n2. CONFIDENT COMMANDER IN CHIEF/READY ON DAY ONE\r\n\r\nThis is a high-powered national security cabinet who will work together as a\r\nTEAM to keep America safe and restore its standing in the world.\r\n\r\nThese are the choices of a CONFIDENT Commander in Chief who wants strong\r\nleadership to advance his agenda and is signaling his intention to work\r\nacross the aisle in a bipartisan way on the security challenges we face.\r\n\r\nPresident-elect Obama is moving quickly and decisively so will be ready on\r\nDAY ONE to meet the challenges that will be there on day one: two wars;\r\nterrorism; Iran/North Korea -- spread of nuclear weapons;over-stretched\r\nmilitary; energy dependence; conflicts in Sudan, Congo,Guantanamo/detainee\r\nissues, etc.\r\n\r\n3. BIPARTISANSHIP:\r\n\r\nWe move forward with respect for America\xe2\x80\x99s tradition of a bipartisan\r\nnational security policy, and a commitment to national unity.\r\n\r\n4. AMERICAN POWER RESTORED (specific messages for State, AG, Defense, DHS,\r\nUN and NSC -- the order in which they are speaking).\r\n\r\nSTATE:  America is stronger and safer when we pursue vigorous diplomacy.  As\r\nthe President-elect has said, we must engage friends and foes alike.\r\n\r\nDOJ: Strong law enforcement and respect for civil liberties can live side by\r\nside.  We can protect our people, uphold the public trust and adhere to our\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nDOD:  We must responsibly end the war in Iraq through a successful\r\ntransition to Iraqi control, and we must ensure that we have the strategy \xe2\x80\x93\r\nand resources \xe2\x80\x93 to succeed against al Qaeda and the Taliban. Afghanistan is\r\nthe central front on the war on terror, and we must refocus our efforts to\r\ndefeat terror where it started.\r\n\r\nDHS:\r\nProtecting our homeland means preventing terrorist attacks and responding to\r\ncatastrophe \xe2\x80\x93 be it manmade or natural. To do that, the federal government\r\nmust ensure accountability and a high level of cross-government\r\ncoordination.   It must also work hand in hand with state and local\r\ngovernments to share information, secure our borders, and keep our country\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nUN: The global challenges we face demand global institutions that work. We\r\nmust work together with the world -- our commitment to multilateral action\r\nwill be borne out by a commitment to reform. We need the UN to be more\r\neffective as a venue for collective action \xe2\x80\x93 against terror and\r\nproliferation; genocide and conflict; global climate change, poverty and\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nNSC:  To succeed, we must use all elements of American power: our military\r\nand diplomacy; our intelligence and law enforcement; our economy and the\r\npower of our moral example.\r\n\r\nVice President Elect:   Confident Commander in Chief, ready on Day One, high\r\npowered cabinet that will form a national security TEAM to keep us safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
