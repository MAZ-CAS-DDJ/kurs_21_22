Sooner or later we\'re going to have to\ndeal with them one way or another. And I understand why this administration\nand previous administrations had such antipathy towards Hamas and their\ndedication of violence and the things they not only espouse but practice.\nBut it\'s a new reality in the Middle East. And I think the lesson is that\npeople want security and a decent life and a decent future and they want\ndemocracy. And Fatah was not giving them that.\n\n[Present-day Commentary]\n\nRUBIN: Well this is the biggest flip-flop I\'ve ever seen in American\npolitics when it comes to this crucial subject of American policy towards\nIsrael and the Middle East. John McCain in Davos (?) in that interview was\ntalking \'well, we\'re gonna have to do business with Hamas.\' And that was the\nJohn McCain that was so beloved, often called the \'charming maverick\' by\nmany in the media. Now he\'s running for President and he attacks Democrats,\nin particular Barack Obama, as somehow being the preferred candidate of\nHamas. This is outrageous. This is the stuff that we Democrats have taken\nfor a long time. We\'re sick of it. We\'re tired of it. Of being attacked for\nthese guilt by association devices suggesting that we\'re the friends of\nterrorists. [\x85]\n\n*Rubin: McCain **"180**\xb0** Flip Flop" on Hamas is "the Height of\nHypocrisy"*(CNN 05/16/08 9:00am)\nJAMES RUBIN: The president of the United States is in the Israeli Knesset .\nThis is a country that was created out of the ashes of World War II, because\nof the holocaust. And the enemy of everyone connected with that era, that\nhistory, was the appeasement of Hitler. The idea that we should have\nnegotiated with Adolf Hitler. And that\'s what President Bush brings up\nbefore the Israeli Knesset. There\'s no more gruesome place for the president\nto suggest that other Americans, other Democrats, are somehow \'appeasers\'\nbecause they want to sit down at the negotiating table with Iran. Especially\nwhen, let\'s face it his own Secretary of Defense has said we should\nnegotiate with Iran, many many Republican officials have said we should\nnegotiate with Iran. All of Bush\'s silent treatment on Iran and Syria has\ngotten us nowhere. So for the President to use this solemn occasion of a\npresidential address to the Israeli Knesset, to use these horrible words\nabout appeasement and Munich and Neville Chamberlain is the really really\nmost ugly form of American politics brought to another shore that I\'ve seen\nin a long time.\n\nKIRA PHILLIPS: Then we see John McCain responding yesterday, the new John\nMcCain but there\'s an old John McCain that we discovered and that comes from\nan interview you did when you were working with Sky News in 2006, I believe,\ncorrect?\n\nRUBIN: That\'s right.\n\nPHILLIPS: Let\'s take a listen to this exchange.\n\n[Cut to clip of Rubin interviewing John McCain in 2006]\n\nJAMES RUBIN: Do you think American diplomats should be operating the way\nthey have in the past in working with the Palestinian government if Hamas is\nnow in charge?\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: They\'re the government and sooner or later we\'re gonna have to\ndeal with them in one way or another. I understand why this administration\nand previous administrations had such antipathy towards Hamas is because of\ntheir dedication to violence and the things they not only espouse but\npractice. So, but it\'s a new reality in the Middle East.\n\n[end clip]\n\nPHILLIPS: Ok, explain to me now. Where does John McCain stand?\n\nRUBIN: This is the ultimate flip flop in American politics. When he was in\nDavos, amongst the European crowd and I interviewed him there two years ago,\nhe was talking as if it was appropriate and natural and reasonable to\nnegotiate with Hamas, the new government of the Palestinian territories. And\nthen two years later, he\'s taking a very very different position saying,\n\'anybody who wants to talk to them is somehow an equivalent to terrorists.\'\nSmearing people for suggesting that one ought to talk to Hamas, when it was\nhe himself who was prepared to talk to Hamas two years ago. And the great\nirony of all of this is that neither Hillary Clinton nor Barack Obama even\nwant to talk to the Hamas government. They\'ve both said they we shouldn\'t\nnegotiate with them or deal with them properly until they renounce terrorism\nand Israel. So John McCain doing this 180 degree flip flop and then\nattacking Barack Obama is just the height of hypocrisy.\n\n\nHighlight #2\n*McCain Agrees with Bush Line, Ridicules Obama for Willingness to Engage\nIran* (CNN 05/16/08 8:20am)\nJOHN ROBERTS: John McCain tough jumped right in on top of the attack,\nridiculing Obama for being willing to talk with Iran\'s president.\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: What does he want to talk about with Ahmadijhad? Who said that\nIsrael is a stinking corpse, who said that he wants to wipe Israel off the\nmap, who\'s sending the most explosive devices into Iraq, killing Americans?\n\nROBERTS: McCain is also quick to point out that an official of Hamas, the\nmilitant Palestinian Organization, says that he hopes that Barack Obama\nbecomes the next president.\n\n*Clinton Comes to Obama\'s Defense, Says Bush Comments are "Outrageous" and\n"Deeply Offensive"*  (CNN 05/16/08 8:20am)\nJOHN ROBERTS: Even Senator Hillary Clinton took a break from all of the\nin-fighting to back her fellow Democrat.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON: I think what President Bush did today was to make an\noutrageous and deeply offensive comparison. I just reject it out of hand and\nI think that any fair minded American will reject it out of hand.\n\n*Obama Blasts Bush\'s "False Political Attacks"* (CNN 05/16/08 8:20am)\nJOHN ROBERTS: On Obama released this statement to CNN saying, "It is sad\nthat President Bush would use a speech to the Knesset on the 60th\nanniversary of Israel\'s independence...to launch a false political attack."\n\n\nHighlight #3\n*Biden: Bush Comment is "Hypocrisy", McCain Flip Flop on Hamas is "Raw Ugly\nPolitics*" (CNN 05/16/08 7:20am)\nJOHN ROBERTS: He has mostly resisted the temptation to weigh in on the\nelection campaign but yesterday President Bush jumped in with both feet. In\na speech to Israel\'s Knesset he appeared to take a dramatic swipe at Barack\nObama who said he would meet with the leaders of nations like Iran, Syria,\nand Venezuela in his first year in office without precondition. President\nBush likened that policy to the allies attempts to appease Hitler prior to\nWorld War II [...] Senator, BS, strong words. Why did it touch such a nerve\nwith you?\n\nJOE BIDEN: Well because I find it so damaging for the United States. It\'s so\nrare for a president of the United States, as you know John, to be abroad\nand use such a forum as a political forum. It makes us look foolish around\nthe world. And it makes the rest of the world look at President Bush and\nrealize what hypocrisy there is. Here he\'s negotiating with North Korea, he\nnegotiated with Lybia, Kadafi, a terrorist. He in fact has engaged in a\npolicy where Secretary Gates, his own Secretary of State, says we have to\nsit down with Iran, as well as his Secretary of State says we have to sit\ndown with Iran [...]\n\nROBERTS: You think it was malarkey, Senator John McCain, Senator John McCain\ndid not though. He immediately jumped on the president\'s comments. Let\'s\nhear what he said about it yesterday.\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: It is a serious error on the part of Senator Obama. It shows\nnaivete and inexperience and lack of judgment.\n\nROBERTS: [...]What do you think of what he said yesterday?\n\nBIDEN: I think there\'s an emerging pattern here. That they\'re gonna try to\nhave rhetoric, highly charged rhetoric masqueraded as policy. This\nPresident\'s policy has made us much weaker in the Middle East. Israel is\nmuch more at risk then it was before he became president. Iran is closer to\nthe bomb. John himself, as the Washington Post reports today, has said two\nyears ago at Davos that we\'re probably gonna have to sit down with Hamas,\nthat\'s John McCain. This is raw ugly politics. It makes it look like to the\nrest of the world that we may have a Republican president again [...] who\ndoesn\'t understand the world, who they don\'t want to cooperate with. It just\nundermines the United States\' credibility. And it seems to be an emerging\nugly pattern here. John said a week and half ago, I\'m paraphrasing here,\n\'the fact that Hamas likes Obama and the fact that Danny Ortega likes him\nyou judge for yourself.\' What kind of character assassination is that? [...]\n\nROBERTS: Senator Biden let me just go into a little more detail about what\nyou mentioned regarding Senator McCain and what\'s in the Washington Post\ntoday. Jamie Rubin [...] interviewed Senator McCain and he talked to John\nMcCain about the new Hamas government and Senator McCain said, "They\'re the\ngovernment sooner or later we are going to deal with them, one way or\nanother." So there seems to be a suggestion there from Senator McCain that\nthey were legitimately elected, at some point the United States is gonna\nhave to, if not sit down at the table with these folks, at least have some\nsort of engagement with them.\n\nBIDEN: Look John, how do you get to the point where you change the behavior\nof Iran, which is not good behavior, bad behavior, unless you actually sit\nacross the table from them and lay out clearly what the alternatives are.\nJohn Kennedy, when he was president, once said, "We should negotiate out of\nfear but we should never fear to negotiate."\n\n\nHighlight #4\n*Thompson Accuses Obama of Naivet\xe9 for Advocating Diplomacy with Iran *(FNC\n05/16/08 8:10am)\nSTEVE DOOCY: And in fact, Senator, when you look at John McCain he\'s, you\nknow where he stands on stuff like this. When you look at Barack Obama, he\'s\nmade it very clear in the past, he said he would deal with, he would\nnegotiate with the people who run Iran.\n\nTHOMPSON: My understanding is the outrage is based upon the fact, in effect,\nwe have never advocated negotiating with terrorists, we have just advocated\nnegotiating with terrorist sponsors. The major state sponsor of terrorism,\nIran [...] But it points out something that\'s very fundamental and that is\nthe leader of the free world has to not be a babe in the woods in these\nareas, he has to have some experience, has to know what he\'s doing, has to\nbe not naive in dealing with people who are responsible with the death of\nlots of Americans.\n\n*Thompson Quells Concern of Conservatives About McCain, Says He is "Very\nSolid" on National Security, Supreme Court, Taxes, and Trade* (FNC 05/15/08\n8:10am)\nSTEVE DOOCY: Let\'s talk a little bit about the conservative wing of the\nRepublican Party [...] John McCain, some have said, is just not conservative\nenough. He is, however, your candidate. How is he gonna, how are the two\ngonna get together by November?\n\nFRED THOMPSON: John is very solid on the things that are the most important\nto the future of this country. And I consider that to be National Security.\nI\'ve traveled a lot of places with him. He knows the way the world operates.\nHe knows most of the world leaders and he\'s tough, and a long way from being\nnaive [...] He is solid on the appointment of federal judges, which I think\nis the second most important thing that a president does and will do. Not\nonly possibly a couple of Supreme Court nominations, but other of the 700\nmembers of the judiciary. And I might add taxes and trade [...]\n\n\n\n\n-- \nGregory E.
