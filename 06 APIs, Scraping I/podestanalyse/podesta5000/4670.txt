On October 11th, John Slattery, star of the Emmy Award winning series Mad Men, will go door-to-door with LCV volunteers to encourage Virginians to vote for Senator Obama.\n\n"John Slattery connects with mass audiences through his television and film work and now he will help us connect with the tens of thousands of households on behalf of Barack Obama," said LCV President Gene Karpinski. "We are thrilled that the man who brings Roger Sterling to life will bring even more excitement to LCV\'s effort to win Virginia and the White House for Barack Obama.  Mad Men is one of the most critically acclaimed and entertaining dramas on television, and Mr. Slattery will help bring attention to the clean energy solutions our country so desperately needs."\n\nJohn Slattery plays an advertising executive in 1960\'s Manhattan in the stylized and provocative AMC hit.  A veteran actor, Slattery has recently appeared on screen in the films Flags of our Fathers, Charlie Wilson\'s War, and Traffic.  He has also appeared in Sex and the City, Will and Grace, and Desperate Housewives.\n\n"Politicians have been talking about energy independence almost since the days of Mad Men," Karpinski said. "But the time has come to make clean, renewable, American energy a reality.  LCV supports Barack Obama because he has the most comprehensive energy plan ever offered by a nominee for president."\n\nLCV volunteers have been going door-to-door in Northern Virginia for the last several weeks to encourage swing voters to support Obama for President, and they will continue to do so every weekend between now and election day. The 2008 presidential race may be decided by just a handful of voters in Virginia and knocking on doors and engaging voters can  make the difference between John McCain and Barack Obama, between a continuation of the Bush energy policies that led to today\'s energy crisis and a new energy future with millions of new jobs, greater national security, and a comprehensive plan to deal with global warming.\n\nAnyone interested in meeting Mr. Slattery and talking to their neighbors about Senator Obama is encouraged to join LCV on Saturday, October 11 at 10:00am in Northern Virginia.
