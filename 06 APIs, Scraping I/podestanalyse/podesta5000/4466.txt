Honestly, talk about letting\nCEO's off the hook!  Given wall street kerfuffle, seems like a good move.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-collar-crime-prosecution_564a2336e4b06037734a2f84\n\n\n\n\n\nwe are trying to come to an agreement to get rid of it in the final package\nof cjs in the House (not in Senate bill, but now w/ house moves, Hatch\ntrying to add to the senate).  I think her ripping it would actually help\nour negotiations.\n"
