john.podesta@gmail.comb"John -- \n\nWhen I last emailed you a few months ago, I told you about\nmy dad, Reuven, who was killed this past September in a\nmass shooting in Minneapolis.\n\nSince then, I've been fighting every single day to reduce\ngun violence, so no one else ever has to grieve like I did.\n\nWhen the Senate defeated a bill that would expand background\nchecks last week, I just couldn't believe it. Something\nthat 90 percent of Americans support should be a slam dunk.\n\nRight now, we might be witnessing the greatest disconnect\nbetween Congress and the American people in our history. \n\nThis is why Organizing for Action's job is so important.\nTogether, we can make sure that no one in Washington ever\ngets away with ignoring the voices of the people who sent\nthem there -- no matter how powerful the special interests.\n\nAdd your name -- say you're ready to keep on fighting:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Keep-Fighting\n\nI can't get over the fact that those 45 senators cast their\nvotes against background checks while family members of the\nvictims of Newtown, Tucson, and Virginia Tech watched from\nthe Senate gallery.\n\nCould those senators even look those families in the eye\nand explain themselves?\n\nThe truth I'm finding is that the gun lobby has got decades\nworth of money and organizing behind them, and they know\nhow to stir their supporters into a frenzy.\n\nBut 90 percent of this country is on our side, not theirs.\nIf we all step up, we will be heard. And we will win the\nnext vote.\n\nThis past weekend, thousands of OFA supporters got together \nat 45 targeted events across the country to thank the senators \nwho stood up for us, and to tell the senators who caved to the \nspecial interests that we're not about to give up this fight.\n\nThat's the kind of action I'm talking about. Join in -- let's make sure \nthat Wednesday was the most powerful the gun lobby will ever be \nin Washington.\n\nAdd your name right now: \n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Keep-Fighting\n\nThanks. Now back to work.\n\nSami\n\nSami Rahamim\nMinneapolis, MN\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for Action.\n\nContributions or gifts to Organizing for Action are not tax deductible.\n\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo update your address, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/change-address?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe from these messages, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscription\nOrganizing for Action, P.O.
