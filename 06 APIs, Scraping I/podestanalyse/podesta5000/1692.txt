john.podesta@gmail.comb'ProgressNow Colorado\n\n\nDear Friend,\n\nA shocking update to the story of John Suthers\' questionable campaign\ndonations from payday lenders was published in today\'s Grand Junction\nSentinel. According to legal counsel for Governor Ritter, the rules\nSuthers\' office wrote to regulate payday lending would actually allow\nlenders to charge\xa0more in fees, rather than\xa0less as the law\nintended.\n\nProposed payday loan rule \'absurd,\' says Ritter\'s\nattorney\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=0Cw1KtsjIlWpv5Z0MEDzDg..\nCharles Ashby, Grand Junction Sentinel\n\n...Under the old law, those fees and rates could amount to as much as\n520 percent per year. The new law limits fees to $7.50 a month for\nevery $100 loaned, and an interest rate of no more than 45 percent.\n\nIn a letter to Attorney General John Suthers\' office this week,\nWelling said one rule could result in fees and rates far higher than\nallowed under the old law.\n\n"A borrower who repaid a loan ... would pay a $60 nonrefundable\nfinance charge (on a $300, two-week loan) as well as $5.19 in prorated\ninterest, for a total 565 percent annual percentage rate,"\nWelling wrote.\n\n"Increasing the annual percentage rate from 520 percent to 565\npercent would frustrate legislative intent to the point of\nabsurdity."\n\nAn advocacy group, Coloradans for Payday Lending Reform, echoed\nWelling\'s comments in a similar letter, saying that\'s not\nwhat the Colorado Legislature intended when it approved the new law\nduring this year\'s session.\n\nIf true, it\'s a blatant subversion of the legislature\'s intent to\ncrack down on abusive, predatory payday lenders--and after Suthers\ntook over $10,000 from payday lenders during the time his office was\ndrafting the new rules, this reeks of the worst kind of corrupt\nbackroom dealing. If you haven\'t already, please sign our petition\ndemanding that Suthers immediately return donations he received from\nthe payday lending industry while his office drafted these proposed\nnew rules.\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=n2cC_nUjxf58vLfr8PYBZw..\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=Qhnlk_M_Heyj9sFFmazvyA..\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=i6Pz0F6vK_O4pHSm16ugWg..\n\nAnd the time is now to make sure your friends and neighbors get the\nfacts. Please forward this email widely, and post the above link to\nyour Facebook page or website. With each passing day this scandal\ndeepens, and these protections for Colorado\'s most economically\nvulnerable citizens are too important to be gutted behind closed\ndoors. Thanks for doing your part.\n\nKjersten\n\n\xa0\n\n---------- Original message ----------\nFrom: Kjersten Forseth, ProgressNow Colorado\n<info@progressnowcolorado.org>\nDate: Tue, Aug 24, 2010 at 9:33 AM\nSubject: Return the dirty money now!\n\nDear Friend,\n\nSuthers Payday Lending\nLast week, nonpartisan watchdog group Colorado Ethics Watch called on\nAttorney General John Suthers to immediately give back a sudden burst\nof donations he received from the payday lending\nindustry-donations received at the same time his office is\ndrafting new rules restricting predatory payday lending in Colorado.\nWhat\'s worse, a legislative staffer has asserted that the new rules\nare not as strict as the law requires! The obvious conflict of\ninterest this represents is very serious.\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=-YS-y32uXQWIbqMM-oWpHg..\n\nClick below to demand Suthers immediately return the thousands he\nrecently received from payday lenders:\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=XL5attB2QY3dCq8AbMrebA..\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=Pvi4Yd29LG9jirtut_yr9A..\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=2ZkVIzWtb_WX0uOQ9eJqmA..\n\nAs the state\'s highest law enforcement officer, Suthers has the\nstrictest obligation to remain free of conflicts of interest.\nAccording to the Grand Junction Sentinel last week, with further\nreporting by the Durango Herald, Suthers received over $10,000 from\nPACs and donors associated with the payday lending industry in recent\nweeks. Prior to this, Suthers had never received significant\ncontributions from the payday lending industry (Grand Junction\nSentinel, 8/14/2010).\n\nAt the same time Suthers\' re-election campaign accepted these\ndonations, Suthers\' office was drafting new rules governing the\npredatory payday lending industry, as mandated by the Colorado\nlegislature\'s passage this year of tough reforms to protect\nconsumers, and limit the exorbitant interest charged by these lenders.\nLimits on payday lending had been sought for many years unsuccessfully\nby ProgressNow Colorado and a broad coalition of consumer advocacy\norganizations.\n\nAfter everything we have fought for to reform predatory payday\nlending, is Attorney General Suthers stabbing Colorado consumers in\nthe back? John Suthers opposed House Bill 1351, and has continued to\ndisparage the legislation as a defense against questions about his\noffice\'s handling of the proposed new rules. But according to a\nlegislative staffer interviewed by the Sentinel, Suthers\'\nproposed rules are not as strict on payday lenders as the law signed\nby the Governor.\n\nWe can\'t allow dirty payday loan money to influence the judgment\nof our highest elected officials. Sign our petition-demand that\nSuthers immediately return these donations from the payday loan\nindustry.\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=iikEvLKlVQD1EkzQlJ--Kg..\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=0-qbChLsy9RisO4qAdaPSg..\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=czZ51AsG2VL2MYTnq5cH4A..\n\nUnder the old rules, payday lenders made $75 to loan $500 for two\nweeks or less. That means the payday lenders had to exploit nearly 140\nColoradans to give Suthers his $10,000. That\'s reason enough for\nSuthers to be ashamed, but to take this money while weakening the new\nprotections that ProgressNow Colorado members, and concerned citizens\naround the state fought for year after year, would be totally\nunacceptable.\n\nDon\'t let Suthers get away with it.\n\nhttp://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=N49peqRmpkgGqCp6c6bI5g..\n\nAnd thanks for standing up for integrity in Colorado\'s highest\npublic officials.\n\nSincerely,\nKjersten Forseth\nProgressNow Colorado\n\n\n\n\xa9 2010 ProgressNow Colorado.
