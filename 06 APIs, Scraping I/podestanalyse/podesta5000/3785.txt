This movement needs supporters like you to step up and volunteer right now.\n\nThe simplest tasks are also the most important and the most effective.\n\nHere are some easy ways you can get involved today.\n\n     *Join a local organizing group: http://my.barackobama.com/groups\n\n     *Find events near you: http://my.barackobama.com/events\n\n     *Create your own fundraising page: http://my.barackobama.com/fundraising \n\nThis campaign has always been about change -- and real change comes from the bottom up, not from the top down. Supporters like you organizing and fundraising at the grassroots level will make the difference, and we have all the tools to help you do that.\n\nEven if you've never been involved in politics before, it's easy and doesn't require any experience. \n\nThis election is too important to sit on the sidelines. And together, there's nothing we can't do.\n\nBarack\n\n\nDonate: https://donate.barackobama.com/wecan\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Obama for America\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscribe\n\n"
