Although anchors were quick to\nrepeat GOP talking points of Obama\'s travel as being part \'political\' and\noccurring too late, several outlets still noted the contradictory criticisms\nemanating from the McCain campaign on this issue. There were mentions of\nMcCain\'s rebuke of Jill Hazelbaker\'s photo-op comment from yesterday. Top\nMcCain surrogates Tim Pawlenty and Mitt Romney gave interviews this morning,\nboth faithfully delivering the message that Obama is campaigning for the\n"President of Europe" and that the entire trip to the Middle East is more\nabout politics than policy. Political-related news touched on an EPA report\nabout climate change and health concerns, Bill Clinton\'s willingness to\ncampaign for Obama, Al Gore\'s environmental speech on Thursday, new\nRepublican smears against Michelle Obama, and an interview Speaker Pelosi\ngave to Wolf Blitzer attacking President Bush. Segments about the release of\nthe new Batman movie, an increase in travel costs, an apparent parachute\nmishap, and a missing child story, were on constant rotation throughout the\nday.\nHighlights:\n1.     MSNBC: Pawlenty disparages Obama for speaking in Europe, campaigning\nfor "President of Europe"\n2.     NBC: Romney similarly attacks Obama, also saying Obama should have\nproposed policy after fact-finding trip rather than before\n3.     ABC: Tapper analyzes McCain position on Obama trip\n4.

How many trips\nto Iraq have you taken?\nTIM PAWLENTY: I\'ve taken three Mike and the last one was last year. I\'m\nglad, we\'re glad the McCain campaign said Senator Obama is finally getting\nback to Iraq. He\'s only been there once. He hasn\'t been there almost three\nyears. If you\'re going to make pronouncements about war, be helpful if you\nhad some on the ground experience. So we applaud his decision to go. And we\napplaud his decision to migrate more towards McCain\'s position on these\nissues. But I am concerned about the unprecedented political rallies he\'s\ngoing to be having across Europe. *It\'s one thing to meet with world\nleaders. It\'s another thing to be basically campaigning for President of\nEurope, it seems. And that\'s a little unprecedented and concerning if he\'s\ngoing to be having political rallies.*\nBARNICLE: Aren\'t you encouraged though? Everything, all the reporting says\nthat in the papers are that Europeans are down on America because of Iraq\nand they don\'t like the Bush administration. So this might be some element\nof the United States of America might like? That\'s kind of encouraging don\'t\nyou think?\nPAWLENTY: Well again I segregate the trip. I applaud the Iraq and\nAfghanistan trip but I don\'t think he\'s ever by the way set foot in\nAfghanistan even though he\'s making pronouncements about the war. But going\nto Europe and meeting with those leaders and introducing himself, trying to\nbuild good relations, that\'s positive. But it looks like he\'s planning what\nlooks like political rallies in Europe. And I think that\'s unprecedented and\nto me it seems a little untoward.\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI: Ok let me try to give you the other side of that. And that\nis that one could argue that we are at a time, a moment in history where\nsome feel that our international reputation is at stake. And perhaps Barack\nObama is going there to build on not only his foreign policy credentials but\nalso work on something that has been ripped to shreds over the past 8 years.\n\nPAWLENTY: And I think that\'s good in that you saw Senator McCain go to\nColombia for example. He met with President Uribe, he met with the Defense\nSec. Santos, others at high level official meetings. He didn\'t go out and\nhave rallies and politicize the trip in Colombia, or in Canada. He kept it\nin the context of formal policy speeches or meeting with officials. This\ntrip seems designed to have kind of a political rally or campaign rally\ncomponent to it. If you\'re a sitting President that would be good or a\nsitting official but it seems a little bit odd if your in the middle of a\nPresidential campaign that he\'d be having these political rallies on this\ntrip.\nBARNICLE: What\'s odd about it? The guys a politician. You\'re a politician. I\nmean if you were given the opportunity, I mean if somebody said to you we\'re\nthe government of Germany we\'d like you to stand up and speak before 4,000\npeople or how many people, what would you say? No I don\'t want to do it\nbecause I\'m the Gov of Minnesota and I don\'t want to speak when I\'m\noverseas. It\'s odd. This complaint seems odd.\nPAWLENTY: Well I think it\'s a question of is it political or is it policy?\nHe\'s a sitting Senator and in that capacity the right and opportunity to go\nand deal with those kinds of issues or have those kinds of meetings but are\nthose things really designed to advance a policy discussion and the United\nStates national security interests which we try not to politicize as\nofficials? *Or is it designed to be part of his campaign? And if it\'s part\nof his campaign, campaigning in Europe, seems to be perhaps unusual or\nunprecedented at least in my knowledge about Presidential campaigning.*\n<https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/em3kyys080>\n\nHighlight #2\n*Romney Attacks Obama\'s Trip As \'Campaign Swing,\' Distances Himself From\nPast Criticism of McCain* (NBC 07/18/08)\nMITT ROMNEY: *As a campaign swing more than a fact-finding tour, it\'s\nunfortunate that he developed this policy with regards to the surge before\nhe was actually there 20 see how the surge might be progressing. As a matter\nof fact, had he been president a year ago he would have said no to the\nsurge, pulled out our troops and we would be in a setting where al qaeda\nwould be planning attacks against us from Iraq. We\'re fortunate he wasn\'t\npresident and not doing this tour at a time when it could have shaped his\npolicy with regards to iraq and foreign policy*. [...]\n\nROMNEY: I\'m sure he\'ll be warmly received. People of different political\nbackgrounds are warmly received there. I don\'t know whether he\'ll be able to\nerase the things he\'s already said. My guess is he\'ll say don\'t confuse me\nwith the facts. My mind is already made up. He\'s already said what he\'d do\nwithout the benefit of speaking to General Petraeus and leaders on the\nground there. John McCain is saying, look, his goal get the troops out by\nthe end of his first term. They\'re in a combat setting, and get that done\nbut not going to do it based upon some artificial political timetable.\n\nMATT LAUER: [...] *Primary races, of course, good news you get to run for\npresident. Bad news, everything you say during that primary race comes back\nto haunt you in some caes. Here what you said, quote, in January, \'I frankly\ndon\'t think Senator McCain despite his service and length of experience will\nbe able to stand up to the message that Barack Obama has brought forward. I\nthink Barack Obama would be able to do the John McCain exactly what he was\nable to do to other senators who are running on the democratic side.\' So if\nthat\'s what you said in January, why do you think John McCain\'s now the man?\n*\n\nROMNEY: Well, no question when it comes to Barack Obama you\'ve got a\ncharming person, well spoken. He speaks beautifully. But i think in the\nfinal analysis that the sweet talk is going to give way to straight\ntalk.  [...]\nBarack is very tough. No question about that. When I was running in the\nprimary I thought i was the right guy to run against Barack Obama. When it\ncomes to comparison between John McCain and Barack Obama I know who I\'d\npick, who America should choose and in the final analysis will choose the\nguy that\'s been there, has the experience, demonstrated right on the surge,\nauthor of it, his work.\n\nLAUER: They worry about John McCain and the economy. Six in ten a poll feel\nthat John McCain will continue basically the policies of our current\npresident George Bush. 54% to 35% in a Washington Post abc poll think Barack\nObama will best handle the economy. With the economy being the biggest issue\non the minds of voters, that\'s got to be a real problem for John McCain.\nDoesn\'t it?\n\nROMNEY: It\'s a big opportunity for John McCain. As they understand Barack\nObama\'s position, the John McCain position, the American people will say,\nguess what? John McCain is right on the economy. Barack Obama is wrong.\nRaising taxes, as Barack Obama would do would slow down the economy. He\'s\nadmitted that as much.\nHis energy policy is critical to the economy. Barack Obama doesn\'t want\nadditional drilling or nuclear power plants fast tracked, wants to put\nhigher tax on coal and John McCain will bring the cost of energy down.\nthat\'s the right policy. <https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/9g4mrg2lcg>\n\nHighlight #3\n*"Good Morning America" Analyzes McCain Camp\'s Position Vis-\xe0-vis Obama\'s\nTrip Overseas *(ABC 06/18/08 7:00am)\nJAKE TAPPER: From the Euphrates to the Chunnel, Barack Obama will wade into\nthe waters of international geopolitics.

As\nyou know, All three evening news anchors going over on this foreign soil\nwith Barack Obama. They know he\'s going to get a lot of attention. I think\nthey will look to take quick hits every day. And of course, pounce on any\nmistake that Barack Obama makes.

I\'m\nwondering what John McCain\'s message is today.\n\nDANA BASH: It\'s going to be talking about exactly that. [\x85] that is going to\nbe a big part of John McCain\'s message there that he has been trying to give\nacross the country on this stump talking a lot about the economy and the\nfact that he understands people are hurting. But what he\'s going to do at\nthis particular event is try to shine a light on some new technology that he\nsays he hopes will be the wave of the future and perhaps a jobs gainer in\nthe future. He\'s going to be touring this plant where they\'re hoping to and\ntrying to devise the first plug in electric car. It\'s called the Chevy Volt.\n*So you are going to hear some of the \'I feel your pain\' message from John\nMcCain but also a try to focus on some of the technologies that he says he\nhopes can be developed for in the future.*\n\nHARRIS: Hey Dana you know we\'ve heard John McCain crticize Barack Obama\'s\nupcoming overseas trip. Are we likely to hear more of that today?\n\nBASH: We are. [\x85] *in the words of one adviser it is extraordinarily\narrogant for him to be explaining his policies, his foreign policies on\nAfghanistan on Iraq which he did this week before even going.* You heard\nJohn McCain yesterday say that from his experience, he\'s travel abroad\nextensively, he waits until he comes home from a fact finding mission to\nannounce his policies. *There they feel that they have a little bit of an\nedge on something they know* Tony they know full well that this trip is\ngoing to get extensive, extensive coverage. They\'re trying to influence it\nas much they can.\n\nHARRIS*: And remind us: this is a trip McCain suggested Obama should take,\ncorrect?*\n\nBASH: *Exactly.
