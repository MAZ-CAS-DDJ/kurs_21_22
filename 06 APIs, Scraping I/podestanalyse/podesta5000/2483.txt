Please let me know if you have\nany questions.\n\nMany thanks,\nEric\n\nEric Ferrero\nVice President, Communications\nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund\n\n\nTo view Planned Parenthood\xe2\x80\x99s video, see here: Planned Parenthood: Cecile\nRichards' Official Video Response\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZUjU4e4fUI&feature=youtu.be>\n\n\n\n*A full transcript of the video is below:*\n\n\n\nHello.  I\xe2\x80\x99m Cecile Richards, President of Planned Parenthood Federation of\nAmerica.\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood provides a full range of health care services to\nmillions of women, men, and young people every year, including cancer\nscreenings, birth control, STD testing and treatment, and abortion. And we\nprovide much more than health services \xe2\x80\x93 we support millions of people as\nthey build their futures and pursue their goals.\n\n\n\nRecently, an organization that opposes safe and legal abortion used\nsecretly recorded, heavily edited videos to make outrageous claims about\nprograms that help women donate fetal tissue for medical research.\n\n\n\nI want to be really clear: The allegation that Planned Parenthood profits\nin any way from tissue donation is not true. Our donation programs \xe2\x80\x93 like\nany other high-quality health care providers \xe2\x80\x93 follow all laws and ethical\nguidelines. Over our 100-year history, we have continually engaged leading\nmedical experts to shape our practices, policies, and high standards \xe2\x80\x93 and\nalways will.\n\n\n\nOur top priority is the compassionate care that we provide. In the video,\none of our staff members speaks in a way that does not reflect that\ncompassion. This is unacceptable, and I personally apologize for the staff\nmember's tone and statements.\n\n\n\nAs always, if there is any aspect of our work that can be strengthened, we\nwant to know about it, and we take swift action to address it.\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood stands behind our work to help women and families donate\ntissue for medical research when they wish to. It is always their decision.\n\n\n\n\nI thank those women and families who have chosen tissue donation at some\npoint in their lives.  Your commitment to lifesaving research, developing\ntreatments for diseases like Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s and Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s, is important and\ncompassionate, and it should be respected \xe2\x80\x93 not attacked.\n\n\n\nWe know the real agenda of organizations behind videos like this, and they\nhave never been concerned with protecting the health and safety of women.\nTheir mission is to ban abortion completely and cut women off from care at\nPlanned Parenthood and other health centers.\n\n\n\nWe will never let that happen.\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\n\n\n*Planned Parenthood is the nation's leading provider and advocate of\nhigh-quality, affordable health care for women, men, and young people, as\nwell as the nation's largest provider of sex education. With approximately\n700 health centers across the country, Planned Parenthood organizations\nserve all patients with care and compassion, with respect and without\njudgment. Through health centers, programs in schools and communities, and\nonline resources, Planned Parenthood is a trusted source of reliable health\ninformation that allows people to make informed health decisions. We do all\nthis because we care passionately about helping people lead healthier\nlives. *\n"
