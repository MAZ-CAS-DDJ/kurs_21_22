As I said on the phone, I currently serve as Political director for\n> Penn for Hillary: a student-led organization building a Philadelphia base\n> for Hillary Clinton\'s next political endeavor. Our group started out as a\n> campus franchise of Ready for Hillary but after surpassing the goals set by\n> the national organization, we broadened our vision to include the greater\n> Philadelphia area. We\'ve formed partnerships with most of the major schools\n> in the trip-state region and we have established a network of students\n> approaching 500 members. These partnerships include strong ties to the\n> Pennsylvania College Democrats.\n>\n> As I mentioned, we\'ll be traveling to DC this week to attend the Winter\n> Meeting. Our hope is for us to form more connections within the party and\n> to establish ourselves as a resource in Philadelphia. We\'d love to meet\n> with you informally if your schedule allows. If we\'re unable to meet in DC,\n> you always have an open invitation to visit us here at Penn (we\'d love to\n> have you speak to our student body).\n>\n> *Travel Details:*\n> Arriving in DC Thursday evening and leaving Saturday night.\n>\n> *Delegation Members:*\n> Mitchell McVeigh, Co-Founder and Co-President\n> Emily Irani, Co-Founder and Co-President\n> Michael Ramdatt, Political Director\n> Robert Klein, Outreach Director\n>\n> Thanks again for being so kind. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n>\n> -Mike\n>\n> *Michael C. Ramdatt*\n> *University of Pennsylvania, 2018*\n> ramdatt@wharton.upenn.edu\n> ramdatt@seas.upenn.edu\n> 407.864.8884\n>\n>\n'
