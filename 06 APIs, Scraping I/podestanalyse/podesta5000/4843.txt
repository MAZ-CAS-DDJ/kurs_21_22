john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\r\n\r\nI wonder if it would make sense for me to join the board call tomorrow given the number of tick-tock topics that relate to agency review. Happy either way - just want to do my job efficiently. \r\n\r\nLisa\r\nSent via BlackBerry by AT&T\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: john.podesta@gmail.com\r\n\r\nDate: Wed, 29 Oct 2008 20:33:25 \r\nTo: Lisa Brown<lisabrown3660@gmail.com>\r\nSubject: Re: Issue related to all day agency review working group meeting tomorrow\r\n\r\n\r\nYes\r\nSent via BlackBerry from T-Mobile\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: "Lisa Brown" <lisabrown3660@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nDate: Wed, 29 Oct 2008 16:05:01 \r\nTo: <john.podesta@gmail.com>\r\nSubject: Re: Issue related to all day agency review working group meeting tomorrow\r\n\r\n\r\nWill add Grumet.  We will add from Change to Win list and AFL with parity\r\nbtw the two -- working out details now.  Sadly, there was little diversity\r\non their lists.  We are low esp on Hispanics and are reaching out for people\r\nto add.  Ok if we add a reasonable number for diversity purposes?\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Oct 29, 2008 at 3:52 PM, <john.podesta@gmail.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> On hayes batch, I\'d like to add jason grumet as co-lead even if we have 3\r\n> with sue tierney and elgie.
