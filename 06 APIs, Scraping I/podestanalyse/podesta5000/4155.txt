I\'ll send you both a link when it\'s up.\n\nD\n\nThis week, the Center for American Progress will bring a delegation of CAP energy and climate experts to China to discuss critical issues in the U.S.-China climate relationship and learn directly, from Chinese officials, non-government experts, and university groups what their nation is doing on energy and climate policy in the run-up to the UNFCCC conference in Paris this December.\n\nCAP has been deeply engaged in U.S.-China relations since 2009, expanding the frontier of U.S.-China cooperation and seeking new and innovative ways to study, analyze, and engage one of the most important bilateral relationships of the 21st century. CAP\'s strong and growing China program has focused on making U.S.-China climate cooperation a critical pillar of the relationship<https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/report/2014/11/10/100761/energy-and-climate-change/>. We view China\'s ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy demand as vital to the global effort to combat climate change.\n\nA key element of CAP\'s work on China is our ongoing series of staff research trips to China, which we engage in multiple times per year. These trips give a broad array of CAP experts the opportunity to discuss new ideas for climate cooperation with Chinese counterparts and to monitor China\'s progress on climate both domestically and internationally.\n\nOn this research trip, the CAP delegation will meet with experts from the Chinese People\'s Institute of Foreign Affairs, or CPIFA, as well as additional Chinese organizations and universities arranged by CPIFA. As part of this trip, the Center for American Progress expert delegation will participate in the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, or CCIEE, fourth global think tank summit<http://english.cciee.org.cn/NewsInfo.aspx?NId=9797>, an international summit in Beijing focusing on global sustainable development in 2015 and beyond.\n\nCAP experts participating in the research trip include CAP founder and board member John Podesta, Director for China Policy Melanie Hart, Vice President for Energy Policy Greg Dotson, Senior Fellow Pete Ogden, Senior Fellow Cathleen Kelly, Director for Ocean Policy Michael Conathan, Senior Fellow Joe Romm, and Special Assistant for Energy Policy Erin Auel. Podesta will also deliver remarks at the CIIEE summit.<http://cpc.people.com.cn/n/2015/0604/c83083-27103099.html>\n\nCAP will join a group of representatives from more than 50 international think tanks at the summit. Other notable representatives<http://cpc.people.com.cn/n/2015/0604/c83083-27103099.html> include former Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns of the Carnegie Endowment, former president of the European Commission and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and 2011 Nobel Laureate Thomas Sargent. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon is expected to address the summit via video message.\n\nFor additional information on previous CAP\'s dialogue programs in China see:\n\n\xb7         "Expanding the Frontier of U.S.-China Strategic Cooperation Will Require New Thinking on Both Sides of the Pacific"<https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/report/2014/11/10/100852/expanding-the-frontier-of-u-s-china-strategic-cooperation-will-require-new-thinking-on-both-sides-of-the-pacific/> by Melanie Hart\n\n\xb7         "U.S.-China Relations: Toward a New Model of Major Power Relationship"<https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/report/2014/02/20/84383/u-s-china-relations-toward-a-new-model-of-major-power-relationship/> by Rudy deLeon and Yang Jiemian\n\nFor additional information on CAP\'s climate work see:\n\n\xb7         "Developing a Blue Economy in China and the United States"<https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/report/2015/05/13/113063/developing-a-blue-economy-in-china-and-the-united-states/> by Michael Conathan\n\n\xb7         "From Bonn to Paris: Navigating the Course to an Effective International Climate Agreement"<https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/report/2015/06/19/115641/from-bonn-to-paris-navigating-the-course-to-an-effective-international-climate-agreement/> by Gwynne Taraska\n\n\xb7         "Primer on Beijing\'s Slice-and-Dice Approach to Energy and Climate Reform"<https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/report/2014/07/07/93278/primer-on-beijings-slice-and-dice-approach-to-energy-and-climate-reform/> by Melanie Hart\n\n\nDaniella Gibbs L\xe9ger\nSenior Vice President for Communications and Strategy\nCenter for American Progress\no: 202-481-8183\nm: 202-415-3739\nt: @dgibber123<https://twitter.com/dgibber123>\n\n'
