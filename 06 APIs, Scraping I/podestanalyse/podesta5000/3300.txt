"It will take a high level of discipline to do it."\n\nThe exact design of the strategy remains fluid as Bush approaches an\nannouncement of his intention to run for the Republican nomination in 2016.\nBut at its center is the idea of placing Right to Rise in charge of the\nbrunt of the biggest expense of electing Bush: television advertising and\ndirect mail.\n\n   - Jeb Bush headed on overseas trip in June\n   <http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeb-bush-headed-on-overseas-trip-in-june/>\n   - Watchdog groups: Jeb Bush, others violating campaign finance laws\n   <http://www.cbsnews.com/news/watchdog-groups-jeb-bush-others-violating-campaign-finance-laws/>\n\nRight to Rise could also break into new areas for a candidate-specific\nsuper PAC, such as data gathering, highly individualized online advertising\nand running phone banks. Also on the table, tasking the super PAC with\ncrucial campaign endgame strategies: the operation to get out the vote and\nefforts to maximize absentee and early voting on Bush\'s behalf.\n\nThe campaign itself would still handle those things that require Bush\'s\ndirect involvement, such as candidate travel. It would still pay for\nadvertising, conduct polling and collect voter data.\n\nBush\'s plans were described to The Associated Press by two Republicans and\nseveral Bush donors familiar with the plan, who spoke on condition of\nanonymity because the former Florida governor has not yet announced his\ncandidacy.\n\nBush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said: "Any speculation on how a potential\ncampaign would be structured, if he were to move forward, is premature at\nthis time."\n\nThe strategy aims to take maximum advantage of the new world of campaign\nfinance created by a pair of 2010 Supreme Court decisions and counts on the\nFederal Election Commission to remain a passive regulator with little\nwillingness to confront those pushing the envelope of the law.\n\nFor Bush, the potential benefits are enormous. Campaigns can raise only\n$2,700 per donor for the primary and $2,700 for the general election. But\nsuper PACs are able to raise unlimited cash from individuals\n<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-jeb-bush-aims-to-raise-100-million-in-three-months/>,\ncorporations and groups such as labor unions.\n\nThe main limitation on super PACs is that they cannot coordinate their\nactivities with a campaign. The risk for Bush is that his super PAC will\nnot have access to the candidate and his senior strategists to make pivotal\ndecisions about how to spend the massive amount of money it will take to\nwin the Republican nomination and, if successful, secure the 270 electoral\nvotes he will need to follow his father and brother into the White House.\n\nSuper PACs got their start in presidential politics when former aides to\nGOP nominee Mitt Romney set one up to support him at the outset of the 2012\ncampaign. The group, called Restore Our Future, raised and spent more than\n$142 million. By comparison, his formal campaign raised $446 million.\n\nThe primary complication is the ban on coordination. For example, if the\ncampaign decided to change its focus from one issue to another, it could\nnot share that decision with the super PAC.\n\nOne way Bush is already addressing the coordination ban is by frontloading\nhis efforts inside Right to Rise. Because he is not yet a candidate, he can\nnow spend time raising money for the super PAC and take part in strategic\ncampaign planning under its auspices.\n\nCritics also believe that coordination can take place surreptitiously, and\nsuch illegal activity isn\'t punished by an FEC comprised of three\nDemocratic and three Republican members unable to agree on most anything.\n\nFormer FEC commissioner Scott Thomas, a Democrat, doubts the Justice\nDepartment would ever look at such a case because the FEC has been so\nprecise in detailing what is allowed and what is not.\n\n"You\'d have to show a true smoking gun, showing the candidate controlling\nthe campaign and the super PAC," said Thomas, a lawyer now in private\npractice in Washington. He can\'t see campaign operatives being that clumsy:\n"It would have to be a smoking gun left by someone who had the intelligence\nof an advanced fern."\n\n\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups\n"HRCRapid" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an\nemail to hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "HRCRapid" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n'
