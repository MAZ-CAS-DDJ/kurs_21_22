As a high school student in Illinois, Clinton began to\nlearn that faith must be lived out through a lens of social justice and\nhuman rights.\n\n\nUpon first hearing Martin Luther King Jr. when he visited Chicago in 1962,\nClinton began to see the social and racial struggles that were taking\nplaces throughout the United States. As a minister trained in both law and\ntheology, I see in Secretary Clinton a fighter for the marginalized, a\nvoice for the struggling, and a comforter for the overburdened.\n\n\nSecretary Clinton has also come to be one of our nation\xe2\x80\x99s greatest\nadvocates for my generation, the millennials. As senator, Hillary Clinton\nfought to expand college affordability by introducing legislation to boost\nawareness of student financial aid through outreach programs. She also\nfought to restore the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s cuts to Pell Grants, and\nco-sponsored legislation to establish centers on college campuses to assist\nveterans.\n\n\nI have the distinct privilege of serving as the State Director of New\nLeaders Council, which works to recruit, train and promote the progressive\nentrepreneurs of tomorrow \xe2\x80\x94 trendsetters, elected officials and civically\nengaged leaders in business and industry who will shape the future\nlandscape of our state. Over and over again, I find millennials who are\ncraving to be led by authentic public voices not afraid to share the faith\nthat spurs them to social action. The millennials I know see beyond the\npolarizing reality that has defined faithful discourse for much of the 20th\ncentury. They see another way, a way that Secretary Clinton understands.\n\n\nNorth Carolina is a state where people are not afraid to share their faith,\nand strive to reclaim the victories of the civil rights leaders who guided\nus forward. Here in North Carolina, however, we have experienced\nsignificant challenges to progress. Cuts to our university system, cuts to\nour public schools, and cuts to healthcare access have defined the past\nseveral years of legislative action. Secretary Clinton understands these\nchallenges, but more importantly, she understands how to work with people\nof faith, including a new generation of leaders, as we seek to restore a\ncommitment to justice and equal opportunity right here at home.\n\n\n\n*Andrew Barnhill is the State Director of New Leaders Council-North\nCarolina. He is the youngest member of the Executive Council of the North\nCarolina Democratic Party.*\n'
