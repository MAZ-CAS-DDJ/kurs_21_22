Thank you, Danny, for that introduction.  And thank you all for coming out today.  I\x92ve been traveling all over New Hampshire, and everywhere I go \x96 from Dover to Nashua to Glen to Windham \x96 people ask great questions.  It must come from being the first primary state.  So today, I want to talk for just a little bit, and then I want to hear what\x92s on your mind.\n\nThis election is about the choices we have to make as a country, and how they\x92ll shape our children\x92s and grandchildren\x92s futures.  I believe that, in America, if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead.  That\x92s the basic bargain that\x92s always set our nation apart.  And I want to make sure we keep that bargain and strengthen it, so it holds true for this generation and the next.\n\nThanks to your hard work \x96 and the hard work of people across the country \x96 America has come back from the worst recession of our lifetimes.  We\x92re standing again.  But we\x92re not yet running the way we should.  Corporate profits are near record highs \x96 but most paychecks have barely budged.  Costs for everything from childcare to prescription drugs are rising faster than wages. It\x92s no wonder so many Americans feel like the deck is stacked in favor of those at the top.\n\nWe\x92ve got to do better.  We\x92ve got to get incomes rising again, so more hard-working families can afford a middle-class life.  We need strong growth\x85 fair growth\x85 and long-term growth.  That\x92s how we\x92ll achieve lasting prosperity \x96 by building an economy that we all have a stake in, and that works for everyone.\n\nToday, I want to talk about one way we do that:  by making college affordable and available to every American.\n\nFor millions of Americans, a college degree has been the ticket to a better life.  My grandfather worked his entire life in a lace mill \x96 but my dad made it to college and was able to start his own small business, and that made a huge difference in our lives.  Then my parents scrimped and saved for years, so they could send me to a school across the country.  They knew that they were setting me on the path to a better future.  College still holds that promise today.  A lot has changed in this country \x96 but that hasn\x92t.\n\nAcross America, parents are starting college funds the day their kids are born.  High-schoolers \x96 even middle-schoolers \x96 are taking college prep courses and studying for the SAT.  Full-time workers are going to night school, even if that means heading straight from an eight-hour shift to a pile of homework.  If that\x92s what it takes to get a better job \x96 to give their kids better than they had \x96 then they\x92ll do it.\n\nBut here\x92s the problem.  States are slashing education budgets.  Colleges keep raising prices.  In-state tuition and fees for public colleges increased by 55 percent between 2003 and 2012.  But your incomes didn\x92t rise by that much, did they?  So families are left facing a painful choice.  Either you say, \x93We just can\x92t afford it,\x94 and pass up on all the opportunities that a degree can offer \x96 or you do whatever it takes to pay for it, even if that means going deeply into debt.\n\nAnd more and more, that debt is holding people back.  Forty million Americans have student loans.  Together, they owe more than a trillion dollars.  New Hampshire\x92s students are carrying the highest debt in the country.  And millions of Americans are delinquent or in default.  Even if they\x92re doing everything they can to pay their loans, they just can\x92t keep up.\n\nThe cost of this debt is real \x96 not just on balance sheets, but in people\x92s lives and futures.  I\x92ve talked to people who have so much student debt, they\x92ve put off buying a house, changing jobs, starting a business \x96 even getting married.  I\x92ve met parents and grandparents who\x92ve co-signed loans and end up draining their savings or ruining their credit \x96 all because they did what parents and grandparents are supposed to do \x96 help out the next generation.\n\nThere are students who take out loans to pay for an expensive degree from a for-profit institution \x96 then graduate and discover that, when it comes to finding a job, their degree isn\x92t worth what they thought it would.\n\nAnd the 40 percent of students who never finish college are left with debt and no degree to show for it \x96 the worst of both worlds.  And that non-completion rate should trouble to all of us.  It\x92s the highest in the developed world.\n\nCollege is supposed to help people achieve their dreams.  But more and more, it\x92s pushing people\x92s dreams further out of reach.  And that\x92s just wrong.  It\x92s a betrayal of everything college is supposed to represent \x96 and everything families have worked so hard to achieve.\n\nThis is also about our national competitiveness.  The rest of the world is working as hard as they can to out-do us.  China plans to double the number of students enrolled in college by 2030, which means they\x92ll have nearly 200 million college graduates.  That\x92s more than our entire workforce!  American workers can out-work and out-innovate anyone in the world \x96 as long as they get the training and education they need to compete.\n\nSo we need to make some big changes.  We need to transform how much higher education costs \x96 and how those costs get paid.  For too long, families have had to bear the burden of soaring prices, underinvestment, and too little accountability.\n\nIt\x92s time for a new college compact, where everyone does their part.  We need to make a quality education affordable and available to everyone willing to work for it.\n\nI\x92ve been traveling the country for months, talking to students and families, educators, legislators, and experts of every stripe \x96 including young progressive activists who\x92ve put the issue of debt-free college and college affordability at the top of the national agenda.\n\nAnd today, I\x92m announcing my plan to put college within reach for everyone.  We\x92re calling it the New College Compact.  And we\x92re posting it on our website, Facebook, Medium, Snapchat \x96 just about everywhere we can think of.  I hope you\x92ll check it out.  But for now, here are the basics.\n\nUnder the New College Compact, schools will have to control their costs and show more accountability to their students.\n\nStates will have to meet their obligation to invest in higher education.\n\nThe federal government will never profit off student loans.\n\nNo family \x96 and no student \x96 should have to borrow to pay tuition at a public college.\n\nAnd everyone who has student debt will be able to refinance it at lower rates.\n\nThat\x92s my plan.  It\x92s ambitious \x96 and we should be ambitious.  But it\x92s also achievable.  And it would make a big difference in people\x92s lives.\n\nMy College Compact comes down to two main goals.\n\nFirst, we\x92ll make sure that cost won\x92t be a barrier.\n\nUnder my plan, you\x92ll never have to take out a loan to pay for tuition at an in-state public university.  We\x92re going to make community college free \x96 that\x92s President Obama\x92s plan and we\x92re making it ours too.  We\x92re reforming Pell Grants, so students can use them for living costs as well as tuition.  We\x92re offering special help to college students who are parents, because when you help a parent get an education, you\x92re helping their kids, too.\n\nWe\x92re going to work with historically black colleges and universities, because they serve some of America\x92s brightest students, who need the most support and too often have gotten the least of it.  And we\x92re going to help pay for college for students who agree to national service.  If you\x92re willing to tutor America\x92s kids or clean up our parks, the least we can do is support your education.\n\nAnd second, we\x92ll make sure that debt won\x92t hold anyone back.\n\nUnder my plan, every borrower in America who already has student debt will get the chance to refinance at lower interest rates.  If you can refinance your mortgage or your car loan, you should be able to refinance your student loan.\n\nIf you do still end up taking out a loan \x96 for example, to go to a private college \x96 we\x92ll cut your interest rates, so the government never makes a profit off your loan.\n\nWe\x92ll make it easier to enroll in income-based repayment programs, so you\x92ll never have to pay more than 10 percent of what you make.\n\nWe\x92re going to help borrowers who are in default get back on their feet.  And we\x92ll crack down on predatory schools and lenders and bill collectors.  If you defraud students, overcharge veterans, or mislead borrowers, we\x92re going to do everything we can to stop you.\n\nThere\x92s a lot more in my College Compact \x96 from encouraging innovations like online learning and apprenticeships, so students can earn their degree in less time and move straight into a job\x85 to strengthening the G.I. Bill, so more of our veterans can get their degree... to making sure colleges spending federal dollars on things that benefit students, like teaching and research \x96 not marketing campaigns or big salaries for administrators.\n\nI plan to make college affordability a major issue in this campaign \x96 because it\x92s a major issue for millions of American families.  Here\x92s the bottom line.  An education shouldn\x92t be something just for those at the top.  And it shouldn't be a burden.  An education should be affordable \x96 and available \x96 to everyone.\n\nI remember how proud my parents were when I graduated college.  I remember how proud Bill and I were to see Chelsea graduate \x96 I\x92ll never forget how grown-up she looked that day.  And even though my new granddaughter is already growing up faster than I\x92d like, I can\x92t wait to see her walk across a stage someday and receive her diploma. And I know that mothers and fathers and grandparents across the country feel the exact same way.\n\nI want every young person in America to have their shot at that moment.  I want every hard-working parent out there to get the chance to see his or her child cross a stage \x96 or to cross it themselves.  America should be a place where those achievements are possible for anyone who\x92s willing to work hard to do their part.  That\x92s the country I want to help build \x96 for this generation and all the generations to come.\n\nThank you very much.  And now, let\x92s hear from you.\n\n\n\n\n--\nAnn O'Leary\nSenior Policy Advisor\nHillary for America\nCell: 510-717-5518\n<8-7-15 draft NH college town hall 730pm - AOL.docx>\n\nThis email is intended only for the named addressee.
