And we're going to begin this next chapter in the\nAmerican story together.\n\nSign up and stay updated:\n\nhttp://action.2013pic.org/Inauguration\n\nThanks,\n\nBarack\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by the Presidential Inaugural Committee 2013.\n\nYou are receiving this message as a member of BarackObama.com's online community.
