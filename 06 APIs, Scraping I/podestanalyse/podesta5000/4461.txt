I only wish they\nhad it on tape, as it would be a superb teaching tool: thoughtful, well-\ninformed, cheerful and realistically optimistic. You did a great job.\n\nGood luck with the campaign.   She must win, and we will all be lined up to\nhelp.\n\nThank you. Again, good luck and see you soon.  T\n'
