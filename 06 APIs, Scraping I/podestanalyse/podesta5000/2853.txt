Don't think we need the policy teams at this point, but we\r\n\tcan add national security if you think wise.  Better to do the others\r\n\tseperately.\r\n\tIs Saturday afternoon or Sunday better for any of you?\r\n\t\r\n\tOn Tue, Oct 14, 2008 at 7:27 AM, Gips, Don <Don.Gips@level3.com> wrote:\r\n\t> Not yet.
