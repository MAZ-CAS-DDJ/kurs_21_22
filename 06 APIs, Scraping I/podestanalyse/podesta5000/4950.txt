Now, in briefings that I\'ve had with the oil producers, there are\nsome instances within a matter of months they could be getting additional\noil. In some cases, it would be a matter of a year.\n\nIn some cases, it could take longer than that, depending on the location and\nwhether you use existing rigs or you have to install new rigs. But there\'s\nabundant resources in the view of the people who are in the business that\ncould be exploited within a period of months.\n\nSo off-shore drilling is something we have to do. I\'m sorry that Senator\nObama opposes it.\n\nNuclear power is not only vital, I think, to clean energy and reduction of\ngreenhouse gas emissions, but nuclear power also is a way to employ hundreds\nof thousands of Americans. We can build 45 new nuclear power plants by the\nyear 2030. It would employ some 700,000 people.\n\nSo Senator Obama opposes off-shore drilling. He opposes reprocessing of\nspent nuclear fuel. He opposes storage of spent nuclear fuel. And so he is\nthe Dr. No of the America\'s energy future. And he also opposes a gas tax\nholiday as a gimmick.\n\nSo I\'m very pleased to be here. Again, we\'ll be talking about energy and the\neconomy and continue to do so.\n\nAnd, by the way, I -- as I do every three months, visited my dermatologist\nthis morning. She said that I was doing fine, took a small little nick from\nmy cheek, as she does regularly, and that will be and will be biopsied, just\nto make sure that everything is fine.\n\nBut I want to, again, urge all Americans to wear sunscreen, particularly\nthis summer. Stay out of the sun as much as possible. Wear sunscreen. And if\nyou ever have any slight discoloration, please go to your dermatologist or\nyour doctor and get it checked up on.\n\nMelanoma is a preventable occurrence. It really is. It\'s one of the most\npreventable occurrences. But, remember, a lot of the damage that people\nreceive from the sun when they\'re young sometimes comes back later in life.\nAnd that\'s the end of my lecture from the American Dermatology Association\ntoday.\n\nThank you all very much. Thank you.\n\nQUESTION: Senator, your doctor was confident that there was nothing major?\n\nMCCAIN: Absolutely.\n\nHighlight #2\n*Nancy Pfotenhauer\'s Responses on Deficit Questions Leave Wolf Blitzer\nUnsatisfied *(CNN 07/28/08 4:30pm)\nWOLF BLITZER: [\x85] among other things that the Obama campaign, Nancy, said\ntoday, Senator McCain is proposing to continue the same Bush economic\npolicies that put our economy on this dangerous path and that will drive\nAmerica even deeper into debt. What is he going to do differently than\nPresident Bush has done all these years to reduce this enormous deficit?\n\nNANCY PFOTENHAUER: Well, spending, spending, spending. Senator McCain has\nbeen a leader in the U.S. senate and Laura knows this, trying to hold the\nline on federal spending. What wasn\'t discussed earlier is the fact that\nBarack Obama has midwifed this as much as anyone else.\n\nBLITZER: I want to hear what McCain is going to do to cut the deficit.\n\nPFOTENHAUER: Certainly, Senator McCain has proposed do a top to bottom\nreview of the federal government and all spending programs. There will be\nconsolidation and elimination. He\'s proposed to eliminate pork barrel\nspending and Senator Obama proposed about $900 million of that in a brief\nperiod of time that he\'s been in the U.S. Senate, that\'s I mean by he\'s part\nof the problem\x97\n\nBLITZER: You know, Nancy that, pork barrel spending is something significant\nbut a relatively tiny percentage of the federal budget.\n\nPFOTENHAUER: It\'s important to stop that, though, Wolf. In addition to that,\n*Senator McCain is going to put in place spending disciplines like a\nconstitutionally viable line item veto, enhanced ability to stop this\ntremendous spending growth by forcing congress to enroll each provision\nseparately so he could veto each provision.* Keep in mind how we got here,\nan energy bill, a farm bill, a highway bill that is worth hundreds of\nbillions of dollars.\n\n[cross-talk]\n\nBLITZER: You\'re neglecting to mention about $700 billion spent on the war in\nIraq, money that could have been spent here at home.\n\nPFOTENHAUER: Well, and it\'s important to focus on why where that money would\ngo in the future, since both candidates are agreeing there\'s going to be a\ntroop drawdown, if you will, one important distinction between Senator\nMcCain and Senator Obama, Senator McCain said since this war has been\nfinanced with deficit spending, as the troop drawdown occurs every penny of\nthat needs to go to deficit reduction. Senator Obama has done nothing but\nlip service on deficit reduction. *Senator McCain has said, "I will balance\nthis budget by the end of my first term."*\n\n[\x85]\n\nBLITZER: Let me let Nancy respond to the one serious accusation you made\nagainst Senator McCain. He opposed the bush tax cuts in 2001, opposed them\nin 2003, and now says they have to be made permanent, forever. That\'s going\nto increase the budget deficit, if you were to eliminate some of those tax\ncuts that presumably would reduce the budget deficit, right, Nancy?\n\nPFOTENHAUER: Keep in mind; keep in mind he opposed the tax cuts because he\nsaid they needed to be accompanied with spending reductions. If they had\nbeen accompanied by spending reductions, we would not be in the situation\nthat we\'re in right now. Also, keep in mind that, for most of the last eight\nyears, revenues have been running at about 18.8% of GDP. That is slightly\nabove historic historical averages.\n\nI will agree with Laura on one thing, that the economic downturn has now\nbecome part of, if you will, this equation and therefore, revenues are\nsliding but I would argue that that\'s because the market has recognized a\ncouple of things. One, Senator Obama, who is a potential president of the\nUnited States, he\'s not going to get there, but he\'s a potential president\nof the United States, is actively promising tax increases on income, on cap\ngains, on increasing the amount of wages subject to the payroll taxes, lower\ncorporate tax rates, won\'t lower the corporate tax rate.\n\nBLITZER: Unfortunately we have to leave it there.* I will add one thing,\nNancy, when he opposed the tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, he also said they were\nskewed toward the wealthy. He didn\'t like that and also said at the time of\nwar you don\'t start cutting taxes, that\'s what he said at the time but he\'s\ngot a different sense right now*. We have to leave it right there, a good\ndiscussion, serious discussion. *I\'m still not hearing a lot from either one\nof you about how this budget deficit is about to be cut*, but we\'ll leave\nthat for the next occasion, Nancy, and Laura, thanks to you.\n\n*Pfotenhauer Supports McCain\'s New Attack Ad and Touts His Econ\nPlatform*(MSNBC, 07/28/08, 12:20pm)\nCONTESSA BREWER: The Obama campaign points out Nancy, that Barack Obama went\nto visit the wounded troops in Iraq and he didn\'t bring cameras, do you\nthink that ad reflects well on your candidate?\n\nNANCY PFOTENHAUER: I think it showcases the differences between these two\ngentlemen*. Senator McCain, for his whole life, not just his time in the\nsenate, but obviously his time in the military has shown that he loves his\ncountry and puts it first at the cost of political or personal well\nbeing.*And with Senator Obama, I think his actions in canceling a\nscheduled visit\nwith wounded troops just calls into question kind of his judgment and his\npriorities, frankly. And that carries over, not just from when he has had to\nsay about foreign policy and you almost have to check your watch to see what\nhe\'s saying today, because most of his statements have an expiration date.\nBut if you translate it over into the domestic policy front, things like\nenergy where he refuses to embrace easy answers to increasing our domestic\nproduction in order to ease the pain for Americans who are facing higher\nenergy prices, he won\'t embrace drilling, he won\'t embrace natural gas.\n\nBREWER: Because the experts say that even if we open up all the offshore\ndrilling it really won\'t do anything to wean us off our foreign dependence.\nAnd that is why Barack Obama says he doesn\'t support a Federal gas tax\nholiday. That being said, when you have John McCain in another ad, basically\nblaming Barack Obama for high gas prices, again, McCain wants to be the\nstraight shooter. Do you think these kind of campaign ads line up with a\nstraight shooter?\n\nPFOTENHAUER: *He\'s telling the American people the truth. *When you look at\nSenator Obama\'s energy plan, let\'s just talk about that for right now, he\nhas no plan to increase domestic production. That is reckless and\nirresponsible given the situation that we\'re facing. He doesn\'t endorse\ndrilling, he doesn\'t endorse natural gas, he wants to tax coal, he doesn\'t\neven have a real role for nuclear power which is embraced by at least 8\nother countries. It\'s safe and it\'s clean. so, he has this real piecemeal,\npie in the sky plan on energy that does nothing to help people now or in\nfive years.\n\nBREWER: I know American families want to hear what the candidates have to\nsay about their economic future, what they\'re going to do. [\x85] So taxes\naren\'t off the table, but Frank Donatelli says, no, no, never taxes. Which\nis it?\n\nPFOTENHAUER: What Senator McCain\'s plan shows is that he\'s going to reduce\ntaxes and keep them low on capital formation or the job producing sector of\nthe economy and lower federal spending. And that\'s really one of the key\ndifference. Senator Obama\'s plan calls for dramatically increasing taxes in\nincome, raising the cap on wages subject to the payroll tax. He\'s going to\nlet the cap gains tax bump back up and he\'s going to do nothing for our\ncorporate tax rate, and that really hinders our international\ncompetitiveness at the same time he\'s increasing taxes, and he\'s increasing\nspending by about a trillion dollars. So higher taxes and higher spending,\nrecipe for a recession.\n\n*Frank Donatelli Supports McCain\'s New Attack Ad and His Economic Strategies\n* (MSNBC, 07/28/08, 10:30am)\nCONTESSA BREWER: What\'s your response to what Obama\'s campaign says, that\nthis new ad is inappropriate and dishonorable?\n\nFRANK DONATELLI: You know, it\'s funny. This is about the fifth different\nreason that you just heard from the gentleman as to why he canceled his\ntrip. This is first that we\'ve heard that there\'s an individual that wanted\nto come along that they wanted to bring and the defense department wouldn\'t\nlet them. They never mentioned that before. And they\'re also trying the\ndefense department under the bus, for heaven\'s sakes. It comes back to a\nquestion of judgment, Contessa. They didn\'t have time to do this, but they\nhad time to visit a couple hundred thousand citizens of the world.\n\n[\x85]\n\nBREWER: Let\'s talk about the judgment on the economy. It now appears that\nBarack Obama is ready to focus on the economy, of course, McCain last week\nat the time when Barack Obama was overseas he was -- McCain was in grocery\nstores, looking at the prices of eggs and that now very famous photo-op. do\nyou think that he has settled on an economic message that resonates with\nvoters?\n\nDONATELLI: Yes, absolutely. In a time of economic weakness, no higher taxes.\nYou never, ever raise taxes when the economy is weak. *Senator Obama has\npromised to raise every single tax. Senator McCain is going to keep taxes\nlow.* Secondly, energy prices. Senator Obama does not have a plan. All he\nfavors is having energy prices go higher and higher. Senator McCain believes\nin more domestic oil and gas supplies, which will eventually moderate the\nprice. Very clear difference between the two candidates.\n\n*CBS Evening News Examines McCain\'s Economic and Energy Plans* (NBC,\n07/28/08, 6:55pm)\nCHIP REID: John McCain has also surrounded himself with some of the best\nminds in business, including Carly Fiorina, former CEO of HewlettPackard,\nand Meg Whitman, former head of Ebay. Today they briefed reporters on the\nimportance of cutting taxes on business to create jobs.\n\nCARLY FIORINA: Small business is the engine of growth in this economy.\n\nREID: McCain says he\'ll balance the budget by the end of his first term, but\ncritics wonder how that\'s possible givin his support for extending all of\nthe Bush tax cuts. As important as jobs and taxes are, polls show it\'s the\nprice of gas that really gets voters mad. That\'s where McCain kept his focus\ntoday as he toured an oil field in California.\n\nMCCAIN: So offshore drilling is something we have to do.\n\nREID: McCain says he now supports increased offshore drilling, as do 73\npercent of Americans, because he says more oil supplies will bring prices\ndown. He says it\'s time for Obama to get on board.\n\nMCCAIN: He is the doctor no of America\'s energy future.\n\nREID: But Obama says offshore drilling harms the environment, and looks to\nthe past not the future. [\x85] There are now so many economic challenges\nconfronting the nation that as one key senator put it today, whoever is the\nnext president will have a very, very sobering first week.\n\nHighlight #3\n*John McCain\'s Lobbyists Under Scrutiny* (CNN 07/28/08 8:46pm)\nJOE JOHNS: John McCain and the lobbyists is a story that won\'t go way. That\nis partly because the democrats like to talk about it so much. When you\'re\nfollowing the lobbying game, it\'s all about money and who gets access to\npower. To hear John McCain tell it, he\'s your guy in Washington fighting\nagainst the unchecked influence of big businesses and their lobbyists.\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: The workers and entrepreneurs of America are taken for granted\nby their government while the lobbyists and special pleaders are seldom\nturned away.\n\nJOHNS: Those lobbyists often kick in top dollar to gain top access to the\nhighest corridors of power, right? Sure. *How does that McCain rhetoric\nsquare with this: a fancy 2006 soiree of the little known, but\nwell-respected International Republican Institute in Washington, the video\nfrom the group\'s own website shows the chairman of AT&T, which had just\ndonated $200,000 to the institute introducing none other than John McCain,\nwho was still chairman of the institute\'s board. Remember, at the time,\nMcCain was fresh off of the term as the chairman of the senate committee\nthat regulates telephone companies like AT&T.* AT&T says there were no\nstrings attached to the donation but that\'s not always the point.\n\nLARRY SABATO: Access this is name of the game. It\'s getting in the door to\nsee your candidate so you can make your case. Sometimes you don\'t even need\nto see the candidate, just talk to staff members, the people who influence\nthe candidate\'s decision.\n\nJOHNS: Okay, so which is it? *Will the real John McCain please stand up? Is\nhe the scourge of a system in Washington that rewards lobbyists and their\nwealthy bosses or is he the guy who hob-knobs with and therefore might\nsomehow be influenced by the very interest he says he\'s trying to root out?\nAnswer: both.*\n\nSmart politicians know tough talk on lobbyists sounds good to the public.\nThe reality is players at this level can\'t live without them.\n\nSABATO: They know they work with lobbyists, *they have staffers who have\nbeen lobbyists*, they are going to depend on lobbyists for a lot of\ninformation for the decisions they make if they get elected. So\nabsolutely,*there\'s a lot of hypocrisy involved\n*.\n\nJOHNS: The group, IRI that held the event McCain attended gets just about\nall its money from the federal government to do things like promote\ndemocracy around the world and help governments run more efficiently. It\'s a\ncause McCain believes in.\n\nA former IRI staffer who also worked for the last McCain presidential\ncampaign says that while the IRI event may have brought McCain and the\nlobbyist together, there was never any kind of a quid pro quo.\n\nTODD HARRIS: The important question is are those lobbyists getting anything,\nany special favors or privileges for their donations? In the case of Senator\nMcCain *in general* and IRI specifically, there\'s never been a single time\nsomeone gave money and said, \'This is what I want in exchange.\'\n\nCAMPBELL BROWN: [\x85] I have to ask, with all this talk about clearing out the\nlobbyist, McCain has also gotten a lot of criticism over his campaign\nmanager, Rick Davis who was a former lobbyist.\n\nJOHNS: That\'s right and there are some other former lobbyists as well, you\nknow; a variety of people. *You might even need a scorecard to keep up with\nall of them.* The democrats say McCain is tainted by this. The republicans\nsay he\'s completely above it. He\'s put in\x97actually\x97a conflicts policy to try\nto tell people who are actually paid by the campaign that they can\'t work\nactively as a lobbyist but this story tends to dog him [\x85].\n\n[\x85]\n\nCAMPBELL BROWN: [\x85] *McCain, after he became the Republican nominee, said he\nwas gonna take this dramatic step, purging his campaign staff of anyone with\nlobbyist ties. Several staffers did leave, but [\x85] Rick Davis, his campaign\nmanager: former lobbyist, still there; Charlie Black: former lobbyist now,\nstill in a senior advisor position. I mean, a lot of parsing. You\'re either\nokay with lobbyists, or you\'re not, right?*\n\n*McCain Voting Hypocrisy: Record Shows Lack of Support in Voting for\nVeterans and Troops* (MSNBC 07/28/08 8:20pm)\nKEITH OLBERMANN: [\x85] The latest McCain campaign ad made an even more\noutlandish claim quote, "John McCain is always there for our troops." Except\nwhen he isn\'t. As Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid noted in mid 2007,\nMcCain only showed up for four of the past 14 Senate votes on Iraq. So far\nthis year he\'s shown for none. Not even the resolution honoring the\nsacrifice made by the fallen.\n\n*In looking at just part of McCain\'s record of supporting the troops since\nthe war in Iraq began, in April 2003 he tabled a motion to provide over a\nbillion dollars of national guard and reserve equipment. October 2003, he\ntabled then an amendment to provide an additional 322 million dollars for\nsafety equipment for U.S. troops in Iraq. March 2004, he voted against\neliminating abusive tax loopholes that would have increased veteran\'s\nmedical care by 1.8 billion dollars. March 20006, he voted against closing\ncorporate tax loopholes that would have increased veteran\'s medical services\nby 1.5 billion dollars. April 2006, he voted against providing an extra 430\nmillion dollars for veteran outpatient care. May, 2006 he voted against 20\nmillion dollars for veteran healthcare facilities. March 2007, he didn\'t\nbother to vote on a resolution to start redeploying troops from Iraq by\nMarch 2008. September 2007, he voted against Senator Webb\'s amendment that\nwould specify minimum rest periods for troops in between deployments. And in\nMay 2008 he first spoke out against Senator Webb\'s GI bill and then didn\'t\nbother to show up to vote on it.  But none of that stopped him from\naccepting President Bush\'s praise when the bill ultimately passed.*\n\n[\x85]\n\nIf you go after your opponent for not supporting the troops, when your own\nrecord is pretty clearly indicative that you do not support the troops, do\nyou not provoke people to look at your own record like we just did?\n\nRACHEL MADDOW: I\'ve long said, and you\'ve been saying this too, that there\nis a fascinating candidacy for the presidency happening right now, if people\ncould just pay attention to it for a hot minute.  *John McCain can\'t hold\nthe press\'s interest for long enough to get this kind of scrutiny in very\nmany media venues.* His campaign is counting on, and I think they\'ve been\nright to count on so far, the idea that if you kind of squint and don\'t\nfocus too much, the fact that he is a veteran can sort of substitute for the\nidea that he has done right by veterans as a politician, that he\'s done\nright by veterans and by the troops as a Senator. *But the fact is, Iraq and\nAfghanistan veterans of America they gave John McCain a D for his voting\nrecord, they gave Barack Obama a B+. Disabled American Veterans gave John\nMcCain  just a 20 percent voting record, they gave Barack Obama an 80\npercent voting record. There\'s a difference between being a veteran and\nsupporting veterans as a politician, he\'s just counting on people not being\nable to tell the difference.*\n\nHighlight #4\n*New Poll Shows McCain Ahead of Obama, But Does It Count?* (MSNBC 07/28/08\n5:40pm)\nMIKE BARNACLE: *Whenever these polls are released, and they\'re released\nalmost on an hourly basis now, there are always two things that are pointed\nout. One is, Barack Obama seems unable, thus far, to crack 50 percent in the\npolls. And yet John McCain  seems unable, thus far, to crack 45 in the\npolls.* What do you make of that?\n\nWAYNE SLATER: Let me say something that may be a little counterintuitive,\nand that\'s that *we got a poll that shows John McCain ahead. As Michelle\nsaid, it\'s the first time in any poll we\'ve seen in this campaign. But I\nreally think it\'s not good news for John McCain. It\'s not bad news to be\nahead, but it\'s not good news.* *Basically, people know who John McCain is,\nhe hasn\'t made the sale. He can\'t go above 45 at least so far.* Barack Obama\nis still largely unknown, in the larger sense of things, and he hasn\'t\ncompletely made the sale, but I think the opportunity for growth is there\nwith Barack Obama. To go back to the clich\xe9 we\'ve heard again and again,\nthis is Barack Obama\'s race to lose. A referendum on his race.  If he stays\nahead, as in other polls, then I think he wins.\n\n*Media Bias Investigated: More Negative Obama Coverage, Press Takes It Easy\non McCain* (MSNBC 07/28/08 6:07pm)\nRACHEL MADDOW: There is such thing as bad press. Much has been made in the\npast couple of weeks about the disproportionate media coverage that Obama is\ngetting as compared to John McCain. Indeed, Andrew Tindle\'s online Tindle\nreport found that  Obama was getting almost twice as much network news\ncoverage as McCain. But now George Mason University has looked into not just\nhow much the networks are saying about each candidate, but what they\'re\nsaying, and it turns out that 72 percent of the opinionated statements on\nObama on network coverage were negative*. The networks were 15 points\nkinder, more favorable to John McCain then they were to Obama. It\'s not just\nthe quantity of coverage, it\'s the quality. And that means, I think, I\'m not\nsure that John McCain\'s campaign has much to complain about in terms of\ntheir press coverage right now.*\n\nDAVID GREGORY: Are you surprised that McCain\'s still getting the buzz, the\nglow from 2000?\n\nMADDOW: *He\'s just not getting very much attention at all. And the coverage\nthat he is getting is sort of rounding him up in sort of a nice, hazy, soft\nfocused way based on his 2000 impression. People just aren\'t taking a hard\nlook at him and they\'re not being tough on him.*\n\n*McCain\'s Vice Presidential Candidate Options Down to a Shortlist* (NBC\nNightly News, 07/28/08, 7:11pm)\nBRIAN WILLIAMS: And back home, the U.S. political clock is ticking down\ntowards this summer\'s party conventions. By the time they take to the stage,\nObama and McCain will have running mates selected. We\'re getting awfully\nclose to selection time for both of them, you can tell that from the amount\nof speculation that\'s flying around Washington.\n\nDAVID GREGORY: For Obama and McCain it\'s the most presidential decision of\nthe race, and by all accounts they are closing in on a number two.\n\n[\x85]\n\nRepublican sources close to McCain say he appears to be down to a shortlist\nof three. Mitt Romney, former Congressman and Bush administration official\nRob Portman, and Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty with whom McCain is said to\nhave good chemistry. But might McCain try someone more unconventional, like\nthe pro-abortion rights former governor of Pennsylvania Tom Ridge?\n\nThe base wouldn\'t like it but those swing voters, those white independent\nwomen, those Hillary supporters who may decide this election, I think they\'d\nlike Tom Ridge and I think the two of them would play really strong.\n\nA lot of the buzz now is not just who but when. This is a decision that can\nchange the dynamic of a campaign.\n\n --\nJacob Roberts\nPAO\n208.420.3470 (c)\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
