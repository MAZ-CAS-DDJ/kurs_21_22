Apple\n<http://washpost.bloomberg.com/marketnews/stockdetail/?symbol=AAPL> and\nGoogle <http://washpost.bloomberg.com/marketnews/stockdetail/?symbol=GOOG> last\nyear announced they were offering forms of smartphone encryption so secure\nthat even law enforcement agencies could not gain access \xe2\x80\x94 even with a\nwarrant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that all of us should care passionately about privacy,\nbut we should also care passionately about protecting innocent people,\xe2\x80\x9d FBI\nDirector James B. Comey said at a recent roundtable with reporters.\n\nLast fall, after the announcements by Apple and Google, Comey said\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/2014/09/25/68c4e08e-4344-11e4-9a15-137aa0153527_story.html>\nhe\ncould not understand why companies would \xe2\x80\x9cmarket something expressly to\nallow people to place themselves beyond the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFBI and Justice Department officials say they support the use of encryption\nbut want a way for officials to get the lawful access they need.\n\nMany technologists say there is no way to do so without building a separate\nkey to unlock the data \xe2\x80\x94 often called a \xe2\x80\x9cbackdoor,\xe2\x80\x9d which they say amounts\nto a vulnerability that can be exploited by hackers and foreign governments.\n\nThe letter is signed by three of the five members of a presidential review\ngroup appointed by Obama in 2013 to assess technology policies in the wake\nof leaks by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden. The signatories\nurge Obama to follow the group\xe2\x80\x99s unanimous recommendation that the\ngovernment should \xe2\x80\x9cfully support and not undermine efforts to create\nencryption standards\xe2\x80\x9d and not \xe2\x80\x9cin any way subvert, undermine, weaken or\nmake vulnerable\xe2\x80\x9d commercial software.\n\nRichard A. Clarke, former cyber\xc2\xadsecurity adviser to President George W.\nBush and one of three review group members to sign the letter, noted that a\nsimilar effort by the government in the 1990s to require phone companies to\nbuild a backdoor for encrypted voice calls was rebuffed. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\npull it off at the end of the Cold War, they sure as hell aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to\npull it off now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nComey, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis the best FBI director I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s wrong\non this [issue].\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCongress, too, is unlikely to pass legislation that would require\ntechnology companies to develop keys or other modes of access to their\nproducts and services in the post-Snowden area.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed skepticism toward the\npleas of law enforcement agencies. Rep. Ted Lieu, a California Democrat\nwith a computer science degree, called backdoors in software\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/04/30/congressman-with-computer-science-degree-encryption-back-doors-are-technologically-stupid/>\xe2\x80\x9ctechnologically\nstupid.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRonald L. Rivest, an inventor of the RSA encryption algorithm (his name is\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cR\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cRSA\xe2\x80\x9d), said standards can be weakened to allow law enforcement\nofficials access to encrypted data. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve done great\ndamage to our security infrastructure if you do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe issue is not simply national, said Rivest, a computer science professor\nat MIT who signed the letter. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce you make exceptions for U.S. law\nenforcement, you\xe2\x80\x99re also making exceptions for the British, the French, the\nIsraelis and the Chinese, and eventually it\xe2\x80\x99ll be the North Koreans.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe signatories include policy experts who normally side with\nnational-security hawks. Paul Rosenzweig, a former Bush administration\nsenior policy official at the Department of Homeland Security, said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\nactually thought there was a way to build a U.S.-government-only backdoor,\nthen I might be persuaded. But that\xe2\x80\x99s just not reality.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRosenzweig said that \xe2\x80\x9cthere are other capabilities\xe2\x80\x9d that law enforcement\ncan deploy. They will be \xe2\x80\x9cless satisfying,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, but \xe2\x80\x9cthey will make\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrivacy activist Kevin Bankston organized the letter to maintain pressure\non the White House. \xe2\x80\x9cSince last fall, the president has been letting his\ntop law enforcement officials criticize companies for making their devices\nmore secure and letting them suggest that Congress should pass pro-backdoor\nlegislation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bankston, policy director of the New America\nFoundation\xe2\x80\x99s Open Technology Institute.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time for Obama to put an end to these dangerous suggestions that we\nshould deliberately weaken the cybersecurity of Americans\xe2\x80\x99 products and\nservices,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time for America to lead the world toward a more\nsecure future rather than a digital ecosystem riddled with vulnerabilities\nof our own making.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n\nOn May 19, 2015, at 8:25 AM, Lisa P Jackson <lisa_jackson@apple.com\n<javascript:_e(%7B%7D,'cvml','lisa_jackson@apple.com');>> wrote:\n\nNice!\n\n\n\n\nOn May 19, 2015, at 8:07 AM, Nick Ammann <nammann@apple.com\n<javascript:_e(%7B%7D,'cvml','nammann@apple.com');>> wrote:\n\nWe got a lot of peeps to step up.\n\n\n\n*FROM MORNING CYBERSECURITY: HUGE COALITION PRESSURES WHITE HOUSE ON\nENCRYPTION* \xe2\x80\x94 Nearly 150 civil society groups, trade groups and\ncybersecurity experts this morning are sending a letter to President Barack\nObama trying to force the administration to reject encryption workarounds\nfor law enforcement, Pro Cybersecurity\xe2\x80\x99s Tal Kopan reports.
