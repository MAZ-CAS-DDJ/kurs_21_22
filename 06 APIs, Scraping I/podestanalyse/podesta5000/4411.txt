john.podesta@gmail.comb'John -- It was so nice to see you on Friday. \xa0As discussed, let me know if you might have 5 minutes to talk on the phone about QDDR 2010. \xa0\n\nAlso, do you mind putting me in touch with Ben Rhodes (or his people) so that I can make sure that Tom and I meet with him to discuss where we are with QDDR 2014? \xa0Thanks! \xa0\n\nTake care,\nCaroline'
