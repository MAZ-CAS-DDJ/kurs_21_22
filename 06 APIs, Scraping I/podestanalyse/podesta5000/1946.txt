john.podesta@gmail.comb'As some of you already know, I moved from the quiet confines of Camp\nPhoenix to Bagram Air Field a couple weeks ago.  Camp Phoenix is smalltown\nUSA\xe2\x80\x94small, comfortable, everyone seems to know one another.  Bagram is the\nbig city\xe2\x80\x9440,000 of us living on top of one another, extremely loud, and\nhonest-to-goodness traffic jams.\n\nBagram has something else that Phoenix lacks\xe2\x80\x94Presidential visits.  A day or\ntwo before Memorial Day I received a cryptic email from an Army Major at\nthe Garrison Command.  She wrote something to the effect of \xe2\x80\x9cCapt Podesta,\nI believe you are in Afghanistan.  Contact me immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d  I truly\nwondered if it was one of those Afghan spear-phishing attempts DoD keeps\nwarning me about and came very close to deleting it.  But I ultimately\ncalled and was ordered, without explanation, to report to the Big Wig\nbuilding on Memorial Day.  I asked a couple questions, however, and learned\nthat I was being summoned because I was \xe2\x80\x9crelated to someone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll spare you all the details of the visit but suffice to say, it was\nincredible.  Deployment sucks at times.  The food is terrible and I\xe2\x80\x99m\nconstantly dirty.  But all that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem so bad when the President\ntells you he\xe2\x80\x99s proud of you.\n\nBut as cool as it is to talk to the President, nothing compares to getting\nto see your Dad in the middle of deployment.  When I returned to the office\nand told my coworkers about my memorable Memorial Day I could sense that\nmany were jealous.  But it seemed that they were jealous that I got to see\na family member, not that I got to meet the President.  The couple hours\nDad and I got to spend together were great and made me that much more\nexcited for when I come home and get a chance to spend time with all of you.\nLove and miss you.
