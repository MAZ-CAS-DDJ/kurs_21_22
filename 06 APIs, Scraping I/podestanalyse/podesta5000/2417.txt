I truly never realized how deeply I would come to care for my constituents.\n\nI'll continue to work hard for you each and every day -- but there could be trouble on the horizon.\n\nMy former opponent - Republican ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling - just launched a rematch against me. Not only will his campaign raise millions, but like last time, outside groups are sure to spend millions more on personal attacks against me.\n\nWe were able to beat Mr. Schilling last November because of your support. Now, I need you to step up again. With only 7 hours to go before our July fundraising deadline, we're still $680 short of hitting our goal.\n\nJohn -- will you chip in $10 before tonight's midnight fundraising deadline?\nhttp://action.cheribustos.com/2july31-1\n\nI want to keep working for seniors, students, and middle class families, but I'm going to need your help.\n\nThanks for your support,\n\nCheri\n\n\n\n\nThis message was emailed to: john.podesta@gmail.com\n\nTo unsubscribe from this email list, please paste this URL into your browser: \nhttp://action.cheribustos.com/unsubscribe\n\nPaid for by the Friends of Cheri Bustos\n\n"
