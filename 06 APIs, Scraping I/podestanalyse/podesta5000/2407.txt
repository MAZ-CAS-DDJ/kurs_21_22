Thanks.\n\n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: Steiner, Joshua \nSent: Saturday, October 18, 2008 4:51 PM\nTo: William M. Daley (william.m.daley@jpmchase.com)\nSubject: \n\n \n\nWe've obviously been going back and forth on the question of transition\nleadership given the uncertainty of the NEC appointment timing.  To help\nadvance the discussion, here some thoughts:\n\n \n\nI think we have the following options all of them are predicated on the\nassumption that the NEC would take over upon his/her appointment:\n\n \n\n1.\tKeep current structure in place with campaign staff slotted in\nas appropriate.\n2.\tAppoint a transitional transition economic policy director.\n3.\tKeep campaign structure/staff in place, but on transition\npayroll. \n\n \n\nOn balance, I would favor #2.\n\n \n\n1.\tAs soon as possible, the transition board in consultation with\nSenator Obama would choose an Economic Policy Transition Director.  \n2.\tIf possible, such Director would become integrated into Bill's\nand my work such that they can provide guidance on useful work and take\nover seamlessly post-election.\n3.\tSuch Director would serve until such time as the President has\nchosen his NEC director.\n4.\tThe Director would begin immediately after the election to hire\nthe transition team (including putting appropriate campaign staff\nmembers on the payroll), but would leave room on the payroll for any\npeople the NEC director might want to add.\n\n \n\nHere are some thoughts on the Transition Director:\n\n \n\n1.\tKnown and respected by Obama.\n2.\tAble to command the respect of the campaign staff and outside\nadvisors.\n3.\tPersonality that would work well with new NEC director.\n\n \n\nHere are some candidates:\n\n \n\n1.      Jason Furman\n\n2.      Dan Tarullo\n\n3.      Gene Sperling\n\n4.      Daley/Reich/Rubin/etc as head with one of the above as deputy to\navoid any signaling.\n\n \n\nLet me know what you think and whether it makes sense to send this to\nPodesta.  I didn't really catch up with him yesterday.  Thanks.\n\n \n\n_____________________________________\nJoshua L.
