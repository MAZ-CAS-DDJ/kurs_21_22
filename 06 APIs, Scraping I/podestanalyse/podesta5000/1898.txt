john.podesta@gmail.comb'John, our country is facing a serious economic\nchallenge. We\'re feeling it every day as we fill up our gas\ntanks and pay our electric bills.\n\nPresident Bush and Big Oil\'s allies in Congress are exploiting\nthis hardship, aggressively pushing to open up more land for\ndrilling. But even they know we can\'t drill our way out of this\nenergy crisis. \n\nWe can expect votes on drilling as early as this week - please\ngive TODAY!\nhttps://secure.ga4.org/01/drilling_c4/nn1zLkNKqwn0f?\n\nHelp us convince our elected leaders to help solve this energy\ncrisis by giving consumers better choices, not by spreading the\nfalse claim that more drilling will lead to lower gas prices.\n\nThe fastest, cheapest, most reliable way of easing our economic\nwoes is to increase efficiency, support mass transit, and invest\nin renewable energy. One sure way to provide immediate relief\nwould be to cut some of the billions of dollars in subsidies\nthat oil and gas companies enjoy, and issue rebates to\nconsumers. \n\nThere\'s a lot at stake in the next few weeks, which is why I\'m\nsending this message again. Support our work to stop destructive\ndrilling amendments in Congress. We can\'t do it without you.\nhttps://secure.ga4.org/01/drilling_c4/nn1zLkNKqwn0f?\n\nThanks,\n\nGene\n\n===============================\nLeague of Conservation Voters\nhttp://action.lcv.org/ct/v1zLkNK1YmYZ/\n===============================\n\nDear John,\n\nWe\'re so deep in a hole, you\'d think we\'d stop drilling...\n\nUnfortunately not everyone agrees. Big Oil\'s allies in Congress\nare trying to scoop up more land for drilling - including the\nArctic National Wildlife Refuge. Later today, President Bush is\nexpected to go so far as to repeal the long-standing executive\nban on offshore drilling put in place by his own father.\n\nThis is not only an environmental disaster, it will give us zero\nrelief from gas prices and will pad Big Oil\'s bottom line.\nThat\'s a raw deal.\n\nEvery week, we can expect a new, outrageous drilling provision.\nAnd we urgently need your support to stop them! Please give\ntoday - there will be votes on drilling in the next TWO weeks.\n\nDonate today to help LCV stop the legislative madness and\nenvironmental destruction.\nhttps://secure.ga4.org/01/drilling_c4/nn1zLkNKqwn0f?\n\nBig Oil\'s cronies in Congress are using high gas prices as an\nexcuse for this greedy land grab, and they plan to make this a\nmajor campaign issue. Even some of our pro-environment friends\nin Congress are feeling pressure to support drilling\nlegislation. But renowned oil businessman T. Boone Pickens is\npublicly broadcasting a different message: "I\'ve been an oilman\nall my life, but this is one emergency we can\'t drill our way\nout of."\n\nWe believe that the facts will triumph over the fear mongering,\nbut we need your support to keep up the fight and deliver our\nmessage to Congress:\n\n* America simply can\'t drill its way out of this problem. Our\nsupply (less than 3% of world oil reserves) can\'t possibly keep\nup with our demand (25% of world oil consumption). A few drops\nof oil, up to a decade away from making it to market, cannot\nalleviate our pain at the pump.\n\n* There are almost 70 million acres of proven reserves in Big\nOil\'s possession where absolutely no drilling is taking place.\nAs long as gas prices continue to rise, so does the value of the\nreserves they\'re sitting on.\n\n* We need consumer choices, such as plug-in hybrids and other\nfuel efficient cars - not a greater addiction to oil. Cutting\nsubsidies for Big Oil and giving rebates to consumers would be\ntrue short-term relief.\n\nThe ban on offshore drilling, which has enjoyed bipartisan\nsupport for decades, is in real danger. Both President Bush and\nSenator John McCain have recently reversed their position and\nnow support this land grab.\n\nYour support today will allow us to conduct valuable polling in\nbattleground states on this issue, lobby key Members of\nCongress, and place ads to educate consumers that drilling will\nnot provide them with the relief they need.\n\nYour gift to LCV will go a long way toward protecting our\nenvironment from irresponsible drilling - and truly rescuing us\nfrom our energy crisis.\nhttps://secure.ga4.org/01/drilling_c4/nn1zLkNKqwn0f?\n\nThank you, John, for your continued support of the\nLeague of Conservation Voters. We\'ll never match Big Oil\'s\nresources dollar-for-dollar. But backed by your commitment, I\nknow we will be able to build a clean energy future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGene Karpinski\nLeague of Conservation Voters\n\n*******************************\nTell A Friend!\nTell your friends to sign up for LCV updates today.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/lcv/join-forward.html?domain=lcvorg&r=n1zLkNKqwn0f&\n\nSign up for LCV Updates\nIf you received this message from a friend, you can sign up for\nLeague of Conservation Voters updates.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/lcv/join.html?r=n1zLkNKqwn0fE&\n\nQuestions?\nIf you have any questions about this message or any other League\nof Conservation Voters issue, please click here or call\n202-785-8683.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/ct/fpzLkNK1YmYK/\n\nPolicy\nYou, or someone on your behalf, has subscribed to receive this\ninformation from the League of Conservation Voters.
