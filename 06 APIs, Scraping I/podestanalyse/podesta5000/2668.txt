Please let me know any thoughts you have on\nthis -- including if you think there's something more specific we should\nsay about the prospects/timing of President Obama weighing in on the carbon\nprice question.\n\nThanks.\n\n--Pete\n\nOn Wed, Dec 10, 2014 at 12:57 AM, Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>\nwrote:\n>\n> John, wanted to give you a brief update. Pete and his team continue to\n> revise their paper with the goal of getting a draft to HRC by Dec. 17.  If\n> we can work it out, they will meet with WJC before then to be sure his\n> thoughts are incorporated. And we're hoping you will be able to take\n> another look as well. Also, we wanted to follow up with you on the question\n> of what (in broad strokes) we can expect from the administration over the\n> coming year or two in terms of carbon pricing and crude exports, because\n> that will do so much to shape the landscape going forward.\n> Will let Pete add to this if there are additional questions to put on the\n> table.\n> Thanks\n> Dan\n>\n>\n>\n"
