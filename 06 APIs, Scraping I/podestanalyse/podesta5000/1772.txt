john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi John--\n\nI connected with Simone Woung again.  She spoke with Mitch Bailin, Dean of\nStudents, who advised that he is totally willing to talk to you directly\ntoday.  His guidance to Simone this morning is that "Ryan Stafford should\nreceive an AF in Congressional Investigations if he does not submit his\npaper before the deadline."\n\nA note that doesn\'t really affect the conversation: the registrar still has\nit listed for non-grads at 5 pm today, but that\'s just an arbitrary\ndeadline.  Your Friday deadline is still in effect, and that\'s the one that\nthe registrar will respect for Ali (who plans on turning in his paper\nmidweek).\n\nDean Bailin\'s number is 202-662-4066; email address is\nmcb48@law.georgetown.edu.\n\nSimone is also available at 202-662-9852 or woung@law.georgetown.edu.\nAdding Milia for awareness in case you\'d like to call either of them today.\n\n-- \nEryn M. Sepp\nCell: 818-456-2881\n'
