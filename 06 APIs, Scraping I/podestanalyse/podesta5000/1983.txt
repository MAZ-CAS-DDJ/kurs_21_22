Your support already has\xa0been\n nothing short of amazing.\n\nWill you help Joseline finish this month\n strong and donate by today at midnight?\n\nJust this month, we've\n gained endorsements from major grassroots\xa0networks, we've met voters\n across the district through events and\xa0phone banking, and we've proven\n that our campaign can compete in\xa0fundraising. And we did it all without\n the help of special interests -\xa0we did it with the support of working\n families across Maryland.\n\nWe are proud of the campaign we're\n running. And we are proud to be\xa0supporting Joseline, someone who truly cares\n about working people in\xa0Maryland and is fighting to make a\n difference.\n\nWill you join us?\xa0Donate today to join our campaign for working\n families!\n\nThank you,\n\nMonica\n\nPaid for by Joseline Pe\xf1a-Melnyk\n for Congress\nP.O.
