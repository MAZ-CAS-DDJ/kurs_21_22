We can\ncommunicate with Susan and Sarah generally that Benjamin wasn't given\ninterim status, and either Chris or I can communicate directly with\nBenjamin. For your information, out of the approximately 187 people who we\nhave moved through the process Benjamin was the only person declined interim\nstatus. The young lawyer Kate Shaw who is coordinating the process for us\nhas done a great job.\n\nOn Wed, Oct 29, 2008 at 1:06 PM, Cassandra Butts\n<cbutts.obama08@gmail.com>wrote:\n\n> John,\n>\n> The FBI has indicated that they are inclined to decline interim security\n> clearance for Benjamin Rhodes who is OFA senior speechwriter and national\n> security policy person.
