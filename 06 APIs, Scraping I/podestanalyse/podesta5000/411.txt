Hope you are back up for air. Let me know\nwhat you think about the idea below.\n\n Thanks!\n\n Jin\n\n ----- Forwarded Message -----\n*From:* Jin Chon <j_chon@yahoo.com>\n*To:* Neera Tanden <ntanden@americanprogress.org>\n*Sent:* Friday, July 10, 2015 10:25 AM\n*Subject:* New Idea - What do you think?\n\n  Hi Neera - Hope you're enjoying your summer. I've really appreciated the\nadvice you've provided about the campaign and am hoping I can get your\ncounsel once again.\n\n I've pretty much given up on joining the campaign as staff but sitting on\nthe sidelines is killing me. So, I'm wondering if Podesta or another senior\nmember of the campaign would be interested in having me as a volunteer for\n20-30 hours/week. While my job is busy and rewarding, it also provides a\nlot of time after hours and on the weekends to do other things and would\nlove to channel that energy into the campaign. I think I could be helpful\nworking on longer-term projects like working on policy rollouts, creating\nplans for caucus/primary night events or developing plans for the\nconvention.\n\n In addition to the 20-30 hours/week, I would also be willing to spend a\nfew long weekends (Thursday-Monday) in Brooklyn each month (on my own dime)\nand take some extended time off from GW around in January 2016 if they need\nall hands on deck in Iowa or New Hampshire.\n\n I think I could get Lorraine to agree to this flexible schedule as she's\naware of my interest in working with the campaign but does not want me to\nleave the university.\n\n What do you think? Do you think the Podesta would be interested? Would you\nbe willing to talk with him about this idea?\n\n As always, thanks for your guidance!\n\n\n\n Jin\n"
