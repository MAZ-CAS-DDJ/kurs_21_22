The officer who signed that agreement in 2001, Timothy Paul, is\nnow with Goldman Sachs, as chief trust officer for your trust company.\n\nI am wondering if he might be available to discuss a few matters, on\nwhatever basis that might be amenable to him.\n\nI am happy to discuss this further with you or him at your convenience.\n\nI have asked the Clintons whether they would waive any client\nconfidentiality with regards to Citi ---or JPMorgan, the current trustee of\ntheir finances---but have not yet heard back.\n\n\n\nThanks for considering my request,\n\n\n\nJeff Gerth\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nProPublica\n\n(202) 362-6139\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nThis e-mail may contain information that is confidential, privileged or\notherwise protected from disclosure.
