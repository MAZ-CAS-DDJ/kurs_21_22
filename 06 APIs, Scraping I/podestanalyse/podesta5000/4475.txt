GOP outside groups have spent more money against Democrats in Arizona than any other state in the country.\n\nSo far, Boehner's committed a stunning $3,OOO,OOO.OO on Arizona T.V. to defeat Ann.\n\nWorse yet, we just found out Boehner's coming to Arizona NEXT WEEK to raise money for Andy Tobin.\n\nWith the race for Arizona's 1st district TOO CLOSE TO CALL, it's more critical than ever we get the facts out to Arizona voters.\n\nJohn -- Ann's counting on you. Will you have her back today?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/kirkpatricksep2014?refcode=em_FR_2014.09.19_b1_afa_ldnd_SL2&amp;amount=25&amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=DC&amp;zip=20016&amp;phone=2162818851&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=&amp;recur_weekly=true\n\nWe know we ask a lot, but the truth is, what you do in moments like this could mean the difference between winning or losing.\n\nTime is of the essence.
