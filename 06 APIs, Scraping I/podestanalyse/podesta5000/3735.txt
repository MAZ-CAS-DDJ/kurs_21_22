I may go on a CAP trip at the end of March.

Real this time.  Being replaced by a guy named Zhang Yong, head of their FDA.  Who replaced the former head after that guy was executed!  Wish I were making that up.\r\n\r\nAnyway -- losing Xie sucks.\r\n\r\nHope you\'re well.  Did I tell you you were awesome last year and that it was great to work with you?  You were and it was.\r\n'
