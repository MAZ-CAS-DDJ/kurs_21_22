john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\n\nYou have to see this! This morning, the New York Times ran a\xa0front-page story about the historic LGBT representation in this Congress. \n\nIt\x92s truly remarkable how far we\x92ve come. The article talks\xa0about how we, as LGBT members of Congress, are \x93forcing some of [our] colleagues\xa0to rethink gay rights.\x94\n\nIn the New York Times! Clearly, this is a pivotal moment.\xa0But trust me, this story \x96 that picture of my family and me \x96 is going to infuriate\xa0and galvanize opponents of LGBT rights.\n\nThis is an extraordinary moment. This is the moment that\xa0decides whether this election was a fluke or if real LGBT representation is\xa0here to stay \x96 if it\x92s no longer a novelty.\n\nMake no mistake: I will be a target. I know I can\x92t win\xa0without you, and I need you now, before our January 31 deadline.\n\nHelp us make sure\xa0that Congress truly represents America \x96 click here to rush $20 so we can build\xa0a strong campaign that will stand up to the coming attacks.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/seanmaloney?refcode=em130126-d&amounts=20,35,50,100,250,500,2500\n\nRight now, there are six LGBT members of the House and one\xa0LGBT member of the Senate. That\x92s groundbreaking \x96 and it\x92s changing the\xa0conversation. But not everyone is happy about it.\n\nDespite clear public sentiment opposing the Defense of\xa0Marriage Act (DOMA), House Republicans voted to waste taxpayer dollars\xa0defending this law, which discriminates against LGBT couples.\n\nI\x92m standing up to the GOP and demanding they stop. But I\xa0can\x92t do it alone. I need you standing with me. That\x92s how I got here and\xa0that\x92s how I\x92ll stay here, fighting for the values we share.\n\nClick here to rush\xa0$20 or more before our January 31 deadline so that we can protect this seat and\xa0the gains we\x92ve made.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/seanmaloney?refcode=em130126-d&amounts=20,35,50,100,250,500,2500\n\nThis is not the time to rest on our laurels. Let\x92s look back\xa0on this moment and say, that was just the beginning, not the peak.\n\nThank you for your support and everything you fight for,\n\nSean\n\n\n\n[ Contribute - https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/seanmaloney?refcode=em130126-d&amounts=20,35,50,100,250,500,2500 ] \n\n\n\n--- \n\nPaid for by Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n\nSean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n18 West Main St\nBeacon, NY 12508\n\nTo unsubscribe from this mailing list, click here - http://images.myngp.com/unsubscribe.aspx?crypt=Casv%2frrJxGAq9DTl%2f1OHiHqjYnYu9HWTKEKFHIUkyGA%3d\n\nPowered by NGP VAN, Inc.\n\n'
