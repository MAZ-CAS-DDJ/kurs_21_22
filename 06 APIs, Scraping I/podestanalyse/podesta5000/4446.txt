Take our poll and tell us your top priority in 2016:\nhttp://go.nationalpartnership.org/site/R?i=1vKckEgDy7bnto31k0ODUA\n\nJohn, as a supporter of the National Partnership, you know that tomorrow's briefing on Capitol Hill is exactly what we do.\n\nWe are a respected voice with lawmakers. \nWe have a seat at the table.\nWe lead broad, diverse coalitions.\nWe draft and advance legislation.\nWe provide research and analysis to raise awareness.\nWe stand up and speak out for women and their families.\nWe bring people together to take action that makes a difference.\n\nWe get things done.\n\nOur focus -- our purpose -- is making America better.

And we know we can count on you to stand by our side.\n\nThat's why we want to hear directly from you and learn more about what matters MOST to you.\n\nSo take a quick poll and let us know your top priority this year:\nhttp://go.nationalpartnership.org/site/R?i=oP_HwbcvMWnhYprZeU2qdw\n\nYou've got the floor.
