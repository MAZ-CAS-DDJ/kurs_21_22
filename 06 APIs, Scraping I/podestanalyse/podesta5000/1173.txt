would be it crushing and get you\noff your game?\n\n\n\n*BERNIE SANDERS:* at the end of the day in terms of delegate selection,\nif you get 52% or 48% it will mean very\nfew delegates. psychologically obviously it\'s northern.\n\n\n\n*LESTER HOLT: *word on the street you\'ve got a lot of ad dollars you\'ll\nbe buying on television. are you going to be going directly at hillary\nclinton? are you going to turn negative?\n\n\n\n*BERNIE SANDERS:* no, no, no. we differentiate ourselves from secretary\nclinton every single day. that is what a campaign is about.\n\n\n\n*LESTER HOLT:* let\'s talk about the significance of your\ncampaign. president obama, the first african-american president. hillary\nclinton could become the first female president. not a lot has been talked\nabout the fact that you would become the oldest and the first\njewish president. is that something you reflect on and think about?\n\n\n\n*BERNIE SANDERS:* sure, i do. thank god i am in good health and as a\nformer long distance runner, was a pretty good miler when i high school,\ndid a little running in college, my endurance is strong. in terms of\nmy religion, i\'m very proud of my jewish background, and it has had a\nsignificant influence on me.\n\n\n\n*LESTER HOLT:* and one more note from our interview. the new\nhampshire union leader is hosting a debate next week that will air\non msnbc. hillary clinton said today that she\'s in and we asked\nbernie sanders if he\'s in as well. he said he wasn\'t ready to\ncommit because he wants to expand on that plan and add additional debates\nto the schedule as well, so stay tuned there.\n\n\n\n*LESTER HOLT:* want to bring in right now our political director, the\nmoderator of "meet the press" chuck todd. chuck, let\'s go back to donald\ntrump for a moment. is there a hidden strategy perhaps in him refusing to\ndebate and obvious question could it backfire?\n\n\n\n*CHUCK TODD:* well, look, always a chance could backfire. iowans could\nbe offended by the idea, but here\'s where it could be a shrewd move. look,\ndebates haven\'t been donald trump\'s best moments. the most recent\ndebate was probably list best debate but that\'s grading a little bit on a\ncurve. he\'s been fine, not collapsed, but debates only matter to the voters\nif somebody has a disastrous performance, so here\'s why it could be\na shrewd move. trump not being there. no way he can make a mistake and say\nthe wrong thing, but guess what could happen? his chief rival in iowa ted\ncruz, after five minutes of bashing donald trump for being there, what do\nyou think the rest of the candidates are going to do? are they going\nto continue going after donald trump or piling on ted cruz and who benefits\nmore from that, donald trump? this could end up being a very shrewd move by\nthe front-runner.\n\n\n\n*LESTER HOLT:* all right. chuck, thanks very much.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups\n"HRCRR" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an\nemail to hrcrr+unsubscribe@hillaryclinton.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrr@hillaryclinton.com.\n'
