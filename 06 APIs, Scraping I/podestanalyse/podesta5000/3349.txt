He sent an urgent email to his supporters asking for help because our campaign could defeat him.\n\nLet's show Toomey that he's right to worry about our grassroots strength. Pitch in now to defeat Toomey and take back the Senate for Democrats >> https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/elect-katie-mcginty?refcode=e20160318&amp;refcode2=e20160318abx&amp;amount=25\n\nWe know it, and Pat Toomey knows it too: With your support right now, we can and will defeat Pat Toomey, end the GOP stranglehold on Washington, and take back the Senate for Democrats.\n\nRUSH whatever you can now and turn the Senate back to blue. Every dollar counts.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/elect-katie-mcginty?refcode=e20160318&amp;refcode2=e20160318abx&amp;amount=25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------\n|    Paid For By Katie McGinty for Senate    |\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.\nIf you no longer wish to receive updates from our campaign, please https://act.myngp.com/el/-6306008032098648064/785055700278575104.\n\n\n\nKatie McGinty for Senate\nPO Box 22447\nPhiladelphia PA 19110 United States"
