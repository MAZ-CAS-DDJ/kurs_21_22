john.podesta@gmail.comb"John --\n\nDo you ever feel like the system is rigged? Like elected officials have stopped working for you? Like Big Money Billionaires are calling all of the shots?\n\nYou're not alone. Since the Supreme Court handed down the disastrous Citizens United decision exactly six years ago today, billionaire-backed Republicans have corrupted our political system.\n\nIt's time to fight back. Before midnight, we have the chance to announce something that could change everything:\n\n5OO,OOO donations to End Citizens United!\nBut there's one contribution missing -- one that could put us over the top:\n\nYours.\n\nSo John, if you're sick and tired of the status quo... ready to take on the billionaires buying elections... and mad as HELL at our broken campaign finance system, we need you with us now more than ever!\n\nChip in $5 or more to help us hit 5OO,OOO grassroots donations on the sixth anniversary of Citizens United >>\n\nChip in $5 immediately >>\nChip in $35 immediately >>\nChip in $50 immediately >>\nChip in $100 immediately >>\nChip in $250 immediately >>\nOr donate another amount >>\nChange won't be easy. But every petition you sign, dollar you donate, and action you take makes a difference. Together, we're building a powerful organization to elect pro-campaign finance reform Democrats in 2O16 and beyond.\n\nThis is our moment. Will you make your first donation to End Citizens United?\n\nhttp://act.endcitizensunited.org/2016-Member\n\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n-the entire End Citizens United team\n\n\n\nPAID FOR BY END CITIZENS UNITED PAC\n\nhttp://act.endcitizensunited.org/page/s/less-emails\n\n"
