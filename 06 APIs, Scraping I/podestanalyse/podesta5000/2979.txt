She\nand her husband (he also worked at the White House with me on global\ndevelopment) just moved to the Bay Area and she is looking to do work on\n financial inclusion. She\'s very good and I think would benefit from your\nadvice.\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: *Teresita Perez* <teresitadperez@gmail.com>\nDate: Wednesday, July 8, 2015\nSubject: Hello + Question on Lisa Jackson\nTo: John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>\n\n\nThanks so much for the prompt reply, John! And the minute you tell us to\nshow up, we will be in Truckee. No questions asked :)\n\n\nI would also love to connect with Herb Sandler. He would be a fascinating\nperson to talk to. Let me know how I can facilitate that introduction.\n\n\nI went ahead and drafted a short email to Lisa, and I attached my resume.\nLet me know if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have her email over at Apple and I can work on\ntracking it down.\n\n\nThanks again for all your help!\n\n\nBest,\n\nTeresita\n\n\n---\n\nHi Lisa,\n\n\nI hope you are doing well and are enjoying your time in California.\n\n\nI wanted to introduce you to a friend and colleague of mine, Teresita\nPerez. Teresita was my speechwriter at the Center for American Progress\nwhere she excelled in writing complex policy speeches on climate,\nimmigration, and poverty alleviation, among other issues. She recently\nmoved to the Bay Area and she is interested in working for a company\ninvesting in progressive social initiatives, and she has a keen interest in\nmobile payments and financial inclusion. I immediately thought she would\nbenefit from a conversation with you, particularly as you build out your\nnew office.\n\n\nBy way of background, after she left CAP, Teresita served as a speechwriter\nand policy adviser to Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, then went to\nGeorgetown Law and, she is currently working remotely as an attorney for\nthe World Bank, where she is focused on reducing fraud and corruption on\nBank-financed projects.\n\n\nI have cc\xe2\x80\x99ed Teresita on this email and attached her resume. I hope you two\ncan connect soon.\n\n\nJohn\n\nOn Wed, Jul 8, 2015 at 11:46 AM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com\n<javascript:_e(%7B%7D,\'cvml\',\'john.podesta@gmail.com\');>> wrote:\n\n> Happy to do.
