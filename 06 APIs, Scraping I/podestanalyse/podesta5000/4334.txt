Normally we would\nhave 7-10 days to advance and this give us 30 hours to load (remember\nwe are on an island with basically one road), build, test sound and\nlight before HRC walks on to stage. Also since we will have to\nexpedite getting all our equipment off island, I'm sure our costs will\nescalated.\n- June 11th, 12th or 13th: they are the best options for the venue and\nfrankly for us in terms of logistics.  It is not ideal message wise I\nknow but it's our practical reality. They can close the park, we have\nas much time to build and take down as we need. Chelsea cannot do the\n11tn but we might be able to get her to change. This also enables us\nto do the swing to 4 early states. We have to be in Iowa and Nevada\nthat week anyway.\nOur recommendation is we move to June 11th, 12th, 13th. The indoor\nbackup option would remain one of the armories.\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On May 8, 2015, at 5:52 AM, Robby Mook <re47@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n>\n> Any news on date?\n"
