I\'m running because I want to make being middle class mean something again. \n\n It\'s not enough that CEOs are making more than ever, your family needs to be able to get ahead too.  People need to have a little more so you can worry a little less.  \n\nLook, I know it\'s not going to be easy.   We face some pretty powerful forces. But  I\'ve spent my whole life fighting for children, for families, standing up for America.  I think people know that I don\'t quit and I won\'t quit now\n\nFor me, it isn\'t enough for American families to just get by, you deserve to get ahead.
