However, political candidates such as Hillary Clinton<https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/paid-leave/>, as well as a variety of advocacy groups<https://www.idmarch.org/document/Sick+leave/1gu3Q/WORKPLACE+LEAVE+IN+A+MOVEMENT+BUILDING+CONTEXT+How+to+Win+the+Strong+Policies+that+Create+Equity+for+Everyone++MOVEMENT+MOMENTUM>, have given paid leave prominence on their agendas, with many successes already notched. As the economist Heather Boushey<http://democracyjournal.org/magazine/40/home-economics/> noted, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the past decade, more than two-dozen states and localities have passed laws giving workers the right to earn paid sick days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEconomic News\r\nWhen a Major Metro System Shuts Down, Low-Income Workers Pay the Price<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chelsea-kiene/when-major-metro-shuts-down-low-income_b_9479638.html>\r\nHuffington Post \xe2\x80\x93 Chelsea Kiene\r\nAn equally important conversation officials should be having are the potential impacts of such mammoth service disruptions to the area's most vulnerable populations, particularly low-income workers. After all, the ability to quickly absorb major disruptions in public transportation access\xe2\x80\x94in other words, the ability to find alternative ways to easily and safely get to work, or to fulfill work obligations remotely\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8ais in many ways its own form of economic privilege.\r\n\r\nThe 20th anniversary of the myth that won\xe2\x80\x99t quit<http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/273167-the-20th-anniversary-of-the-myth-that-wont-quit>\r\nThe Hill \xe2\x80\x93 Michael Saltsman\r\nToday, it\xe2\x80\x99s even clearer that the Card-Krueger conclusions in Myth and Measurement were without foundation. In a 2007 summary of the previous two decades of research, the economists Neumark and Wascher found that 85 percent of the most credible studies pointed to job loss following a minimum wage hike.\r\n\r\nStop Agreeing To Be On All-Male Panels \xe2\x80\x93 Just Stop <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/all-male-panel-pledge_us_56e848f9e4b065e2e3d77148>\r\nHuffington Post \xe2\x80\x93 Emily Peck\r\nOn Tuesday afternoon, a United Nations-based organization devoted to responsible business practices took a stand on the issue.

In addition to experiencing more violent crime, people in racially segregated pockets might be stranded further from good jobs or the transportation necessary to reach them. The data might help explain why African Americans fare worse across various health metrics.\r\n\r\nWhy Tech Is the Leading Industry on Parental Leave<http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/03/tech-paid-paternity-leave/473922/>\r\nThe Atlantic \xe2\x80\x93 Bourree Lam\r\nThe U.S. tech sector has been leading the way<http://www.buzzfeed.com/susiearmitage/tech-companies-offer-workers-the-most-paid-parental-leave#.pizdYaMwXj> in offering paid leave for new parents.

Democrats, including those who have been supporting Hillary, should thank Senator Sanders for his campaign on the issues. He has crystalized in many minds why we need to deal with the issue of economic inequality and by doing so has made Hillary a stronger candidate. Hillary has always been strong but one can clearly see she has gotten better and better in the both the debates and town halls she participates in.\r\n\r\nRisk Analysis Group Says a Donald Trump Presidency Would Drag Down Global Growth<http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/03/16/risk-analysis-group-says-a-donald-trump-presidency-would-drag-down-global-growth/>\r\nNY Times \xe2\x80\x93 Alan Rappeport\r\n\r\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit<https://gfs.eiu.com/Article.aspx?articleType=gr&articleid=2866>, based in London, has been carefully monitoring Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s march toward the Republican presidential nomination, and on Wednesday it warned in a report that a President Trump could be a drag on global growth.\xe2\x80\x9cIn the event of a Trump victory, his hostile attitude to free trade, and alienation of Mexico and China in particular, could escalate rapidly into a trade war,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the report.\r\n"
