But the person who will introduce her will tell a story\nabout gun violence in her life, and there will be people in the audience\nfrom gun violence orgs.\n\nSince she won\'t have a podium, rather than write TPs that cover her broader\nmessage, I just did guns.\n\nSee what you think.  Attached and pasted below.\n\n*HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON*\n\n*TALKING POINTS ON GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION*\n\n*MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE*\n\n*MONDAY, OCTOBER 5, 2015*\n\n\xc2\xb7      Too many families have stories like Erin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 or worse.\n\n\xc2\xb7      We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen yet another mass murder \xe2\x80\x93 this time, in a community\ncollege in Oregon that\xe2\x80\x99s probably a lot like this one.  That same day, a\nfive-month-old baby girl strapped into her car seat was killed by a stray\nbullet in Cleveland.  She was the third child killed by a gun in Cleveland\nin the last month alone.\n\n\xc2\xb7      We can\xe2\x80\x99t just pray for the victims and their families, and pretend\nlike that\xe2\x80\x99s enough.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not nearly enough.  We need to *act*. We need to\nbuild a movement.\n\n\xc2\xb7      You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be afraid to go college, or the movies, or a\nBible study class, or to drive around your hometown with your kids in the\nbackseat.  What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with us that we can\xe2\x80\x99t we stand up to the NRA and\ngun manufacturers?\n\n\xc2\xb7      I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of politicians reacting to gun deaths with what amounts to\na shrug.  Here\xe2\x80\x99s what Jeb Bush actually said about the massacre in Oregon:\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cStuff happens. There\xe2\x80\x99s always a crisis.  And the impulse\nis always to do something.  And it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily the right thing."\n\n\xc2\xb7      Governor: you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more wrong.  This kind of violence doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\njust *happen*.  We *let* it happen.  We let it happen when we don\xe2\x80\x99t take\nsensible steps to keep guns out of the wrong hands.  We let it happen when\nwe don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to gun dealers who break the rules.  We let it happen\nwhen children die and we don\xe2\x80\x99t do a thing about it.\n\n\xc2\xb7      People who claim they want to lead America shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just accept the\nmass murder of Americans.  You deserve so much better than that.\n\n\xc2\xb7      As President, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take on the gun lobby. I\xe2\x80\x99ll fight to stop\ndomestic abusers and people with mental illness from getting guns\xe2\x80\xa6 to\nrevoke the licenses of gun dealers who break the rules\xe2\x80\xa6 to get\nmilitary-style weapons off our streets\xe2\x80\xa6 and to end the special immunity\nthat protects gun-makers from accountability.\n\n \xc2\xb7      If Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t act to prevent gun violence, as President, I\nwill.  That\xe2\x80\x99s a promise.\n\n\n\n>\n>\n'
