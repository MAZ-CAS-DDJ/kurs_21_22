john.podesta@gmail.comb'Following up on our call last week about the stump speech, I want to share this significantly revised draft.  (I\'m actually sending two documents: One is a full speech at roughly 20 minutes and one is a 5-minute excerpt.)\n\nAs you\'ll see, I\'ve tried to focus in on the core argument of why the middle class is so important for America\'s future and what it\'s going to take to "make being middle class mean something again."  Especially in the 20-minute version, I\'ve tried to personalize the case by drawing on her family history, faith, record in public life, and experience in the world.  The tone is hopefully more optimistic and forward-looking than before, with less time spent diagnosing the problem and more spent on how we\'ll fix it.  At the top, I\'ve tried a few things that may or may not work in the name of experimentation, directness, and authenticity.  Will be curious for your reaction.\n\nThis is definitely still very much a work in progress, and I\'m sure you\'ll once again have lots of helpful edits and guidance.  I\'m particularly interested in ideas for addressing Podesta\'s concern about newness, because I don\'t think we\'re quite there yet.\n\nThanks and I look forward to discussing.\nDan\n\n'
