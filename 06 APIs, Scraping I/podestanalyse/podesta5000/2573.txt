The following statement can be attributed to Lily Eskelsen Garc\xc3\xada\n<http://www.nea.org/home/NEA-President-Profile.html>, president of the National\nEducation Association <http://www.nea.org/>, which represents 3 million\neducators:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs Americans prepare to pick our next president, public education must be\npart of the conversation. Tonight we heard five Democratic presidential\ncandidates talk about the real issues that are challenging Americans.\nSubstantive issues\xe2\x80\x94such as expanding early childhood education, closing the\nopportunity gaps, and addressing the crushing college debt that is\ncrippling students\xe2\x80\x94were given focus because these candidates understand the\npath to a stronger America starts in our classrooms. While we want to see\npublic education play a larger role in future debates, we were pleased to\nhear the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 visions to keep America moving forward.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton scored an A-plus tonight.
