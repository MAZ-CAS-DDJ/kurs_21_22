john.podesta@gmail.comb"Hi John, \n\nJust a heads up, Paul Ryan's new book comes out today and his publisher is furious! It turns out that they accidentally shipped it with the wrong cover, and they need your help to make things right. \n\nWe have the correct cover and it's up to us to get it on as many of his books as possible, as soon as possible. The real cover is right here [ http://postimg.org/image/j8w0uqmsl/ ]. Just print it out, take it to your nearest bookstore, and place it over the book jacket. Rep. Ryan is counting on us, let's not let him down! \n\nRemember to email us at Erica@agendaproject.org with any pictures you take of the corrected covers, and share them on social media with the tag #SaveGranny. We'll let the publisher know you helped them out! \n\n-ep \n\nErica Payne\nAgenda Project Action Fund \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Click here to unsubscribe [ https://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/8820/p/salsa/supporter/unsubscribe/public/?Email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&email_blast_KEY=36698 ]"
