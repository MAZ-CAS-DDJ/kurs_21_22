Tell your Senators to oppose any amendments to the FY 2014 budget resolution that would weaken vital environmental programs [ http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=12891 ]. \n\nSlipping back-door amendments into the budget without hearings or full debate is a terrible way to set environmental policy. Unfortunately, we expect to see dozens of "riders" offered in the upcoming Senate budget debate that would put the health of our water, air, and communities at risk. You can help us make sure those amendments don\'t pass \xe2\x80\x93 send a message to your Senators today and tell them to stand up for a pro-environment budget today [ http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=12891 ]!\n\nSome of the possible riders would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from protecting communities impacted by toxic coal ash, from finalizing protections for the sources of drinking water for 117 million Americans, and from moving forward with plans to cut greenhouse gases and toxic air emissions. \n\nTell your Senators, "enough is enough" and demand that they reject any amendments to the FY 2014 Budget Resolution that would weaken environmental protections. Back-door budget riders are a bad idea. Tell your Senator to vote NO on any budget amendments that would weaken protections for our environment and our health [ http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=12891 ]!\n\nYours for Clean Water, \n\n-Bob Wendelgass, President & CEO\n\n\n----------------------\nTell a Friend\nDo you know someone who might be interested in learning about our work? <http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/t/201/tellafriend.jsp?tell_a_friend_KEY=3263>Tell them!\n\nDonate\nSupport Clean Water Action by <https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/t/9935/content.jsp?content_KEY=6304&tag=email.passiveask>making a donation today.\n\nConnect\n<http://www.facebook.com/pages/Clean-Water-Action/22907478728?ref=nf> Join us on Facebook\n<http://twitter.com/cleanh2oaction></http:> Follow us on Twitter\n<http://www.youtube.com/cleanwateraction> Check out our YouTube channel\n<http://cleanwateraction.we-care.com></http:>Shop with a purpose!
