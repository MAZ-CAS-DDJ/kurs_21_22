john.podesta@gmail.comb"John, I'm asking for $5.\n\nNo tricks, no gimmicks -- just an email for $5.\n\n-- the election is FOUR DAYS away\n-- a brand new poll shows Brad TRAILING Bob Dold by 2 points\n-- and Republicans are spending $2.5 MILLION against Brad this week alone.\n\nWhat else can we say? What you do right now will determine the outcome of this race.\n\nSeriously, Brad needs you now -- we're just asking for $5 (or more if you can afford it!).\n\nPlease John, chip in $5 right now and send Brad back to Congress.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/schneiderq42014?refcode=em_FR_2014.10.31_b3_tm_all-s2&amp;recurring=auto&amp;amount=25&amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=DC&amp;zip=20016&amp;phone=2162818851&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=\n\nTHANK YOU!\n\nTracy----\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.\n\nTo unsubscribe, go to: \n  http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/unsubscribe\n\n"
