john.podesta@gmail.comb'Bernard Schwartz wasn\'t very difficult to schedule. My instinct is that it\nwould be easy enough to move that meeting to the afternoon but I will just\ncheck now with his scheduler to see if it\'s even possible.\n\nThursday afternoon is also a possibility in your schedule.\n\nMilia Fisher\n(858) 395-1741\n\nOn Jun 28, 2015, at 11:24 AM, Eryn Sepp <esepp@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\nFYI on polling meetings for this week. Schedule below.\n\nTuesday\'s works. But Wednesday\'s conflicts with Bernard Schwartz. Milia,\nhow hard was it to land that? John, what\'s your preference to keep on the\nbooks? Move Schwartz or skip IA polling?\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n\n*From:* Kate Offerdahl <kofferdahl@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Date:* June 28, 2015 at 11:09:42 AM EDT\n*To:* Christina Reynolds <creynolds@hillaryclinton.com>, Varun Anand <\nvanand@hillaryclinton.com>,  Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com>,\nEmily Samsel <esamsel@hillaryclinton.com>,  Elizabeth Renda <\nerenda@hillaryclinton.com>, Tony Carrk <tcarrk@hillaryclinton.com>,  Sawsan\nBay <sbay@hillaryclinton.com>, Corey Ciorciari <\ncciorciari@hillaryclinton.com>,  Milia Fisher <mfisher@hillaryclinton.com>,\nEryn Sepp <esepp@hillaryclinton.com>,  Mona Thinavongsa <Mona@algpolling.com>,\nShannon Currie <scurrie@bsgco.com>,  Caitlin Merchant <\ncaitlin@grunwald-communications.com>,  "Esterhay, Ellen" <\nEllen.Esterhay@gmmb.com>, Katie Connolly <kconnolly@bsgco.com>,  Peter\nBrodnitz <pbrodnitz@bsgco.com>, Rich Davis <rich@dixondavismedia.com>\n*Subject:* *Polling Briefings*\n\nDear all,\n\nI\'ll be putting two meetings on the books this week - briefings on the\nrecent polls in NH and IA.\n\nThis timing is firm, and apologies for not being able to move them around.\nAppreciate what you can do to make sure you/your principals to be there.\n\nTuesday: 11-12:30 PM - NH Poll Briefing\nWednesday: 10:30-12 PM - IA Poll Briefing\n\nFYI - the Weekly Long-Term Message Briefing meeting, normally scheduled for\n6-7pm on Wednesdays will be canceled this week.\n\nMany thanks!\nKate\n'
