john.podesta@gmail.comb"Progressive Turnout Project\n\nINSTANT POLL\n\nRESPONDENT: John Podesta \n\nShould citizens convicted of nonviolent crimes be allowed to vote once their sentence is complete?\n\nhttp://go.turnoutpac.org/Restore-Votes\n\nJohn --\n\nIn 2012, more than 5.8 million Americans were prevented from voting due to their criminal history. In Florida alone, more than 1 out of every 10 citizens 18 years or older cannot vote due to their criminal history.\n\nRight now, 10 states have laws on the books that disenfranchise some felons for the rest of their lives.\n\nOf course, there's a strong argument for preventing society's most dangerous criminals from voting. But many people believe that American citizens convicted of nonviolent crimes should be able to vote after they are released from prison.\n\nShould citizens convicted of nonviolent crimes be allowed to vote once their sentence is complete?\n\nWe want to know what our supporters think.
