john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John,\n\nI have an urgent request.\n\nThere are two critical decisions the Obama administration will make in the\ncoming weeks. These decisions have the potential to save consumers billions\nof dollars at the pump, reduce our dangerous dependence on oil, and save\nthousands of lives.\n\nAs a member of LCV\'s Environmental Majority Council, we need your\nhelp to ensure that the administration moves ahead with the most protective health\nstandard for smog and the strongest new vehicle efficiency standards.\n\nReducing Smog, Saving Lives: The current smog standard, set by the Bush administration in 2008 falls far short of what level scientists agree is needed to protect public health and has been challenged in court by public health and environmental organizations.The EPA has been working to strengthen the smog standard for over a year and after delaying action several times has set a late July deadline to announce a strengthened smog standard. We believe that the EPA and the White House are making these key decisions in the next couple of weeks.\n\nAdvancing Cleaner Cars, Reducing Dangerous Oil Dependence: The administration is currently considering the next round of car fuel efficiency and global warming pollution standards (from 2017 to 2025). Last year the administration finalized historic fuel efficiency standards for cars sold through 2016, which will save over 1.8 billion barrels of oil. In March, the President set a goal of reducing our nation\'s oil dependence by one-third by 2025. The single biggest step the administration can take to reach that goal is to set strong car\nefficiency standards that achieve at least 60 mile-per-gallon by 2025. Facing pressure from the auto industry, we are concerned that the White House may opt for a lower standard that won\'t deliver the innovation in car technologies or oil savings that we need.\n\nMake your voice heard by calling the White House switchboard at 202-456-1414 today. Below is a sample of what we are urging our supporters to make clear to senior White House officials:\n\nSample Message:\n\nI am calling about two opportunities to protect public health and reduce oil dependence that are very important to me. The first issue is the updated smog standard. The White House should let EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson set a national smog standard that follows\nthe science, the law, and protects public health. Jackson has rightly said the current smog standards are "not defensible" and I want to see her issue a standard that truly protects public health this summer.\n\nThe second issue concerns the next round of car fuel efficiency standards. I strongly support the President\'s goal of reducing our nation\'s dangerous dependence on oil and the single biggest step he could take to achieve this goal would be setting fuel efficiency standards of at least 60 miles per gallon by 2025.\n\nPlease let us know if you are willing to make your voice heard.
