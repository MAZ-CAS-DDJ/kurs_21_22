Three organizations that\nwork directly on these issues have published a short and informative primer\nthat I'd like to bring to your attention.  The organizations are NASPA \xe2\x80\x94\nStudent Affairs Administrators in Higher Education, the American\nPsychological Association (APA) and the American Council on Education\n(ACE).  While this falls primarily in the purview of the Campus Life\nCommittee, it is an issue that affects academics, finances, risk\nmanagement, and is truly at the core of the mission, so I encourage you to\ntake the time to look it over.  Thanks -- I hope you are all staying warm\nas the polar vortex envelops the campus once again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Strategic Primer on College Student Mental Health\n<http://www.apa.org/pubs/newsletters/access/2014/10-14/college-mental-health.pdf>\n\xe2\x80\x9d\n*************************************\nTeresa L.
