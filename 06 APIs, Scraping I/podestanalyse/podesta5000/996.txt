john.podesta@gmail.comb"A few suggestions:\n1) I'd take one more pass through this and strip the defensive stuff\nout ( we may have not been perfect stuff, etc.) just make it factual.\n2) I'd move the sections on what Teneo does and what you do up to the\ntop and then go through the details and how they have helped WJC; in\nthis draft what the actual activities are sort of come in at the end.\n3) If I were you I'd take Lasry out of this. You'll get into a deep\ndebate about who's right and who's not with CC on this.  The list is\nreally strong without it, so why get into that.\n\n\nOn Sat, Nov 12, 2011 at 7:14 PM, Doug Band <doug@presidentclinton.com> wrote:\n> Need get this asap to them although I'm sure cvc won't believe it to be true\n> bc she doesn't want to\n> Even though the facts speak for themselves.\n> John, I would appreciate your feedback and any suggestions\n>\n> I'm also starting to worry that if this story gets out, we are screwed.
