The Republican presidential\ncandidate and Vietnam POW opposed bipartisan support for renewal and\nexpansion of the "21st\x1b$B!>\x1b(Bcentury GI Bill" that increases educational benefits\nsuch as in\x1b$B!>\x1b(Bstate tuition reimbursement and extends coverage to National\nGuard troops and Reserves. The bill, which was sponsored by Vietnam Marine\ninfantry officer and former Secretary of the Navy, U.S. Sen. Jim Webb, is\nalso supported by 91 percent of Americans. McCain who initially supported\nthe bill said, "One of the things we ought to do is provide significant\neducational benefits in return for serving." Later, he opposed the measure.\nFacing opposition from veterans\' groups, McCain argued that if government\nmakes college more affordable, people might leave the military rather than\nre\x1b$B!>\x1b(Benlist.

Moreover, McCain lacked the courtesy to\nshow up for the vote, choosing instead to attend a pro\x1b$B!>\x1b(Bfootball fundraiser\nin California.

Billions of dollars in public subsidies\nfor oil and gas companies continue, while productive incentives for\nrenewable energy languish. And, the inane idea of drilling for oil in\ncoastal areas on the outer continental shelf is being billed as a legitimate\nresponse to the problem of $4.00 per gallon. The Albuquerque Journal\n(subscription required) saw fit to ignore reality and jump on the "black\ngold" bandwagon in its Sunday editorial. Like Congress and the president,\nthe Journal is no help at all for the people of New Mexico. Because the\npresident and his apologists in the press are beating the domestic drilling\ndrum, I thought it might be interesting to find out just what kind of a\nmarginal effect, if any, increased American oil exploration would have. So,\nI did what any armchair research novice would do; I jumped on Google. My\ngrandiose plans of finding a slick econometric analysis quickly ended when I\ncame across a story on NPR, one that put the nonsense about offshore\ndrilling into simple perspective. Henry Lee of the Kennedy School of\nGovernment talks about the 8\x1b$B!>\x1b(B14 year time line for getting outer\ncontinental shelf drilling on\x1b$B!>\x1b(Bline and fully operational. High\x1b$B!>\x1b(Bend\nestimates put daily production at about 1 million barrels per day, or less\nthan 1% of the world\'s daily oil consumption. This is hardly the kind of\nvolume that would make a discernible dent. Plus, with growing needs from\nChina, India and other Asian countries, oil from the outer continental shelf\nwould have virtually zero impact on world demand. (NPR story) There you have\nit. When it comes to finding a sensible solution to the related crises of\nskyrocketing fossil fuel costs and global climate change, leaders in\nWashington are ignoring plain facts. Instead of serving the public interest,\nleaders in Washington, and our own Albuquerque Journal, are no help at all.\n\n\n\nMinnesota\n\n\n\nAlliance for a Better Minnesota continues to lead the charge in organizing\naround the National Republican Convention.

John McCain with the same broad brush.\n\n\n"It\'s very powerful to see the timetable and cause and effect of so many of\nthe administration\'s failed policies," said Marlene Ostrow, 49, who traveled\nfrom Cincinnati to see the bio\x1b$B!>\x1b(Bdiesel\x1b$B!>\x1b(Bpowered rolling anti\x1b$B!>\x1b(BBush museum at\nCourthouse Square in downtown Dayton.\n\n\nDisplays in the bus include timelines, videos and photographs outlining what\nthe advocacy group, Americans United for Change, believes are the Bush\nAdministration\'s disastrous policies and actions.\n\n\nDisplays covered Iraq, the economy, Hurricane Katrina, health care, workers\'\nrights and education. A large old\x1b$B!>\x1b(Bfashioned style gas pump sat at the back\nof the bus, with an electronic display that could determine the annual cost\nof gas to a consumer. Atop the pump was a round sign with a large "W" in the\nmiddle and the words "Bush Cheney Oil," and at the bottom, and one that said\n"GOP Grand Oil Party."\n\n\nAsked to react to the group\'s message, Republican National Committee\nspokeswoman Blair Latoff said, "The last thing Ohioans want or need is a bus\nfull of professional partisans rolling into town and tearing people down.\nOhio needs leadership and they are looking for someone like John McCain who\nhas demonstrated the capability and willingness to work on both sides of the\naisle to get things done."\n\n\nMcCain was targeted along with Bush in speeches by local government\nofficials and union and civil rights leaders. They asked the lunchtime crowd\nto support Democratic Sen.
