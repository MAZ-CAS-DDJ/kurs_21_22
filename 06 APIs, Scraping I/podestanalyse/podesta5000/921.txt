Also, not sure if you saw \nthe General Mills announcement this am (below), but this is the result of \nabout 2 years of work for me.\n\nGeneral Mills, like Campbells has figured out that this is really the \nright, and popular thing to do.  They are entering the 21st century at \nlast, albeit slowly.  HRC should be leading on this...it will absolutely \nbe a huge step in helping to win over millions of young Bernie supporters. \n\n\nAs ever, lets talk this through if you want.

"The result: consumers all over the U.S. will soon \nbegin seeing words legislated by the state of Vermont on the labels of \nmany of their favorite General Mills products."\nHowever, Harmening said the company is still going to work with the rest \nof the industry to get Congress to pass a law to set a national standard.\n"With the Vermont labeling legislation upon us, and with the distinct \npossibility that other states will enact different labeling requirements, \nwhat we need is simple: We need a national solution."\nThe announcement from General Mills marks the second major food company to \ndecide to label its products nationally. The Campbell Soup Company made \npublic its plans to do the same in January. It also follows a failed \neffort Wednesday by Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts to \npass a bill that would preempt GMO labeling laws in Vermont and other \nstates from taking effect. \nWhile lawmakers and the food industry have agreed to continue to work on \nfederal legislation, it\'s unclear if a compromise short of labeling on \npackages will garner enough support from Democrats to gain passage.\nTo view online:\nhttps://www.politicopro.com/agriculture/whiteboard/2016/03/general-mills-to-label-gmos-in-products-069172\n\nGary Hirshberg\nChairman, Stonyfield Farm\nChairman, Just Label It\n \n \n\n\n----- Forwarded by Gary HIRSHBERG/StonyfieldUS/DANONENA/AM/DANONE on \n03/18/2016 12:31 PM -----\n\nFrom:   Scott Faber <sfaber@ewg.org>\nTo:     Ken Cook <ken@ewg.org>, Gary Hirshberg <GHIRSHBERG@Stonyfield.com>\nDate:   03/16/2016 04:37 PM\nSubject:        Fwd: Clinton tweet\n\n\n\n\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n\nFrom: "Amy C.
