But there is no time to waste. He must take the lead\nwith a bold clean energy agenda as soon as he takes office. \n\nSign our petition urging President-elect Obama to Repower,\nRefuel, and Rebuild America in his first 100 days.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/campaign/100_days/6kk3b5rv7mw6bte?\n\nThe League of Conservation Voters, in partnership with nearly a\ndozen environmental groups, has collected more than 100,000\nsignatures to send a strong message to the President-elect that\nnow is the time to grow our economy and build a sustainable\nenergy future. \n\nWe are calling on President-elect Obama to support four goals\nthe moment he steps foot in the Oval Office: \n\n**Moving America to 100% clean electricity;\n**Cutting our dependence on oil in half;\n**Creating 5 million new clean energy jobs; and\n**Cutting global warming pollution by at least 80%.\n\nNow is the time to take action. We can\'t wait any longer to\nsolve our energy crisis, so add your voice today. \n\nClick here to sign the petition to Repower, Refuel, and Rebuild\nAmerica.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/campaign/100_days/6kk3b5rv7mw6bte?\n\nSincerely,\n\nGene Karpinski\nPresident, League of Conservation Voters\n\n*******************************\n\nTell A Friend!\nTell your friends to sign up for LCV updates today.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/lcv/join-forward.html?domain=lcvorg&r=upzLkNKqt6O2&\n\nSign up for LCV Updates\nIf you received this message from a friend, you can sign up for\nLeague of Conservation Voters updates.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/lcv/join.html?r=upzLkNKqt6O2E&\n\nQuestions?\nIf you have any questions about this message or any other League\nof Conservation Voters issue, please click here or call\n202-785-8683.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/ct/f1zLkNK1_zCP/\n\nPolicy\nYou, or someone on your behalf, has subscribed to receive this\ninformation from the League of Conservation Voters.
