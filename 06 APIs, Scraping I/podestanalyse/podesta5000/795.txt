john.podesta@gmail.comb'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear John and Mary:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarolyn and I would be honored if you and both could attend our Passover Seder on Friday, April 3, at 7 pm, at our home in Potomac Maryland. We are proud that our Seders are less traditional.  While they tell the story of the Exodus in the Seder book called the \xe2\x80\x9cHaggadah,\xe2\x80\x9d it is mostly in English and we also dedicate our Seders each year to an individual or an historic event that offers a profound message for our Seder gathering. In years past, for example, we have dedicated our Seder that year to Pee Wee Reese, who should the moral courage during the Cincinnati Reds-Brooklyn Dodgers game to walk across the field to put his arm around Jackie Robinson; to the cause of Palestinian-Israeli peace and a two-state solution; to Malala Yousafzai for her courage and inspiration for young women around the globe; and, on the year of his death, to Gerald Ford for his integrity and dignity when he served as president through difficult times and crises for our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have also been honored in years past with special guests and friends, such as former congressman, Secretary, and legendary quarterback Jack Kemp; former Ambassador to Sweden under President Clinton, Tom Siebert; and Dr. Ziad Asali, the head of the Washington D.C.-based American Task Force on Palestine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe would be so happy if you both  could join us this year.   We expect about 10-12 guests in total. Our tradition has been to invite Jews and non-Jews to share this experience of our Seder, which so many people have remarked upon as memorable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHope you are well \xe2\x80\x93\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLanny\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x8e\r\n'
