He told me that I could use it\r\nfor the Think Blue website.  I contacted Amy Dacey, who is the\r\nexecutive director for Fund for America.  She sent me a different\r\nvideo that is the "Democracy Alliance Clip for Anna\'s Political\r\nPresentation."\r\n\r\nCan you please ask him for the name of that video that he uses, or for\r\na copy of the video if for some reason he has one with him.\r\n I don\'t think it is going to be a problem, since I read in the paper\r\nthe other day that the Fund for America is disbanding\r\n\r\nTHANKS!!!\r\n\r\n--\r\nEmily Tisch Sussman, J.D.\r\nPresident and Founder, Think Blue\r\nwww.Thinkblue.net\r\n\r\nE-MAIL CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This e-mail message is intended solely\r\nfor the addressee(s) and may contain confidential and/or legally\r\nprivileged information.
