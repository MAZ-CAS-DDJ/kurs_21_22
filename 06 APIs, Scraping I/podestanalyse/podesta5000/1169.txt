Fitzpatrick to Crack Down on Wall\nStreet, *\n\n*Not Sesame Street*\n\n\n\n*LANGHORNE *\x96 Once again Big Bird will take center stage in the 2012\nelection with Mitt Romney and Rep. Fitzpatrick detractors welcoming the\ntraveling \x93Bain Worker Bus\x94 to *Sesame Place on Wednesday at 5:30pm*.\n\n\n\nThe Bain Worker Bus is a nationwide tour with a contingent of workers from\ncompanies owned by Bain Capital, the private equity firm Mitt Romney\nfounded and continues to profit from.\n\n\n\nThe bus will stop in front of Sesame Place, where a crowd of local\nsupporters, including a costumed Big Bird character, will welcome the Bain\nworkers. The Bain workers will be speaking out, along with local\nunemployed, under-employed and outsourced workers about the dangers of a\n\x93Romney Economy\x94 where good jobs are outsourced and minimum wage jobs, with\nno benefits, remain.\n\n\n\n\x93We know that this election is not about Sesame Street, but it says a lot\nthat politicians like Mitt Romney and Rep. Fitzpatrick would rather end\nfunding for Big Bird than end tax breaks for big oil,\x94 said Earl Williams\nof Levittown.\n\n\n\n*WHAT:*  Sesame Place Showdown: Big Bird Meets Bain Capital\n\n*WHEN:*  Wednesday, October 10, 5:30 pm\n\n*WHERE:*  Sesame Place, 100 Sesame Road, Langhorne, PA\n\n(in front of the Sesame Place main entrance)\n\n*WHO:* Big Bird, local community members, Bain workers\n\n\n\nFor more information and updates on the bus tour, visit\nwww.BainWorkerBus.org <http://www.bainworkerbus.org/>.\n\n\n[image: Inline image 1]\n\n\n *****VISUALS:* Big Bird, Sesame Place, wrapped Bain Bus****\n\n\n\n *Pennsylvania Working Families is a grassroots organization fighting for\nan economy that works for everyone and politicians who stand for working\nfamilies, not corporate CEOs.*\n\nwww.paworkingfamilies.org\n\n###\n-- \n\nJulie Blust\n\nPennsylvania Working Familes\njblust@paworkingfamilies.org\n215-713-6777\n@PAWorkFamilies\nhttp://paworkingfamilies.org/\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to dubois.sara@gmail.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
