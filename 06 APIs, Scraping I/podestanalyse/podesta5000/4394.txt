Revised below. This is a verbal message only.\n\n-tom\n\n\nI know there has been a lot of uncertainty since the announcement that\nwe are not running ads.  I want to make sure I put an end to any\nspeculation of what might happen next.  As someone deeply vested in\nwhat we have built together this has not been easy.\n\nFirst, I wanted to thank you for your head-down singular focus on\nknocking around the McCain team for their lobbyist ties. Working with\nour partners and relentlessly pursuing this you have broken through,\ndespite the news about us not running ads.\n\nThe last week has shown exactly how an aggressive earned media\ncampaign can screw with the McCain campaign. They are thin-skinned\nabout these stories and there is a lot more there. We need to keep\nthat going.\n\nWhat is clear is that there are going to be changes in how we do our\nwork-a restructuring.\n\nI wanted to share the possible options with you and a timeline of what\nyou can expect.\n\n1.   WHOLE CAMPAIGN TAKEOVER -We might be subsumed into the work of a\nnew organization. We would continue to co-locate and work together.\n\n2.   COMPONENT CAMPAIGN PARTS RESTRUCTURED -We may divide up the\ncampaign projects and have partners take over various parts of the\nwork, various staff pods and projects subsumed by partners. We would\ntry to continue to co-locate and work together.\n\nTimeline and Guarantees:\n\n-The decisions about the next phase of the campaign will be made this week.\n\n-You still have your job. We are working to make sure the transition\nto a new organization or organizations is seamless and trying to\nfigure out transition assistance (pay) when it might not be.\n\nI said it last week and I will say it again. No group of people on the\nplanet is better prepared to take on John McCain right now. Back to\nwork.\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, May 20, 2008 at 11:11 AM, Matthew Butler\n<matthewsbutler@gmail.com> wrote:\n>\n> Think we need to be clear that even in scenario 2 we're looking at options\nthat keep the staff co-located and working together, they just may not all\nget paychecks from the same entity.\n>\n>\n>\n> On Tue, May 20, 2008 at 11:09 AM, Tom Matzzie <tom@zzranch.com> wrote:\n>>\n>> feedback welcome\n>>\n>> I know there has been a lot of uncertainty since the announcement that we\nare not running ads.
