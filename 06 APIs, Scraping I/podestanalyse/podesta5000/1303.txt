I write in hopes of helping you work through\nit.\n\n\n\nI was not valorous enough to simply withdraw from playing a substantial role\non Health because I think I'm pretty good at this, feel that in some sense I\nowe it to my friend to try my best to push the quality up, and figure that's\nwhy he asked me to be involved. Not for diversity. Not because I'm his old\nprofessor. But because he thinks I have something to contribute in the\npolicy domain.  So, I just want to give it my best shot.\n\n\n\nI won't rehash my concerns with the health memo as drafted by Jeanne.  My\ncomments began by stating, in essence, that I wouldn't object to you\nforwarding it to Barack.  On the other hand, I wouldn't if I were in your\nposition because I don't think it's good enough.  It was okay, but not up to\n(what I take to be) his standards.  If you want me to rewrite it, just say\nso.  That's what I would prefer to do, taking my board role seriously.\n\n\n\nMy request is that you either support me as the board member overseeing\nhealth, or remove me from that role.  If you choose the former, tell Jeanne.\nIf you do the latter, tell Barack.  I will salute either way.\n\n\nLet me just repeat what I said to you over a month ago: I am concerned just\na bit that Tom Daschle and Jeanne are approaching this too intently from a\nHill rather than White House perspective.  Pre-transition, they were\ncommitted to an independent effort to forge a bi-partisan proposal.  Now\nthey are in the awkward position of continuing that effort while\nsimultarneously trying to figure out how to advance the specifics to which\nBarack has spoken as a candidate.  To some extent, you put them in an\ninherently conflicted role.\n\n\nSome resolution of this would be helpful.  I don't especially relish the\nidea of disrupting my life to spend substantial time in DC just to keep tabs\non Education and Immigration policy \x96 I know most of the members of those\nteams, have a lot of confidence in them, and can provide some coaching\nwithout being in DC.\n\n\n\nYou didn't reply to my note about being involved on the personnel side.  I\nam interested partly to be in a position to press diversity and quality, but\nalso because if you take Health away from me, it might provide the added\njustification for spending time in DC.  But, if there are too many chefs in\nthe kitchen, so be it.\n\n\n\nOf course, if Rahm is going to be chief of staff, this is moot.  You can\njust assume that I will have no role going forward. I'm being realistic, not\npetulant. Sure would simplify things!\n\n\nTHANKS\n\n-- \n(personal email)\nChristopher Edley, Jr.\nProfessor and Dean\nUC Berkeley Law School\n"
