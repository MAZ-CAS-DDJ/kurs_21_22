john.podesta@gmail.comb'Here\xb9s a press statement Public Campaign Action Fund just put out about\nadding the voices of donors to the fight to reform our campaign finance laws\n< a man-bites-dog kinda thing.\n\nPicked up as a preview by CNN.com here:\nhttp://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/05/05/deep-pocketed-donors-want-ca\nmpaign-finance-reform/\n\n\nFor immediate release:            For more information:\nWednesday, May 6, 2009            David Donnelly, 617-899-1084 (cell)\n \nPolitical Donors Lobby For Fair Elections Now Act\n \nNearly 60 Democratic donors who collectively have donated more than $16\nmillion send OEOpen Letter\xb9 to Democratic members of Congress\n \nLetter part of a national campaign to pass Sen. Durbin\xb9s and Rep. Larson\xb9s\nFair Elections legislation\n \nWashington, DC \xad In a letter hand-delivered to the offices of House and\nSenate Democrats today, 58 political donors urged Congress to advance the\nFair Elections Now Act to address the growing problem of campaign\nfundraising.\n \nThe letter, which was organized by campaign finance watchdog Public Campaign\nAction Fund, read in part:\n \n\xb3With so much at stake in Washington today, we believe it is shortsighted to\ncontinue down the present unsustainable path of skyrocketing campaign\nspending. The Fair Elections Now Act is a common sense idea whose time has\ncome, a change that will set us on a better path in the years ahead. We hope\nyou agree with us, and offer your support by co-sponsoring this important\nlegislation.\xb2\n \n\xb3With health care, clean energy, and the economic troubles before them,\nmembers of Congress shouldn\xb9t be spending their time raising money,\xb2 said\nArnold Hiatt, former CEO of Stride Rite and a longstanding champion of\npublic financing of elections. \xb3Congress should pass the Fair Elections Now\nAct and become less dependent on the interests who will be opposed to the\nhealth care, energy, and economic policies the country needs right now.\xb2\n \nThe Fair Elections Now Act was introduced in the Senate by Assistant Senate\nMajority Leader Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Pa.), and in\nthe House by the House Democratic Caucus Chair John Larson (D-Conn,) and\nRep. Water Jones (R-N.C.). For qualified candidates who raise a significant\namount of small donations, the bill would provide a limited amount of public\nfinancing to run for a House or Senate seat.\n \nThe 58 signers on the letter collectively have made $16.2 million in federal\ncontributions, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics,\nwhich guarantees that virtually all of the signers will have appeared on\nmembers of Congress\xb9 fundraising call lists. A significant number of the\nsigners have donated more than $100,000 in the last two elections, and many\nof them have made sizeable political donations to organizations beyond their\nfederal campaign giving. In addition to Mr. Hiatt, the signers include\nprominent political donors such as Ambassador Elizabeth and Smith Bagley of\nWashington, D.C.; Alan and Susan Patricof of New York, New York; Vin Ryan of\nBoston, Massachusetts; and Murray Galinson of San Diego, California.\n \nThe text of the open letter and the full list of who signed can be viewed at\nhttp://www.campaignmoney.org/openletter.\n \nThis open letter follows an effort to organize political donors begun\nearlier this year by Change Congress. Change Congress called a \xb3donor\nstrike\xb2 which has led to grassroots donors withholding approximately $1.4\nmillion in campaign contributions from members of Congress who have not\ncosponsored the Fair Elections Now Act. In addition to political donors,\nprominent lobbyists in Washington, D.C. have spoken out in favor of the Fair\nElections Now Act.\n \nPublic Campaign Action Fund is a national nonprofit dedicated to improving\nAmerica\xb9s campaign finance laws. The group holds politicians accountable for\nopposing comprehensive campaign reform and for the favors politicians do for\ntheir political backers.\n \n###\n\n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
