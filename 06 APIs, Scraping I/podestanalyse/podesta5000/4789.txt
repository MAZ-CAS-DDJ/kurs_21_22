"At the same time Boehner was busy hitting the\nlinks, his office was sending out press releases about how he and his\nparty were still busy working over the recess to find solutions for high\ngas prices.  Not since President Bush said he\'s given up golf\n<http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0508/Bush_has_given_up_gol\nf_for_troops.html>  to recognize the sacrifices of the troops in Iraq\nhave the American people been exposed to such absurd political\ngamesmanship at their expense.  At a time when American families are\nmaking incredible sacrifices choosing between gas, bills and food, John\nBoehner and Senator John McCain\'s best answer is more offshore drilling\nthat even the oil industry admits\n<http://www.mcclatchydc.com/100/story/41379.html>  wouldn\'t yield a drop\nof new oil for 10 years. Reducing gas prices by a nickel cents ten years\nfrom now is not a solution to $4 a gallon gas prices right now - it\'s a\ndistraction advocated by the same big oil companies making record\nprofits that have given Boehner $185,000\n<http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=E01&cycle=All&rec\nipdetail=H&sortorder=N&mem=Y>  and John McCain $1.2 million\n<http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=E01&cycle=All&rec\nipdetail=S&sortorder=N&mem=Y&page=2>  in campaign cash over the years.\nAnd when faced with real solutions for reducing our nation\'s dependence\non foreign oil that the Democratic-led Congress has offered again and\nagain, Congressman Boehner just said "none of the above." \n\n \n\n "The Boehner-McCain-Big Oil offshore drilling proposal seems even more\ndistracting when considering that nearly 80 percent of offshore oil is\nin areas that are already OPEN for exploration," added Funk.  "In fact,\n68 million acres, onshore and offshore, are already under lease by oil\ncompanies, BUT ARE NOT BEING DRILLED.  But, the more area opened up, the\nbetter it is for the big oil companies\' bottom line, so it\'s\nunderstandable why Rep. Boehner is cheerleading for the plan. An\naddiction to big oil campaign cash might also explain why John Boehner\nstands in the way of any legislation to repeal billions of dollars in\nwasteful and unnecessary subsidies to the petroleum industry - subsidies\nthat could instead be invested in clean, renewable energy resources,\npromoting new emerging technologies, developing greater efficiency and\nimproving energy conservation."  \n\n \n\n*Click Here to See Boehner\'s Habitual Record of Obstructionism of Real\nSolutions to the Energy Crisis.\n\nBoehner Tees Off The Political Games....\n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.rollcall.com/news/27290-1.html?type=printer_friendly\n\n\n Republicans Return to House Chamber to Protest Energy Policy\n\nAugust 4, 2008, 4:23 p.m. \nBy Steven T. Dennis\nRoll Call Staff\n\n \n\nTwo dozen House Republicans took over the chamber again Monday to\ncontinue their talk-a-thon protest of Democratic leaders\' decision to go\nhome for the August recess without a vote on expanding oil and gas\ndrilling. \n\n"The microphones aren\'t on, the lights are dim, the cameras are off, but\nwe\'re here because you\'re here," said Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), talking to\na chamber filled with tour groups. \n\nThe Republicans want Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to call Congress\nback into session "so we can have a vote on American energy," Price\nsaid, and Republicans plan to continue their protest speeches on the\nHouse floor at least through the rest of this week. \n\n[...]\n\nIn a joint memo over the weekend, Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio)\nand Minority Whip Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) had urged Members to return to the\nCapitol, although they themselves didn\'t show up.   "It\'s not a request\nwe make lightly. But the American people are suffering," Boehner and\nBlunt said. "We\'ve called on the Speaker to call Congress back into an\nemergency session this month and schedule a vote on the American Energy\nAct. We must continue to make a stand until the Speaker complies."\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOof, need a Mulligan, John?  Because This Looks Like A Triple Bogie on\nthe Shameless Scale....\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/06/AR200808\n0602887_pf.html\n\n \n\nBoehner and the Bunker Mentality\n\nBy Mary Ann Akers And Paul Kane\nThursday, August 7, 2008; A19\n\nAs his troops forsake their August recess this week to raise Cain over\ngas prices, their No. 1 campaign issue, House Minority Leader John A.\nBoehner <http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/b000589/>\n(R-Ohio) has been home tending to his golf game and his fundraising.\n\nEvery day this week, rank-and-file Republicans have staged "shadow\nsession" protests on the House floor over the Democrats\' decision to\nadjourn Congress on Aug. 1 for a five-week recess without passing energy\nlegislation. Officially, according to his office, Boehner is back in\nOhio raising money for his political action committee, the Freedom\nProject.\n\nBut Boehner also found time to squeeze in a couple of rounds of golf.\nBoehner, a 7.6 handicap, reported to a U.S. Golf Association Web site\nthat he shot an 85 at his home course, Wetherington Golf &amp; Country\nClub in West Chester, Ohio. It is unclear based on the site exactly when\nthe round was played. Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said he was\nconfident that the congressman played "over the weekend" -- and not\nduring the energy protests on the House floor.\n\nBoehner was also spotted Tuesday at the lovely Muirfield Village Golf\nClub in Dublin, Ohio, which was designed by Jack Nicklaus and is home to\nthe Golden Bear\'s Memorial tournament, a mainstay of the PGA Tour.\nBoehner was there for an annual Freedom Project fundraiser and golf\ntournament. "Canceling it would have cost tens of thousands of dollars\nfor Republican candidates across the country," Steel told\nwashingtonpost.com\'s Ben Pershing, who first reported Boehner\'s golf\nactivities on the Capitol Briefing blog.\n\nWhile we don\'t know what Boehner shot on the Nicklaus course, Steel said\nthe congressman has generally cut down on golf this year because of back\ntrouble. The stats bear that out, as Boehner\'s scores, assuming he\nreports them all, show that he played just twice this year before this\nweek.\n\nHe\'s expected back in the Capitol tomorrow for what may be the final day\nof the House floor protests by the Republicans.\n\n \n\nCan\'t Run From His Record: Boehner Stands in the Way Time and Again of\nReal Solutions to the Energy Crisis\n\n \n\nBoehner\'s Opportunities to Lower Gas Prices\n\nFREE OUR OIL <http://www.speaker.gov/legislation?id=0238> \n\nDRILL ACT <http://www.speaker.gov/legislation?id=0234> \n\n"USE IT OR LOSE IT" <http://www.speaker.gov/legislation?id=0228> \n\nPRICE GOUGING <http://www.speaker.gov/legislation?id=0224> \n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY <http://www.speaker.gov/legislation?id=0206> \n\nNOPEC PRICE FIXING <http://www.speaker.gov/legislation?id=0201> \n\nPUBLIC TRANSIT <http://www.speaker.gov/legislation?id=0229> \n\nENERGY SECURITY <http://www.speaker.gov/legislation?id=0131> \n\nBoehner\'s Vote\n\nNO <http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll527.xml> \n\nNO <http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll511.xml> \n\nNO <http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll469.xml> \n\nNO <http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll448.xml> \n\nNO <http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll344.xml> \n\nNO <http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll332.xml> \n\nNO <http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll467.xml> \n\nNO <http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll1177.xml> \n\n \n\n*        Boehner voted against comprehensive energy legislation that\nincludes the first new vehicle efficiency standards in 32 years, saving\nfamilies up to $1,000 a year at the pump.
