I loved seeing you in NYC the other week.  It had been too long.  \n> \n> Is there anyway I can tempt you to DC for the evening of June 25?  Dr. G is going to be back in town and once again Tom and I are organizing a fun dinner to welcome him.    We're keeping the guest list small - Carrie and Steve, Linda Thomas Greenfield, Jacob and Lily - but he has specifically requested to see you and your father :)\n> \n> Could you kindly extend the invitation to your dad, and, hopefully, join him?\n> \n> xxx\n> \n> \n> -- \n> Elizabeth H.
