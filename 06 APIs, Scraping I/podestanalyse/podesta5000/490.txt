She did the tour, which\nwill have lots of great images come out of it, and while press\ncouldn't hear her on the tour itself, she referenced what she talked\nabout in the round table a few times, including a comment about all\nthe machines being from other countries at the top.\n\nThe round table itself was another natural, substantive conversation\non a range of issues, from drug use among young people to the need for\na return to vocational training to capital gains taxes and spurring\nsmall business growth.  A note that she hit hedge fund managers again\nfor not paying their fair share in taxes.\n\nShe did very well in the opening, did the four fights, talked about\nour need to make the middle class mean something again, and did it\nwith little to no looking at her notes sounding very natural.\n\nAt the end she chatted with the participants and then walked over to\nshake hands with the guests there.  After some brief conversations she\ndoubled back to the center to take some questions.  The first question\nwas about Clinton Cash and she did quite well with it, used our line\nabout Republicans being focused on her and her being focused on the\nissues.\n\nWMUR asked her 2 questions, one about staged events which she handled\nwell, said she was hear to talk to people and doing this how she\nwanted to do it.  The other question was a redux of the Clinton Cash\nquestion.\n\nWill send a transcript this afternoon.  Headed to Claremont now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Apr 20, 2015, at 1:33 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n\nDeparted Kristin's Bakery, headed to the message event.
