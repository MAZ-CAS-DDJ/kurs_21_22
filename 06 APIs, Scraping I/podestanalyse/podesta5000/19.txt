I had originally planned on surveying wartime investigations\n(Civil War, WWI, WWII, Iraq and Afghanistan). However, after additional\nresearch and a good deal of thought, I believe I have found a topic much\nbetter suited to my academic interests.\n\n\nNew Topic: I would like to examine why Congress should investigate the\nanti-homosexuality law that was recently passed in Uganda, and the United\nStates government's engagement with Uganda on this issue and decision on\nwhether or not to withdraw foreign aid from the country as a result. I\nwould also analyze this through the lens of how one would go about\ninitiating and conducting this proposed investigation using our class\nmaterials and *Congressional Investigations: Politics and\nProcess*(Hamilton, Muse & Amer).\n\n\nI have long been interested in this human rights issue, as I wrote a paper\nabout it as an undergraduate after it was first proposed as a bill. (I\nwould not be using any text or information collected for that paper.) I am\nin the International Women's Human Rights Clinic this semester, and my team\nis focusing on girls' and women's rights in education in Uganda. I do not\nforesee my proposed paper topic overlapping in any way with any work done\nin the Clinic, as the issues are quite distinct, but I did want to flag\nthis. I would, of course, also mention this to the Clinic before proceeding.\n\n\nMany thanks,\n\nAmanda\n\n-- \nS. Amanda Shelton\nJ.D.
