We have a quick turnaround to analyze the data, so we're trying to get as many people to take it as possible over the next few days (read: feel free to pass it along to family, friends, and even people you don't even like that much). I offer lifelong friendship and a more relaxed demeanor in exchange. ;-)\n\nhttp://mcdonough.az1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_aXBa8MifXAjivad\n\nThank you!!\n\nP.S.
