It was the lead story on every major morning show, and\nrepeated continuously throughout the day. Analysts devoted coverage to the\nMcCain surrogate problem, his campaign disarray, and analyzed whether there\nwas any truth in what Graham meant. John Edwards also chimed in on the\nGraham controversy on Good Morning America, where he also used the\nopportunity to go after McCain on being wrong on Iraq. Overall, it was a\nrough week for McCain as several reports pointed out. McCain continued to\nget hit on the Viagra/Healthcare issue, and there was even discussion of\nwhether he could even run for president since he was born in Panama. The\nonly positive McCain story of the day was the release of his fundraising for\nlast month. June proved to be McCain\'s best fundraising month to date.\nOther non-McCain headlines included the possibility of mortgage lending\ngiants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac possibly getting bailed out by the\nFederal government, potentially costing the American taxpayers $3 trillion\ndollars. The California wildfires continue to cause destruction and dominate\ncoverage. And oil prices reach new record highs due to speculation and fear\nof war with Iran. The Senate confirmed General David Petraeus as top\ncommander of the Middle East.\n\nHighlights:\n1.     Phil Graham\'s controversial comments on economy dominate coverage\na.

[\x85]\n\nANDREA MITCHELL: [....] *John McCain is now running as fast as he can to get\naway from one of his closest economic advisers who called Americans, "a\nnation of whiners,"* when it comes to the bad economy. In Michigan, a battle\nground state where the economy is on everyone\'s mind, *John McCain wasted no\ntime throwing his economic advisor, Phil Graham, under the bus.*\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: Phil Graham does not speak for me. I speak for me. So, I\nstrongly disagree.\n\nMITCHELL: Graham, a former senator and PHD economist, told the Washington\nTimes, that American are suffering from a mental recession, not a real one.\n\nPHIL GRAHAM: "[\x85] you\'ve heard of a mental depression. This is a mental\nrecession. We have never had more natural advantages than we have today.\nWe\'ve sort of become a nation of whiners."\n\nMITCHELL: *McCain\'s problem, he and Graham have been friends for decades.\nEver since Graham co-sponsored landmark legislation to control federal\nspending. And this year Graham has been a top McCain economic advisor.*\n\nMCCAIN: There is no one in America that is more respected on the issue of\neconomics than Senator Phil Graham. So I\'m honored that you are here, Phil.\n\nMITCHELL: Barack Obama saw the opening and pounced.\n\nBARACK OBAMA: America already has one Dr. Phil. We don\'t need another one!\n\nMITCHELL: And McCain was so eager to distance himself from Graham; he said\nhis old friend would no longer be a candidate for treasury secretary in a\nMcCain administration.\n\nMCCAIN: I think Senator Graham would be in serious consideration for\nambassador to Belarus. Although I\'m not sure the citizens of Minsk would\nwelcome that.\n\nMITCHELL: Belarus, an outlaw state, is far worse than Siberia in the old\ndays. But even Mink might not be far enough to control the political damage.\n\nCHUCK TODD: *McCain was already seen as somebody who was struggling to show\nthat he was in touch on the issue of the economy. This just made his job\nthat much harder.*\n\nMITCHELL: Today McCain will go to another battleground state, Wisconsin, and\ntry again to get back on message about how much he cares about the\neconomy.<https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/iyruihog00>\n\n*Controversial Graham Comments Lead Story on The Early Show* (CBS, 07/11/08,\n7:04am)\nHARRY SMITH: Senator John McCain has been backed into a corner by a key\neconomic adviser, and forced to disavow some key controversial statements.\n[\x85]\n\nBILL PANTE: Senator Phil Graham, former senator, a key economist, a key\nadvisor to John McCain, but when he seemed to be blowing off people who were\nworried about the economy as a bunch of whiners, that\'s something the McCain\ncampaign didn\'t need. And the candidate was blunt in his response.\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: Phil Graham does not speak for me. I speak for me.\n\nPLANTE: *After spending the past week trying to convince voters that he does\nfeel their pain, McCain was forced into full damage control after his\neconomic advisor appeared to muck the troubles faced by many Americans.* In\nan interview with the Washington Times, Graham questioned the true extent of\nthe country\'s economic downturn saying quote, "You\'ve heard of mental\ndepression; this is a mental recession. We have sort of become a nation of\nwhiners. Complaining about a loss of competitiveness, America in decline."\nBarack Obama wasted no time in responding.\n\nBARACK OBAMA: America already has one Dr. Phil. We don\'t need another one.\n\nPLANTE: Graham said that he had only been talking about the nation\'s\nleaders, *but the comment played right into the democrat\'s charge that\nrepublicans are a bunch of plutocrats that don\'t care about the average\nvoter.* And McCain, when he was asked about a position for Graham in his\nadministration, Graham has often been mentioned as a treasury secretary,\nsaid, well maybe he\'s a candidate for ambassador to Belarus. Belarus is a\nformer Soviet republic, which is still repressive.\n\nHARRY SMITH: Yeah, and McCain went on to say that he wasn\'t sure the people\nof Minsk would be happy about that either.\n<https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/zq2mihns4s>\n*Good Morning America: Gramm\'s comments have caused a media "firestorm" *(ABC\n07/11/08 7:15am)\nDAVID WRIGHT: [\x85] *one of his top advisors who seemed to suggest that the\nmortgage mess, gas prices crisis all those problems are just in people\'s\nheads, political dynamite.  It\'s not exactly what former Senator Gramm meant\nbut his words have been damaging at a time when McCain is trying to convince\nvoters that he feels their pain.*  McCain had hoped his headline today would\nhave been his message to voters in the rust belt.\n\nJOHN MCCAIN:  America is hurting today, Michigan is hurting today, the\nautomotive industry is hurting.\n\nWRIGHT: Instead he finds himself at odds with one of his top economic\nadvisors.\n\nGRAMM: This is a mental recession.\n\nWRIGHT: Former Senator Phil Gramm, a conservative icon, told the Washington\nTimes he has no sympathy for people complaining about the economy.\n\nGRAMM: We\'ve never been more dominant. We never had more natural advantages\nthan we have today.  We\'ve sort of become a nation of whiners.\n\nWRIGHT: on cable tv:\n\nLOU DOBBS: *Phil Gramm who is clearly out of touch with reality, speaking\nfor John McCain.*\n\nWRIGHT: on late night:\n\nJAY LENO: *It\'s just a mental recession.  $5 a gallon gas and the bank\nkicking you out of your house, that\'s all in your mind!  You\'re just\nimagining that!*\n\nWRIGHT: Gramm\'s remarks set of a firestorm.\n\nBRAD DELONG:  Well I think it reminds people that economic policy is not\nMcCain\'s strength.  It\'s not the central thing that he is running on, it\'s\nnot why he wants to be President.\n[\x85]\n\nOBAMA: When people are out there losing their homes and property values are\ndeclining that\'s not a figment of your imagination.  And it\'s not whining to\nask government to step in and give families some relief.\n\nWRIGHT:  And John McCain sensed a liability, immediately he cut Gramm loose.\n\nMCCAIN: *I think Senator Gramm would be in serious consideration for\nambassador to Belarus, although I\'m not sure the citizens of Minsk would\nwelcome that.*\n[\x85]\n\n*McCain\'s has too Much History with Gramm to Dismiss him so Easily* (CNN\n07/11/08 07:01am)\nDANA BASH: Phil Gramm is not only the chairman of John McCain\'s campaign and\na long time friend, he\'s an economist who McCain has pointed to often as a\nguide for him on economic issues. [\x85] In hard hit Michigan this is the\nMcCain mantra on the economy:\n\nMCCAIN: People are hurting. People are hurting very badly.\n\nBASH: A carefully measured message that is part feel your pain, part\nrealist, but all optimism.\n\nMCCAIN: But they need to have trust and hope and confidence in the future.\n\nBASH: Given that, quotes from Phil Gramm, [\x85] were a big oops.\n\n[Clip of Gramm\'s Comments]\n\nBASH: *McCain couldn\'t distance himself fast enough from his friend.

We\ndon\'t need another one.\n\n[\x85]\n\nBASH: The problem for McCain is that he relies on Gramm, a PhD in economics,\nfor policy advice and as a character witness for voters worried that McCain\ndoesn\'t get the economy.\n\nMCCAIN: The reason why I have the support of people like Jack Kemp and Phil\nGramm is because of their confidence in my proven record of handling the\neconomy.\n\nBASH: I spoke to Phil Gramm by phone yesterday; he said he wanted to clarify\nsome of his comments.  He insisted he didn\'t mean to say Americans were\nwhining about the economy but rather many of the country\'s leaders are.  Here\'s\nwhat he said: "The whiners are the leaders. Hell, the American people are\nvictims, but it didn\'t quite come out that way in the story*." But Gramm did\nsay he stood by another controversial thing he said that we are in a "mental\nrecession". He said he believes a steady drumbeat of bad news is simply\nmaking Americans feel worse about the economy than they should.*\n\nJOHN ROBERTS*: At the same time when he stood by that comment, John McCain\nwas running away from it as fast as he could.*\n\nBASH: Could not get away far enough fast enough.\n[\x85]<https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/vcse302cko>\n\n*Is Phil Graham Crazy?

He obviously has strong economic chops, so is there any, any\ntruth to this notion that we have become a nation of whiners?*\n\nJIM CRAMER: Well, I think we\'re more a nation of winners, more than a nation\nof whiners*. I think that the firm that he works at, his stock, down 60\npercent. You\'ve laid of many thousands of people. Maybe he\'s surrounded by\ngloom, the rest of the country isn\'t.*\n\nVIERA: Well, I watched last night on Hardball and you were animated to say\nthe least. You were ranting actually.

[\x85]\n\nCHRIS CUOMO: But you know that McCain was talking about equipment and bases\nand things that often stay behind in countries.  Do you really believe there\nis that meaningful of a distinction in terms of when they\'ll get out?  Both\nwant to end the war, No?\n\nEDWARDS: I think there is a huge distinction between the two.  Barack Obama\nopposed the war to begin with and has said consistently that he will bring\nthe war to an end.  John McCain has been a very strong supporter of the war\nat every stage. Strong supporter of the surge, and I think is personally\ncommitted to stay there as long as he feels is necessary. [\x85]\n\nCUOMO: Phil Gramm, he came out and said we need to stop being a nation of\nwhiners. [\x85]\n\nEDWARDS: John McCain has been very forthright about the fact that the\nAmerican economy is not his strength.  And he has called Phil Gramm his\neconomic guru.  This is his guy.  And this guy says it\'s not a real\nrecession it\'s a mental recession. [\x85]  *What it means is if John McCain\nwere actually elected President, I don\'t believe he will be, but if he were\nelected President that is the attitude that he projects, and Americans are\nstruggling everyday.*\n\nCUOMO: But John McCain stepped away from him, turned and said he shouldn\'t\nhave said that, said it was tough times, should you hold him accountable for\nwhat his advisor said?\n\nEDWARDS: [\x85] *John McCain, one of his weaknesses is the American economy and\nhe admits that I think he\'s been very open about that, and Phil Gramm is his\nguy, his economic guru on the American economy.  That\'s what I think changes\nthis situation.* [\x85] I think what makes Phil Gramm\'s statements, which I\nthink are incredibly dismissive of hardworking Americans and the struggle\nthat middle class families are going through, what makes it so important is\nthat *he is John McCain\'s guy in an area where Senator McCain admits he\nisn\'t very strong.*\n\n[\x85]\n<https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/epo08qngok>\nHighlight #3\n*Not Just Any Surrogate, Phil Graham Offers Insight Into McCain\'s Ideology\nand Thinking* (MSNBC , 07/11/08, 7:20am)\nJOE SCARBOROUGH: Talk about, let\'s talk a little bit about Phil Graham\'s\ncomments. It seems to me that if you\'re a republican, in any year, that\'s\nthe first thing you have to do is prove that you can feel voters\' pain. The\nfact that we are in economic strains, the likes of which we haven\'t seen\nsince probably 1979, makes the situation even worse. How damaging is it for\nthe McCain campaign that their top economic advisor is saying that we\'re a\nnation of whiners and that this is just a mental recession?\n\nJONATHAN ALTER: You know, I don\'t think it\'s that damaging, Joe. Because\nthere\'s a flap a day nowadays. You know, it used to be that one of these\nthings would come a long every few weeks in a campaign and there\'d be a\nfeeding frenzy about it. But now you have a surrogate sticking its foot in\ntheir mouth and chewing practically every day on one side or the other. So I\ndon\'t think any one of these is necessarily crippling politically. *But what\nit does do is give you a little bit of a window into the ideology and the\nthinking on the McCain side. Phil Graham is not just any old surrogate. This\nis a guy who John McCain favored him for president in 1996. I remember, I\nwas down in your state in Florida for a straw poll in 1996, republican straw\npoll, and McCain was there passing out literature for Phil Graham for\npresident. I said, why do you want this guy as president? And he talked\nabout what great insight Graham had into the economy and how he was the best\nsteward for our economy and how he liked him personally and the rest of it.\nAnd all the years since then, John McCain who\'s not terribly interested in\neconomic policy, has relied heavily on Phil Graham and on his wife Wendy,\nwhen it came to economic issues. So this is an important insight into\nMcCain.* I don\'t think it\'s a particularly damaging thing in terms of his\ncampaign.\n\nANDREA MITCHELL: But are you at all surprised, Jonathan, at how quickly\nMcCain just tossed him overboard? As you point out, this relationship goes\nall the way back to 1982, to the Graham/Rudman Act. Landmark legislation to\nrestrain federal spending, which was the mantra for McCain.\n\nALTER: Yeah, the kind of clich\xe9 of the year is throw them under the bus. And\nwe\'re now into an interesting competition in politics, the speed at which\nyou can throw somebody under the bus. *And I think McCain might have set a\nnew indoor record on that score yesterday. It took him about 5 seconds. He\nhad to do that*. What Phil Graham said was kind of beyond the pale, in the\ncurrent context, with a lot of people hurting. I think he made it worse by\ncalling people a bunch of whiners. That never helps. So McCain had to act\nquickly. [\x85Everyone talks over each other]\n\n[\x85]\n\nALTER: But the thing to remember about this is, that whenever somebody does\nget thrown under the bus, it\'s really just being thrown under the bus for\nthe cameras. You know, you don\'t really have a sense of whether the person\nis really disassociated themselves from this surrogate who\'s caused them\nproblems. A lot of times these candidates continue to talk privately to the\npeople who they just had executed.\n\nMITCHELL: *It\'s called the Mark Penn effect. They\'re on the telephone even\nif they\'ve been fired publicly.*\n\nALTER: Yeah, that\'s a great example. Great example.\n\nMIKE BARNACLE: [\x85] But right out there, in the middle of this country, most\npeople aren\'t paying attention to Phil Graham, they don\'t know who Phil\nGraham is, they don\'t know really that he\'s speaking on behalf of John\nMcCain, or thinking he is. But what they do know is, that they\'re very\nanxious about the economy around them. They\'re anxious about the value of\ntheir house. They\'re anxious about their children\'s economic futures. Do you\nget the sense that this, with Graham saying what he said, that the whole\neconomic conundrum that we face today, the economic issues that confront the\naverage American family today, it might be such a steep hill for John McCain\nto climb that issues like Iraq, and issues like Iran, might be so far off\nthe table that the economy is enough to just spin the whole thing for Obama?\n\nALTER: It\'s very possible that it will play out that way. You know, that\'s\nwhat happened in 1980 when Jimmy Carter was president. Ronald Reagan was the\nchallenger. It looked like it was a very close race, even after Labor Day.\nAnd yet, the economy was in such bad shape that Reagan just romped. And so,\nyou could see that happen this time. But you do also have to understand\nthat, you know, McCain is hanging in there. And even as these numbers for\nhim, in terms of who\'s better to handle the economy go south and the\ndemocrats pick up strength, there\'s a new poll out this morning indicating\nthat, despite that he\'s still in that 5 point range with Obama. So, I think\nwe have to be careful with getting too far ahead of ourselves on how the\neconomy could necessarily tilt the outcome.\n<https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/qfyoav3ksw>\n*McCain\'s Surrogate Problem* (CBS, 07/11/08, 7:06am)\nHARRY SMITH: If you\'re John McCain, and you bring somebody into your fold,\nlike a Phil Graham, serious heavyweight, longtime service in the Senate,\nsupposedly on the money in terms of the economy, he says stuff like this,\nhow does that rub up against your campaign?\n\nJEFF GREENFIELD: Well, ok, you\'re in the suburb of Detroit, an area with 10\npercent unemployment. You\'re trying to show that even though you are a\nrepublican, but you\'re not a conventional stereotype republican, you feel\nthe pain, to coin a phrase of the workers. And your top economic adviser is\ncalling the country a nation of whiners, saying it\'s all in your head. Phil\nGraham is a longtime free market de-regulator guy. And that\'s not the\nmessage McCain is trying to communicate. It steps on a message on the very\nweek when McCain is out there trying to say on the economy, I\'m with the\nregular, ordinary hurting folk. Not helpful.\n\nHARRY SMITH: It\'s interesting, cause we are in a summer of surrogates, and\none of\nMcCain\'s other surrogates, Carly Fiorina, who of course was the CEO of\nHewlett Packard and is another one of his important economic advisors, has\nbeen shooting from the lip and you know, sort of running off the cuff. And\nthere was this whole controversy about what she had to say about whether or\nnot insurance companies would pay. Let\'s play a sound bite [\x85]\n\n[McCain Viagra clip shown]\n\nGREENFIELD: See Harry, here\'s why I\'m the Chief Political Analyst, or\nwhatever you call me. *If you\'re the oldest candidate ever to run for\npresident, the late night comedians are hammering one thing about you.\nYou\'re old, you\'re out of touch. That\'s not how you want to be seen on\ntelevision.* It may be unfair. The other thing about this is, he\'s trying to\nappeal to women. He\'s going out, talking to women today. The idea that women\nmay want birth control paid for by health insurance, that\'s also something\nthat some of the republican base, especially if it\'s unmarried women, are\nnot at all happy about. *It again, is not a message you want to communicate\ngiven the fact that you\'re being looked at through a, perhaps, unfair prism\nof the oldest candidate ever.*\n<https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/hd5twwd0cw>\n\n*McCain\'s Advisors Leave Him In Awkward Situation* (ABC, 7/11/08, 6:32am)\nMATT BROCK: [\x85] you could call it a gaffe, a candidate simply unprepared.

And suggested the nation faces a mental\nrecession instead of a real one.  You know who jumped on that:\n\n[Clip of Obama]\n\nMCCAIN: America is in great difficulty.  We are experiencing enormous\neconomic challenges, as well as others.  Phil Gramm does not speak for me, I\nspeak for me. So I strongly disagree.\n\nBROCK: The problem for McCain here is that he\'s been trying to shore up his\ncredentials on economic issues.  He\'s admitted in the past it\'s not his\nstrong suit.\n\nHighlight #4\n*McCain\'s Rough Week* (MSNBC, 07/11/08, 7:04am)\nJOE SCARBOROUGH: *John McCain\'s not really had a good week.

Ronald Reagan didn\'t like you. And now we move\non to Phil Graham, which is probably the biggest problem he\'s faced this\nweek.*\n\nWILLY GEIST: He did not get any help from Phil Graham, the former republican\nsenator from Texas.

So we know he\nwas born in 1936. We know that he was born in Panama.  We know there is\nsomething called the 14th Amendment that says you have to be a natural born\ncitizen to be President of the United States.  And now a professor in\nMcCain\'s own state, at the University of Arizona, says not so fast.\n\nCLAYTON MORRIS: Yea because McCain was born in 1936, well not until 1937 did\nthey pass a law to change that said people born in that zone can be natural\nborn citizens.  But it doesn\'t really matter, in April Senate approved a\nnon-binding resolution that said John McCain is eligible to be President.  This\nlaw was never intended to disallow people who are military children to not\nbe able to be president.  Technically this guy is right, but again Senate\nalready approved that John McCain can be President of the United States.\nSCOTT DOOCY: [\x85] This professor out there at the University of Arizona,\nGabriel Chen,  said that because he was born in 36 and because the law\npassed in 37.

I cast thousands of\nvotes* in the senate, but I will respond to you, it\'s a \x96\n\nREPORTER: Delicate issue.\n\nMCCAIN: It\'s a something that I have not thought much about.  And I did hear\nabout her response but I hadn\'t thought much about it.  I will get back to\nyou today on it.  I don\'t usually duck an issue but I will try to get back\nto you.\n\n[End of Clip]\n\nHARRIS: That\'s just rough.  That\'s just a rough moment.\n\nLocal Highlight #1\n*Local Minnesota News Interviews McCain, Takes Questions From Viewers* (ST.\nPaul, MN-ABC 5-KSTP, 07/10/08, 10:13pm)\n[\x85]\n\nCHRIS O\'CONNELL: My questions are going to come from our viewers.\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: Oh I gotchya.\n\nQUESTIONER 1: Senator McCain, I want to ask you, what are you going to do\nabout the high gas prices?\n\nMCCAIN: In the long term, though, we got to have nuclear, wind, solar, tied\nwith a car battery that will take you a hundred miles or more.\n\nQUESTIONER 2:  Senator McCain, what\'s your plan on getting us out of debt?\n\nMCCAIN: It isn\'t that revenues have been the problem, it\'s spending that\'s\ngotten completely out of control. I\'ll veto every single pork barrel bill\nthat comes across my desk. I\'ll make them famous and you\'ll know their\nnames.\n\nQUESTIONER 3: Senator McCain, I\'d like to know about health care reform,\nwhat your plans are for covering everyone?\n\nMCCAIN: I want to give every family in America a $5,000 dollar refundable\ntax credit, so they can go across state lines and get the health insurance\nof their choice.\n\nQUESTIONER 4: My question would be, what is his fix for immigration?\n\nMCCAIN: We have to secure our borders, then we have to have tamper proof\nbiometric documents for temporary workers who are truly temporary. Then we\nhave to address the issue of the 12 million people who are here illegally.\n\nQUESTIONER 5: I want to know who will be your vice president and when are\nyou going to tell us?\n\nMCCAIN: We haven\'t been naming names and we\'ve been going through the\nprocess. If we name a name then I guarantee you that the party\'s would have\nto have their home number changed. But the fact is we\'re not naming\nanybody\'s name but we\'ll try to get it done as soon as possible before we\ncome to the Twin Cities for our convention.\n\nO\'CONNELL: Now McCain also said he knows he\'s behind in the polls here in\nMinnesota and that\'s one of the reasons for his trip here.
