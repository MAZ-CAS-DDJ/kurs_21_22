john.podesta@gmail.comb"Karen Luken (who runs CCI's waste management work) reached out to ask if she and we could expand waste management work beyond C40 cities. We had a call today. She said half of the C40 cities don't really need our help; and that on the other hand, she has turned down three non-C40 locations that asked for help over the last 7 months (Senegal, Maldives, one other). She says the less wealthy cities in developing world have major problems that may actually be easier to begin remedying than the big/wealthy C40 cities. I said it all would depend on what budget for this kind of program would be, what the expected deliverables would be over 12 and 24 months, and whether of course this is being requested by governments. She's going to put a budget and deliverables, for us to review. \r\n\r\nFollowing some discussions we established a couple months ago, she also said she's being asked by CGI to help CGI members with their waste management issues, and she said she'd like to help but has no bandwidth. I suggested she put together a similar outline of what could be achieved (based on what is being requested by CGI members), and what that would cost in terms of staff time, etc. She said she'll do so. \r\n\r\nGiven the importance attached to waste management by WJC, and the progress that does seem possible - and the scarcity of other folks working in this space - this feels like something worth serious consideration. \r\n\r\nI look forward to your feedback. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAmi"
