As some of you are aware, I have been battling a form of cancer called cholangiocarcinoma. (I was diagnosed over a year ago and I still can't pronounce it!)\n\n\n\nAlthough I have been compelled to learn a great deal about cancer, and the research keeps getting better, it does not appear that a cure can happen in my timeframe.  According to my medical team, the cancer is progressing, and time is not my friend. I regret having to share this news in this way, but there is probably no better way and I wanted an opportunity to reach all of you.\n\n\n\nAmong the many things I'd like to convey is the great sense of pride and fulfillment that I feel in the Albright Stonebridge Group, an amazing enterprise in which you all have had some part. Our goal was to build a global institution that would endure long beyond the careers of any of the founders: a world-class firm built on a foundation of the very best professionals providing truly valuable service to the clients with whom we had the privilege to partner. Although the work is never complete, the foundation has been well laid with a deep bench of talent and a solid leadership team. I have no doubt that ASG's greatest days are still to come.\n\n\n\nMore broadly, I am very proud of my work and the remarkable opportunity to have served our country in the Clinton Administration and to have led so many foreign policy projects, boards, and organizations and remain grateful to the friends and colleagues I have been privileged to meet along the way.\n\n\n\nThroughout my career, from my early days as a Hill staffer and campaign speechwriter, at the State Department, at Hogan & Hartson, and my years of service as National Security Advisor, I have been honored and blessed with incredible colleagues for whom I have enormous respect.\n\n\n\nThe clients I have worked with at ASG often are more than clients; we become colleagues, partners, and friends. I deeply value these relationships and am grateful for the trust that you placed in me and in the firm.\n\n\n\nIf you would like to be in touch with me, please feel free to do so or reach out to my ASG partner Dan Rosenthal at drosenthal@albrightstonebridge.com<mailto:drosenthal@albrightstonebridge.com> or my close friend and former colleague Tara Sonenshine at tsonenshine@earthlink.net<mailto:tsonenshine@earthlink.net>\n\n\n\nWith warmest regards\n\n\n\nSandy\n\n\nFariba Yassaee | Vice President\nAlbright Stonebridge Group LLC<http://www.albrightstonebridge.com/>\n601 13th Street, NW | 10th floor |Washington, DC  20005\nT +1.202.759-5100 | D +1.202.759.5156 | Skype: fariba.yassaee\nfyassaee@albrightstonebridge.com<mailto:fyassaee@albrightstonebridge.com>\n\n"
