The President\x92s job approval  numbers have drifted below 50%.  \nThe  popularity of some of his signature initiatives has dropped.  Last week, \nDemocratic Congressman Parker  Griffith of Alabama announced he was \nswitching parties \x96  presumably in order to enhance his odds of political survival \nnext  fall. \nThese events have given rise to calls that the Democratic agenda needs to  \nbecome more \x93moderate\x94 or \x93centrist\x94 and that this would somehow be more  \nattractive to Independent voters.   \nNothing could be further from the truth.   \n\x93Moderating\x94 our goals is not a recipe for  victory.  It is a recipe for  \nfailure.  Last fall, voters  overwhelming voted for change, and they knew \nthen \x96 and still know now \x96 the  kind of change they wanted.   \nThey wanted to end the stranglehold of the private insurance companies  \nthat continues to put every American a single illness \x96 or one layoff \x96 away  \nfrom financial catastrophe. They want to take bold, clear action to assure \nthat  America is in the forefront of  creating the clean energy jobs of the \nfuture \x96 and leave a thriving healthy  planet to our children. They wanted to \nfundamentally change the  bull-in-the-china shop foreign policy of the Bush \nyears and re-establish  American leadership in the world.  Most \nimportantly, they rejected the failed economic policies that allowed  the recklessness \nof huge Wall Street banks to plunge the economy into free  fall\x97and cost \nmillions their livelihoods.  They desperately want leadership that will lay the \nfoundation for long  term, bottom-up, widely shared prosperity.  \nIn other words they wanted\x85 and  still want\x85 fundamental change. \nNo one should be surprised that fundamental change does not come  easily.   \nThe massive array of  forces with vested interests in the status quo will \nbite, kick, poke out eyes,  lie, threaten, bully and do pretty much \neverything else within their power to  stop fundamental change.  Frederick  Douglass \nwas right: \x93Power surrenders nothing without a struggle, it never has,  it \nnever will.\x94 \nThat means we might not win everything we want every time we enter the  \narena of battle.  But to be successful in next fall\x92s  elections and increase \nour odds of long-term victory we must do four  things: \n1). Democrats need to demonstrate  to the voters that we are fighting tooth \nand nail for the goals they  support.   This is  critically important to \nkeep the base of the Party engaged and energized.  But it is also important to \ncontinually  remind swing voters that we have not forgotten our mandate for \nchange.   \nRemember that there are only two groups who decide elections: swing,  \npersuadable voters; and mobilizable voters who would support our candidates, but  \nhave to be motivated to go to the polls.   \nIn the 2008 elections, the Obama campaign, and Democrats in general,  \ndemonstrated that we can and must address both.  And in off-year elections, both \nare just  as important.  In 1994, the  Democratic loss of the House not only \ninvolved disillusionment among swing  voters.  It was particularly driven  \nby depressed Democratic turnout.  And it turns out that neither the \nmotivation of mobilizable voters, nor  the support of persuadables are generally \nenhanced by a more \x93moderate\x94 approach  to our policy agenda or how we talk \nabout it.  That is particularly true  today. \nBoth base and  swing voters need to be convinced that however successful we \nare in each given  legislative or political engagement, that we are \nfundamentally on their side,  and that we are willing to take on the forces of the \nstatus quo without  complaint or reservation.  \nI do not personally believe, as some Progressives do, that we would be in  \na better position to get a strong public option as part of this round of \nhealth  care reform had President Obama been a more ardent advocate.  (I do, by \nthe way, think that a public  option \x96 which continues to have overwhelming \npublic support \x96 will be approved  before many of the provisions of the \nhealth care reform bill go into  effect.)  But I do believe that  President \nObama would have stronger political support among base and independent  voters \nhad he been a more forceful public option advocate.   People want to see \ntheir leaders  fighting for the things they support, even if in the end they \nare not entirely  successful. \n2). Democrats need to  deliver. When you\x92re in power, fighting is not \nenough.  The President and Democratic Congress  have to deliver concrete \nmeasurable results.  That is what the voters think they hire  leaders to do.  Voters \nnot only want  leaders who are on their side.  They  also want strong, \neffective leaders who can turn goals in to reality.   \nEven if it\x92s not perfect, we need to deliver on fundamental health care  \nreform.  Even if it\x92s not everything  we want, we need to make significant \nprogress on clean energy jobs and global  warming.  Recent immigrants \x96 and  \nespecially Latino voters \x96 expect us to deliver on comprehensive immigration  \nreform.  And of course, all  Americans demand that we deliver on economic \nchange.   \nThat last point requires two  things.  On the one hand, we have to  turn \nthe economy around in the short  term and start creating measurable increases \nin jobs.  By next November, the economic future  must look brighter for most \neveryday Americans or we will suffer significant  political losses.  By \nElection Day  people have to see things in their own  personal everyday life \nexperience (not just political rhetoric from  Washington)  that gives them \nhope that in the short run their economic prospects are  improving.  \nTo make that happen we don\x92t need  to \x93moderate\x94 our goals.   God  knows \nwe don\x92t have to be more concerned with the deficit.  Democrats need to use \nevery organ of  political power available to them \x96 in the Executive Branch \nand Congress \x96 to  create jobs.   A jobs bill at least as robust as the one  \nthat passed the House in December should pass the Senate and be signed into \nlaw  ASAP. Every ounce of executive power should be mobilized to convert \navailable  funding from the Economic Recovery Bill \x96 and every other possible \nsource --  into jobs NOW.  November is coming  up on the horizon very fast; \nwe cannot afford to wait.  \nSecond, we must lay the foundation for long-term economic growth by  \ncontinuing to tackle the problems of health care reform, creation of clean  energy \njobs, immigration reform, investment in education at all levels \x96 and  \nespecially taking action to shrink the bloated financial sector that almost sent \n the world into another Great Depression.   It is no time to be \x93moderate\x94 \nin  our approach to Wall Street.   \n3). Not only do we need to  forcefully rein in the power of Wall Street and \nthe Big Banks \x96 we need to frame  the political dialogue in decidedly \npopulist terms.   \nVoters are angry \x96 as they should be.  We can\x92t be talking about financial \n regulatory reform in cold, clinical economic terms.  We need to make the \nissues that brought  our economy to a standstill very personal.  We don\x92t \nneed \x93moderate\x94 language here.  The debate needs to be cast in moral terms \x96 \nin the terms of right and  wrong. That\x92s how the voters see it.  \nThe fact is that a tiny number of people who dominate our financial  sector \nsystematically skimmed off all the fruits of financial growth during the  \nlast decade for themselves.  They  justified literally billions of dollars of \nbonuses, stock options and perks  while the average income of most \nhouseholds shrank.  And then \x96 as if that was not bad enough  \x96 their reckless \npursuit of personal greed created a massive financial house of  cards that \ncollapsed and cost millions of Americans their livelihoods.   \nVoters are furious that after hundreds of billions in taxpayer bailouts  to \nprevent complete financial meltdown, much of this gang is back in business, \n and worse yet, acting as if they somehow deserve to make ten million \ndollar  bonuses \x96 or to get 70 million dollar golden parachutes \x96 while everyday \npeople  trudge through this winter\x92s snow to the unemployment office.   \nWhen \x93moderates\x94 talk about more \x93centrist\x94 positions on financial  \nreform, they mean positions that are more acceptable to the bankers that bundle  \ntogether big financial contributions for Republican and Democrats alike.  \nThat\x92s not what we need to do to  win.  That\x92s what voters find most  \nrepulsive about politics.   \nVoters want the proverbial money  changers thrown out of the temple of \ngovernment.  They don\x92t want Democrats to be more  milquetoast and \x93sensible.\x94 \nThey want something done to right this extraordinary  wrong and to create a \nsociety and economy that once again allows everyone to  succeed together, \nand rewards hard  work \x96 not sharp speculators whose chief skills involve \nmaking themselves  rich at the expense of the working people who actually create \nthe wealth that  they squander on $5,000 blouses, $50 million dollar \nestates, and trips to the  South of France. \nIf you want to get people in rural and small-town America fired up for  \nDemocrats, it won\x92t be by sounding more \x93moderate\x94 or tepid in our goals or in \n the way we talk.  It won\x92t be by  cozying up to banks and health insurance \ncompanies.  It will be by focusing their legitimate  anger where it \nbelongs: on the Big  Wall Street Banks.    If it\x92s not focused there,  it will be \nfocused on those who are in charge of government: Democrats.  \nThe recipe for victory for  Democrats in November does not involve more \x93\nmoderation,\x94 it involves more  populism.  But holding Big Wall  Street Bankers \naccountable is not enough. \n4). We must continue to  forcefully and proudly stand up for progressive \nvalues.  And we must, in particular, contrast  those values to the values of \ngreed and division that lead us down the path to  economic failure only a \nyear ago.   \nTo win, we must continue to define the value frame.  We must continue to \nassert that we\x92re  all in this together, not all in this alone.  We must \ncontinue to hold up the vision of  a society built on principles of unity not \ndivision, hope not fear, equality not  subjugation. We must re-commit to the \npremise that if each of us is better  educated all of us will be wiser, that \nit is not true that in order for me to be  richer you have to be poorer \x96 but \nrather that if each of us is more prosperous,  all of us will have more \nopportunity-- that our success comes from cooperation  and mutual respect.  \nWe have to continue to stay on the offense because in politics, if you\x92re  \nplaying defense you\x92re losing. If we fall back into old bad habits of \nallowing  our critics on the right \x96 the forces of the status quo \x96 to define the \nterms of  debate, we will lose more than political ground in 2010. We will \nlose an  historic opportunity to create a progressive realignment in \nAmerican politics.  \nRobert Creamer is a long-time  political organizer and strategist, and \nauthor of the recent book: \x93Stand Up  Straight: How Progressives Can Win,\x94 \navailable on _amazon.com_ \n(http://www.amazon.com/Listen-Your-Mother-Straight-Progressives/dp/0979585295/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qi\nd=1206567141&sr=8-1) \n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
