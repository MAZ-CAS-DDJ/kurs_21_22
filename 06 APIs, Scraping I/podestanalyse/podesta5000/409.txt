I interviewed Ted Strickland today and he told me that through you he was told Hillary Clinton wanted to be on the Ohio ballot with him. Could you verify that and tell me if it is an indication of her intention to run in 2016? Please advise and thank you. I am on deadline for the morning paper. I left you a voicemail at your Georgetown office as well. Thank you.\n\nLynn Hulsey\nReporter\nDayton Daily News\n1611 S. Main St.\nDayton, OH 45409\n(937) 225-7455\nLynn.Hulsey@coxinc.com\n\n\n\n"
