You have to be an optimist to do this kind of work.\n\nOf course there are good days and bad days, and yes, even  good years\nand bad years.\n\nFour years ago today was one of the best days ever.  The House of\nRepresentatives passed a  comprehensive clean energy and climate bill,\nauthored by Henry Waxman and Ed  Markey, by a margin of 219-212.  That\nbill, while not perfect, would have cut carbon pollution by 80 per\ncent by  2050.\n\nThen, as most of you know, the next 18 months were almost  all\ndownhill.  Scott Brown was elected  Senator in MA in January 2010. By\nJuly 2010, Senator Reid announced that he  would not take up a climate\nbill. In November 2010 many of our friends lost  their seats in the\ndebacle of the election.\n\nWe learned many valuable lessons and just kept fighting  back. With\nyour partnership, we helped elect and re-elect many climate  champions\nat the state and national level in November 2012.\n\nWell, elections have consequences.\n\nYesterday was one of the most important days EVER in the  fight\nagainst climate change.  Hopefully you  have had a chance to see the\npowerful speech that President Obama gave, laying  out the most\ncomprehensive and ambitious administrative plan ever to cut  climate\nchange pollution.\n\nI was privileged, because of my association with LCV, to  sit with our\nBoard chair Scott Nathan in the front row of the audience for that\nspeech. We also had a few moments beforehand to offer the President\nour support  going forward.  Scott and I then got on a  plane to\nBoston to celebrate the fantastic special election victory by Ed\nMarkey, our great climate champion, to become the next Senator from\nMassachusetts.\n\nYes, it is days like yesterday that remind us why we do  this\ncritically important work.\n\nYesterday launched the next phase of our ongoing campaign  to cut\nclimate change pollution, and we have an ambitious plan to get the job\ndone.\n\nThank you, and congratulations for being a part of this  work. We\ncould not have come this far without your very generous guidance and\nsupport.  I look forward to more great  days in the future.\n\nFondly,\n\nGene Karpinski\n\n\n\nUpdate Your Profile\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=ibwpBrFekfpWDBTBpQ9ncA\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=za_jTWIvFwJMSwBRx1NsnIyZz08BIRdx&cid=0\n\n1920 L Street, NW Suite 800\nWashington, DC 20036\n202-785-8683\n\n"
