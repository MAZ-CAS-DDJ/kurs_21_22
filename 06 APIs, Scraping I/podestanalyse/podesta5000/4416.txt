Barack Obama and the anti-choice\nSen. John McCain and is a top issue for moving pro-choice Republican and\nIndependent women to support Obama. When this critical bloc of swing\nvoters hears just how anti-choice McCain is and his belief that Roe v.\nWade should be overturned, they leave him in significant numbers.\nAdditionally, the poll shows that choice helps Obama shore up the\nDemocratic women voters that some thought would not support him\nfollowing Sen. Hillary Clinton\'s suspension of her campaign.\n\n \n\nGreenberg Quinlan Rosner Research conducted the poll, which included an\noversample of pro-choice Republican and Independent women from 12\npresidential battleground states:  Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan,\nMissouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania,\nVirginia, and Wisconsin.\n\n \n\n"The data shows that choice is an important issue that can move key\nvoting blocs of pro-choice Republican and Independent women who can play\nan important role in building Obama\'s winning coalition," said Al\nQuinlan, president of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research. "Because NARAL\nPro-Choice America communicates extensively with this unique swing\nconstituency, NARAL\'s efforts in 2008 can help Barack Obama win what may\nbe a close election."\n\n \n\nGreenberg Quinlan Rosner Research\'s poll shows that once pro-choice\nRepublican and Independent women hear a balanced description of the\ncandidates\' respective positions on choice, Obama gains ground:\n\n \n\n*         Obama gains 13 points among pro-choice Independent women (who\nmake up nine percent of this electorate) and nine points among\npro-choice Republican women (who account for five percent of this\nelectorate), when they hear McCain\'s anti-choice record.  \n\n*         When these groups are combined, this movement equates to a\ngain of 1.6 points overall in the general election race against McCain. \n\n \n\nChoice is the top issue for moving these key audiences to Obama,\ntrumping other traditional Democratic issues and attacks on McCain.\nAmong key voting blocs of pro-choice Independent and Republican women,\nMcCain\'s anti-choice record concerns them more than attacks on his\neconomic plan and his position on the war in Iraq. \n\n \n\n*         Among pro-choice Independent women, 83 percent said that\nMcCain\'s opposition to abortion for many women - even in cases of rape,\nincest or when a woman\'s life is in danger - causes serious doubts about\nMcCain. \n\n*         For these same voters, 79 percent say that McCain\'s votes\nagainst birth control access raises serious doubts in their minds about\nMcCain.\n\n*         Among pro-choice Republican women, 71 percent said that\nMcCain\'s opposition to abortion for many women - even in cases of rape,\nincest or when a woman\'s life is in danger - causes serious doubts about\nMcCain. \n\n*         For these same voters, 61 percent say that McCain\'s votes\nagainst birth control access raises serious doubts in their minds about\nMcCain.\n\n \n\nFinally, the polling shows that choice can help Obama gain more ground\namong women voters considered to be Hillary Clinton strongholds:\nnon-college educated women, older women, and suburban women.\n\n \n\n*         Among non-college women, Obama\'s margin over McCain grows by\n12 points between the initial vote and the vote after their choice\npositions are known.\n\n*         Among older women, Obama\'s margin over McCain grows by 11\npoints between the initial vote and the vote after their choice\npositions are known.\n\n*         Among suburban women, Obama\'s margin over McCain grows by nine\npoints between the initial vote and the vote after their choice\npositions are known.\n\n*         Among Democratic women generally, Obama\'s margin over McCain\ngrows by 12 points between the initial vote and the vote after their\nchoice positions are known.\n\n \n\n"This poll confirms what we\'ve known for a long time now," said Nancy\nKeenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. "NARAL Pro-Choice America\nis uniquely positioned to help pro-choice candidates win elections from\nthe White House to the state house. We will be working tirelessly over\nthe next five months to ensure NARAL Pro-Choice America\'s endorsed\ncandidate, Sen. Obama, becomes president-elect Obama on November 4,\n2008."\n\n \n\nGreenberg Quinlan Rosner Research conducted this poll for NARAL\nPro-Choice America between May 29 and June 8, 2008 in 12 battleground\nstates. This survey of 1,788 likely November voters (1,000\nrepresentative likely voters plus oversamples of 424 likely-voting\nRepublican women and 364 likely-voting Independent women) is subject to\na margin of error of +/- 3.1 percentage points.\n\n \n\nLink to Summary: \n\nPlease go to \nhttp://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/files/naralpollmemo061608.pdf for\na summary of the polls findings and \nhttp://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/files/naralpollslides061608.pdf\nto access additional information in the complete poll presentation.\n\n \n\nContact: Kathryn Prael, 202-973-3032\n\n###\n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
