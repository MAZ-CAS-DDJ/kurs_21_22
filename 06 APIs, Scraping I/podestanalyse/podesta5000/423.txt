Given that all major decisions about CGI were made at last week\'s CGI board meeting, I believe the only outstanding CGI issue for next week\'s meeting with WJC is 2012 compensation.  How would you like to handle my physical absence?\nShould I call into the meeting?\n\nShould I make sure that I am available in case you need to reach me?\nShould Ed or Lisa participate or be available to participate in my absence, if necessary?  (Lisa and Ed know compensation recommendations below the Director level.  I am the only one who knows Director level recommendations.)\n\nThanks for your advice,\n\nBob\n\n--\nRobert S.
