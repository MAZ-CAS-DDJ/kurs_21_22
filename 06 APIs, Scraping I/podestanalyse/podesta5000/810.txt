Things \nlike promoting job growth and increasing wages. Making \nmeaningful reforms to our criminal justice system. Finding ways \nto keep Americans safe at home and abroad. We have a lot of \nimportant work still ahead of us, John, and I want to make \nsure that when my time in office is over, my successor has a \nCongress who will work with them to build on all we've \naccomplished so far: \n\nhttps://my.democrats.org/December-Deadline\n\nI plan on doing everything I can with every minute of every day \nthat I have left as President to deliver on behalf of the American \npeople and supporters like you who have stood by me since day \none. That clock really starts ticking when we get back to work in \nJanuary, and if you're with me, I hope you'll be one of the 32 \nsupporters we need to step up in Washington by the end of the year.\n\nSo, John, can I count on you to step up before Thursday \nnight's deadline?\n\nhttps://my.democrats.org/December-Deadline\n\nThanks as always for being part of this, and happy New Year! \n\nBarack Obama\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**************************************************************\nPaid for by the Democratic National Committee, http://www.democrats.org, 430 South Capitol Street SE, Washington DC 20003 and not authorized by any candidate or candidate\xe2\x80\x99s committee.
