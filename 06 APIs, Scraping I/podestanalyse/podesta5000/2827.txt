john.podesta@gmail.comb'someone follows up with\n"Are you for reinstating glass steagall or not?"\n\nGene\'s artful version still gets us to no.\n\nI am saying she says some version of I will fix the problem w out it. But\nif it makes sense to do bc of issues that arise - e g too much complexity\nto manage - then she will do it. She\'s not saying she will do it now. She\'s\nnot saying it was responsible for the crisis. But she will reinstate if\nfuture need arises.\n\nI guess I worry about everyone else up on the stage saying reinstate glass\nsteagall and not giving her more.\n\nI recognize I\'m in a different place than others. You may not want to go\nthis far, but given her anxiety on Glass Steagall I did want to offer up an\nalternative.\nOn Fri, Sep 11, 2015 at 6:00 PM Gary Gensler <ggensler@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n> I think Gene is onto a possible path forward - buying into the values of\n> Glass Steagall - while not the actual specifics for our times.
