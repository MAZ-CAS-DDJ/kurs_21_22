john.podesta@gmail.comb"John --\n\nI want you to be there with me on Election Night when the results come in. \n\nWe're planning a big event that will include tens of thousands of supporters in Grant Park in downtown Chicago.\n\nWe're saving some of the best seats in the house for 5 people who make their first donation to the campaign before Sunday at midnight.\n\nIf you're selected, you can bring a guest, and we'll fly you in and put you up in a hotel for the night. You'll go backstage at the big event and -- no matter what happens -- you'll have a front row seat to history as we celebrate the supporters who got us over the finish line.\n\nAny donation counts -- whatever you can afford. Show your support at this crucial time with a donation of $5 or more, and you could join me on Election Night:\n\nhttps://donate.barackobama.com/backstage2\n\nThis movement for change has been a testament to the power of ordinary Americans coming together to achieve extraordinary things.\n\nI look forward to having you there on Election Night.\n\nThank you,\n\nBarack\n\n\nPlease donate: https://donate.barackobama.com/backstage2\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Obama for America\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscribe\n\n"
