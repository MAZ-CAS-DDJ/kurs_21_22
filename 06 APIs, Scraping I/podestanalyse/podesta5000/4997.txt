There is big signage that says\nmedia row/democratic debate. There's a stoplight in the middle of the\nroad-- you pull in-- you will see a security guard at the gate who will\nstop your car and knows to expect you. Dave will meet you there (you can\ncall him when you're on the way).\n\n*Driver: *Joe from Alpine Limousine-- (702) 358-5062. Joe has all the above\ndirections as well.\n\nP.S. the dispatcher I spoke to at Alpine Limousine says he loved watching\nHillary last night, she's getting his vote, and he's going to help GOTV\nwhen the time comes!!!\n\n-- \nMilia Fisher\nSpecial Assistant to the Chair\nHillary for America\nmfisher@hillaryclinton.com\nc: 858.395.1741\n"
