He's trying to get some recent statistics, talking points, etc.  Is there someone at CAP that could be a good resource for him?  If so, would you be able to connect me with him/her, and I'll loop in Haim's office?\n\nThank you!!\n\nDennis\n\nDennis Cheng\nDirector of Development & Philanthropy\nWilliam J.
