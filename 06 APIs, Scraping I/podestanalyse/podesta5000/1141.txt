Clinton Talks With Black Publishers\n\nIn her run for president, Senator Hillary Clinton visited Bennettsville Middle School Tuesday, November 27th for a campaign stop to discuss her plans to cut the minority dropout rate in half.  Afterward, Senator Clinton took the time to meet with African American news paper Publishers from across the state of South Carolina about some or the issues important to the Black Community.  \n \nThe publishers present were: Mr. Larry D. Smith, Co-publisher of The Community Times and The Times Upstate Newspapers, Mr. Nathaniel Abraham, publisher of Carolina Panorama Newspaper, and Mr. Mel Hart, publisher of Columbia Black News.\n \nAmong the many issues being discussed, Mr. Abraham asked if elected "would [she] support a 25% raise in benefits for disabled veterans?"  Senator Clinton stated that she "would do everything [she] could to have the most positive agenda on veterans." \n Senator Clinton added, "I\'m tired of seeing [lack of] the amount of time, effort, and heartbreak that goes into trying to give people what they deserve to have, and our disabled veterans deserve to have more than what they are being given [currently]."  Senator Clinton also wants the Federal Government to "fully fund the VA, and help to clear up the backlog, get rid of the waiting lists, and problems peoples are having filing for disability and other claims."\n \nOne of the biggest issues among this year\'s Presidential campaign has been Foreign Relations. Mr. Smith asked Senator Clinton about her position on "the ability to talk to foreign leaders who are not high on the priority list at this particular point."  Senator Clinton compassionately stated, "I want to have a very thorough comprehensive diplomatic effort.  Let\'s talk to everybody!"  Senator Clinton went on to say, "But I don\'t think that the president is the person who should always do the talking... everyone in the world would love to have a meeting with the president of the United States because it elevated them... I want to get back to diplomacy around the world... and where appropriate, after we\'ve laid the ground work I will be meeting with people."\n \nOther issues discussed were the qualifications Senator Clinton would look for in Supreme Court Justices, where she states, "I would look for people who understood and believed that the constitution has been the most important tool for expanding human and civil rights... some people who have had some life experiences, not just the ones that went to college, went to law school, worked in a big law firm, then worked for the government for a few years, but someone like Sandra Day O\'Connor, who came out of the political process, worked in the State Senate, worked a s a local judge, and has a sense of real people\'s lives... and people who are not going to side with big power, not only big government, but big corporations, which is what this current court is doing." Senator Clinton discussed her plans to "re-establish the civil rights division in the Justice Department, have an Attorney General who is committed to the rule of law, and to start enforcing the laws including civil rights laws, equal opportunity laws, and voting rights laws."\n \nThe most important issue to the African American community around the nation, unfortunately, is capital punishment and the disparities in the criminal justice system. Senator Clinton was asked her position on the matter, "I support capital punishment in limited cases, there are some crimes that are so offensive and heinous that it is appropriate, but only after [it] has been made clear that the rest of our system functions, and right now I believe that we have a broken capital punishment system in America." \nMr. Hart asked, "In many African American communities it is being said that something is wrong with the entire [criminal] system, individuals getting out of jail and going right back in, how do we fix that problem?" Senator Clinton breaks down her solution in long term, medium term, and immediate term. "Long term, we have to have preschool programs, mentoring programs, and things to give young people a solid foundation, if we invest in our kids when they\'re young we will break the revolving door that goes from the streets to the prison and back...Medium term, we need more \'Second Chance\' programs and diversionary programs...Immediate term, we need to look at the disparity of sentencing, and the discriminatory treatment from law enforcement and the judicial systems." \nSenator Clinton sees that it is "primarily young men of color who are being discriminated against more harshly than they should be by the law enforcement system and creating a pool of young men who are so discouraged and think jail-time is inevitable." Senator Clinton\'s solution includes giving first time drug offenders treatment for a chance at a better life instead of going to prison, and putting more education programs back into prisons, "In New York [they] took out college programs, and most states have cut out education programs completely." Senator Clinton passionately believes the United States Federal Government "Can do better."\n           \nSen. Hillary Clinton talks about her plans to rebuild small businesses as we continue this conversation next week.\n* * *\nJET Magazine ...

Barack Obama <http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/08/22/politics/main3193625.shtml> , the first African-American to emerge as a serious contender for a major party presidential nomination. \n\nA series of CBS News polls show the New York senator has a 15-point lead over Obama among black women. Other polls have confirmed Clinton\'s popularity with African-American women. \n\nOverwhelmingly, the most frequently stated reasons women give for favoring Hillary Clinton are that they have positive feelings about her husband and his administration and they think she\'s got the best shot of any of the Democrats to win against the Republicans. \n\n"Most Black women simply believe Clinton can win," said former Gore campaign manager and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile. "They loved her husband Bill and would like to see \'a woman elected first\'" \n\nObama hopes to find the antidote to Clinton\'s less-than-secret weapon - husband Bill - with a boost from talk-show queen Oprah Winfrey, who is campaigning for Obama <http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/26/politics/main3539533.shtml>  in three early primary states: Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. \n\nBut beating back Bill won\'t be easy. \n\nAs much as African Americans may instinctively roll their eyes in exasperation when they hear Bill Clinton referred to as the "first black president", it is undeniable he made an emotional connection with black America in a way that no other president has. \n\nSheryl McCarthy is a columnist for USA Today and Newsday who often explores issues of politics and race. "Black people have always felt with Bill Clinton that he is sort of one of them, "that he cares about them, that he can relate to them," she said. \n\n"And after he left the White House", McCarthy observed, "He put his office in Harlem <http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/06/23/politics/main625808.shtml> . So black people have a real connection with Bill Clinton and may think there\'s sort of a continuum with Hillary Clinton or similar sensibility with Hillary." \n\nMark Sawyer is director of UCLA\'s Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity and Politics. He pointed out Hillary also enjoys a halo effect from the fact that black Americans felt more confident economically during the 1990\'s. \n\n"Relative to other years, other presidencies, African Americans did very well under the Clinton administration, though there\'s substantial evidence that they perceive themselves to be doing a lot better than they actually were," he said. \n <<Picture (Metafile)>> You want to go with the winner, and if that\'s a woman as opposed to someone black, then you want to go with them. <<Picture (Metafile)>> \nSheryl McCarthy, newspaper columnist\t\n\nHillary Clinton\'s White House years also gave her a forum from which she was able to raise her own visibility. Dr. Suzan Johnson Cook is an influential African American Baptist pastor who served as a member of Bill Clinton\'s Domestic Policy Council and is now active in Hillary\'s presidential campaign. \n\n"I got to know her as the first lady," Johnson Cook said, "and I got to see her work with health reform. She took on some issues, which was very courageous and the first time a first lady really dealt with policy." \n\nThat time in the White House also put Clinton in the public eye as the long-suffering wife of a man with a roving eye. \n\n"It took a lot to hold up under that," Johnson Cook said. "I don\'t know how many women could have done that, but she did, so I give her three thumbs up." \n\nSuccess begets success, and the simple fact that Hillary Clinton is the leader of the Democratic pack in most national polls carries a lot of weight in the minds of black women. \n\n"She looks like she has a much stronger chance of getting the nomination and getting elected than Obama. You want to go with the winner, and if that\'s a woman as opposed to someone black, then you want to go with them," said Newsday columnist McCarthy. \n\nThe Rev. Johnson Cook points out that the kinds of issues Hillary has tackled in her political service also make her especially attractive to black women. \n\n"Many of us are mothers and wives and family women, however you qualify us, and we know the track record of Senator Clinton with children, particularly poor children, and city children. When we look at someone who has a track record of voting that way and representing us and fighting for us and advocating, then she wins on the experience and the track record, hands down, no question, undeniably," she said. \n\nRace weighs heavily on the minds of black women, though not always in ways that have generated support for Obama. \n\nIn a series of interviews in South Carolina, New York Times reporter Katharine Q. Seelye noted that black women often brought up a sense of fear for Barack Obama\'s safety if he was elected, describing it as "an almost maternal concern". \n\n"I don\'t feel the country is ready for an African American," one woman told her, "He would be killed." \n\nUCLA\'s Mark Sawyer calls that fear a kind of "proxy" for how significant voters feel racism is in the American public sphere. "It\'s a way of saying African Americans are concerned that if Barack Obama were to win [the nomination], there\'s just no way he would become president because there are \'forces\' out there - racist forces - including perhaps the white electorate, that would make that impossible." \n\n"People do feel the assassination thing is very real," said Johnson Cook, "They do fear that for him. This is a topic that\'s on everybody\'s plate and around everybody\'s dinner table that I know." \n\nOne point made repeatedly is that if many black women prefer Clinton over Obama, it\'s nothing personal. \n\n"I think we\'re being told that if black women are leaning toward Hillary Clinton that that\'s a negative perception of Barack Obama," Prof. Sawyer said. "African Americans feel extraordinarily positive towards Barack Obama, so choosing to put Hillary forth as the preferred candidate is a strategic voting choice and not necessarily an emotional choice." \n\n"I prefer Obama, but Clinton is stronger," said one black woman almost apologetically while out shopping with her sisters and their children. \n\nShe feels that the current political climate just isn\'t right to test out a black candidacy. "I wouldn\'t want him to go into it as the first black person, because I think he would have a hard time, and he\'s such a nice young man. Believe me, he would get the brunt of everything. Everything is messed up and he would basically have to clean it up - and that\'s a lot for him to handle." \n\nDespite her pessimism towards his campaign this time around, she did express hope for the future, "He is young, he can do it again, he can do it another time," she said. "This is not the time, because it\'s a lot to clean up. Bush really left it in a mess, is my feeling." \n\n <<Picture (Metafile)>> \n\nBeyond Oprah Winfrey\'s very high profile endorsement, it isn\'t difficult to find black women who do have confidence that Obama is ready to take on the establishment, not someday, but now. \n\nLivi, a black woman from Long Beach, California argued that Obama has proven naysayers wrong in the past. "The fact is, people have said...that he wasn\'t electable in terms of the Senate and there have been other races or other things in his life where he was the underdog." \n\n"People say, is this country ready for a black person, an African American, to be president. You know, I think that this time is as good as any." \n\nLivi\'s 32-year-old daughter Maryam agreed. "I actually like Barack more than Hillary. I just don\'t trust Hillary as much as him. There\'s something about her that\'s very political. I think that it\'s nice to have a new face, a new energy, someone who can bring in some change." \n\n"It\'s just like we got behind Clinton," Livi added, referencing not Hillary, but Bill. "He was like the new Camelot the first year he was in office. I think I would have the tendency to get behind Barack for that same reason - that if we want a change, let\'s go ahead and really vote for the change." \n\nSheryl McCarthy concluded that for her, it comes down to a pragmatic choice as opposed to an idealistic one. "I don\'t know that people are happy with the three front runners. I\'m not happy with the three front runners. I\'m very disillusioned with Hillary, I wish John Edwards were doing better, I\'m not quite sure why he isn\'t, and Obama just sort of floats there, like I said, what\'s not to like about him?" \n\nMore and more Democrats in Iowa are telling pollsters that they really do like Obama and now that Clinton\'s lead has dwindled in what is essentially a white state, there\'s still time for voters on the fence to reconsider his electability. \n\n"If he were to do a big surge and come out as a real, real serious contender with Hillary Clinton, sure, I\'d probably switch to him," she said, "but I don\'t think that\'s going to happen."\n\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/12/02/politics/main3562837.shtml\n\n* * *\n\n <<Picture (Metafile)>> \n\'O\' stands for Oprah, Obama and overestimating influence \nOprah Winfrey and Barack Obama are both from the garden of the unexpected that produces so many surprises in American life. Although black people have always been as surprising as the social circumstances allowed, things have changed so much over the past 25 years that, at long last, it is not impossible to imagine a black American President.\nBut in some signal ways Oprah Winfrey is more unexpected than Barack Obama - or Colin Powell, who could have been elected if he had gone out and sought the Republican nomination, taking the seat in which Bob Dole sat when Bill Clinton rolled over him on the way to his second term in the White House. \nPowell was then seen as a war hero and an extremely intelligent military man, and there was no high-profile American man more impressive. Rupert Murdoch was itching to throw the weight of his media empire behind Powell, which would have meant that every single day viewers of Fox News were fated to see electronic love letters sent to the general. \nSuch backing could have changed the minds of those who were opposed to him solely on racial grounds. But now we will never know. \nIn this presidential race, we\'re in for a different experiment. It is quite possible that Oprah Winfrey will turn some big tides for Obama, now that she has declared her intention to campaign for him. But there is plenty of doubt about whether that will be enough to help the Illinois senator win some of the primaries that were assumed to be there for Hillary Clinton\'s taking. \nThere are few who admire Winfrey\'s work more than I do. Oprah Winfrey is, as I have called her before, the American Queen of Goodwill - and a very likable billionaire who has repeatedly shown more concern for those below her than those who travel through the same rarefied financial air that she does. \nIn fact, Winfrey\'s public record is so impressive that if she were seen as a politician, she could have a fighting chance to become the first woman to sit at the desk in the Oval Office. \nBut she is not running, Obama is. And that will make all of the difference: Americans are developing a relationship here with him, not her. Although millions of Americans love and trust Winfrey, the question is whether or not they will always agree with her, or conclude that, in this instance, she has stepped too far outside of her television and philanthropic empires. \nIn the end, I doubt that she will get that many black or female voters to give Clinton the hot-potato routine. Obama\'s campaign should not overestimate her influence. Oprah is persuasive and she is powerful, but it is unlikely she can convince many primary voters that it is worth rejecting Clinton and embracing Obama. \nDemocrats this year seem to have a feeling that Clinton can return the country to the feeling of power and goodwill that Bill Clinton, rhetorically at least, came to represent. \nA few years ago, before anyone actually started to campaign for presidential nominations in 2008, I thought that the most interesting and exciting battle could be fought between Sen. Clinton and Secretary of State Rice. The debates could have been some of the best since those between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas. What doozies those could have been. \nNow we will see just how powerful Winfrey is and how much our celebrity-driven media will trivialize her backing of Obama. \nBeyond that, we will see what the impact of our most popular black American can have on a presidential race and whether, like her talk show, the appeal will reach across ethnic lines. \nCrouch: stanley@gmail.com; Monday, December 3rd 2007, 4:00 AM \n\n* * *\n\n <<Picture (Metafile)>> \nBarack Obama Reveals his Master Plan\nPresidential candidate speaks out on housing, education, and jobs\nby Joyce Jones\nBarack Obama has emerged as a leading candidate for the president of the United States. With a host of influential supporters-including Oprah Winfrey-the Obama campaign is making a huge impact on the political landscape. BLACK ENTERPRISE recently caught up with the Illinois senator to talk about some of the more pressing issues facing African Americans today.\n\nQ. News about the housing industry has been mostly bad these past several months. Do you think it is the federal government\'s responsibility to help homeowners fight and avoid foreclosure? And should lenders be penalized for making enticing loans that were doomed for failure?\n\nA. I introduced comprehensive legislation more than a year ago to fight mortgage fraud and protect consumers against abusive lending practices. My STOP FRAUD Act will provide the first federal definition of mortgage fraud, increase funding for federal and state law enforcement programs, create new criminal penalties for mortgage professionals found guilty of fraud, and require industry insiders to report suspicious activity. The bill also provides counseling to homeowners and tenants to help them avoid foreclosure and gives borrowers additional rights to protect themselves during foreclosure proceedings.\n\nAs president, I will create a Homeowner Obligation Made Explicit (HOME) score, which will allow individuals to easily compare various mortgage products and understand the full cost of the loan. The HOME score would also help borrowers understand their long-term obligations and would be required to include mandatory taxes and insurance.\n\nI will also create a fund to help people refinance their mortgages and avoid foreclosure. The fund will also assist individuals who purchased homes that are simply too expensive for their income levels by helping to sell their homes. The fund will help offset costs of selling a home, including helping low-income borrowers get additional time and support to pay back any losses from the sale of their home and waiving certain federal, state, and local income taxes that result from an individual selling their home to avoid foreclosure. The fund will be partially paid for by increased penalties on lenders who act irresponsibly and commit fraud. \n\nQ. How do you propose to address the deficit in public infrastructure such as the deteriorating condition of public school buildings, bridges, levees, etc?\n\nA. As president, I will make strengthening our transportation systems, including roads and bridges, a top priority; support the development of high-speed rail networks; and work with Congress to modernize the nation\'s air traffic control system. I also believe that we can lead the world in broadband penetration and get true broadband to every American through a combination of reform of the Universal Service Fund, better use of the nation\'s wireless spectrum, promotion of next-generation facilities, technologies, and applications, and new tax and loan incentives.\n\nQ. How would you address discrimination in employment, both the effects of discrimination in getting hired and in access to equal pay.\n\nA. I will start by strengthening the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The Commission has lacked the resources and staff to carry out an initiative designed to attack systemic discrimination and has closed field offices, substituting them with a National Call Center contracted out to nongovernment employees. I will fully fund and increase staffing for the EEOC to reduce these charge backlogs and to prosecute efforts to remedy systemic discrimination, and appoint an EEOC chair and nominate commissioners who are committed to enforcing anti-discrimination laws. \nGovernment needs to take steps to better enforce the Equal Pay Act, fight job discrimination, and improve child care options and family medical leave to give women equal footing in the workplace. I am a co-sponsor of the Fair Pay Act of 2007, which expands upon the protections of the Equal Pay Act by requiring employers to provide equal pay for not only "equal work," but also for jobs that are comparable in skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions. The bill would also prohibit pay discrimination on the basis of race, national origin, or gender. Finally, I have co-sponsored and introduced legislation with Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and others to reverse the Supreme Court\'s decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tires, which made it difficult for minority and women employees to allege employment discriminations.\n\nQ. Many minority entrepreneurs feel that the Small Business Administration has been greatly weakened during the Bush administration. What steps do you believe are necessary to ensure that they get their fair share of federal contracting dollars?\n\nA. Less than 1% of the $250 billion in venture capital dollars invested annually nationwide has been directed to the country\'s 4.4 million minority business owners. I will increase funding for Small Business Administration programs that provide capital to minority-owned businesses, support outreach programs that help minority business owners apply for loans, and work to encourage the growth and capacity of minority firms. I will also support entrepreneurship and spur job growth by creating a national network of public-private business incubators to facilitate the creation of startup companies. They offer help designing business plans, provide physical space, identify and address problems affecting small businesses, and give advice on a wide range of business practices.\n\nhttp://www.blackenterprise.com/cms/exclusivesopen.aspx?id=3854&p=1\n\n* * * \nObama hopes for sane solutions\nBy Derrick Z. Jackson, Globe Columnist  |  December 4, 2007\nBARACK OBAMA talked softly that he would beat off the big stick the Republicans are sure to wield on immigration. "Yes we have to have comprehensive immigration reform, we have to be serious about border security, we have to crack down on employers who are taking advantage of illegal immigrants, and we have to have a pathway to citizenship for the 12 million who are here," the Illinois senator told the Globe\'s editorial board yesterday in its series of endorsement interviews before the New Hampshire primary.\n"But the politics of immigration I don\'t think will change until American workers feel as if somebody is listening to them, looking out for them, fighting for them and their economic concerns . . . If people see that we\'re taking those steps, then it puts them in a more generous mood when it comes to immigrants."\nTo borrow from the title of one of Obama\'s books, he has the audacity to hope for sanity if he becomes the Democratic nominee for president.\nA month ago, front-runner Hillary Clinton came under fire from Obama and the rest of her rivals as well as from conservative talk shows for appearing to vacillate in a debate on a proposal in her New York state to give driver\'s licenses to undocumented immigrants. She went from saying the now-dumped proposal by Governor Eliot Spitzer "makes a lot of sense" to saying "Do I think this is the best thing for any governor to do? No."\nObama was one of the candidates who immediately challenged Clinton\'s position.\n"I was confused on Senator Clinton\'s answer," Obama said. "I can\'t tell whether she was for it or against it. And I do think that is important. One of the things that we have to do in this country is to be honest about the challenges we face. Immigration is a difficult issue. But part of leadership is not just looking backwards and seeing what\'s popular."\nWhen Obama was asked his position on driver\'s licenses, he said, "I think that is the right idea. . . . We can make sure that drivers who are illegal come out of the shadows, that they can be tracked, that they are properly trained, and that will make our roads safer."\nSuch statements, along with supporting a "pathway to citizenship," are red meat for the anti-immigration crowd. Talk-show host Lou Dobbs recently lumped Obama and Clinton together as "locked up in \'60s liberalism" supporting "amnesty" and "open borders."\nObama yesterday said that Dobbs, radio host Rush Limbaugh, and "the machinery of anti-immigration talk has had its impact," forcing him to answer many questions on the issue from Democrats in his campaign stops. But he asserted that the 2006 midterms also showed the issue\'s limits. The Democrats were returned to the majority in the House and Senate as anger over the Iraq war trumped immigration.\n"It is an indicator of the economic anxiety that people are feeling right now," Obama said. "I see anti-immigrant sentiment as growing out of the same soil as anti-trade sentiment. People feel as if globalization is making their lives more insecure, less stable. . . . They\'re working harder for less. They\'ve never paid more for healthcare or college. It\'s harder to save. It\'s harder to retire. They\'re maxed out on their credit cards. They\'re taking out home equity loans to keep pace."\nThe question for nominee Obama would be if he can get such Americans to focus on sane solutions instead of scapegoating.\nThe discussion was anything but sane in the last Republican debate last week, with former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney accusing former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani of running a "sanctuary city," Giuliani accusing Romney of running a "sanctuary mansion," and Romney attacking the surging Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, for an old proposal to give the children of undocumented residents breaks on college tuition.\nObama said, "We\'re not going to build a 2,700-mile wall on our southern border."\nObama said the Democratic nominee has to confront anti-immigration sentiment "squarely, to not back off, to affirm that we are a nation of laws and we are a nation of immigrants and those two things are not contradictory."\nJudging by how driver\'s licenses could not be debated without an explosion, a lot of square talk will be needed to beat off the contradictions.\nDerrick Z.

Not only is he doing far better in the polls than any black presidential candidate in American history, but he has also raised more money than any of the candidates in either party except Hillary Clinton. \n\nMost amazing, Obama has built his political base among white voters. He relies on unprecedented support among whites for a black candidate. Among black voters nationwide, he actually trails Hillary Clinton by nine percentage points, according to one recent poll. \n\nAt first glance, the black-white response to Obama appears to represent breathtaking progress toward the day when candidates and voters are able to get beyond race. \n\nBut to say the least, it is very odd that black voters are split over Obama\'s strong and realistic effort to reach where no black candidate has gone before. Their reaction looks less like post- racial political idealism than the latest in self-defeating black politics. \n\nObama\'s success is creating anxiety, uncertainty and more than a little jealousy among older black politicians. Black political and community activists still rooted in the politics of the 1960s civil rights movement are suspicious about why so many white people find this black man so acceptable. \n\nMuch of this suspicion springs from Obama\'s background. He was too young to march with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His mother is white and his father was a black Kenyan. Obama grew up in Indonesia and Hawaii, then went on to the Ivy League, attending Columbia for college and Harvard for law school. \n\nHe did not work his way up the political ladder through black politics, and in fact he lost a race for a Chicago Congressional seat to Bobby Rush, a former Black Panther. \n\nIn an interview with National Public Radio earlier this year, Obama acknowledged being out of step with the way most black politicians approach white America. \nIn the history of African-American politics in this country there has always been some tension between speaking in universal terms and speaking in very race-specific terms about the plight of the African-American community," he said. "By virtue of my background, you know, I am more likely to speak in universal terms." \n\nThe alienation, anger and pessimism that mark speeches from major black American leaders are missing from Obama\'s speeches. He talks about America as a "magical place" of diversity and immigration. He appeals to the King-like dream of getting past the racial divide to a place where the sons of slaves and the sons of slave owners can pick the best president without regard to skin color. \n\nObama\'s biography and rhetoric have led to mean-spirited questions about whether he is "black enough," whether he is "acting like he\'s white," as a South Carolina newspaper reported Jesse Jackson said of him. But the more serious question being asked about Obama by skeptical black voters is this: Whose values and priorities will he represent if he wins the White House? \n\nAs he claims to proudly represent a historically oppressed minority, Obama has to answer the question. Too many black politicians have hidden behind their skin color to avoid it. \n\nFifty percent of black Americans say Obama shares their values, according to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center. But that still leaves another half who dismiss him as having only "some" or "not much/not at all" in common with the values of black Americans. \n\nThere is a widening split over values inside black America. Sixty- one percent of black Americans, according to the Pew poll, believe that the values of middle-class and poor blacks are becoming "more different." Inside black America, people with at least some college education are the most likely to see Obama as "sharing the black community\'s values and interests a lot." But only 41 percent of blacks with a high school education or less see Obama as part of the black community. \n\nOverall, only 29 percent of people of all colors say Obama reflects black values. He is viewed as the epitome of what Senator Joe Biden artlessly called the "clean" and "articulate" part of black America - the rising number of black people who tell pollsters they find themselves in sync with most white Americans on values and priorities. \n\nAnd in a nation where a third of the population is now made up of people of color, Obama is in the vanguard of a new brand of multi- racial politics. \n\nHe is asking voters to move with him beyond race and beyond the civil rights movement to a politics of shared values. If black and white voters alike react to Obama\'s values, then he will really have taken the nation into post-racial politics.\n\nWhether he and America will get there is still an open question. \n\nJuan Williams, a political analyst for National Public Radio and Fox News Channel, is the author of "Enough: The Phony Leaders, Dead- End Movements and Culture of Failure That Are Undermining Black America." \n\nOriginally published by The New York Times Media Group. \n\n(c) 2007 International Herald Tribune.

The latest Des Moines Register\'s Iowa Poll, one of the most respected surveys in the state, provided Barack Obama with a boost over the weekend, showing <http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/12/02/politics/main3563455.shtml>  the Illinois senator with a three-point lead over Clinton among likely Democratic caucus-goers. \n\n"I think the people of Iowa need to know there\'s a big difference between our plans, more importantly there\'s a big difference between our courage and our convictions, what we believe and what we\'re willing to fight for," Clinton told reporters yesterday. Citing the ongoing dispute between the candidates over their health care proposals and referencing Obama\'s PAC donations to influential early-state leaders, Clinton said she\'s fighting back. \n\n"You know, I have said for months that I would much rather be attacking Republicans and attacking the problems of our country because ultimately that\'s what I want to do as president," she said. "But I have been for 4 months on the receiving end of rather consistent attacks. Well, now the fun part starts. We\'re into the last month and we\'re going to start drawing the contrast because I want every Iowan to have accurate information when they make their decisions." \n\n"I think that folks from some of the other campaigns are reading the polls and starting to get stressed and issuing a whole range of outlandish accusations," Obama said of the Clinton camp\'s more aggressive stance. \n\nClinton\'s criticism yesterday focused on two issues. First is the dispute between the campaigns over their health-care plans. Clinton has hammered Obama with her contention that his plan does not amount to universal coverage while he has criticized her plan for lacking specifics on how mandated coverage would be enforced. But Clinton is increasingly drawing attention to reports that Obama\'s Hopefund political action committee, which she claims took money from lobbyists which was then donated to key leaders in the early primary states. \n\n"Contrary to what we\'ve been hearing for a year, (Hopefund) had lobbyist money and PAC money, and they were more than happy to take that money to influence elections and create relationships with people while he was running for president," she said <http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071203/NEWS09/712030311/-1/caucus> . "We were told to shut ours down, and we did." Obama said his PAC operated within the law. "Everything that we\'ve done is in exact accordance with the law," he said. \n\nBut it\'s a difficult issue for Obama, who has campaigned as someone who operates outside the bounds of "politics as usual." He and John Edwards have been critical of Clinton\'s acceptance of donations from lobbyists during the campaign and Clinton\'s focus on Hopefund could undermine the image he\'s cultivated throughout the year. As the new front-runner in Iowa, Obama is about to find out what it felt like to be Clinton for the past several months. \n\nThe Buddy System: From CBS News\' Fernando Suarez, on the campaign trail with the Clinton campaign: \n\nIn a grassroots effort to boost her support among would-be voters in Iowa, the Clinton campaign unveiled its "Take a Buddy to Caucus" effort at a campaign stop in Cedar Rapids Sunday. The enthusiastic crowd at the Roundhouse (an old farmer\'s market) took their seats where awaiting them was a handout from the campaign which read: "Caucusing. It\'s more fun with a friend." The flyer features photographs of Mrs. Clinton and supporters on the cover. Inside, however, are clear instructions for the more experienced caucus goers. Participants in the Buddy program agree to: "Call your buddy twice before caucus night" and "write and mail a reminder postcard to your buddy" and "make a plan to ride with your Buddy to the caucus." \n\n"Here\'s what we know - don\'t tell anybody, this is kind of between us," said Clinton "We know that everybody who is supporting me, if we all come out on January 3rd we\'re going to do really, really well." \n\nThe new push by the Clinton campaign comes just one day after the Des Moines Register poll. With only a month left in the caucus season, candidates are pulling out all the stops to get supporters to the precincts. "We\'re prepared to help in any way," assured Clinton pointing out that her staff would even be willing to shovel snow out of the driveways to get voters to caucus. Clinton reassured first-time caucus goers not to be scared noting that the new buddy system would help take the pressure off. \n\nAlthough the buddy system sounds like a good campaign strategy, it will only make a difference if supporters actually turn out. "I know this is a close race here in Iowa, I think that makes this more exciting and makes your role even more important," said Clinton, "That means that if we come out in the numbers that are out there, we\'re going to do really well. But if people say, \'you know, I\'m for her but I\'ve never done it before\' or \'it sounds too hard\' or \'I think I\'d rather stay home and watch the Orange Bowl,\' we may not have that chance to make history." \n\nPart of Clinton\'s biggest challenge in Iowa is that the majority of the former First Lady\'s supporters are first-time caucus goers - unlike most of her opponents who her campaign says have deeper ties to Iowa - leaving open the potential for a flakey turnout come January 3rd. \n\nJesse Jackson Jr. Rebukes Dad\'s Criticism Of Democratic Field: One-time presidential candidate and civil rights activist Jesse Jackson criticized the Democratic candidates for ignoring African Americans in a Chicago Sun-Tomes column <http://www.suntimes.com/news/jackson/668053,CST-EDT-JESSE27.article>  last week. In a letter to the paper, his son, Rep.

He is deeply rooted in the black community, having fought for social justice and economic inclusion throughout his life. On the campaign trail -- as he\'s done in the U.S. Senate and the state Legislature before that -- Obama has addressed many of the issues facing African Americans out of personal conviction, rather than political calculation." \n\n\nAround The Track \n* In advance of Mitt Romney\'s speech on religion <http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/12/02/politics/main3564183.shtml> , the Boston Globe provides the text <http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/12/02/address_of_senator_john_f_kennedy_to_the_greater_houston_ministerial_association>  of John F.

Luckily for us, he talked the former this past week at the Gaylord College of Journalism as a guest of visiting professor Al Eisele.\n\nCole\'s Democratic friends - and he has a few - think it\'s going to be a tough presidential year for Cole\'s beloved GOP. Tough yes, but extraordinary, too. His Republican friends - and he has many - are acting like "Eeyore" the donkey in "Winnie the Pooh." \n\nThere may be some surprises, too. It\'s a year of firsts for both parties. The first legitimate female presidential contender in New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, the first legitimate African American candidate in Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, the first Mormon candidate in former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and the first person running who is over age 70 in Arizona Sen. John McCain.\n\nCole predicts the closest of elections. Still, Republicans are perplexed with all the various candidates. They have no legacy candidate and no vice president who will run. The American electorate, too, seem very willing to make some changes this year. \n\n"It\'s hard if you\'re named Bush or Clinton to have change," he said. "I can make the argument that the strongest candidate on paper would be Jeb Bush."\n\nThe president\'s brother isn\'t running this time around but don\'t count him out in future elections. Or as an independent candidate either. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has the personal financial fortune to still be a contender. Such a late candidacy would hurt Democrats hardest, Cole thinks.\n\nAsked which candidate Republicans want to rally their troops against, Cole hints it doesn\'t matter but Sen. Clinton is the most likely nominee and the race will be intense beyond words. He says Sen. Obama is too liberal and former Sen. John Edwards\' appeal is waning. He failed to mention New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson\'s effort. \n\nOther Cole pointers: Clinton\'s the most conservative of the Democrats. Few Americans don\'t think she\'s tough enough for the job. Sen. Obama is an attractive candidate but lacks the credentials. He would make a great vice presidential nominee.\n\n"I think the Democrats are favored. It\'s very hard to win three in a row. I give them the edge," he said.\n\nOnce the nominees are selected, the campaign will kick into high gear and the nation will quickly become polarized.\n\n"You\'re going to see a campaign of high profile like you\'ve never seen before," he said. "And, afterwards, the country will be exhausted."\n\nI\'m already tired and it\'s only December.\n\nAndy Rieger writes for The Norman (Okla.) Transcript.

The big media portray the Democratic race as a death-match between the Clinton machine and the Obama phenom. Edwards comes off as a plodder in the shadow of two glamour pusses.\n\nBack in the world of plain people, the story looks somewhat different. A new Des Moines Register poll shows 28 percent of likely Iowa Democratic caucus-goers preferring Barack Obama, 25 percent for Hillary Clinton and 23 percent for Edwards. That sounds like a three-way race to me.\n\nAlso consider the caucus rules. Within a caucus site, people whose candidate gets less than 15 percent of the total can throw their support to another contender. Edwards now leads the Democratic pack as the likely participants\' second choice, according to a recent Rasmussen poll.\n\nThe former senator from North Carolina seems definitely in the game. So why is the race commonly seen as a two-titan contest? The easy explanation, that much of the media are lazy, would not be far off. But something else is going on.\n\nWe live in a political culture dominated by celebrity journalists covering celebrity politicians. Big media want to consort with the big stars - currently New York Sen. Clinton (plus Bill) and the charismatic Illinois Sen. Obama (with Oprah in his entourage).\nOne recalls Angela Lansbury\'s quip when television executives in Los Angeles canceled her very popular show. "Nobody in this town watches \'Murder, She Wrote,\' " the actress said. "Only the public watches."\n\nDelaware Sen. Joseph Biden recently hit the nail on the noggin as he explained why a candidate as experienced as he gets so little attention. After all, polls show that in a general election, Biden would run even with leading Republicans Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani.\n\nDemocrats, Biden said, have a talented woman and a talented African American, and "they\'ve sort of sucked all the oxygen out of the air." A white man does not fit into the storyline. That could be Edwards\' problem, as well.\n\nEdwards was all over New Hampshire last week, talking to average citizens. The people who filled the Bow Town Hall on a slushy Monday morning were neither rich nor poor, but they definitely felt left out. Edwards\' theme of putting middle-class interests at the center of American policy seemed to hit home. As Edwards warned the crowd not to "trade corporate Republicans for corporate Democrats," people nodded.\n\n"I\'d like to hear smaller voices heard, as opposed to the lobbyists," Anne Dupre, a 34-year-old mother of two, told me. Dupre is an independent whose family is "very Republican."\n\nAlso in the audience was Louis Duval, a 67-year-old technician who has been laid off more than once. In a non-question to Edwards, he demanded that American consumers dump imported products, "like the tea party." An independent, Duval wouldn\'t tell me whom he\'ll vote for.\n\nIn Iowa, Edwards supporter Skip McGill suspects that the media have used fundraising as the yardstick for a candidate\'s viability. McGill is president of the United Steelworkers Local 105 in Bettendorf, whose national union has endorsed Edwards.\n\n"They were not looking at what people where thinking and saying as about bank accounts," McGill said. "The other two definitely have money, and I wish it was not about money."\n\nHe says friends on other campaigns have come to his side after hearing Edwards speak. Edwards has hit all 99 of Iowa\'s counties.\n\n"One friend said it in a funny way," McGill remarked. "He said, \'Skip, I drank the Kool-Aid.\' "\n\nThe big-gun cameras rarely focus on less-glamorous candidates discussing middle-class anxieties in small auditoriums and town halls. That\'s why they don\'t watch Edwards the way they do Clinton and Obama. Only the public watches.\n\nProvidence Journal columnist Froma Harrop\'s column appears regularly on editorial pages of The Times.

The votes dealt with abortion and gun-control initiatives.\n\nHis campaign hits back\n\n"A president can\'t vote \'present.\' A president can\'t pick and choose which challenges he or she will face," Clinton said.\n\nObama\'s campaign shot back at the New York senator, touting his support of abortion rights and a Springfield record that included helping reform the death penalty.\n"Barack Obama doesn\'t need lectures in political courage from someone who followed George Bush to war in Iraq, gave him the benefit of the doubt on Iran, supported NAFTA and opposed ethanol until she decided to run for president," Obama spokesman Bill Burton said.\n\n\'The poor guy\'\nOne of Obama\'s "present" votes was on 1999 legislation that would have required teens 15 and older to be tried as adults for firing weapons on or near school grounds. He was among five African-American senators voting present.\n\n"I\'m for getting guns off the streets, but I\'m not for treating these juveniles as adults," said state Sen. Rickey Hendon (D-Chicago), who voted "present" with Obama.\nOn the abortion bills, legislators who supported women\'s rights to the procedure were encouraged to vote "present" on bills that would have required parental notice before minors could obtain abortions and that would have barred what abortion foes call "partial-birth" abortions, a leading abortion-rights advocate said. The goal was to entice moderate Republicans and Democrats to also vote present, helping to defeat the bills.\n\n"The poor guy is getting all this heat for a strategy we, the pro-choice community, did," said Pam Sutherland, president and CEO of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council.\n\nhttp://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/obama/679446,CST-NWS-obama04.article#\n\n\nFROM THE BLOGS: \n\n\n <<Picture (Metafile)>> \nDefining His Faith for Voters  <http://blogs.bet.com/news/pamela/2007/12/04/defining-his-faith-for-voters/> \nPosted December 4, 2007 \nhttp://blogs.bet.com/news/pamela/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/pol_mittromney_.jpg" \\o "Former Mass. Gov. Mitt Romney (R)By Pamela Gentry, Senior Political Producer \n\nHow important is faith to you when selecting a candidate for president? \n\nThere\'s a new frontrunner among the Republican presidential candidates according to a recent poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers.  The Des Moines Register poll released on Saturday revealed that former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has edged out Mitt Gov. Romney to take over the top spot in the GOP race to the White House. Huckabee now has 29 percent, to Romney\'s 24 percent and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani\'s 13 percent.\n\nHuckabee was 17 points behind Romney in a similar poll taken in October.\nHuckabee isn\'t the only candidate making waves this weekend.  Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who only netted 7 percent in the Iowa poll, walked away with the coveted endorsement of the conservative Manchester Union Leader newspaper.  Publisher Joe McQuaid, who penned the endorsement, cited McCain as the candidate who understands the threats to the United States and has prove[d] his right to criticize the Bush administration\'s prosecution of the War on Terror; fights against earmarks; has  a strong anti-abortion position and can work across party lines.\n\nThe recent surge by Huckabee and endorsement for McCain could be why Romney\'s camp announced Sunday that the former Massachusetts governor would be giving a speech Thursday, titled "Faith in America."\n\nKevin Madden, spokesman for the campaign, said, "This speech is an opportunity for Gov. Romney to share his views on religious liberty, the grand tradition religious tolerance has played in the progress of our nation and how the governor\'s own faith would inform his presidency if he were elected."\n\nThe speech is slated to take place at the George Bush Presidential Library in College Station, Texas.  Madden said, "Gov. Romney personally made the decision to deliver this speech some time last week." \n\nReligion has been the one issue Romney can\'t seem to explain well enough to Iowa voters.  We\'ll have to see if this speech makes the difference in Iowa and in other early primary states, like South Carolina.  \n\n"Gov. Romney understands that faith is an important issue to many Americans, and he personally feels this moment is the right moment for him to share his views with the nation," Madden said.\n\nhttp://blogs.bet.com/news/pamela/\n\n* * * \n\nCould Black Voters Trip Up Obama? <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-jenkins/could-black-voters-trip-u_b_75134.html> \nPosted December 3, 2007 | 03:08 PM (EST) \n <<Picture (Metafile)>> \nWith Barack Obama gaining strength in Iowa <http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/ia/iowa_democratic_caucus-208.html>  and New Hampshire <http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_primary-194.html> , it is increasingly possible that he could win the first two states, leaving Hillary Clinton little option but to come first in South Carolina to credibly stay in the race. A year ago, many assumed that Obama would comfortably win the state, where about half of the primary voters are African-American <http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-southcarolina26sep26,1,6474644.story?ctrack=3&cset=true> . That conjecture may yet come to pass, but the patronizing premise it was based on (that black voters would flock to Obama) is obviously flawed. \n\nSo flawed, in fact, that Clinton\'s lead in South Carolina has grown <http://www.pollster.com/08-SC-Dem-Pres-Primary.php>  over the past few months. This could not be happening without a high number of black voters in the state saying they intend to vote for her, although no conclusive polling is available for African-Americans in South Carolina or elsewhere. \n\nWhatever polling has been done is unreliable, mostly because samples are too small to be of any significance. In July, for instance, CNN <http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/07/20/clinton-in-charge-in-south-carolina/>  polled 153 black voters in South Carolina and concluded that Clinton was leading by 16 points in that group, within the margin of error (!). A recent national poll <http://www.npr.org/blogs/newsandviews/2007/11/headlines_1128.html>  didn\'t even ask black voters for their intentions at the ballot, but measured favorability ratings. Clinton was very slightly ahead. \n\nAt the very least, it is pretty clear Obama isn\'t way ahead among black voters, and of all the things expected to trip him up, this was not at the top of the list. But a Clinton win in South Carolina after a hypothetical two wins by Obama in Iowa and New Hampshire, is exactly what the New York Senator would need to be back on track. And neither candidate will end up first in South Carolina without a significant share, probably the majority, of African-American votes. \n\nThis year, as usual, well-polled <http://www.gallup.com/poll/102436/Women-Key-Growing-Clinton-Lead-Among-Democrats.aspx>  fault lines exist among Democratic primary voters, foremost gender, but also class, education and area (urban, suburban and rural), and these differences exist among black voters, even though the data is more anecdotal. Conventional wisdom <http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/us/politics/14carolina.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin>  is that African-American women will be the deciding factor, at least in South Carolina. And if they mostly vote for Clinton, they could fatally derail the Obama candidacy. Somewhat ironically, if Obama wins overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire, it will be because a significant number of white women vote for him rather than for Clinton. \n\nIn the meanwhile, there seems to be a narrowing of the race in favor of Obama in South Carolina <http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/sc/south_carolina_democratic_primary-234.html> , as there is nationally <http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/democratic_presidential_nomination-191.html> , but his campaign must be reflecting on the fact that wavering black voters may well become the biggest threat to its candidate. Michelle Obama may underestimate the power of the Clinton name among some African-American voters when she says that "black America will wake up" <http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21771034/>  and vote for her husband. Then again, she must be as intrigued as the rest of us that the Clintons and their allies can get away with calling <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0107/2402.html>  her husband "a very well-spoken young man" who "doesn\'t have Hillary or Bill Clinton\'s track record in [the black] community." And that the Clinton campaign doesn\'t "see it as a hard battle for her" <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0107/2402.html>  to win African-American votes. \n\nIt may well be that something about Obama, his positions and his track record won\'t appeal to all, or even a majority of African-American voters, but surely it is at least as inappropriate for Clinton to take their vote for granted as it is for Obama to do so. \nAs for the Clinton endorsements from the majority <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/30/AR2007113002257.html?nav=rss_email/components>  of Obama\'s colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus and from the old political guard, a Clinton supporter <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0107/2402.html>  says it best: "This is all about loyalty and the strength of relationships that the Clintons have engendered over the years." Yes, you have to give it to the Clintons: they know how to accumulate I.O.U.\'s and they know how to strong-arm. Whether the endorsements of Clinton by John Lewis <http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=3683>  and Ron Dellums <http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=3512> , for instance, will trump that of Oprah Winfrey <http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/scoprah?source=eventcenter> , who will be campaigning for Obama in South Carolina this week, is an open question. \nThere is every reason to believe that if Obama wins Iowa and New Hampshire, all voters, including African-Americans, will take notice. Under that scenario, there is also every reason to believe that the Clinton machine would move into South Carolina with an aggressiveness that would make George W. Bush\'s 2000 slashing and burning <http://www.boston.com/news/politics/president/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/>  of John McCain in that state look tame. At that point, maybe the sight of a take-no-hostage campaign by America\'s first black president <http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/clinton/morrison.html>  and his spousal successor-to-be against the prospective second black president will put a welcome end to the fetishization of the Clintons, and Michelle Obama\'s prediction will come true.\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-jenkins/could-black-voters-trip-u_b_75134.html\n\n* * *\n <<Picture (Metafile)>> \nCAN OPRAH ACTUALLY HELP OBAMA WIN THE NOMINATION? History says celebs not effective in persuading voters to support a particular candidate.\nCan campaigning by television talk-show diva Oprah Winfrey help Illinois Senator Barack Obama with the Democratic Party\'s nomination for president? \n     That was the question coming from a wide range of media pundits last week shortly after it was announced that starting in December Winfrey will join Obama on the campaign trail in the key early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n     Historically, celebrity endorsements and campaigning have not been particularly effective in persuading voters to support a particular candidate. \n     But the Obama camp is hoping that Winfrey\'s huge popularity among both Blacks and whites will reverse the historic trend. Currently, New York Senator Hillary Clinton is holding double digit leads over Obama in most national pools. \n     The exception is the Iowa caucuses where Obama holds a slight lead over Clinton and former North Carolina Senator John Edwards.\n     Obama\'s strongest base of support appears to be under 30, educated white females. Clinton, meanwhile, continues to outpoll Obama among Blacks and she is especially strong among Black women. \n     The Obama strategy is to secure a win in Iowa and with Winfrey\'s help make strong showings in New Hampshire and South Carolina and thus convince hesitant voters that he can indeed become the first African American to secure the Democratic Party\'s presidential nomination.\nhttp://www0.eurweb.com/printable.cfm?id=39002\n\n* * *\n\nCandidate-celeb smackdown: Can voters smell what the hopefuls are cookin\'?\n\nSomething new is happening in the Democratic and and Republican presidential campaigns: celebrities are being used in the most flamboyant fashion to win voters.
