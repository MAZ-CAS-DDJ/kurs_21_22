Obama\'s silence speaks\nvolumes." Andrea, should the guys back off on this then?\n\nANDREA TANTAROS: No, look, you know, I think that\'s absolutely true. This\nisn\'t a one-way street here. Both Candidates have seen their wives come\nunder scrutiny. Cindy McCain under scrutiny for the cookies that she baked .\n. . look, I think if both spouses are going to be used on the campaign\ntrail, which they are, they are fair game. . . they absolutely are. For the\nObama campaign to say, "No, hands off" . . . I think that was a mistake . .\n.the man may be the head of the White House in this situation but the\nwoman\'s going to be the neck . . . it\'s in the context of what fair game?\n\n[. . .]\n\nLAUREN SCHWARTZ:  . . . when McCain\'s people put out that statement about\nthe DNC leveling charges against Cindy McCain, I think it\'s important to\nlook at what those charges are because there\'s a legitimate issue and\nconcern that both the Democratic National Committee and GOP lawyers have\nraised. And that is when John McCain was suffering economically in his\ncampaign last summer, he used Cindy McCain\'s corporate jet to fly in for\nMcCain events that he has not yet reimbursed for that travel and that\nviolates the means of his own campaign finance reform. I was a trip director\nto Theresa Heinz-Kerry and she had a private plane that we used every day\nthat was methodically credited back and the campaign paid for that use. And\nthat is a legitimate issue and Cindy McCain is of course involved in that\nbecause it was her company\'s jet that John McCain was flying on. So I think\nit\'s important to put in context those legitimate issues like the DNC and\nGOP lawyers have been talking about for the last\nweek.<https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/vi2vd74n4w>\n\n*Making the Candidates\' Wives Fair Game is Tantamount to Enacting a Policy\nof Mutually Assured Destruction *(MSNBC 06/19/08 6:14am)\nJOE SCARBOROUGH: The thing is, while Cindy McCain and others have kind of\nbeen poking at Michelle Obama, trying to gain an advantage and perhaps it is\ngaining advantage in states like West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio . . . it\nis what military strategists termed during the Cold War, basically the\npolitical equivalent of . . . Mutually Assured Destruction.\n\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI: I agree\n\nSCARBOROUGH: If you go after wives you may gain a short term advantage, but\nin the end, you are assuring your own\ndestruction.<https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/egnth8nwg0>\n\n*Cindy Gets Out of Her Usual "Designer Suits and Pearls" to Help Out\nOperation Smile* (ABC 06/19/08 7:15am)\nKATE SNOW: *This is the Cindy McCain you don\'t see on a campaign stage. No\npearls, no designer suit*, at a hospital on the coast of Vietnam helping\nOperation Smile screen children to see if they qualify for a life changing\nsurgery. She got involved years ago, after adopting a daughter from\nBangladesh who needed the same operation.\n\n[\x85]\n\nCindy McCain hasn\'t done a lot of interviews until recently. *The latest ABC\nNews poll found that fewer Americans had a favorable opinion of her than\nMichelle Obama, and more than a third said they had no opinion of\nMcCain.  *There\nseems to be this mystery about you, people don\'t know you.\n\nCINDY MCCAIN: *I don\'t think I\'m very mysterious. I\'ve just lead my life\ndifferently,* and I\'m not the candidate, I\'ve never been front and center. *I\ndo the things that I enjoy, I do the things that are important to me, and do\nthem in a way that I like to do them.*\n\nSNOW: If they say, she\'s just kind of up there and posing, what would you\nsay to people who think that?\n\nMCCAIN: Get to know me! I\'ll talk to them.\n\nSNOW: Her husband, the senator, has been actively courting women voters. But\nwomen\'s rights groups say that once women discover that he is anti-abortion,\nthey may change their minds. So why should women support her husband?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, supporting our troops the way he does, supporting our young\nmen and women, right now, who are serving so gallantly is very pro-women,\nbecause every mother, wife, sister, aunt, feels the way I have felt. The\nthings that he does doesn\'t make him any more pro-women, pro-man, or\nanti-anything. He\'s about America, he\'s about making America strong, America\nstrong is good for all of us.\n\nSNOW: Would you feel safe with Barak Obama as your president?\n\nMCCAIN: I would feel safe with my husband as president. I think Barack Obama\nis a fine man. I think Michelle Obama is a fine women. This is about who\nwould be better, and I think my husband would be\nbetter.<https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/lq5mz0zcww>\n\n\nHighlight #2\n*Fallout in FL on Drilling May Pale in Comparison to Gains in Other Swing\nStates *(MSNBC 06/19/08 6:40am)\nJOHN HARWOOD: I want to say one thing about oil. I do not think it\'s a\nwinning position in Florida per se but John McCain\'s up eight points in\nFlorida . . . what John McCain is playing to is . . . Ohio and Pennsylvania\nand Michigan and these blue-collar voters who say, oil\'s four dollars a\ngallon right now, do something different . . . I think that John McCain has\nthe potential to be on to something here because we\'re in a new circumstance\non energy and I think he\'s adjusting to it . . . when you see not only John\nMcCain but Charlie Crist going, people say he\'s playing to be John McCain\'s\nvice president, maybe so, but still he\'s a Florida politician.

I\'m not sure?\n\n[ . . .]\n\nPAT BUCHANAN: I think John Harwood is exactly right . . . $4 a gallon\ngasoline, everybody talking about . . . energy independence . . .so McCain\nsays that\'s right, we\'ve got to throw out some of the old ideas and really\nmove forward aggressively . . . I think McCain is moving toward a winning\nposition . . .

But has John McCain, in your mind, played this issue\ncorrectly? He\'s diametrically opposed, the opposite to where Barack Obama\nstands.\n\nNEWT GINRICH: *Well, I think Senator McCain\'s moved in the right\ndirection.*He\'s come out for drilling, he\'s for clean coal technology,\nhe\'s for nuclear\npower, he\'s for alternative fuels including wind power and solar power. So\nhe\'s clearly moving to a position that we ought to have more production and\nlower costs, and I think that\'s a pretty powerful contrast with Senator\nObama, who is apparently sticking with a higher regulation, higher tax, and\nhigher price which I think, frankly, is a losing hand in the long\nrun.<https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/lblqtcmckk>\n\n*McCain\'s Drilling Plan Brings Him Closer to Bush *(CNN 06/19/08 7:22am)\nJOHN ROBERTS: Sen. McCain\'s new stance on offshore drilling than one he had\njust a few years ago. It is now a stance that mirrors President Bush\'s.\nSomething he has been trying to avoid. . .\n\nED HENRY: Republican John McCain is trying to appeal to independent voters\nby saying he\'s no President Bush.\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: The next president must be willing to break with the energy\npolicies not just of the current administration but the administrations that\npreceeded it . . .\n\nHENRY: And yet the president and McCain are marching in lockstep on how to\ndeal with $4 a gallon gas . . .\n\nGEORGE BUSH: I know that the Democratic leaders have opposed some of these\npolicies in the past. Now that their opposition ahs helped drive gas prices\nto record levels. I ask them to reconsider their positions.\n\nHENRY: A clear attempt to spread political blame . . .\n\n[. . .]\n\nHENRY: A fascinating family drama . . . it was the president\'s father who\nsigned that order banning offshore drilling while his brother Jeb . . .\nopposed such drilling as governor of Florida. And the president\'s embrace of\nMcCain\'s proposal for more drilling could complicate the Senator\'s efforts\nto distance himself from this White House and appeal to the\nmiddle.<https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/crv9ih1c0g>\n\n\nHighlight #3\n*Colbert\'s Word Mocks McCain as Being Same as Bush* (Comedy Central,\n06/18/08, 11:40pm)\nSTEPHEN COLBERT: *It\'s no secret that one of John McCain\'s biggest\nchallenges as a candidate is to distinguish himself from President\nBush.*I\'m not sure why he\'s so eager to spurn the President\'s\nsupporters. I mean\nthat\'s walking away from almost 29 percent of the American electorate, and\nnearly half the Bush children. But he\'s so different than Bush already. *The\nonly issues they agree on are education, immigration, Iraq, abortion,\nsupreme court judges, social security, tax breaks for the wealthy, wire\ntapping, trade, health care, the Middle East, same-sex marriage, and\nMedicare.* But, they could not be further apart on Katherine Heigl\'s feud\nwith her Grey\'s Anatomy producers. Luckily, John McCain has found away to\nput distance between himself and the President, and it\'s tonight\'s word.\nLexicon artist. Folks, language is very important in politics, particularly\nwhen it comes to war. (Weapons of mass description) For years, the Bush\nadministration used the words, "war on terror". Which was replaced with the\nnames, "global war on terror". (Bush loves nicknames) Then it was the\n"global struggle against extremism" then briefly it was the "long war"\nbefore they settled on the new name, "hey, maybe we should bomb Iran." (The\n"maybe" proves they\'re diplomats) To prove, to prove that he\'s his own man,\nJohn McCain has his own words to describe America\'s ongoing conflicts. See\nif you can spot it.\n\n[Various McCain "We\'re facing a transcendental challenge" clips shown]\n\nThat\'s right. The war is now transcendental. (Transcends voter approval) No\nsurprise, after all Toby Keith\'s anti-terrorists lyric, "we\'ll put a boot up\nyour ass, it\'s the American way" originally appeared in Henry David\nThoreau\'s "Walden". Now there are some questions about McCain\'s new buzz\nword, it\'s not entirely clear what he\'s trying to say. (Another way he\'s\nlike Bush) Now, does he mean, does he mean transcendent? Which, according to\nWebster\'s means "exceeding usual limits?" Because the war has certainly\nexceeded the time limit. (And the Constitution) Or is he intentionally using\nthe word transcendental? Which is defined by Webster\'s as "of or relating to\nexperience as determined by the mind\'s makeup." In which case he\'s saying\nthe war on terror is all in our heads. (Along with Cheney\'s buckshot) *Now\nmaybe, maybe, he didn\'t mean to describe a transcendental experience at all,\nmaybe we misheard him because he was having trouble with his dentures.\n(Fixodental challenge)* Now clearly, clearly transcendental has too many\ninterpretations*. John McCain needs to come up with a new word.\n(Retirement?)* You know what, Shakespeare, I mean think of it folks,\nShakespeare invented words all the time. He invented over 1,200 words\nincluding, and this is true, accused, torture, and zaney. (From play "much\nAbu about Ghraib") Now everybody knows I\'ve coined a few words myself.\nTruthiness. Wikiality. (Explitive)-turn. Which I can not define due to a\npending lawsuit. (And upcoming Fox reality show) So, Senator, Senator let me\nhelp you. From now on, keeping our troops in the Middle East isn\'t just\nnecessary to win the war. It\'s downright "Iraq-rosanct". (Iraq-rosanct)\nHolding people indefinitely at Abu Ghraib is "divine inter-detention."\n(Divine inter-detention) And secretly sending prisoners to other countries\nwhere torture is legal is no longer extraordinary rendition. It\'s called\n"offshore drilling." (Offshore drilling) *Now I hope those help, because\nusing language to turn failed policies into ideals that transcend debate is\nthe best way to get people to think of you as "transcen-presidential."\n(Transcen-Presidential!) And that\'s the\nword.*<https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/4v6bf7nggc>\n\n*Joy Behar Proclaims McCain is Same as Bush and People Have Had\nEnough!*(CNN, 06/18/08 10:30pm)\nLARRY KING: How close is this race going to be?\n\nJOY BEHAR: How close?

And I\ndon\'t know if you\'ve read about this, but there are a lot of people who\nthink you would make a great vice presidential running mate for John McCain.\nTo all those people who say, yeah she would be on my short list too, what do\nyou say to them?\n\nCONDOLEEZA RICE: Well, thanks very much, obviously it\'s dearly flattering to\nhave people think that way. But, no, it\'s time for me to go back to\nStanford, *I mean 8 years is a long time, particularly in the circumstances\nthat we\'ve gone through.* I am quite certain that Senator McCain is going to\nfind a really great running mate. He, himself, is a terrific patriot and\nhe\'s a good friend. But it\'s time for me to do something else.\n\nDOOCY: Oh, come on, you\'d like the job.\n\nRICE: No, no I wouldn\'t. Government service is a wonderful thing, Steve*,\nbut you have to know when your time is up, and it\'s time for new blood and\nlet us leave.* I\'ve got six months still to try to complete some of the\nimportant tasks the administration\'s taken on.
