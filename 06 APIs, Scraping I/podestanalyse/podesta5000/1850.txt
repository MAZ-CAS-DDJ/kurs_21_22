john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John,\n\n\n\nI had the pleasure to discuss with you at the CGI meetings and I take the\nopportunity of the beginning of the year to deliver some news on a very\npromising project: how to mobilize investors to tackle climate change.\n\n\n\nThe starting point is that a fast growing number of investors realize that\nclimate change is not only a threat for society but in all respects, a risk\nto their assets. As a side effect, by reallocating capital, from polluting\ncompanies to carbon efficient companies, institutional investors could\naccelerate the transition towards the low carbon economy (see\nhttp://www.ai-ciodigital.com/ai-cio/december_2014_european_edition?folio=24#pg26\n)\n\n\n\nIn this perspective, on the academic side, Patrick Bolton (Columbia\nUniversity), Mats Andersson (CEO of Swedish pension fund AP4) and I have\nwritten a new paper (\xe2\x80\x9cHedging Climate Risk\xe2\x80\x9d and available at\nhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2499628).\n\nWe describe low carbon indexes that are reducing climate change related\nrisks without impacting investment profiles. We believe it could be a game\nchanger: it is simple, transparent and it applies to a $10tn market.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, we have launched a non-for profit coalition (Portfolio\nDecarbonization Coalition) solely focused on investors that are taking\naction on climate change (see http://unepfi.org/pdc/). Ban Ki-moon, Dr.\nKim, President Hollande, etc. have all referred to the Coalition in their\nrespective speeches and articles.\n\nThe Coalition will bring together institutional investors who are committed\nto decarbonizing at least $100bn of assets. $30bn is already achieved.\n\n\n\nI would be glad to invite you for a lunch or a breakfast to discuss about\nall this when you stop in Paris, and, in the meantime, I wish to you and\nyour beloved ones a peaceful and Happy New Year.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nFred\n'
