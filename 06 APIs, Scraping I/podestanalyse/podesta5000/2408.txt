Because she is attached to Pew, I asked Tamera to make a first contact. That conversation went well, Tamera connected us via email, and we arranged a time to talk.  But since then, Bair has postponed once and now is canceling without offering to reschedule.  I hope there is not more than meets the eye here, but would welcome your advice as to how to proceed.\nThanks\nDan\n\nFrom: Sheila Bair <sbair@pewtrusts.org<mailto:sbair@pewtrusts.org>>\nDate: Tuesday, February 10, 2015 at 8:16 PM\nTo: Dan <dschwerin@hrcoffice.com<mailto:dschwerin@hrcoffice.com>>\nSubject: Re: Pleased to e-introduce Sheila Bair to Secretary Clinton's lead for policy, Dan Schwerin\n\nDear Dan,\n\nRegrettably, I have developed a conflict for this Thursday and I don't know when I will be able to reschedule. ?I'm afraid that I have a very heavy travel schedule over the next few months.\n\nIn any event, please give Mrs Clinton my best. I will always remember the way she reached out to me in late 2008 during the transition to the new Obama Administration to offer her support for my foreclosure prevention efforts. And please say hello to John Podesta for me as well. I have known him for many years.\n\nIt makes me feel good to know that Mrs Clinton has people like John and Tamera advising her.\n\n I am sorry we will not have a chance to talk on Thursday, but I appreciate your gesture in reaching out.\n\nRegards,\nSheila Bair\n\n\n"
