john.podesta@gmail.comb'Went well and back home. I didn\'t realize the "injection" was actually a\nprocedure where they use an xray to get the needle all the way in to the\njoint. Good idea to take a relaxant before. Anyway should find out next\nweek the results. Should be tired this weekend but the good news is if I am\nup for walking around it will helpmove all the fluids and be back to\nnormal.\n'
