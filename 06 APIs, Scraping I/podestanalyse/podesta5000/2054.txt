john.podesta@gmail.comb"POLITICO: Eric Cantor defends Michele Bachmann\n\nJohn --\n\nWe all know Michele Bachmann is the queen of right-wing conspiracy theories. Last week, she sent a letter to the State Department asking them to investigate Huma Abedin, one of Hillary Clinton's top aides, for being associated with the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nScores of pundits and politicians denounced Bachmann's baseless accusations -- including Republicans John McCain and John Boehner. But this morning in a nationally televised interview on CBS, Eric Cantor refused to take on Bachmann.\n\nCantor doesn't have the courage to stand up to Bachmann or the right-wing fringe. Will you help us reach 100,000 strong denouncing Bachmann's attacks?\n\nSign our petition right now to denounce Michele Bachmann's bigoted attack on Muslim-Americans >> http://www.dccc.org/sal-4b\n\nThanks for taking action.\n\nSal Abdulla\nDCCC Membership Coordinator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis message was emailed to: john.podesta@gmail.com\n\nTo unsubscribe from this email list, please paste this URL into your browser: \nhttp://dccc.org/optout\n\nPaid for by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \n430 South Capitol Street, S.E.
