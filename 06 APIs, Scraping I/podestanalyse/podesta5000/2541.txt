If you are around/available would love to have you at one or both and maybe say a few words. You were the one who really made this possible.\n\n\n-- Judd\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Laurel Raymond\nSent: Friday, February 27, 2015 10:45 AM\nTo: Eryn Sepp\nCc: Judd Legum\nSubject: ThinkProgress 10 year events\n\nHello Eryn,\n\nI sent you an email earlier this week regarding John speaking at one of ThinkProgress\'s 10 year anniversary events. Here is the complete information on both events:\n\nThe panel, titled "10 Years of ThinkProgress and the Future of Digital Media," will be held on March 3rd from 12-1:30 pm on CAP\'s 10th floor. Judd will be moderating, and the panelists will be Susan Glasser, Editor of Politico; Anna Holmes, Editor of Digital Voices at Fusion and founder of Jezebel; Ben Smith, Editor-in-Chief of Buzzfeed; and Amanda Terkel, Senior Political Reporter and Politics Managing Editor at The Huffington Post. The event link is on the website here.<https://www.americanprogressaction.org/events/2015/02/18/106859/ten-years-of-thinkprogress-and-the-future-of-digital-media/>\n\nWe would also like to invite both of you to the evening celebration. We will be having a happy hour from 6-8 pm on March 3rd at The Loft at 600F. Beer, wine and light hors d\'oeuvres will be served. Although the link is not yet up on the website, I\'ve copied the email invite, with both a description and an RSVP link, below.\n\nAs I said, we would like to invite John to speak at either of the events, and would like to invite both of you to attend. Please let me know, and don\'t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.\n\nThank you,\nLaurel\n\nSpecial Assistant, ThinkProgress\n\n\nProblems viewing this email?
