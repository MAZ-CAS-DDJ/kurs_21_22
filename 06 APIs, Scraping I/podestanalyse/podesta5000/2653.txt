Through our website, our magazine, our publications, our press outreach, our videos, and in so many other ways, she and her superb team  have diligently and thoughtfully spread the word about the great achievements of the Law Center community. She will be missed, and her legacy here is strong and important.\n\nAs we conduct the search for Elissa's successor, Anne Cassidy has agreed to be acting head of our communications team. I greatly appreciate Anne's willingness to guide the office during the transition period, and I know she will make sure that our strong communications efforts continue without pause.\n\nThanks again to Elissa and to Anne.\n\nBest, Bill\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Aug 10, 2015, at 4:27 PM, Elissa Free <ebf4@law.georgetown.edu<mailto:ebf4@law.georgetown.edu>> wrote:\n\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\n\nI'm writing to let you know that I've decided to leave the Law Center.
