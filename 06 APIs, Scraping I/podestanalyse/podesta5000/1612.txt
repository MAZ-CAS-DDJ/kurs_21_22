Thanks for Greece suggestions. Spoke to Phil Angelides and Mike Dukakis reached out. Brief readouts below. Miss you here - look forward to catching up soon. JZ\r\n\r\nAngelides is not close with Tsipras, but noted that Tsipras visited with him and other prominent Greek-Americans during a trip to the US when he was opposition leader, and they've kept in touch intermittently since.  He is talking with Jamie Galbraith, a college classmate who he's known for about 40 years, this evening about how they might help reinforce our Plan A messaging to Tsipras-namely, that while Tsipras has his political imperatives domestically so too does Merkel and he needs to come forward with a credible reform plan. Angelides said in the event of an exit, he wanted to be helpful and offered to help mobilize the Greek-American community to provide assistance.\r\n\r\nDukakis offered to mobilize Greek-American community for whatever purpose. Noted he doesn't know of anyone who has strong ties to Tsipras directly. I emphasized our focus now is on Plan A of getting a deal done, and for him to dig deep into networks and think of anyone who can help move Tsipras. In longer-run, he had idea of lending American expertise to help Greece overcome skepticism about ability to implement reforms (e.g. former IRS to help them collect taxes). We agreed to stay in touch.\r\n"
