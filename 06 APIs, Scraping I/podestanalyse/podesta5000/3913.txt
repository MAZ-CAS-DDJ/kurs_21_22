As Tony said, so hard to believe 5 decades have passed since Nose.  You know, I clearly remember (like yesterday) when you recited a JFK speech (was it Japan Night or American Night?) at Nose. I remember that you held a JFK silver dollar in your hand while you recited.  Brought tears to my eyes then. Good grief, wasn\'t it just a few years ago?\r\n\r\nI am very proud and happy to read of your successful career, and I could almost have predicted it given your keen intelligence and passion these many years ago.\r\n\r\nOf course, I also remember Keiko. Very well. Please convey my best regards to her when you see her.  I wonder if you also have kept in touch with Itachi-San?\r\n\r\nBrief update, dear Mac:  I went to law school for awhile, have Master\'s Degree in Journalism/Public Relations, some publications.  I was a commercial banker for several years, and then a fed regulator for another several years (US Comptroller of the Currency).  Married an Olympian and world champion gold medalist, who has since passed away.   Have one beautiful brilliant son who is a classical pianist.  I am now enjoying retirement years (way too much), but ought to be doing something more productive. I\'m working in it. :-)\r\n\r\nATTACHED: a few photos of Nose I managed to preserve over the past 50 years. Keiko is in some of them. Perhaps you can share with her. At the moment, I cannot locate pictures of you, although I thought I had some.\r\n\r\n[I am surprised to read you celebrated Nose anniversary last year because isn\'t 2015 actually the 50th anniversary? Perhaps we are counting differently.  Not certain.]\r\n\r\nBeyond happy to hear from you, dear Mac.  Please do stay in touch.  Give all from Nose days my best wishes.\r\n\r\nSincere and best regards,\r\n\r\nJan\r\n\r\n\r\n'
