You invited me to contact you about getting together either in New York or in DC.  I met with Huma in March and was hoping to meet with you then, but you weren\xe2\x80\x99t around.  In any event, I will be in New York on Tuesday and would like to come by the campaign to see you.  Please let me know if you have any time to meet.  Thanks, Mark\n"
