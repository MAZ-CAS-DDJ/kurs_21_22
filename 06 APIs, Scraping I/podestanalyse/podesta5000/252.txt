I don't\nknow the campaign's politicswith  and experience in trustung these\nnews organizations, but if you all are comfortable with what you have\nto background on and are not doing it until Tuiesday anyway - you\nmight want to go a bit broader and include USA Today, Bloomberg, NPR,\nLA Times.\n\nAnother consideration of course  is time constraints - because I would\nguess you would want to do each news organziation individually to\nprotect best against leaks.  I believe you all are discussing on a\ncall now how you may want to decide which reporter from each\norganization you speak to - so I dont mean to suggest that these are\nthe specific reporters you should speak with - just that these are the\nfolks we have heard from.\n\nJennifer\n\nABC -\nGeorge Stephanopoulos (off air)\n\nAP -\nChuck Babbington\nLarry Margasack\nLiz Sidoti\n\nBloomberg -\nAl Hunt\nChicago Tribune -\nMike Dorning\n\nCNN -\nGloria Borger (off air)\n\nFox -\nJim Angle (off air)\n\nLA Times -\nTom Hamburger\nDoyle McManus\n\nNational Journal -\nAlexis Simendinger\n\nNew York Times -\nJackie Calmes\n\nNPR -\nMara Liasson (off air)\n\nPolitico -\nJohn Harris\n\nUSA Today -\nSusan Page\n\nWall Street Journal -\nJonathan Weisman\n\nWash Post -\nAl Kamen\nShailiagh Murray\nLois Romano\n\nCNN, CBS, Fox, NPR have all asked for him to do on-air interviews for\nNov 5 or later.
