As you will note, they deal both with actions by the Federal Reserve/Treasury, and with steps that Congress could take.\n \nI believe our legislative proposal would be consistent with the "Health Care for Hybrids" idea that Senator Obama originally championed.\n \nHappy to talk further about all of this.\n \nOne further note on the transition.    As you may recall, the Big Three CEOs and UAW President Owen Bieber went down to Little Rock to meet with President elect Clinton.   Assuming the election results go the way they currently look, we think the same type of meeting would make sense with a President-elect Obama.\n'
