john.podesta@gmail.comb'John - \n\nThursday afternoon, a majority of U.S. Senators -- including every Republican save for one -- voted against closing the "terror gap" -- the current loophole in our laws allowing individuals on the terrorist watch list to legally buy guns in the United States.\n\nIt was a shameful vote, especially on the heels of the shooting in San Bernardino and in light of the government investigation that found between 2004 and 2014, individuals on the terrorist watch list were able to purchase guns from dealers over 2,200 times. \n\nCongress must close this loophole, and veterans, military family members and VoteVets supporters have an important role in this debate.\n\nSign our petition to Congress saying you are disappointed with their vote against closing the "terror gap" loophole allowing individuals on the terrorist watch list to legally buy guns in the United States and we\'ll make sure they see the message. \n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/terror_gap\n\nFor those keeping score at home:\n\n* It takes 2 years for refugees to pass a background check before being admitted into the United States.\n\n* It takes six minutes for someone on the terrorist watch list to pass a background check to buy an assault weapon in the United States.\n\nThursday afternoon, the Senate voted against closing this loophole. Add your name if you are disappointed:\n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/terror_gap\n\nThis issue has been ignored for too long. It\'s time for Congress to act.\n\nAll my best,\n\nRick Hegdahl\nIraq War Veteran\nVoteVets.org\n\n\n\n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/unsubscribe\nPaid for by VoteVets Action Fund\n\n'
