Will Raj Chetty sign on?\n\nJohn,\n\n\n\nFollowing up from our discussion this morning.  Here is a list of Econ\nadvisors that we could announce around the time we launch the working group\nstructure.\n\n\n\nNeera Tanden, Gene Sperling, Jacob Hacker, Eduardo Padron, Teresa\nGhilarducci, Alan Krueger, Alan Blinder, Byron Auguste, Christina Romer,\nGary Gensler, Laura Tyson, Austan Goolsbee, and Heather Boushey.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of this list/approach?\n\n\n\nAside from the Econ question and the couple of suggestions you provided me,\nare you good with the rest of the list that you viewed this morning so we\ncan start reaching out?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nEd\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Sep 30, 2015 at 9:27 PM, Edward Meier <emeier@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nJohn,\n\n\n\nAttached is the proposed list of leadership for the policy working groups\nfor your review.  You can click on each name and it will take you straight\nto the person's bio on the internet.\n\n\n\nEach policy group will be managed by a Coordinator (or co-coordinators) who\nwill lead the operations of the group and serve as the primary liaison with\nthe policy team.  Additionally we will have 2-4 Senior Partners per group\nwho are high level notable policy leaders in their field.  The Senior\nPartners will join the monthly calls and work with the coordinators to\nprovide overall strategic direction for the group.\n\n\n\nWe have held off on reaching out to most of the Domestic and Econ leaders\nuntil you review and provide feedback.  Please let us know if there are\nparticular groups that you would like to weigh in on specifically.  We have\nstarted discussions with many of the Foreign Policy group leaders and have\nreceived positive responses.\n\n\n\nNext Steps:\n\n   1. You review the list and flag any questions, concerns, or\n   recommendations.\n   2. Policy will circulate the list to senior staff leadership for a quick\n   review for any major political red flags (All the proposed Coordinators and\n   Senior Partners have been vetted or are currently being vetted).\n   3. Policy will send a brief memo to Secretary Clinton outlining the\n   working group process and attach the leadership list.\n   4. Start launching the groups as early as next week.\n\nThank you,\n\nEd\n\n\n\n-- \n\nEd Meier\n\nDirector of Policy Outreach\n\nHillary for America\n\nemeier@hillaryclinton.com\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\nEd Meier\n\nDirector of Policy Outreach\n\nHillary for America\n\nemeier@hillaryclinton.com\n"
