john.podesta@gmail.comb'Great to see you at the JOrdans - I love being your Vanna White!\n\nI know that you briefly spoke with Don Baer at the event too.  He is eager\nand at the ready to help in anyway.\nHe agreed to call Clinton folks who have yet to surface and encourage them\nto get involved.\nHe offers his policy/comms background to help in anyway - in particularly\nin shaping her message as the larger launch approaches.\nI am not sure if/how you are gathering this support - but I know that HRC\nthinks the world of him -- so did not want to let his offer float away.\nAdditionally, he said he would love to help the Foundation with the current\nissues at hand.  If the need someone who thinks about this issues solely -\nas I am sure Craig is drowning in all of the issues of the Foundation.\nxo\nCapricia\n'
