john.podesta@gmail.comb'Two key facts about Koch Industries that deserve more attention\nthan they get:\n\n1) They made millions by stealing oil from native American\nreservations and federal land (i.e., taxpayers.)\n\n2) They\'ve been hit with some of the largest fines for\nenvironmental damage in U.S. history, including what was at the\ntime (and may still be) the largest civil penalty in the history\nof the Clean Water Act.\n\nHere\'s a good overview; there\'s more out there:\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/11/27/60II/main252545.shtml\n\n(OK, one more: Koch was a key funder of an almost-certainly\nillegal Republican campaign finance scheme during the 1996\nelections that involved laundering excess contributions through\nPACs and controversial use of non-profit organizations to run\nattack ads.  The (GOP-controlled) Senate committee investigating\ncontroversial 1996 Democratic fundraising abruptly halted its\ninvestigation when damaging information tying some Senate\nRepublicans to the Koch/TRIAD scheme started to come out.)\n\n----- Original message -----\nFrom: "Adam Jentleson" <Ajentleson@americanprogress.org>\nTo: "\'bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\'"\n<bigcampaign@googlegroups.com>\nDate: Mon, 7 Dec 2009 13:44:44 -0500\nSubject: [big campaign] Right-Wing Billionaire David Koch Funding\nSwiftBoat Campaign Against Global Warming Science\nAlso see Lee\'s op-ed on the same topic:\n[1]http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/artic\nles/2009/12/06/in_glitzy_shadows_a_health_reform_foe_lurks/\n\n[2]Right-Wing Billionaire David Koch Funding SwiftBoat Campaign\nAgainst Global Warming Science\n\n[3]http://thinkprogress.org/2009/12/07/koch-swiftboat-science/\n\nRight-wing billionaire [4]David Koch, who along with his brother\nCharles owns the oil and gas empire Koch Industries, constantly\npresents himself as a champion of science. Next year, a wing of\nthe Smithsonian will be named after him because of his generous\ndonations. Indeed, in accepting Koch\x92s donations, the Smithsonian\nHuman Origins Program director Rick Potts attempted\nto[5]whitewash Koch\x92s philanthropist history:\n\nPOTTS: What we find in David Koch is a person who\x92s committed to\ndoing things for the American public that has no relationship to\npolitics\n\nKoch apparently relishes this perception that his money buys. In\nan interview earlier this year, Koch pretended that he opposes\norganizations which [6]politicize and distort science:\n\nQ: What role do you think politics should play in educating the\npublic about evolution?\n\nKOCH: That\x92s an interesting question. I think politicians should\nreally stay out of it and allow scientists to present the facts\nand discoveries. I hate to see it politicized.\n\nIn an op-ed in the [7]Boston Globe yesterday, I observed that\nKoch has manufactured a positive image for himself by giving to\nlaudable causes, while at the same time, quietly \x93[8]funneling\ntens of millions of dollars to more subterranean efforts that\nreflect his conservative politics.\x94 Despite his funding of the\nSmithsonian, Koch has done more to politicize and and undermine\nthe public\x92s understanding of science than any other single\nperson. Koch has funded the leading groups dedicated to spreading\nskepticism of climate change:\n\n\x96 Koch\x92s Americans for Prosperity, the right-wing tea party group\nwhich Koch [9]founded in 1984 and continues to finance, has just\nannounced that it will send a team of political operatives to\nCopenhagen for the United Nations Climate Change Conference. AFP\nintends to hold a press conference to attack any climate change\nsolution the President promises as a mistake that will \x93kill jobs\nhere\x94 and \x93[10]infringe on our personal and national freedoms.\x94\n\n\x96 Koch has funded the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which has\nbeen the most aggressive conservative front group heralding\nhacked e-mails[11]as proof that climate change does not exist.\n\n\x96 Koch funds the \x93[12]Hot Air Tour,\x94 a campaign led\nby [13]lobbyists stopping in cities across the country to call\ninto question the science underpinning climate change. The tour\nalso features an actual hot air balloon to illustrate their\nbeleif that climate change science is just \x93hot air.\x94\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences, the US Global Change Research\nProgram, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have\nall come to the [14]same conclusion: \x93that carbon dioxide\nemissions from fossil fuel use and the loss of carbon-sink\ncapacity in heavily timbered forests are increasing temperatures\nand making oceans more acidic.\x94 David Koch\x92s Koch Industries\nderives much of its profit from its oil refineries, one of the\nmajor emitters of carbon dioxide, and from its George-Pacific\ntimber subsidiary, one of the largest contributors to the loss of\ncarbon-sink capacity. So while it\x92s clear Koch\x92s bottom line is\nin conflict with the addressing the world\x92s climate crisis, it\nshould also be clear that he is no champion of science \x97 no\nmatter how many halls he buys at the Smithsonian.\n\n###\n\n\n-----\nAdam Jentleson\nCommunications Director, Progressive Media\nCenter for American Progress Action Fund\n[15]ajentleson@americanprogressaction.org\najentleson (AIM)\n202-247-8614 (cell)\n\n\n\n\n--\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big\ncampaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to\nbigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\nThis is a list of individuals.
