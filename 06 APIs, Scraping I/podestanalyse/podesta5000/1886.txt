We depend on grassroots donors like you to build up the resources to beat the extreme GOP and special interests next fall!\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/baron-august?refcode=20150830&amount=20\n\nSupporter ID: 73810819\nEmail Address: john.podesta@gmail.com\nSUGGESTED SUPPORT: $5 today >> https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/baron-august?refcode=20150830&amount=20\n\nIt may feel like the election is far away, and it is. But that's why our work now is so important. It's going be a long race, and we can't afford to fall behind.\n\nThe Tea Party and their special interest friends are going to pour millions into this race. We don't have to match them dollar-for-dollar but we do need to hit this goal to stay competitive.\n\nPitch in today and help us reach our August fundraising goal!\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/baron-august?refcode=20150830&amount=20\n\nThank you for your support,\n\nBaron for Indiana\n------------------------------------------\n\nPaid for by Baron Hill for Indiana\n\n\nThis message was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.\nIf you'd no longer wish to receive updates from our campaign, please click here: http://salsa4.salsalabs.com/o/51479/p/salsa/supporter/unsubscribe/public/?Email=john.podesta@gmail.com&email_blast_KEY=1281204\n\nPO Box 30675\nIndianapolis, IN 46230"
