john.podesta@gmail.comb'John, \n\nAs I write you, we are working day in and day out to get the\nclean energy and climate bill passed in the Senate. But Big\nOil\'s spending more money daily, using every dubious tactic they\ncan to stop it from reaching the Senate floor. \n\nLCV is working with coalition partners to get our new nationwide\nad on the air and make sure Senators and their constituents know\nthe truth about our clean energy future. But we urgently need\nyour help.\n\nThis is your LAST chance to help us reach the $60,000 we need\nto get our new ad on the air. https://donate.lcv.org/01/c4_nov09/nUpzLkNKa_zMD?\n\nYour gift now will go directly to helping us pass the\ncomprehensive clean energy and global warming legislation we\nneed to protect our planet. \n\nAnd it will help us counter the ongoing lies that Big Oil is\nspreading about clean energy, such as the American Petroleum\nInstitutes\' TV ads that claim climate legislation will kill 2\nmillion jobs. The truth is that independent research shows a\ncomprehensive clean energy and climate bill would create 1.9\nmillion new jobs. But it takes resources to get out these facts\nand expose Big Oil\'s lies. \n\nThat\'s why LCV needs your support, right now, so that we can\ncontinue running ads, calling Senators, and putting organizers\non the ground in key states. \n\nThat\'s why LCV needs your support, right now, so that we can\ncontinue running ads, calling Senators, and putting organizers\non the ground in key states. \n\nIt\'s never been more critical that we get the truth out.
