And Anzo is seeing verbatims.

We got to talking about the day tomorrow and he mentioned that President Clinton and Chelsea are doing an onstage panel with Larry Wilmore (Colbert\x92s replacement on Comedy Central) during the closing plenary tomorrow evening.  HRC is not slated to join, but maybe she should.\n\nWilmore could sit down with WJC and Chelsea and say something like \x93Thanks for having me here, it\x92s a pleasure.  And I should tell you, I just emailed HRC (I hear she\x92s a big emailer), and asked if she\x92d join as well.  (Laughter).\x94  Then cue HRC walking onstage to applause.  She could sit down, take advantage of the light-hearted environment to make things serious for a moment, and give a version of the statement, maybe with a follow-up or two, and then they would have the rest of the conversation.\n\nIt would be just light-hearted enough while giving her the opportunity to address this seriously, be a little conciliatory as discussed, and then get back to a discussion about CGI etc.\n\nGoal would be to cauterize this just enough so it plays out over the weekend and dies in the short term.\n\nJen and I just discussed, and she was open to it, so I\x92ll let her weigh in, but one of the things she suggested was that if we do this we employ the letter-to-State idea below as well earlier in the day, so in addition to getting the human side of HRC for the cameras, we\x92d have a set-the-record-straight piece to this that closes off that avenue of attack as well.\n\nIt might be crazy, but it might also be the one-two punch we need right now.\n\nThoughts welcome.\n\nNick\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Jennifer Palmieri <jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com<mailto:jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com>>\nDate: Friday, March 6, 2015 at 7:37 PM\nTo: NSM <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com<mailto:nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>>\nCc: John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>, Cheryl Mills <cheryl.mills@gmail.com<mailto:cheryl.mills@gmail.com>>, Philippe Reines <pir@hrcoffice.com<mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com>>, Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com<mailto:huma@hrcoffice.com>>, Robby Mook <robbymook2015@gmail.com<mailto:robbymook2015@gmail.com>>, Jim Margolis <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com<mailto:Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com>>, Kristina Schake <kristinakschake@gmail.com<mailto:kristinakschake@gmail.com>>\nSubject: Idea on q and a/statement\n\nFor folks to mull overnight, we could have statement/q and a take the form of a letter to the State Department (either from HRC to Kerry or maybe Cheryl to Finer) that would memorialize the process going forward and give us a venue to explain ourselves and provide q and a in less forced setting.\n\nSent from my iPad\n\nOn Mar 6, 2015, at 3:02 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com<mailto:nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>> wrote:\n\n+ Jim\n\nFrom: NSM <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com<mailto:nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>>\nDate: Friday, March 6, 2015 at 2:48 PM\nTo: John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>, Jennifer Palmieri <jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com<mailto:jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com>>, Cheryl Mills <cheryl.mills@gmail.com<mailto:cheryl.mills@gmail.com>>, Philippe Reines <pir@hrcoffice.com<mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com>>, Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com<mailto:huma@hrcoffice.com>>, Robby Mook <robbymook2015@gmail.com<mailto:robbymook2015@gmail.com>>\nSubject: DRAFT: HRC Email Statement\n\nAs discussed, attached here.\n<2015-03-06 Draft - rev2.docx>\n\n\n\n'
