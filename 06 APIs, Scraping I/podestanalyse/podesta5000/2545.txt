john.podesta@gmail.comb"John --\n\nWho will decide if your taxes increase in just 22 days?\nA few dozen members of the House of Representatives,\nthat's who.\n\nCutting taxes for the middle class shouldn't be difficult,\nespecially when Republicans claim they agree with the\nPresident on the issue. But some Republicans are still\nholding middle-class tax cuts hostage simply because they\nwant to cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires.\n\nHere's what's going on right now: President Obama is asking\nCongress to move forward on a plan that would prevent 98\npercent of American families from paying higher taxes next\nyear. The Senate has passed that bill, and the President is\nready to sign it -- but the Republican leadership in the\nHouse of Representatives won't even bring the bill to the\nfloor for a vote. House Democrats have filed a petition\nthat would force a vote if it attracts 218 signatures.\n\nIf a bill has enough votes to pass, Congress should vote on it\nand pass it. It's a pretty simple proposition. And every\nMember of Congress who hasn't signed on to keep taxes low\nfor the middle class needs to hear from you.\n\nUse the call tool today to reach out to fellow Obama supporters \nand make sure they contact their Republican representative:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Call-Tool\n\nLet's get one thing straight: If your taxes go up,\nRepublicans will have made a conscious choice to let that\nhappen. They'll have missed the opportunity to prevent it,\njust to cut taxes for the wealthy.\n\nRepublicans need to stop using the middle class as a\nbargaining chip. If they fail to act, a typical\nmiddle-class family of four will see a $2,200 tax hike\nstarting in a few short weeks. Middle-class families could\nface some tough financial decisions simply because\nRepublicans didn't want to ask the wealthiest 2 percent of\nAmericans to pay their fair share.\n\nThat's not what President Obama and you campaigned on, and\nthat's not what millions of Americans voted for just one\nmonth ago.\n\nWe know we can affect change in Washington when we raise \nour voices together. So pick up the phone and make a few calls. \nRepublicans in the House need to hear from their constituents. \nYou can help:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Call-Tool\n\nThanks,\n\nStephanie\n\nStephanie Cutter\nDeputy Campaign Manager\nObama for America\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Obama Victory Fund 2012, a joint fundraising committee authorized by Obama for America, the Democratic National Committee, and the Florida, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Virginia State Democratic Parties. \n\nContributions or gifts to Obama Victory Fund 2012 are not tax deductible.  \n\nThe first $2,500 from a contributor to Obama Victory Fund 2012 will be allocated to Obama for America, designated for general election debt retirement.
