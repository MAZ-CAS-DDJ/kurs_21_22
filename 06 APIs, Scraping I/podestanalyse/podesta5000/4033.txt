john.podesta@gmail.comb'\n Any interest?\n\n\n\n\nJohn, August 13, 2014\n\nI attach a four page memo that my colleague and friend\nRichard Lester have prepared about the outlook for nuclear\npower in the U.S.\n\nI did this because of your telling me that you were concerned\nabout this question and would welcome some outside view.\n\nWe shall be interested in your reaction.  And if you request it,\nwe will prepare a more complete paper.\n\nStill at the cape.  We expect 19 guests in the next 21 days.\nMostly Phil and Marne collecting nice people.  Nevertheless\nPat and I may go to a motel.\n\nI am set up to meet with Caroline Atkinson who, by all accounts,\nis quite excellent.\n\nJohn\n\n\n\n\n\n'
