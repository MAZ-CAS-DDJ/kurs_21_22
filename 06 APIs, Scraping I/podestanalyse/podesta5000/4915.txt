The new version to me feels like we have jammed a suitcase full instead of making decisions about what we really need and what we don\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nThis lack of economy makes it feel our sections run into each other without as clear point being made in each section and with transitions that sometimes feel forced or disconnected.\r\nRight at the start the rhythm is off in the joke, where a serious paragraph is inserted betweent the set up of the joke and the punch line.\r\n\r\nI think there is too much Roosevelt and the intro of his four fights  also can be fixed but is a good example of how we slow the point we\xe2\x80\x99re making down instead of elevating with \xe2\x80\x9cno mystery about what it takes\xe2\x80\x9d --- the statement is true but it separates what we\xe2\x80\x99re calling his vision from his vision with a line that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add anything.\r\n\r\nWhen we intro the basic bargain, we have dropped the most important part of it \xe2\x80\x93 that it inspired generations \xe2\x80\x93 before we intro her family and the point is that the bargain is what inspires us and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come through with out that\r\n\r\nOn page 3  - when we add a line like \xe2\x80\x9cjust let them bend them rules a little more\xe2\x80\x9d to the take down on of top down we lose the focus.\r\n\r\nI thought there was power in the section of that joined her with them on You\xe2\x80\x99re here today because you believe as I do\xe2\x80\xa6.. Then they are indicting them along with her\r\n\r\nI think When does my hard pay \xe2\x80\x93 has to be a a bit of a crescendo as it was in previous version --- with better pacing can be fixed.\r\n\r\nThe first line about running for president shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m running for president. It should be declarative.  I\xe2\x80\x99m running for president\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll have more when we sit down\xe2\x80\xa6.. but very important is that the takedown of Republicans is weaker not stronger  \xe2\x80\x9cThey say we should\xe2\x80\x9d  as opposed to \xe2\x80\x9cThey want to\xe2\x80\x9d or They will --- they own this.\r\nThe speech feels to have less of her principles in why she\xe2\x80\x99s fighting .\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll go through the rest at HQ but hope this gives some sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Dan Schwerin [mailto:dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com]\r\nSent: Thursday, June 11, 2015 12:12 AM\r\nTo: Mandy Grunwald\r\nCc: David Binder; John Anzalone; Joel Benenson; Jim Margolis; Jennifer Palmieri; Kristina Schake; Robby Mook; Huma Abedin; Lissa Muscatine; John Podesta\r\nSubject: Re: New Draft\r\n\r\nMandy, thanks for the note and I'm sorry you didn't like this version as much as the last. HRC asked me to collect and share reactions in the morning so will be helpful to go over specific suggestions with you.\r\nDan\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Jun 10, 2015 at 11:31 PM, Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com<mailto:gruncom@aol.com>> wrote:\r\nI think this has taken a bit of a step backward.  Yesterday's draft seemed tighter.  I know you need to make significant edits for time, so I'm not going to track changes.  A few areas to look at edits/cuts:\r\n\r\n--Feels like we now have way too much FDR\r\n--The Republican section feels weaker not stronger.  It doesn't do the humor she was looking for and it doesn't quite have the moral indictment either.\r\n--The section after her mother's story but before the four fights feels redundant and a bit flabby -- I think we can tighten there\r\n--There are some detours in the policy section -- coal! -- that break the rhythm and seem odd to devote so much time to.  Overall, this section is really long now.\r\n\r\nI'll be at HQ in the morning and happy to get into more specifics and help edit/rewrite.\r\n\r\nthx\r\n\r\nmandy\r\nMandy Grunwald\r\nGrunwald Communications\r\n202 973-9400<tel:202%20973-9400>\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com>>\r\nTo: David Binder <David@db-research.com<mailto:David@db-research.com>>; John Anzalone <john@algpolling.com<mailto:john@algpolling.com>>; Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com<mailto:jbenenson@bsgco.com>>; Jim <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com<mailto:Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com>>; Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com<mailto:gruncom@aol.com>>; Jennifer Palmieri <jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com>>; Kristina Schake <kschake@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:kschake@hillaryclinton.com>>; Robby Mook <re47@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:re47@hillaryclinton.com>>; Huma Abedin <ha16@hillaryclinton.com<mailto:ha16@hillaryclinton.com>>; Lissa Muscatine <lmuscatine@gmail.com<mailto:lmuscatine@gmail.com>>; John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>\r\nSent: Wed, Jun 10, 2015 6:09 pm\r\nSubject: New Draft\r\nTeam, the Secretary asked me to share this latest draft with all of you and said that she'd love thoughts overnight.\r\n\r\nThis version reflects our conversation yesterday and a big thanks to Mandy for sending additional suggestions on how to beef up the policy section.\r\n\r\nOne thing to keep in mind as you read is that it would be great to find places to cut.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nDan\r\n\r\n"
