Chris Coons: Tuesday, August 5th\n\nFriends:\n\nMy colleague Eliot Pence and I hope you can join us for a breakfast fundraiser on Tuesday, August 5, on the margins of the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, with one of the Senate's foremost voices on Africa issues and U.S.-Africa commercial engagement: Senator Chris Coons of Delaware.\n\nSenator Coons serves as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African Affairs and has consistently been a strong advocate for U.S. commercial interests in Africa.  I first got to know him early during his first run for Senate and am proud to call him a friend.  His passion for Africa runs deep: he worked as a volunteer for the South African Council of Churches and as a relief worker in Kenya, and he knows the continent well.  As a longtime business executive, he also understands commercial and trade issues well.\n\nIn addition to his service on the Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Coons is a member of the Appropriations, Judiciary, and Budget committees.\n\nThe breakfast will be held on Tuesday, August 5 from 8:00-9:00 AM at the offices of the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), at 1201 Maryland Avenue SW, Suite 900, Washington, DC.  For those attending the events of the U.S.-Africa Business Forum on August 5th, BIO is across the street from the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, where the Forum is being held, and the roundtable discussion will conclude before the day's meetings begin.\n\nFurther background on Sen. Coons can be found below.  Event details are below and in the attached invitation.  Please note that due to heightened security, all guests must RSVP for the reception no later than Friday, August 1 at 12:00 PM, via email to amie@chriscoons.com<mailto:amie@chriscoons.com>.\n\nEliot and I hope you will be able to join us on August 5th.\n\nAll the best,\nNelson\n\n\nNelson Cunningham and Eliot Pence\ninvite you to a Breakfast with\nU.S. Senator Chris Coons\nMember of the foreign relations, Judiciary, Appropriations, and Budget Committees\nChair of the Subcommittee on African Affairs\n\nOn the Occasion of\nThe U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit\n\nThe Date\nTuesday, August 5th, 2014\n8:00-9:00 AM\n\nThe Event\nA roundtable discussion with Senator Chris Coons regarding U.S. commercial and investment ties with Africa\n\nThe Location:\nBiotechnology Industry Organization\n1201 Maryland Avenue SW\nSuite 900 (9th Floor)\nWashington, DC  20024\nVenue is across the street from the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, site of the U.S.-Africa Business Forum.\n\nContribution Options\nPAC Host: $2,500              PAC Attendee: $1,500\nIndividual Attendee: $1,000\n\nDue to increased security, RSVPs are required by Friday, August 1 at 12:00 PM.
