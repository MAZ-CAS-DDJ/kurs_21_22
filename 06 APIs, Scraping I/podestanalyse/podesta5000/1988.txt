john.podesta@gmail.comb"Dear John,\n\nI see you are speaking again at the Clean Energy Summit.  As you may know,\nNeera visited our Xtreme Green Electric Vehicles plant last year the day\nbefore the summit.  I would like to invite you to do so on Sunday or\nMonday, August 23 or 24 in connection with your visit to Las Vegas.  Our\nplant is just North of downtown and is the world's only facility building\nfrom scratch exclusively zero emission lithium battery powered working\nvehicles.  Because our vehicles are used all day and replace highly\npolluting diesel vehicles with essentially no emission controls, our\nvehicles are important contributors to carbon emissions reductions in the\nstruggle against climate change.\n\nWe would be honored by your presence.  Please advise if and how we can make\n this happen and anyone else with whom I should follow up.\n\nThanks,\n\nByron\n\nByron S.
