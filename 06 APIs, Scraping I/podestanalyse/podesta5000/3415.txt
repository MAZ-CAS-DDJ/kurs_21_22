john.podesta@gmail.comb"Hello Mr. Podesta,\nThank you again for taking my call especially considering its unorthodox\nnature. As I said on the phone, I currently serve as Political director for\nPenn for Hillary: a student-led organization building a Philadelphia base\nfor Hillary Clinton's next political endeavor. Our group started out as a\ncampus franchise of Ready for Hillary but after surpassing the goals set by\nthe national organization, we broadened our vision to include the greater\nPhiladelphia area. We've formed partnerships with most of the major schools\nin the trip-state region and we have established a network of students\napproaching 500 members. These partnerships include strong ties to the\nPennsylvania College Democrats.\n\nAs I mentioned, we'll be traveling to DC this week to attend the Winter\nMeeting. Our hope is for us to form more connections within the party and\nto establish ourselves as a resource in Philadelphia. We'd love to meet\nwith you informally if your schedule allows. If we're unable to meet in DC,\nyou always have an open invitation to visit us here at Penn (we'd love to\nhave you speak to our student body).\n\n*Travel Details:*\nArriving in DC Thursday evening and leaving Saturday night.\n\n*Delegation Members:*\nMitchell McVeigh, Co-Founder and Co-President\nEmily Irani, Co-Founder and Co-President\nMichael Ramdatt, Political Director\nRobert Klein, Outreach Director\n\nThanks again for being so kind. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\n-Mike\n\n*Michael C. Ramdatt*\n*University of Pennsylvania, 2018*\nramdatt@wharton.upenn.edu\nramdatt@seas.upenn.edu\n407.864.8884\n"
