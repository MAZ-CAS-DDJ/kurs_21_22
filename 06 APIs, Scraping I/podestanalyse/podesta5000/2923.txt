john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi everyone,\n\nOne more quick note so that you\'re all aware of the statement we just put\nout regarding Secretary Clinton\'s phone call to President Obama today,\npasted below.\n\nThanks.\n\nNick\n\n\n\n\n*Statement*\n\n\nSecretary Clinton was proud to serve with President Obama, she was proud to\nbe his partner in the project of restoring American leadership and\nadvancing America\'s interests and values in a fast changing world.  She\ncontinues to share his deep commitment to a smart and principled foreign\npolicy that uses all the tools at our disposal to achieve our goals.\n Earlier today, the Secretary called President Obama to make sure he knows\nthat nothing she said was an attempt to attack him, his policies, or his\nleadership. Secretary Clinton has at every step of the way touted the\nsignificant achievements of his Presidency, which she is honored to have\nbeen part of as his Secretary of State. While they\'ve had honest\ndifferences on some issues, including aspects of the wicked challenge Syria\npresents, she has explained those differences in her book and at many\npoints since then. Some are now choosing to hype those differences but they\ndo not eclipse their broad agreement on most issues.  Like any two friends\nwho have to deal with the public eye, she looks forward to hugging it out\nwhen she they see each other tomorrow night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Aug 5, 2014 at 10:27 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill.hrco@gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hi everyone,\n>\n> As we enter the quiet days of August I wanted to take a moment to send a\n> quick note thanking everyone for all of your feedback and communication\n> over the past few months.

Tune in at 11:30pm.\n>\n> Beyond that, enjoy the rest of your summers and please continue to be as\n> vocal with your messages as you have been to date.\n>\n> On one final note, I\xe2\x80\x99m cc\xe2\x80\x99ing some colleagues that many of you likely\n> know.

It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. And it didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n>>>>>\n>>>>>\n>>>>>  Clinton addresses claims that the investigation of the attack was\n>>>>> rigged since she appointed some of the Accountability Review Board members\n>>>>> and she was not interviewed.

Rice, Clinton\n>>>>> writes, was relying on existing intelligence. And the talking points she\n>>>>> used were written to help members of Congress address the attacks, and that\n>>>>> the information began with and was signed off on by CIA officials.\n>>>>> Intelligence officials didn\xe2\x80\x99t know Rice would use them, Clinton writes.\n>>>>>\n>>>>>\n>>>>>  The talking points have been a focus of Republican critics, who\n>>>>> insist they stemmed from the White House as an effort to control a\n>>>>> politically sensitive issue \xe2\x80\x94 a terrorist attack on the eve of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\n>>>>> reelection.\n>>>>>\n>>>>>\n>>>>>  *\xe2\x80\x9cSusan stated what the intelligence community believed, rightly or\n>>>>> wrongly, at the time,\xe2\x80\x9d* Clinton writes. *\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the best she or\n>>>>> anyone could do. Every step of the way, whenever something new was learned,\n>>>>> it was quickly shared with Congress and the American people. There is a\n>>>>> difference between getting something wrong, and committing wrong. A big\n>>>>> difference that some have blurred to the point of casting those who made a\n>>>>> mistake as intentionally deceitful.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n>>>>>\n>>>>>\n>>>>>  Clinton takes aim at people who *\xe2\x80\x9cfixate on the question of why I\n>>>>> didn\xe2\x80\x99t go on TV that morning, as if appearing on a talk show is the\n>>>>> equivalent of jury duty, where one has to have a compelling reason to get\n>>>>> out of it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see appearing on Sunday-morning television as any more\n>>>>> of a responsibility than appearing on late-night TV. Only in Washington is\n>>>>> the definition of talking to Americans confined to 9 A.M. on Sunday\n>>>>> mornings.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n>>>>>\n>>>>>\n>>>>>  Early on in the chapter, she describes her grief over losing\n>>>>> American ambassador Chris Stevens and three of his diplomatic colleagues \xe2\x80\x93 *\xe2\x80\x9ca\n>>>>> punch in the gut,\xe2\x80\x9d* she writes \xe2\x80\x94 and says she takes responsibility.\n>>>>>\n>>>>>\n>>>>>  The deaths of *\xe2\x80\x9cfearless public servants in the line of duty was a\n>>>>> crushing blow,\xe2\x80\x9d *Clinton writes. *\xe2\x80\x9cAs Secretary I was the one\n>>>>> ultimately responsible for my people\xe2\x80\x99s safety, and I never felt that\n>>>>> responsibility more deeply than I did that day.\xe2\x80\x9d*\n>>>>>\n>>>>>\n>>>>>  Clinton also addresses her much-seized-upon remark before a\n>>>>> congressional committee in Jan. 2013, when she used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\n>>>>> difference at this point does it make.\xe2\x80\x9d Republicans have claimed it\n>>>>> betrayed Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s lack of interest in getting to the bottom of the attack.\n>>>>> Clinton writes that her words were blatantly twisted.\n>>>>>\n>>>>>\n>>>>>  *\xe2\x80\x9cIn yet another example of the terrible politicization of this\n>>>>> tragedy, many have conveniently chosen to interpret\xe2\x80\x9d *that phrase* \xe2\x80\x9cto\n>>>>> mean that I was somehow minimizing the tragedy of Benghazi.
