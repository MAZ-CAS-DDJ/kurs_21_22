john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\n\nI just gave Sean the latest update on our fundraising\xa0numbers and he asked me to share it with you:\n\nDeadline: March 31\nGoal: $10,000\nRaised: $6,784\nLeft to raise: $3,216\n\nYou can see that we\x92re still $3,216 short and you know, we\x92re\xa0just hours away from the biggest deadline of the year. This is a goal that we\xa0absolutely have to hit, especially with GOP Super PACs already on air against\xa0us. \n\nCould you help us get there by contributing today?\n\nI set up a contribution page here for you or you can\xa0call me at 845.831.9110.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/seanmaloney?refcode=20130330-d&amounts=20,35,50,100,250,1000\n\nThanks for being there for Sean, we really appreciate your\xa0support.\n\nChris Morrin\nFinance Director\nSean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\nPaid for by Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n\nSean Patrick Maloney for Congress\nPO Box 270\nNewburgh, NY 12550\n\nTo unsubscribe from this mailing list, click here - http://images.myngp.com/unsubscribe.aspx?crypt=Casv%2frrJxGAq9DTl%2f1OHiEqlBmoYAWIQkFZnCoLf32w%3d\n\nPowered by NGP VAN, Inc.\n\n'
