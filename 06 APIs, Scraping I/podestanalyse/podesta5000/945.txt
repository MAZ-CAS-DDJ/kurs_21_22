"We are ready to talk about everything but not to negotiate our\npolitical and social system," he told the national assembly on Saturday.\n\nThe 78-year-old leader, who formally succeeded his ailing brother Fidel last\nyear, made the announcement amid grim economic news which will curb spending\non health and education, twin pillars of the 50-year-old revolution.\n\nThe government warned of further austerity in the wake of hurricane damage\nand a sputtering economy, a sharp contrast to glimmers of diplomatic\ndetente.\n\nCastro said there was a chance for negotiations now that the White House had\ntoned down Bush-era hostility towards Havana. "It\'s true there has been a\ndiminution of the aggression and anti-Cuban rhetoric on the part of the\nadministration."\n\nBarack Obama has slightly eased the draconian US embargo against the island,\na policy from the Kennedy administration, and made symbolic gestures such as\nstopping the electronic ticker from the US mission in Havana which used to\ntaunt Cuba\'s rulers with pro-democracy slogans.\n\nCastro noted however that the embargo remained in effect and he rejected\ncomments by the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, linking improved\nrelations with concessions from Havana.\n\n"I have to say, with all due respect to Mrs Clinton ... they didn\'t elect me\npresident to restore capitalism in Cuba, nor to hand over the revolution. I\nwas elected to defend, maintain and continue perfecting socialism, not\ndestroy it," he said to a standing ovation.\n\nHe scorned those who believe the Cuban regime would crumble once he, Fidel\nand other ageing figures from the revolution died, saying: "If that\'s how\nthey think, they are doomed to failure."\n\nThe US used to look forward to a so-called "poof moment" when the communist\nsystem 90 miles off Florida collapsed upon Fidel Castro\'s death. But when\nillness sidelined him three years ago his younger brother seamlessly took\nover.\n\nRa\xfal Castro has offered to talk to Washington before, but doing so in a\nnational assembly address gave the words added weight. There was no\nimmediate response from the state department.\n\n"What we have here is an important and continuing effort by Ra\xfal to signal\nthat discussions with the US are something he very much wants," said Larry\nBirns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs thinktank.\n\n"Ra\xfal is conducting himself like someone who wants to be accepted as a\nserious discussion partner. He has been non-judgmental in his relations with\nthe US and on occasion been relatively warm. From the US viewpoint Cuba has\nbeen on good behaviour."\n\nThe US is the only country in the hemisphere to not have diplomatic ties\nwith Havana, a position many critics consider anachronistic and\nself-defeating.\n\nObama has authorised the resumption of talks over migration and disaster\npreparedness, low-level contacts which were severed during the Bush\nadministration.\n\nEuropean diplomats, and many US commentators, are impatient for bolder moves\nand call Cuba a "low-hanging fruit" ripe for engagement in contrast to\nrecalcitrant regimes in Iran and North Korea. The Cuban-American community\nwhich once lobbied for complete isolation of the Castros is now split, with\na new generation urging closer ties with Cuba.\n\nHavana, once a pariah, has returned to the international fold and recently\nhosted leaders from Latin America, Asia, Russia and the EU.\n\nBut that diplomatic shine contrasts with a darkening economy which has seen\ngrowth projections for this year slashed form 6% to 1.7%, with even the\nlower figure considered optimistic.\n\nCastro said the government cut its budget for the second time this year to\nconfront Cuba\'s worst financial crisis since the "special period" of the\n1990s when the end of Soviet Union subsidies left the population close to\nstarvation.\n\nTropical storms last year caused \xa36bn worth of damage and since then the\nglobal slowdown has hit nickel exports and tourism revenues. "We\'ve been\nforced to renegotiate debts, payments and other commitments with foreign\nentities," said the president.\n\nSpending on education and health care, which are free and universal, would\nbe cut, he said, without much elaboration.\n\nMany Cubans grumble that schools and hospitals have already degraded because\nteachers and doctors prefer to hustle on the parallel economy than work for\nmonthly state salaries of just \xa312.\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
