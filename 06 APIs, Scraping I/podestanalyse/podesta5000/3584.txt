As expected, he was terrific and the reception was over-whelming.  I took the opportunity to wait until the rope line was empty to privately ask him a question--was he aware of the campaign\'s closing argument?  He wasn\'t and asked if I was.  Obviously, I\'m not but that\'s understandable.  However,  I have some thoughts and through you want to get my two-cents in.\r\n\r\nMy sense is we are two weeks ahead of where we were before the \'92 campaign.  At this point in \'92 the campaign\'s goal was still making the case that Bill was qualified to be president.  To Hillary and the campaign\'s credit, Hillary has passed that test and seen as "presidential".  Contributing to that image has been to eschew (love that word) getting into mundane political squabbles that bore the voters and are singularly unhelpful in convincing undecided voters.  The campaign\'s discipline has been praise worthy.\r\nThat brings us to the point of the closing theme/message/argument.\r\n\r\nWhile my first thoughts centered around a specific use of the word "leadership" (and that remains in my mind a continuing possibility) what comes\r\nto mind is who are we trying to win over at that point--post Iowa thru Primary Day--a combination of those who are \'undecided\' and motivate our own supporters.  The theme/message/argument should be directly about them rather than us!  While the airwaves are back-to-back negative, we should be positive.\r\n\r\nAn example of the same would be "A Better Tomorrow".  We don\'t have to shout.  She will have already established the needed creditability.  She will have already explained what she believes and stands for.  We are not going to get the haters but we can comfortably associate ourselves with those who--while frustrated and disappointed--very much want to believe their future can and will be improved when she is President.  I\'m a believer and so are you!\r\n\r\n\r\nJoe\r\n\r\nJ.
