Don't think that you can wait until \nthe debates, or until after these conventions.\n\nWhen you look at what the other side is spending -- and where they want \nto take this country -- none of us can afford to think that way.\n\nIt is absolutely urgent we win this election, and the only way President \nObama is going to win is because of what you do. Donate $5 or more \nto support Barack Obama:\n\nhttps://donate.barackobama.com/Our-Week5\n\nWe can win this.\n\nThanks for doing your part.\n\nBill Clinton\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Obama for America\n\nContributions or gifts to Obama for America are not tax deductible\n\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo update your address, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/change-address?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe from these messages, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscription\nTo contact the campaign with any questions or concerns, go to: http://www.barackobama.com/contact-us\nObama for America, P.O.
