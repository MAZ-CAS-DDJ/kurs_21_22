It\'s critical we\'re ready to go. Here\'s why:\n\nMultiple election forecasters are calling Ann\'s race a pure "TOSS UP."\nSpeaker Boehner\'s campaign arm just reserved $1.95 million in TV ads against Ann.\nFIVE different right-wing groups have committed cash to defeating Ann in 2014.\n\nAs of 11am, we\'re still $3,587 short of reaching our goal. If we fall short, our chances of keeping Arizona\'s 1st district out of Tea Party control could face a serious setback.\n\nJohn, we\'re asking -- can we count on your support before Tuesday\'s critical deadline?\n\nJohn Podesta\nDeadline: 72 HOURS\nYour Support: $5.00\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/kirkpatrickq32014?refcode=em_FR_2014.08.25_b2_response_nd_V2&amp;recurring=auto&amp;amount=25&amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=DC&amp;zip=20016&amp;phone=2162818851&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=\n\nThe outcome of this race will come down to the strength of our grassroots support.\n\nJohn, don\'t wait -- chip in whatever you can right now:\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/kirkpatrickq32014?refcode=em_FR_2014.08.25_b2_response_nd_V2&amp;recurring=auto&amp;amount=25&amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=DC&amp;zip=20016&amp;phone=2162818851&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=\n\nThanks for all you do,\n\nTeam Kirkpatrick\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis message was emailed to: podesta@law.georgetown.edu\n\nTo unsubscribe from this email list, please paste this URL into your browser: \nhttp://action.kirkpatrickforarizona.com/unsubscribe\n\nPaid for by the Kirkpatrick for Arizona\n\n'
