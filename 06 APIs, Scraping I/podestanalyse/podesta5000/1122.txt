Many of you know Donald from his previous service on the CAP Board and from his dedicated work in progressive politics and philanthropy. Donald served as a valued CAP director from May 2009 to May 2012, when he resigned from all boards in order to demonstrate his commitment to an independent news source as a new owner of Maine Today Media.\n\nNow, he is in a position to rejoin. Donald has also had a long and distinguished career in finance.  Significantly, he has never stopped being part of the American Progress family and I am confident that his perspective and commitment will be an important part of advancing our work.  If appointed, he will participate in the spring meeting on May 26, 2015.\n\nIf you agree with my recommendation, please (1) email Alex DeMots to let him know at your earliest convenience at ademots@americanprogress.org<mailto:ademots@americanprogress.org>, and (2) print and sign the attached proposed Unanimous Consent and return it to Alex via facsimile (202-315-0453<tel:%28202-315-0453>) or as a pdf via email.\n\nAlternatively, if you would like to discuss this recommendation, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\n\n\n\nAttachment:  Proposed Unanimous Consent\n\n'
