Since he appears to have the votes in \nCommittee, this is going to be a MAJOR floor fight that will garner a lot \nof media and citizen attention in the next three weeks which is obviously \na critical time for HRC.\n\nAnd as I predicted, Bernie has already come out strong against the bill: \nhttp://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-agriculture ...which is going to \nplay very well with his target (millennials).  I can't stress too strongly \nhow important it is for HRC to come out strongly against the Roberts bill \nand for citizens having the right to know and choose whether to buy foods \nwith GMO ingredients.  And the sooner she can do this the better, so (a) \nshe does not appear to be lagging too much behind Bernie and (b) because \nher assertion of leadership in standing up for consumers now would \nsignificantly boost citizens' confidence about her readiness to stand up \nfor average folks and address the tough issues. \n\nAs for the message, I am more than happy to help frame talking points if \nyou want to send someone my way (a sample of key points is below).  But \none important thing for you and her to know is that Tom Vilsack's efforts \nto find a compromise solution have really been pushed aside for now, and \nso while in Iowa she paid some respect to his idea of a QR code/scanning \napproach, because of the nature of what Roberts is proposing, that idea is \nreally irrelevant now.  This is truly a yes or no issue..as to whether \nsenators will support blocking or supporting citizens rights to know.  As \nI said to her last July, regardless of how she or any of us feel about \ngenetically engineered foods, that is a separate issue from whether or not \npeople have the rights to know and choose whether to buy them for their \nfamilies.  She MUST come out against this asap. \n\nHere are some talking points to consider. \n\nLet me know how I can be helpful.  FYI I will be at the NYC finance \ngathering next week for about 2 hours (3-5pm). I hope to see you then. \n\nGary Hirshberg\nChairman, Stonyfield Farm\nChairman, Just Label It\n \n \n\n"
