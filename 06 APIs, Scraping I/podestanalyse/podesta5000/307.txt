john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi John,\n\nToday, Democracy Corps and the Roosevelt Institute are releasing a major new national web-survey among 1,200 likely voters. This poll shows progressive candidates who embrace an aggressive "Level the Playing Field" message enhanced with progressive positions on trade and unions dominate the conservative message. The union-centric message performs particularly well with progressive base voters, and with TPP and NAFTA very unpopular, the trade-centric message performs particularly well with independents. Bringing trade into the debate also further undermines support for key conservative economic principles overall. Finally, adding tough new rules that make "our financial system work for families, small businesses and community banks" gives progressives effective new language on Wall Street reform. Progressive candidates should take on these tough fights in 2016.\n\nRead the memo<http://www.democracycorps.com/attachments/article/1021/Dcor_RTR%20Jan%20Web%20Survey_Memo_1.25.2016_for%20web.pdf>\nRead on our website<http://www.democracycorps.com/National-Surveys/taking-on-trade-unions-and-banks-in-2016/>\nView the presentation<http://www.democracycorps.com/attachments/article/1021/Dcorps_RTR%20Jan%20Web%20Survey_1.25.16_v7.pdf>\n\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to request a briefing.\n\nCheers,\n\nNancy\n\n[cid:image001.jpg@01CFFA9D.B5C5C3C0]\n\nNancy Zdunkewicz\nProgram Manager\n\n10 G Street NE, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20002\nnzdunkewicz@gqrr.com<mailto:fmayer@democracycorps.com> | Phone: +1 202 478 8300\nwww.democracycorps.com<http://www.democracycorps.com/>\nFollow on Twitter<https://twitter.com/DemCorps> | Like on Facebook<https://www.facebook.com/democracycorps>\n'
