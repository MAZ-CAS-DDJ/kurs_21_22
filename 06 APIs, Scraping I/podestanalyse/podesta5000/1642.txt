The Arizona senator said he was\nfamiliar with the disparity but that there are better ways to help women\nfind better paying jobs. \'They need the education and training, particularly\nsince more and more women are heads of their households, as much or more\nthan anybody else,\' McCain said. \'And it\'s hard for them to leave their\nfamilies when they don\'t have somebody to take care of them.\'" [*Associated\nPress*, 4/23/08<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/04/23/mccain-opposes-equal-pay-_n_98342.html>\n]\n\n\n\n*McCain Voted Against Providing More Effective Remedies For Victims Of Wage\nDiscrimination. *In 2000, McCain voted to impose a Budget Act point of order\ntabling a Harkin amendment to "provide more effective remedies to victims of\ndiscrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex."

I was wondering, Senator McCain, why, um, when you\nhad the opportunity to vote to give equal rights to women, equal pay, I was\nwondering why you didn\'t show up to vote and you said that if you did, you\nwouldn\'t support it?*\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: I think you\'re referring to a vote recently that would\'ve\nallowed, which would\'ve eliminated the statute of limitations on lawsuits\nof, for charges or allegations of discrimination. Uh, I think that if you\neliminate the statute of limitations and make it, uh, unending then you may\nbe violating the rights of the individual who\'s being sued as well, whether\nthey be a man or a woman. So, I believe that the Supreme Court\'s decision\nwas correct, that there is a statute of limitations as, as to when charges\nor allegations or legal means are taken, uh, and I believe that it was a\ncorrect decision of the United States Supreme Court and *I don\'t believe\nthat this would do anything to help the rights of women* except maybe help\ntrial lawyers and others in that profession. And that\'s my view. [applause].\nIf you\'d like to follow up, I\'d be glad to hear your response to that. If\nyou\'d\x97obviously we disagree but if you\'d\x97would you\x97wou--would you like to\nmake another comment?\n\nQUESTIONER: I have someone here who I think would like to\x97who I think would\nbe very more much articulate than me with answering th\x97\n\nQUESTIONER 2: [to scattered booing] *That\'s ok, she\'s fourteen years old,\nok?\n*(Town Hall Meeting; Rochester, MI 05/07/08)\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
