I\'m sorry it took so long but we wanted to send you something good, and that required us to go back to first principles. In this package you will find a strategy memo, an Inclusive Economics primer, and a messaging guide.\n\nThis is likely more nuanced and deeper than you were expecting (or hoping for), but I hope the extra work will be useful to you.\n\nIt has been a fabulously clarifying process for us.  I know you are busy but if you could reply that you at least received this email that would be great.\n\nOnward to victory.\n'
