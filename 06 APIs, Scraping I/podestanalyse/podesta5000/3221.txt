Most of these are contained in the overview memo and the interagency structure memo.\n\nImportantly, for instance, we would hope to get his initial sense how he views the key structural issues that are essential to getting started in the national security realm: e.g. role of NSC, what to do about USAID, whether he is inclined to have a ME envoy (vice use Sec State for that), etc.\n\nJim also would like to know for planning purposes, if such a meeting were to occur, would it entail travel to Chicago or SVTC?\n\nThanks,\n\nSusan\n'
