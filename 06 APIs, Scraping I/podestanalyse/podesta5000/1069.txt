Donald J. Trump had a big day on Thursday, but on\nFriday, other candidates, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Hillary Rodham\nClinton, will find themselves in Puerto Rico at the same time. And Mr.\nRubio is wasting little time previewing his idea of what the general\nelection might look like. \xe2\x80\x9cMarco vs. Hillary in Puerto Rico this Friday,\xe2\x80\x9d\nreads the news release from the Rubio campaign, like a flyer promoting an\nevent more suited to a boxing ring than a presidential race. And while Mrs.\nClinton has acted like she would rather just ignore the Florida senator \xe2\x80\x94\nher campaign sent out a statement of its own saying only that she would be\nvisiting a cardiovascular care center on the island primarily to discuss\nhealth care issues \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Rubio sees their visits on Friday as an\nopportunity to draw clear contrasts with the candidate that many expect to\nbe the Democratic nominee. Their trips were not planned to coincide, but\nMr. Rubio, seems eager to make the most of it. Mrs. Clinton does not speak\nSpanish. He does, and he plans to make good use of it while he\xe2\x80\x99s there. He\nalso wrote an op-ed (in English and Spanish) that was published on Friday\nin El Nuevo D\xc3\xada, Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s largest newspaper by readership. In it, Mr.\nRubio outlined how, unlike Mrs. Clinton and Jeb Bush, another Floridian who\nis one of Mr. Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s chief rivals, he does not support allowing the\nisland\xe2\x80\x99s municipalities to reorganize their debt in bankruptcy. (Stateside\nmunicipalities can do so under bankruptcy law, but as a commonwealth,\nPuerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s cannot.) \xe2\x80\x9cSo far, Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s liberal hosts in San Juan\ntoday have failed to propose any serious measures to fix Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s\neconomic challenges,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in the piece. Of course, there is a subtext\nto Mr. Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s jabs. He hopes their dueling appearances are just a preview\nof what\xe2\x80\x99s to come in the general election.\nView First Draft\n<http://p.nytimes.com/email/re?location=InCMR7g4BCLMQnpkk5MvplGHjZHVWFYy37Fha1nkmwg=&campaign_id=7779&instance_id=62558&segment_id=76933&user_id=30a142167a399d9be2c1b7c32e192bd2&regi_id=63304329>\non the web | Add nytdirect@nytimes.com\n<javascript:_e(%7B%7D,'cvml','nytdirect@nytimes.com');> to your address\nbook\n9/04/2015 nytimes.com/firstdraft \xc2\xbb\n<http://p.nytimes.com/email/re?location=InCMR7g4BCLMQnpkk5MvplGHjZHVWFYy37Fha1nkmwg=&campaign_id=7779&instance_id=62558&segment_id=76933&user_id=30a142167a399d9be2c1b7c32e192bd2&regi_id=63304329>\n[image: First Draft]\n<http://p.nytimes.com/email/re?location=InCMR7g4BCLMQnpkk5MvplGHjZHVWFYy37Fha1nkmwg=&campaign_id=7779&instance_id=62558&segment_id=76933&user_id=30a142167a399d9be2c1b7c32e192bd2&regi_id=63304329>\nRubio and Clinton to Have an Island All to Themselves\n<http://p.nytimes.com/email/re?location=4z5Q7LhI+KVBjmEgFdYACKQh1JEPAsZdfyc9wlrSq35yzYtU4heo6wX+mELN1J9Gg4/cbaa1qLw=&campaign_id=7779&instance_id=62558&segment_id=76933&user_id=30a142167a399d9be2c1b7c32e192bd2&regi_id=63304329>\n<http://p.nytimes.com/email/re?location=4z5Q7LhI+KVBjmEgFdYACKQh1JEPAsZdfyc9wlrSq35yzYtU4heo6wX+mELN1J9Gg4/cbaa1qLw=&campaign_id=7779&instance_id=62558&segment_id=76933&user_id=30a142167a399d9be2c1b7c32e192bd2&regi_id=63304329>\n\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida spoke at the Prescott Bush Awards Dinner in\nStamford, Conn., in June.

But every time Mr. Nash sat\ndown to create an iconic portrait of Mr. Sanders, he struggled to find a\ngaze or a look that captured his momentum.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then it occurred to me that the key to Bernie, is he\xe2\x80\x99s not iconic,\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s emotive,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Nash said. So he set about making not one portrait, but\n12, all cartoonishly emotional (which was fairly unsurprising, given Mr.\nNash\xe2\x80\x99s background: He designed the logo for Nickelodeon way back when).\n\nTwo programmers who work with Mr. Nash, *Akimitsu Hogge *and* Wade Brainerd*,\nhelped him amplify his illustrations.\n\nSo though Mr. Nash\xe2\x80\x99s portraits of Mr. Sanders are dotting the texts and\nchats of supporters, when it comes to the original dare, Mr. Nash jokes,\n\xe2\x80\x9cif you can tell, I failed miserably.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n*\xe2\x80\x93 Nick Corasaniti*\nADVERTISEMENT\n<http://www.nytimes.com/adx/bin/adx_click.html?type=goto&opzn&page=email.nytimes.com/us/politicsemail/html&pos=Position3&sn2=9a54d5d4/132948d3&sn1=da777183/80c616a6&camp=nyt2015_300x250_em_TimesJourneys_selectnewsletters&ad=CRS-4995_TimesJourneys_New_300x250_retina_a.png&goto=http%3A%2F%2Funbouncepages%2Ecom%2Ftimes%2Djourneys%2Dbrochure%2Dnovember%2D2014%2F>\nA Note to Readers\n\nFirst Draft will be celebrating Labor Day by not sending you a newsletter\non Monday.
