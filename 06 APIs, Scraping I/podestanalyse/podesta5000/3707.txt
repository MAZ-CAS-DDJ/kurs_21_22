But in Colorado,\nthe former secretary of state and likely presidential candidate in 2016,\nspoke about how fortunate she felt to be born in America and the message\nshe hopes to be able to leave with children.\n\n\n\nThe personal remarks, while focused on turning out voters for Democrats\nMark Udall, John Hickenlooper and Andrew Romanoff, sounds a great deal like\na presidential candidate and resembled a message Clinton could use should\nshe run for president.\n\n\n\n"I have had a great set of experiences. I have been very fortunate in my\nlife, but the most fortunate thing besides the parents to whom I was born,\nis that I was born in America," Clinton said. "I, from the moment of my\nbirth, was blessed because of that. And I grew up believing with all my\nheart that if I worked hard, if I did was I was supposed to do, go to\nschool, get an education, that I would have opportunities that were never\navailable to my mother."\n\n\n\nClinton added, "Indeed that came true for me. I don\'t want that ever to be\nlost. I want everyone in this room to be able to look at any baby, any\nchild and truthfully say, \'You have the same right to the American dream\nthat I did.\'"\n\n\n\nThis was Clinton\'s second trip to Colorado in a week. She spent a few hours\nwith Udall last week at a private fundraiser and at a local coffee shop and\nmarket to meet voters.\n\n\n\nUdall is in a tight race with Republican Rep. Cory Gardner, who some polls\nhave slightly ahead.\n\n\n\n"The only poll that counts is that poll on election day," Udall said,\nwarming up the crowd for Clinton by using a tried-and-true campaign cliche.\n\n\n\nDemocrats in the state and nationally see Clinton as someone who can turn\nout women in Colorado, a key demographic that some experts see the election\nturning on.\n\n\n\n"This election is important to everybody, but it is especially important to\nthe women of Colorado," Clinton said, touching upon a woman\'s right to\nchoose, personhood laws and availability of birth control - all topics the\nrace between Udall and Gardner have focused on.\n\n\n\n"Women\'s rights here at home and around the world are clearly at risk,"\nClinton said, arguing those rights "are like the canaries in the mine."\n\n\n\nAlthough Clinton was there to endorse Democrats and increase excitement,\nher presidential aspirations weren\'t far from the minds of many.\n\n\n\nBefore Clinton went on, Romanoff tried to pep up the crowd by asking, "Are\nyou ready to hear from the next president of the United States?"\n\n\n\nEven Udall got into the hinting at 2016 action when he said, "I think we\nhope she [Hillary Clinton] is going to come back over the next few years."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Associated Press: The Clintons, the Democrats\' 2014 super surrogates\n<http://bigstory.ap.org/article/8e0b9279063b4468a3d18e4b64c873fd/clintons-democrats-2014-super-surrogates>*\n\n\n\nBy Ken Thomas and Nicholas Riccardi\n\nOctober 22, 2014 3:17 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nAURORA, Colo. (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Bill and Hillary Clinton are the validators-in-chief\nfor Democrats struggling through a bleak campaign season in states where\nPresident Barack Obama is deeply unpopular.\n\n\n\nWith speculation rampant about whether Hillary Rodham Clinton makes a\nsecond presidential run, the power couple has blanketed the political map\nthis fall, attending fundraisers and get-out-the-vote rallies for a long\nroster of Democratic candidates. In states like Arkansas, Louisiana, North\nCarolina and Colorado, the Clintons are an asset at a time when many\nDemocrats need a big name to help inspire supporters. The Clintons usually\ncampaign for candidates on their own.\n\n\n\nOn the campaign trail, the former president, in particular, is in his\nelement.\n\n\n\n"I feel like an old racehorse in a stable and people just take me out and\nput me on the track and slap me on the rear to see if I can run around one\nmore time," the ex-president joked at a recent Democratic Party event in\nNew Hampshire \xe2\x80\x94 a theme he has used before while campaigning this round.\n\n\n\nObama appeared at his first political rallies last weekend \xe2\x80\x94 in\nDemocratic-friendly Maryland and his home state of Illinois \xe2\x80\x94 but the\nClintons can go where the president might not be helpful.\n\n\n\nBill Clinton starred in TV ads for Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky,\nwhere Obama is so unpopular that Grimes has repeatedly refused to say\nwhether she voted for him.\n\n\n\nThe couple is a powerful fundraising force that fuels voter turnout and\ngive activists a taste of what could come next.\n\n\n\n"Some people excel at raising money. Some people excel at turning out\nvoters. The Clintons excel at both," said Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., who\nleads the House Democrats\' campaign arm. "There is not one single\ncompetitive district in the country where both don\'t do well."\n\n\n\nTheir campaign schedule is infused with anticipation of a second run for\nthe White House by Hillary Clinton, former first lady, senator and\nsecretary of state.\n\n\n\nShe\'s expected to announce her decision after the November elections, a\nmove that could boost morale should Democrats cede control of the Senate\nand lose seats in the House.\n\n\n\nThis week alone, Hillary Clinton hauled in an estimated $3.5 million in\nCalifornia for the campaign committees of House and Senate Democrats,\nincluding $2.1 million at a Hollywood event with Democratic mega-donors\nJeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg.\n\n\n\nIn Denver\'s suburbs Tuesday, the former secretary of state vouched for\nColorado Sen. Mark Udall \xe2\x80\x94 who\'s locked in a tight race against Republican\nRep. Cory Gardner \xe2\x80\x94 and Gov. John Hickenlooper, calling them "two of the\nmost effective leaders in the country."\n\n\n\nPeople showing up for the rally had to fill out part of their ticket\nentitled, "I Pledge to Vote," and hand in the stub at the door for\nadmission. Campaign workers signed up attendees to work get-out-the-vote\nshifts.\n\n\n\nIt was Clinton\'s second visit to Colorado in as many weeks. During the last\ntrip, she strolled through Denver\'s central train station with Udall,\nensuring images of them on the local news.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\'s itinerary this week includes events with Minnesota Gov.\nMark Dayton, a former Senate colleague; three rallies in New England with\ncandidates running for governor; and a weekend appearance in Charlotte,\nN.C., with embattled North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan.\n\n\n\nBill Clinton is covering even more ground: Baton Rouge, La., for Louisiana\nSen. Mary Landrieu on Monday; Chicago for Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn and\nwestern Kentucky for Grimes on Tuesday; Flint, Mich., and Long Island,\nN.Y., for Democratic candidates on Wednesday. Thursday brings a New Jersey\nfundraiser for Bonnie Watson Coleman, a congressional candidate; by Friday,\nClinton will be in Syracuse, N.Y., for Rep. Dan Maffei and Milwaukee for\nMary Burke, who is challenging Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.\n\n\n\nYet no state personifies the Clintons\' campaign push more than Arkansas,\nwhere Bill Clinton was governor for more than a decade. During the past two\nweeks, he has barnstormed the state at 10 events for Sen. Mark Pryor, Mike\nRoss, his one-time campaign driver who is running for governor, and a field\nof congressional candidates.\n\n\n\nBill Clinton\'s visits have encouraged early voting among black voters and\ncollege students. Robert McLarty, the director of the state Democratic\nParty\'s coordinated campaign, said Democrats have registered or\nre-registered 3,000 voters on college campuses at Clinton events and filled\n8,500 get-out-the-vote shifts, the equivalent of someone committing to work\na phone bank for 2 hours or canvass a neighborhood for 4 hours.\n\n\n\nNew Hampshire, the nation\'s first presidential primary state, is also\ngetting the Clinton treatment. Hillary Clinton will be there on the final\nSunday before the election, helping a slate of female candidates, while\nBill Clinton\'s speech at the state party\'s fall dinner drew a big crowd and\nraised $250,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Washington Post: Hillary Clinton stumps for Udall in Colorado, calling\nrace \xe2\x80\x98especially important\xe2\x80\x99 for women\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/10/21/hillary-clinton-stumps-for-udall-in-colorado-calling-race-especially-important-for-women/>*\n\n\n\nBy Dan Balz\n\nOctober 21, 2014 5:09 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nAURORA, Colo. - Asserting that women\'s reproductive rights are more at risk\nthan at any time in the past 40 years, Hillary Rodham Clinton made an\nimpassioned plea to the women of Colorado here Tuesday to reelect embattled\nSen. Mark Udall and the rest of the Democratic ticket.\n\n\n\nClinton said women\'s rights - from equal pay to freedom of choice on\nabortion to affordable and accessible contraception - are central issues in\nthe 2014 campaigns. "This election is important for everybody but it\'s\nespecially important for the women of Colorado," she said.\n\n\n\nThe former secretary of state appeared at a rally that featured both Udall\nand Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, each of whom are in competitive races.\nAlso appearing was former Colorado House speaker Andrew Romanoff, who is\nrunning against Rep. Mike Coffman (R ).\n\n\n\nUdall\'s contest against Colorado Rep. Cory Gardner (R ) is one of the\nclosest in the nation and Democratic strategists here say the outcome could\nhinge on the votes of unmarried women.\n\n\n\nClinton praised Udall as a Senate workhorse whose accomplishments don\'t\nmake headlines but are crucial to the well-being of Colorado citizens. She\nsaved her most passionate comments for the end, when she talked about the\nimportance of the elections for women of the state.\n\n\n\nShe said the right to abortion "is under assault today across our country\nand is less secure than it has been at any time in the last 40 years. These\nDemocrats will never shame and judge a woman for decisions that are complex\nand deeply personal." Those decisions, she said, should be between a woman,\nher family and her doctor, "not with her boss or a politician."\n\n\n\nClinton took note of the fact that Udall has been criticized for focusing\nso much attention on women\'s issues, to the point that he has been referred\nto as Mark "Uterus."\n\n\n\n"As far as I\'m concerned, and as far as Mark is concerned, when he fights\nfor women\'s rights, he is fighting on the frontier of freedom," Clinton\nsaid. "Women\'s rights here at home and around the world are clearly at\nrisk."\n\n\n\nWithout naming Gardner, Clinton took aim at him for having supported a\nso-called "personhood" amendment, which would legally recognize life as\nbeginning at conception, and for attempting to run away from it.\n\n\n\nThis was the second time in a week that Clinton has campaigned in Colorado.\nFirst lady Michelle Obama is also scheduled to appear later this week,\nwhile former president Bill Clinton is expected to campaign in the state\nbefore election day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Washington Post: Hillary Clinton sharpens her stump speech\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/10/21/hillary-clinton-sharpens-her-stump-speech/>*\n\n\n\nBy Anne Gearan\n\nOctober 21, 2014 at 10:00 a.m.\n\n\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \xe2\x80\x93 Continuing her 2014 evolution from mostly apolitical figure\nto fierce partisan, Hillary Rodham Clinton is accusing Republicans of\nnational \xe2\x80\x9camnesia\xe2\x80\x9d about their own failings in office and telling Democrats\nthey will have themselves to blame if they don\xe2\x80\x99t come out to vote in\nmidterm elections.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is our chance -- our chance to elect Democrats who are fighting to\njump-start the middle class,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said at a $1.4 million Democratic\nfund-raising luncheon here Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cOur chance to elect Democrats who are\nworking for better jobs, better wages, for an economy that works for\neverybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in the home stretch,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand it all comes down to who\nshows up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAfter President Obama and other Democrats worked hard to avert financial\ndisaster and begin rebuilding the U.S. economy after 2008, \xe2\x80\x9cit is truly\nregrettable [that] we are having to work so hard to elect and reelect\nDemocrats,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as though the other side wants to cast an air of amnesia,\xe2\x80\x9d over the\n2014 midterms, she said, warming to the theme.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t really on the brink of the worst economic catastrophe\nsince the Great Depression; we weren\xe2\x80\x99t really fighting two wars; we weren\xe2\x80\x99t\nreally worrying about what was happening if the economy fell so far and\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s livelihoods and their homes and their healthcare and everything\nelse they were depending on was swept away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, seems to the other side,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re here to\nremind them and all of us, it did happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAlthough her own 2008 presidential loss had little to do with turnout, she\nplayfully invoked it to remind Democrats of the dangers of staying home.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never know what can happen in an election. You can\xe2\x80\x99t take anything for\ngranted. You just have to get out there and work. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any of us\nwant to wake up the day after the election and wish we had done more,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid.\n\n\n\nClinton is also road-testing an unabashedly women-centered economic message\nheavy on outrage over pay inequality and the professional costs women pay\nto both raise families and bring in a paycheck.\n\n\n\nShe was criticized for often bloodless rhetoric about women-oriented\nconcerns when she ran as the first major-party women candidate for\npresident. Now Clinton is pointedly talking about family leave, employer\ndiscrimination, employers\xe2\x80\x99 denial of contraception coverage and the\npreponderance of women in low-wage jobs.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe most vulnerable families in our country have the least support,\xe2\x80\x9d\nClinton said. Imagine, she added, what women would do with the extra income\nthey would make if paid the same as men: rent or buy better houses, buy\nmore groceries, give their families added stability.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen up and down the income ladder face double standards and barriers to\nadvancement,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cThese aren\xe2\x80\x99t just women\xe2\x80\x99s issues.

Mark Udall (D-Colo.), a leading critic of the\nObama administration on NSA reform, for his work on intelligence matters\nduring a campaign stop Tuesday.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a rally for Udall, who is facing a tough reelection race,\nClinton praised him for "leading the Senate in asking the hard questions\nabout intelligence and the tradeoff between liberty and security," adding\n"That was an important and challenging task that he took on."\n\n\n\nUdall has called for President Obama\'s CIA director, John Brennan, to\nresign over gaining access to Senate investigators\' files, and has led the\ncharge against the NSA\'s bulk collection of Americans\' phone records.\n\n\n\nClinton did not go into detail about any policy agreements or disagreements\nwith Udall, but the comments could add some more insight into Clinton\'s\nviews on intelligence matters, an area where she has mostly stayed silent.\n\n\n\nClinton appeared to back some reforms in June, when she told Fox News: "We\nhave to make some changes in order to secure that privacy, that\nconstitutional right to privacy that Americans are due."\n\n\n\nShe added, though, that\'s it is a "really difficult balancing act" and has\nbeen critical of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, saying she found it\n"sort of odd" that he left to China and Russia.\n\n\n\nMost of Clinton\'s speech on Tuesday though, was devoted to touting Udall\'s\npositions on women\'s rights issues, as well as congressional candidate\nAndrew Romanoff and Gov. John Hickenlooper.\n\n\n\nClinton has been focusing on issues such as access to contraception, paid\nleave and equal pay in midterm campaign stops around the country. She spoke\nin stark terms on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n"Women\xe2\x80\x99s rights here at home and around the world are clearly at risk\nunless people of good will, both women and men, regardless of political\nideology, understand that women\xe2\x80\x99s rights are like the canaries in the\nmine," she said. "If women\'s rights are denied or rolled back anywhere, it\nis a threat to everyone\'s rights everywhere."\n\n\n\nUdall has made access to contraception and Republican opponent Rep. Cory\nGardner\'s past support for "personhood" measures that would outlaw birth\ncontrol central to his campaign.\n\n\n\nGardner has sought to counter that attack by supporting over the counter\naccess to contraception, but Clinton hit him, without saying his name, on\nthat proposal.\n\n\n\n"These Democrats will never deny women health insurance for contraception\nand then tell them to just buy it over the counter without even wishing\nthem good luck in paying the bill," Clinton said.\n\n\n\nClinton gave several lines that could make their way into a presidential\nstump speech, closing by speaking of the American Dream.\n\n\n\n"I want everyone in this room to be able to look at any baby, any child,\nand truthfully say, \'You have the same right to the American Dream that I\ndid and the generations before me,\' " she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*BuzzFeed: Hillary Clinton Raises \xe2\x80\x9cRecord\xe2\x80\x9d Millions For Senate Democrats\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/hillary-clinton-raises-record-millions-for-senate-democrats?utm_term=1pvy66n#467iqgk>*\n\n\n\nBy Ruby Cramer\n\nOctober 21, 2014 at 3:29 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton raised a record $2.1 million for Senate Democrats at a Los\nAngeles fundraiser organized on Mondaynight by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the top\nfilm executive who has positioned himself to play a leading, influential\nrole in the possible presidential campaign many expect from the former\nsecretary of state.\n\n\n\nA person with knowledge of the final tally confirmed that the Clinton event\nfor the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, held at Brentwood\xe2\x80\x99s\nTavern restaurant, brought in $2.1 million. The number was first reported\nin Deadline.\n\n\n\nThe source said the total haul set a \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d for the DSCC.\n\n\n\nAn official with the DSCC, now struggling in the final days of the midterm\nelections to win enough races to keep control of the Senate, declined to\nconfirm the total. The committee does not make public the amounts raised at\nits fundraisers.\n\n\n\nThe Clinton fundraiser on Monday was the second event during this year\xe2\x80\x99s\nelection cycle that she has hosted for the DSCC. Also in attendance was the\nchairman of the committee, Sen. Michael Bennet, as well as both of\nCalifornia\xe2\x80\x99s U.S. senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, according\nto the DSCC official.\n\n\n\nClinton appeared earlier in the day at a San Francisco event for the\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee, raising $1.4 million, a DCCC\nofficial said.\n\n\n\nAfter promoting her new memoir at a series of book signings this summer,\nClinton has jumped back into politics this month, hosting fundraisers for\nthe Democratic committees and headlining a string of rallies for Democrats\nin states like Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Colorado, and Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nKatzenberg, the CEO of DreamWorks Animation and a longtime player in the\ntop-most circles of Democratic politics in Hollywood, is poised to be a\nmajor donor and fundraiser for Clinton, should she decides to run for\npresident early next year.\n\n\n\nClinton and Katzenberg had a private meeting in Los Angeles in the spring\nof last year, and are said to be in touch.\n\n\n\nThe two have a long history. Katzenberg supported Bill Clinton in the \xe2\x80\x9990s.\nIn those years, he was close enough to the Clintons to lend them his\nvacation home and enjoy visits to the White House. But before the\nDemocratic primary in 2008, Katzenberg and his two business partners,\nexecutives David Geffen and Steven Spielberg, split from the Clintons to\nback Barack Obama, then a U.S. senator.\n\n\n\nNow, Katzenberg continues to play a strategic role in Priorities USA\nAction, the party\xe2\x80\x99s largest super PAC, where officials have said they are\nprepared to support Clinton early. He helped kick-start that group during\nthe 2012 election with a check for $2 million. The PAC went on to raise and\nspend $65 million for Obama.\n\n\n\nIn addition to Katzenberg, who made remarks at the fundraiser, the event\nwas co-hosted by Casey Wasserman, a major donor; Alan Horn, the Walt Disney\nStudios chairman; and, among others, Andy Spahn, Katzenberg\xe2\x80\x99s longtime\npolitical adviser.\n\n\n\nTickets for the event, which included a reception, photo line, and dinner,\nstarted at $32,400 per person, according to an invitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Hill: Dems: Pelosi isn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere\n<http://thehill.com/homenews/house/221486-democrats-say-pelosi-isnt-going-anywhere>*\n\n\n\nBy Mike Lillis\n\nOctober 22, 2014 6:00 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nHouse Democrats face long odds at the polls and are bracing for depleted\nnumbers next year, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they\xe2\x80\x99re giving up on House\nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) just yet.\n\n\n\nDemocrats on and off Capitol Hill expect Pelosi to remain as leader\nregardless of the outcome on Election Day.\n\n\n\nPelosi, true to form, has been elusive about her post-election intentions,\nsaying she\xe2\x80\x99s focused on Nov. 4 without thoughts beyond.\n\n\n\nBut Democratic lawmakers, aides and strategists predict the unusual\npolitical dynamics in the House \xe2\x80\x94 where the GOP\xe2\x80\x99s struggles to pass major\nlegislation has given the minority Democrats rare sway \xe2\x80\x94 combined with the\nprospect of a Hillary Clinton presidential run, will be enough to keep the\n74-year-old Pelosi in Washington at least through 2016.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she stays for sure, and there are two reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d said a former\nHouse lawmaker who worked alongside Pelosi for years.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne is the presidential cycle. \xe2\x80\xa6 It\xe2\x80\x99s very much a symbiotic proposition:\nHillary\xe2\x80\x99s chances and Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s longevity,\xe2\x80\x9d the Democrat said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe second\nreason [is] \xe2\x80\xa6 that nothing major is going to happen in the next two years\nwithout House Democratic votes, and it puts her in a position of leveraging\nthose votes to accomplish at least some of our agenda.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRetiring Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.) echoed that message, saying he\xe2\x80\x99s seen no\nindication the hard-charging Pelosi is ready to call it quits.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear the rumors, you know, that she\xe2\x80\x99ll prevail in this election easily\nbut then turn it over to her daughter. [But] she never told me that, and\nuntil she does I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any real reason to believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d Moran, a\n12-term congressman, said by phone. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we have to take Nancy at her\nword \xe2\x80\xa6 that she\xe2\x80\x99s committed to leading the Democratic caucus and electing a\nDemocratic president in 2016.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAsked about the Hillary Clinton factor, Moran didn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think Nancy would love to be the first female Democratic Speaker to\nserve under the first female Democratic president,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nPredicting Pelosi\xe2\x80\x99s future has become something of a biennial parlor game\ninside the Beltway \xe2\x80\x94 with good reason. The San Francisco liberal has led\nthe House Democrats since 2003, the longest stretch since the legendary\nRep. Sam Rayburn (D-Texas) died in office in 1961.\n\n\n\nIn a decade as leader, she became the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first female Speaker and\nhelped to enact some of the most significant, if contentious, laws in\ngenerations \xe2\x80\x94 including the Wall Street bailout under President George W.\nBush and healthcare reform under President Obama.\n\n\n\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s also emerged as among the most effective fundraisers, having pulled\nin more than $400 million for the Democrats since taking over as House\nleader, according to a tally kept by her office. It\xe2\x80\x99s a point that could\nalso play a significant role in her decision, Democrats say.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody can raise money like she can \xe2\x80\xa6 and she knows it, and she knows it\nmatters for the party, and she cares deeply about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said a former\nDemocratic leadership aide.\n\n\n\nPelosi surprised many political observers when she remained as leader\nfollowing the 2010 elections, when Democrats were whomped into the\nminority, losing 63 seats. She defied similar predictions after the 2012\ncycle, when she was said to be eyeing the door.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the chance to help the party and move forward into a presidential\nyear, I think the odds are that she stays,\xe2\x80\x9d the former aide said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she\nwas very close to choosing not to stay last cycle, and obviously, at some\npoint the desire to spend time with family and friends and not deal with\nthis stuff has gotta be strong, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFueling speculation about her intentions, several of her closest allies on\nCapitol Hill \xe2\x80\x94 including Reps. George Miller (D-Calif.), Henry Waxman\n(D-Calif.) and Moran \xe2\x80\x93 are retiring at the end of the year.\n\n\n\nPelosi\xe2\x80\x99s office is coy when asked about her next steps.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the Leader has said, she\xe2\x80\x99s not here on a shift, she\xe2\x80\x99s here on a\nmission,\xe2\x80\x9d said Drew Hammill, spokesman for Pelosi, Tuesday in a brief email.\n\n\n\nWith top election handicappers predicting that Speaker John Boehner\n(R-Ohio) and Republicans are poised to pick up at least a handful of seats\nnext month, few are predicting that Pelosi and the Democrats will have an\neasier time of it in the next Congress.\n\n\n\nStill, Boehner has struggled to manage his unruly conservative-leaning\nconference, particularly on major bills, such as funding to keep the\ngovernment open. In turn, that\xe2\x80\x99s created a unique environment where GOP\nleaders have relied on Pelosi and the Democrats to move top priority\nlegislation to the Senate. And the dynamic won\xe2\x80\x99t change next year,\nDemocrats say, even if the Republicans pick up their projected seats.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just don\xe2\x80\x99t think that the Republican caucus is all going to join hands\nsuddenly and sing Kumbaya,\xe2\x80\x9d Moran said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to be\ndivided ideologically \xe2\x80\xa6 so I think that Nancy will still have leverage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA Democratic leadership aide noted that the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 predicted gains \xe2\x80\x94\nsomewhere between five and 10 seats, by most counts \xe2\x80\x94 simply put them back\nwhere they were in the 112th Congress, when Boehner also struggled to pass\ncontroversial bills with only Republican votes.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly where he was and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t function then,\xe2\x80\x9d the aide said\nTuesday.\n\n\n\nBoehner\xe2\x80\x99s office declined to comment for this story.\n\n\n\nDemocrats all agree that Pelosi can keep her post as long as she wants it.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no chance of a challenge to her,\xe2\x80\x9d the aide said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is the\nDemocratic leader until she chooses to not be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nStill, her silence on the topic has also led to intrigue about what a\npost-Pelosi Democratic Party would look like. Rep. Steny Hoyer (Md.), the\nDemocratic whip who\xe2\x80\x99s been Pelosi\xe2\x80\x99s top lieutenant since challenging her\nunsuccessfully in 2002, is all but a shoe-in for leader if Pelosi were to\nstep down.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteny is heir apparent as long as he wants it,\xe2\x80\x9d Moran said.\n\n\n\nBut the shuffle for the No. 2 spot could be more interesting. Rep. James\nClyburn (D-S.C.), currently the third-ranking House Democrat and a close\nPelosi ally, could find himself challenged by one among a younger crop of\nup-and-coming leaders, including Reps. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.), Chris Van\nHollen (D-Md.), current Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\nChairman Steve Israel (N.Y.) and Democratic National Committee Chairwoman\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.).\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe real fight would then be for the No. 2 slot,\xe2\x80\x9d said the former\nlawmaker, who compared it to the bitter Pelosi vs. Hoyer contest of 12\nyears ago. \xe2\x80\x9cThat whip\xe2\x80\x99s race was really a proxy fight for the Speakership.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPelosi, meanwhile, has made it no mystery that she\xe2\x80\x99s rooting for Clinton to\ntake the White House in 2016.\n\n\n\nAppearing with the former secretary of State on Tuesday at a fundraiser in\nSan Francisco, Pelosi said Clinton would be \xe2\x80\x9cone of the best prepared\nleaders\xe2\x80\x9d ever to become president.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am frequently introduced as the highest-ranking woman in political\noffice in our country,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pelosi, who has made women\xe2\x80\x99s empowerment\nissues a central focus of the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 legislative agenda. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to\ngive up that title and elect a Democratic woman for president of the United\nStates.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Associated Press, via Minneapolis Star Tribune: Former President Clinton\ntalks jobs, health care in campaigning for Quinn, Durbin in Illinois\n<http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/279946252.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Sophia Tareen\n\nOctober 21, 2014 2:05 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nCHICAGO \xe2\x80\x94 Former President Bill Clinton became the latest high-profile\nDemocrat to back the re-election bids of Gov. Pat Quinn and U.S. Sen. Dick\nDurbin, saying Tuesday that the candidates focus on issues important to\nvoters, like jobs and health care.\n\n\n\n"I\'m here to support Dick Durbin and Pat Quinn because I think they\'re\nabout the future," Clinton told workers at Chicago-based manufacturing\ncompany Wheatland Tube. "What this election should be about is what your\nlives are about ... more jobs, higher incomes, better education and\ntraining, secure health care and stronger families and communities. ... The\nrest of it is all background music."\n\n\n\nQuinn is seeking a second full term, but faces a tough challenge from\nRepublican businessman Bruce Rauner as the venture capitalist tries to\nwrest away one of the last Democratic strongholds in the Midwest. The\ngubernatorial contest in President Barack Obama\'s home state is one of the\nmost competitive and expensive nationwide. Clinton\'s visit was preceded by\na Sunday rally headlined by Obama and fundraisers and events with first\nlady Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nRauner\'s campaign deemed the visits by Democrats "full rescue mode." Rauner\nwas expected to appear with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in Rockford on\nTuesday afternoon, part of a nationwide tour for Christie, who serves as\nthe head of the Republican Governors\' Association. Christie has been to\nIllinois for Rauner several times.\n\n\n\nDurbin, the Senate\'s No. 2 Democrat, is seeking a fourth term against\nRepublican dairy magnate and state Sen. Jim Oberweis.\n\n\n\nClinton reiterated themes that have been prominent in Quinn\'s re-election\nbid: That the Chicago Democrat took over and led Illinois at a time of\nethical and economic crisis. Quinn, a former lieutenant governor, assumed\noffice in 2009 in the wake of ex-Gov. Rod Blagojevich\'s corruption scandal.\n\n\n\nQuinn noted the drop in unemployment during his tenure. State figures\nshowed a September rate of 6.6 percent, compared to 9.1 percent a year\nearlier. Durbin also praised Quinn\'s jobs record.\n\n\n\nBut Rauner has said Illinois still lags behind other states and isn\'t\ngrowing or competitive.\n\n\n\nClinton told the enthusiastic crowd \xe2\x80\x94 including several state lawmakers \xe2\x80\x94\nthat Republicans elsewhere are "relentlessly attacking the president," and\nusing the midterm election as a referendum on his presidency. He said\nvoters shouldn\'t become pessimistic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Hill: How 2014 may shape Hillaryland\n<http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/221487-how-2014-may-shape-hillaryland>*\n\n\n\nBy Amie Parnes\n\nOctober 22, 2014 6:00 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nIf Democrats lose the Senate, the reverberations could be felt in a Hillary\nClinton presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nGuy Cecil, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign\nCommittee (DSCC), has long been seen as a favorite to manage Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nsecond bid for the presidency. But he\xe2\x80\x99s now in charge of keeping the Senate\nin Democratic hands, and a big loss could potentially boost other\nup-and-coming political operatives who want to lead the Hillary 2016 army.\n\n\n\nRobby Mook, who managed Terry McAuliffe\xe2\x80\x99s (Va.) gubernatorial campaign, and\nEMILY\xe2\x80\x99s List President Stephanie Schriock, are among the other names\nconsistently mentioned as possible leading candidates for the role.\n\n\n\nClinton allies insist Cecil won\xe2\x80\x99t be eliminated from consideration if\nDemocrats lose the Senate \xe2\x80\x94 no matter how devastating the loss. They point\nto Cecil\xe2\x80\x99s overall tenure at the DSCC as proof of his talent.\n\n\n\nIn addition, they note that the president\xe2\x80\x99s party typically loses seats in\nthe midterm elections of a second term \xe2\x80\x94 and that Cecil faces a\nparticularly difficult atmosphere in this campaign year. The party is\ndefending 23 seats this year compared to 10 for the GOP, and many of the\nDemocratic incumbents are in red states.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever happens, nobody is going to blame the staff at the DSCC,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nSteve Elmendorf, the Democratic strategist who served as deputy campaign\nmanager on John Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s 2004 presidential campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are fighting in a\nbunch of very hard states.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAt the same time, perceptions in politics matter and some allies say it\xe2\x80\x99s\nhard to fathom Hillary Clinton selecting someone who led the DSCC during\nwhat could be a grim cycle for Democrats.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether we love him or hate him, he will wear the victory or the loss,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid one Clinton ally, who worked on the 2008 campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no getting\naround that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nDuring the 2012 cycle, Cecil was credited with expanding the Democratic\nmajority in the upper chamber, even as political observers expected\nRepublicans to gain seats. And in 2010, he helped lead Sen. Michael\nBennet\xe2\x80\x99s (D-Colo.) underdog campaign to victory, even though Bennet had\nnever run for elected office.\n\n\n\nA fixture at expensive lunches and dinners for candidates across the\ncountry, Cecil is also known to be accessible to top donors, some\nfundraising insiders say.\n\n\n\nPerhaps more importantly, Cecil has a close working relationship with the\nClintons, who treasure two things in aides: Talent and loyalty.\n\n\n\nAnd Cecil has both, Clintonites say.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKey for her is a team that is tight and close,\xe2\x80\x9d one longtime Clinton\ninsider said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo personality counts for something along with ability.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFormer President Clinton has been known to call Cecil to check in on\nvarious races during the election cycle, and the two would strategize about\nwhich races most needed Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s help. And Cecil has seen Hillary Clinton\nin recent weeks as well, attending a fundraiser at her home in September\nand crossing paths with her on Monday night during an event for Senate\ncandidates hosted by Hollywood executive Jeffrey Katzenberg.\n\n\n\nHillaryland sources say Clinton still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made a decision about whether\nor not she will make another go at the White House and therefore is months\naway from selecting any potential campaign manager.\n\n\n\nBut they say she\xe2\x80\x99s learned a thing or two about the role of a campaign\nmanager from her last presidential bid.\n\n\n\nIn the middle of the hard-fought Democratic primary in 2008, Clinton had to\nfire her campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle after aides complained of an\narrogance at the top. She replaced Solis Doyle with Maggie Williams, a\nlongtime trusted political adviser, who was credited with helping to steer\nthe campaign ship back in the right direction.\n\n\n\nThe Clintons, together with longtime aides including Williams, Cheryl\nMills, Huma Abedin and Philippe Reines, undoubtedly will give their full\nattention to selecting a campaign manager \xe2\x80\x94 and to the optics behind it.\n\n\n\nEven if Democrats lose control of the Senate, Clinton loyalists seemed\nconfident that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt Cecil\xe2\x80\x99s standing. Much of it, several\nallies explained, is out of his control. And the Clintons, who have been\ncriss-crossing the country for Democrats in tight races, now have firsthand\nexperience and the context needed to know what this particular cycle is\nabout, they say.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of the day, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone can dispute that the DSCC, led\nby Guy, has done the best that they can, given the resources they have,\nespecially with Obama\xe2\x80\x99s low approval ratings,\xe2\x80\x9d one Clinton ally said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s only so much you can do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnother Clinton insider who labeled Cecil as \xe2\x80\x9chighly regarded\xe2\x80\x9d boiled it\ndown this way: \xe2\x80\x9cI personally don\xe2\x80\x99t think the midterm results would impact\ndecisions \xe2\x80\x94 it seems larger forces are at work, rendering results beyond\nthe capacity of any individual. \xe2\x80\xa6 And then there\xe2\x80\x99s the fact that sometimes\nyou learn more by losing than winning.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOf course, if the midterms go better than expected for Democrats on Nov. 4,\nCecil could see his stock rise.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we hold the Senate, he\xe2\x80\x99s a genius,\xe2\x80\x9d one Clinton ally said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be\nDavid Plouffe of the next cycle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sec.
