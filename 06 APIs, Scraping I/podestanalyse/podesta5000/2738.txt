As in past years, the faculty and deans will don chefs hats and serve our students a tasty night-time breakfast prepared by Bon Appetit.  Night Owl gives students a much-needed breather during exams.  It's also a great chance for them to chat with you in a casual setting.  Every year we hear from students - especially the first-years and LLMs - how much they appreciate connecting with you at this event.\n\nI hope you will take time out of your busy schedule to join us, whether to serve breakfast or just to socialize.\n\nIf you will participate, please RSVP to Beverly Sapp at bls35@law.georgetown.edu<mailto:bls35@law.georgetown.edu>.\n\nBest,\nMitch\n\nMitchell C. Bailin\nAssociate Vice President and Dean of Students\nGeorgetown University Law Center\n600 New Jersey Ave. NW\nWashington DC 20001\nTel. (202) 662-4066\nFax (202) 662-4067\n\n"
