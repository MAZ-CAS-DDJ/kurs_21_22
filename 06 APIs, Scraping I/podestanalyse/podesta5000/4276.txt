john.podesta@gmail.comb'Just wanted to follow-up on this original note.\n\nAs you may have seen, Ax tweeted this a short while ago: >..Smart of @HillaryClinton to be counseling with @benensonj.  He was brilliant, essential player in @BarackObama wins!\n\nHe called me last night to give us a heads up that O\'Malley and Webb have both asked to speak at his institute. We got into a conversation about his public comments. He assured me that he is 100 percent supportive of HRC and that she will be the nominee and understands that we might be frustrated with what he has said. I sense that he is disappointed that we have talked to everyone else in Obama world except for him and I assured him that HRC would be in touch soon. I think we are now in a good place with him but she needs to call him and I conveyed that to her. Will try to get it done this week.\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Philippe Reines [mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com]\nSent: Wednesday, December 17, 2014 10:35 PM\nTo: CDM; John Podesta; Robby Mook; Nick Merrill; Huma Abedin; Dan Schwerin; Jake Sullivan\nSubject: Axelrod\n\nWe had discussed the utility of reaching out to David Axelrod, but Is he on HRC\'s - or anyone\'s - call sheet?

"And what would the future look like under another President Clinton, and I suspect that\'s what she\'s taking her time working through now, but she has to answer that question."\n\nLiberal groups have been pushing forward with an effort to convince Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to challenge Clinton from the left on economic issues.\n\nMoveOn.org, one of the groups, announced Monday that it has passed 100,000 signatures on its "Run Warren Run" petition. Warren insists she is not running but always phrases the denial in the present tense, which some see as leaving the door open.\n\nAsked if there is an opening for Warren, Axelrod said, "I suppose there is."\n\n"My suspicion is that what she\'s doing is trying to influence how Hillary frames her candidacy and the issues she focuses on," Axelrod said. "I think Elizabeth is very sincere about her concerns about what\'s happening in the American economy, and Hillary hasn\'t yet said what exactly her program will be, what she\'s running on. I think Elizabeth knows she\'s got maximum leverage by still being in the conversation."\n\nMany of Axelrod\'s fellow Obama campaign alumni are now working for Clinton\'s campaign-in-waiting in some capacity. Jim Messina, Obama\'s 2012 campaign manager, for example, signed on as co-chairman of the pro-Clinton super-PAC Priorities USA.\n\nTwo more top campaign aides, Mitch Stewart and Jeremy Bird, have joined Ready for Hillary.\n\n'
