MMFA\nhighlighted a handful of things that Maureen Dowd deceitfully left out of\nher *New York Times *column, including the fact that "100 percent of the\nfees" Chelsea receives are "remitted directly to the foundation." See Media\nMatters For America\'s response below, and Dowd\'s unscrupulous column below\nthat.\n\n\n*Media Matters For America: NYT\'s Maureen Dowd: "There\'s Something\nUnseemly" About Chelsea Clinton Charity Speeches\n<http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/07/13/nyts-maureen-dowd-theres-something-unseemly-abo/200086>*\n\nBy Timothy Johnson\nJuly 13th, 2014\n\n*New York Times* columnist Maureen Dowd posited that there is "something\nunseemly" about recent reports Chelsea Clinton gives speeches that raise up\nto $75,000 per appearance for the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton\nFoundation.\n\nA July 9 article\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/10/us/politics/chelsea-clinton-follows-parents-lead-as-a-paid-speaker.html?ref=us&_r=0>\n in* The Times* discussed Clinton\'s foray into public speaking appearances\non behalf of the Clinton Foundation.*The Times *quoted a Clinton\nspokesperson who explained that "100 percent of the fees" Clinton receives\nare "remitted directly to the foundation," and that "the majority of\nChelsea\'s speeches are unpaid." According to *The Times*, "Ms. Clinton\'s\nspeeches focus on causes like eradicating waterborne diseases." (The\nClinton Foundation\'s website says its mission\n<http://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-presidential-center/about/bill-hillary-chelsea-clinton-foundation>\nis\n"to improve global health, strengthen economies, promote health and\nwellness, and protect the environment.")\n\nIn a July 13 column\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/opinion/sunday/maureen-dowd-isnt-it-rich.html?_r=0>,\nDowd took issue with Clinton\'s speaking arrangements, writing that the\nformer first daughter is "acting out in a sense now, joining her parents in\ncashing in to help feed the rapacious, gaping maw of Clinton Inc." Dowd\nalso suggested that Clinton\'s speaking fee means she has "open[ed] herself\nup to criticism that she is gobbling whopping paychecks not commensurate\nwith her skills, experience or role in life."\n\n"There\'s something unseemly about it," Dowd continued, "making one wonder:\nWhy on earth is she worth that much money? Why, given her dabbling in\nmanagement consulting, hedge-funding and coattail-riding, is an hour of her\ntime valued at an amount that most Americans her age don\'t make in a year?"\n\nDowd also criticized a series of speeches\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/07/04/hillary-clinton-says-she-donated-all-money-from-college-speeches/>\nHillary\nClinton is delivering at colleges and universities, writing, "Hillary\ndoesn\'t see the disconnect between expressing grave concern about mounting\nstudent loan debt while scarfing six-figure sums from at least eight\ncolleges, and counting. She says now that she\'s passing the university\nmoney to the foundation but, never Ms. Transparency, has refused to provide\ndocumentation of that."\n\nEven after paying Clinton\'s fee, which she has noted goes to the Clinton\nFoundation\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hillary-clinton-says-her-college-speaking-feeds-went-to-the-clinton-foundation/2014/07/04/d4234918-039f-11e4-b8ff-89afd3fad6bd_story.html>,\nthe University of Nevada, Las Vegas Foundation expects to profit\n<https://www.reviewjournal.com/politics/unlv-foundation-clinton-fee-pencils-out>\nfrom\nan upcoming Hillary Clinton speech. Dowd failed to mention that point, or\nthe fact that the evidence-free claim that Clinton has not been truthful\nabout the donation of the fees comes from America Rising PAC\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/clinton-foundation-disclosures-108631.html>,\na Republican-aligned\n<http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/02/america-rising-pac-relaunches-as-news-site-183542.html>\nopposition\nresearch outfit.\n\nDowd\'s criticisms of Chelsea and Hillary Clinton over speaking fees that\nare donated to a charitable foundation are largely in line with Dowd\'s take\non Hillary Clinton over the years.\n\nAccording to a June 18 *Media Matters\n<http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/06/18/the-numbers-behind-maureen-dowds-21-year-long-c/199752>*\n report\n<http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/06/18/the-numbers-behind-maureen-dowds-21-year-long-c/199752>,\n72 percent of 195 columns authored by Dowd about Hillary Clinton since\nNovember 1993 had a negative bent. Among the repetitious tropes used by\nDowd, she often accused Clinton of being an enemy to or betraying feminism\n(35 columns, 18 percent of those studied), power-hungry (51 columns, 26\npercent), unlikeable (9 columns, 5 percent), or phony (34 columns, 17\npercent).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*NYT: Maureen Dowd: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t It Rich?\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/opinion/sunday/maureen-dowd-isnt-it-rich.html>*\n\n\nBy Maureen Dowd\n\nJuly 12th, 2014\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 CHELSEA CLINTON never acted out during the eight years she\ncame of age as America\xe2\x80\x99s first daughter.\n\n\n\nNo ditching of her Secret Service detail. No fake IDs for underage\ntippling. No drug scandal. No court appearance in tank top and toe ring.\nNot even any dirty dancing.\n\n\n\nDespite a tough role as the go-between in the highly public and\nembarrassing marital contretemps of her parents, Chelsea stayed classy.\n\n\n\nSo it\xe2\x80\x99s strange to see her acting out in a sense now, joining her parents\nin cashing in to help feed the rapacious, gaping maw of Clinton Inc.\n\n\n\nWith her 1 percenter mother under fire for disingenuously calling herself\n\xe2\x80\x9cdead broke\xe2\x80\x9d when she left the White House, why would Chelsea want to open\nherself up to criticism that she is gobbling whopping paychecks not\ncommensurate with her skills, experience or role in life?\n\n\n\nAs the 34-year-old tries to wean some of the cronies from the Clinton\nFoundation \xe2\x80\x94 which is, like the Clintons themselves, well-intended,\nwasteful and disorganized \xe2\x80\x94 Chelsea is making speeches that go into\nfoundation coffers. She is commanding, as The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Amy Chozick reported,\nup to $75,000 per appearance.\n\n\n\nChozick wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cMs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s speeches focus on causes like eradicating\nwaterborne diseases. (\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m obsessed with diarrhea\xe2\x80\x99 is a favorite line.)\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s something unseemly about it, making one wonder: Why on earth is she\nworth that much money? Why, given her dabbling in management consulting,\nhedge-funding and coattail-riding, is an hour of her time valued at an\namount that most Americans her age don\xe2\x80\x99t make in a year? (Median household\nincome in the United States is $53,046.)\n\n\n\nIf she really wants to be altruistic, let her contribute the money to some\nindependent charity not designed to burnish the Clinton name as her mother\nramps up to return to the White House and as she herself drops a\nhandkerchief about getting into politics.\n\n\n\nOr let her speak for free. After all, she is in effect going to candidate\nschool. No need to get paid for it, too.\n\n\n\nThere was disgust over Politico\xe2\x80\x99s revelation that before she switched to a\nmonth-to-month contract, Chelsea was getting wildly overpaid at $600,000\nannually \xe2\x80\x94 or over $25,000 per minute on air \xe2\x80\x94 for a nepotistic job as a\nsoft-focus correspondent for NBC News.\n\n\n\nChelsea is still learning the answer to a question she asked when she\ninterviewed the Geico gecko: \xe2\x80\x9cIs there a downside to all this fame?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Clintons keep acting as though all they care about is selfless public\nservice. So why does it keep coming back to gross money grabs? It\xe2\x80\x99s gone\nfrom two-for-the-price-of-one to three-for-the-price-of-20.\n\n\n\nHillary\xe2\x80\x99s book \xe2\x80\x94 which feels like something she got at Ikea and had someone\nput together \xe2\x80\x94 is drooping because it was more about the estimated $13\nmillion advance and the campaign ramp-up than the sort of intriguing\nself-examination and political excavations found in the memoirs of Timothy\nGeithner and Bob Gates. If she had had something to say, the book might\nhave been shorter.\n\n\n\nHillary doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see the disconnect between expressing grave concern about\nmounting student loan debt while scarfing six-figure sums from at least\neight colleges, and counting. She says now that she\xe2\x80\x99s passing the\nuniversity money to the foundation but, never Ms. Transparency, has refused\nto provide documentation of that. (She\xe2\x80\x99s still pocketing other huge fees\nfor speeches like her April talk in Las Vegas to the Institute of Scrap\nRecycling Industries.)\n\n\n\nChozick estimated that the lucrative family speechmaking business has\ngenerated more than $100 million for the former president and first lady,\nwhose fees range from $200,000 to $700,000 per appearance. Bill alone\nearned $17 million last year doing what he likes to do best \xe2\x80\x94 talking.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe issue is that the philanthropic beneficiary of the speeches is a\nfoundation, structured as a public foundation but clearly synonymous with\nand controlled by the Clinton family,\xe2\x80\x9d Rick Cohen writes in The National\nPhilanthropy Quarterly, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cDonors and institutions that are paying\nthem and their daughter huge sums for their speeches may very well be\nbuying recognition and face time with powerful political leaders who they\nhope will be able to deliver political favors in the future.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is troubling when corporate donors give to political charities with a\nmore or less obvious expectation that softer and gentler treatment will\nensue in the future. It is also troubling when some of the payers are\npublic or nonprofit entities themselves such as colleges and universities,\nconverting taxpayer funds and tax-exempt donations into signals that could\nend up in positive treatment when these institutions are themselves seeking\naccess and favors, even if it is only a good word put in by one of the\nClintons to a federal agency providing funding or to a regulator who might\nbe taking a critical look at university tuitions and endowment payouts.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThe Clintons were fiercely protective of Chelsea when she was a teenager,\ninsisting on respect from the media and getting it. They need to protect\ntheir daughter again, this time from their wanton acquisitiveness.\n'
