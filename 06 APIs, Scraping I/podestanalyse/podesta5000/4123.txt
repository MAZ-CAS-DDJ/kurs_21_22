The idea would be to do \x93topical drills\x94 in the morning where we isolate 8 high priority topics (see attached) and run them over and over until we are all happy where they stand.  It would be incumbent on Bernie (Bob) and Martin (Jake) to try different approaches so we can test different HRC responses.\n\nWe would give  HRC an extended lunch break to study materials and for us to huddle on advice.  I would propose to give her the attached Cheat Sheet to study during lunch (perhaps updated based on tomorrow AM).\n\nIn the afternoon, we would run our usual mock.  The proposed questions are attached.\n\nLet Karen or I know if you have any objections or concerns!\n\nRon and Karen\n<Agenda-Mock-111215.docx>\n<HRC16-Debates-2ndDebate-RoadMap-1110-5pm.docx>\n"
