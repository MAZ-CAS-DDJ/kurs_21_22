But many Republicans and the special interests they serve have done nothing but stand in the way. They refuse to play a meaningful role in the debate to work towards consensus. The American people deserve better.\n\nIt's high time we work with President Obama to fix our broken system. It's within our power to do so, but only if we stand up to the insurance companies and their mouthpieces and make our voices heard.  \n\nClick here and sign my petition in support of a health care reconciliation vote. Tell the Republicans we won't let them stand in the way of the public option that millions of Americans need.\n\nhttp://www.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/825/petition.jsp?petition_KEY=251\n\nWe can no longer wait for the naysayers to come to the table. Our health care crisis demands action, and the best avenue left is to pass the public option through the Senate reconciliation process.  \n\nPresident Obama and Congress have been debating health care reform for more than a year and in that time our opponents have used every diversion and misrepresentation they could invent to block real health care reform. Since they refuse to be part of the solution, we must move forward without them.  \n\nClick here to sign my petition showing your support for a reconciliation vote and a public option that can compete with private health insurance and drive down health care costs for everyone.\n\nhttp://www.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/825/petition.jsp?petition_KEY=251\n\nIt's time we stopped protecting the bottom line for a few insurance companies at the expense of the financial security of millions of American families. By passing the public option, we can inject real competition into the market, increasing efficiency and lowering costs for seniors, families and small businesses while saving our government upwards of $25 billion.  \n\nIgnoring our health care crisis is simply not an option. If we don't act now, costs will continue to rise, and more American families will be just one illness away from financial ruin. \n\nJoin me in urging Congress to enact real reform and create a public option that can compete with private insurance companies.\n\nhttp://www.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/825/petition.jsp?petition_KEY=251\n\nAs always, I thank you for your support. Together, we can pass the public option and deliver the reform we have all worked so hard for.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nKirsten Gillibrand\n\nContribute.Join the Campaign.\n\n--\n\nPaid for by Gillibrand for Senate\n\nTo unsubscribe please click here\nhttp://www.democratsenators.org/o/44/unsubscribe.jsp?Email=Gavrie@annelewisllc.com&email_blast_KEY=12112&organization_KEY=44"
