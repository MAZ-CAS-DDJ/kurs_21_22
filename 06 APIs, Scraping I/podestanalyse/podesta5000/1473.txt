john.podesta@gmail.comb'Friend,\n\nWhen you\'re up against a billionaire who\'s willing to spend a fortune on baseless, disgusting attack ads, it\'s not enough to have the truth on your side.\n\nYou have to fight back with everything you\'ve got.\n\nThat\'s what we\'re facing right now: Bruce Rauner is launching a completely false attack on Governor Quinn, and we don\'t have much time to counter it.\n\nWill you chip in $5 or more today to make sure voters don\'t fall for Rauner\'s lies?\n\nhttps://www.quinnforillinois.com/fight-the-false-attacks\n\nIf you\'ve seen the ads, you know how low Rauner is willing to go.\n\nHe\'s falsely accusing the Governor of "secretly" releasing prisoners early, and he\'s trying to link the Governor to sexual assault and murder.\n\nHere\'s the truth: The very day Governor Quinn found out about the program in question, he took action and shut it down.\n\nThe Governor didn\'t create this problem -- he fixed it.\n\nRauner has a whole lot of money to convince voters otherwise, so it\'s up to us to spread the word about what really happened.\n\nDonate $5 or more right now to make sure Rauner doesn\'t get away with this appalling attack:\n\nhttps://www.quinnforillinois.com/fight-the-false-attacks\n\nThanks.\n\nBill\n\nBill Hyers\nSenior Strategist\nQuinn for Illinois\n\n\n\n\nContributions are not tax deductible.
