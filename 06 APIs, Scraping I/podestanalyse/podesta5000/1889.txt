Obama just readjusted Malaysia\'s tier on the human rights list in\norder to move TPP thru with Malaysia attached.  Trumka will likely be\nputting out a statement today blasting this.  I have heard that we will\nsoon be asked to weigh in given the Secretary\'s role at State and as a\nPresidential candidate.  Wanted to provide this heads up.

Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) effectively bars the\nU.S. from enacting trade deals with countries deemed "Tier 3" violators of\nhuman trafficking standards -- the worst of the worst in the State\nDepartment\'s formal reckoning of governments that facilitate modern-day\nslavery.\n\nMalaysia earned its spot on that list, alongside Iran and North Korea,\n<http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/226844.pdf> from years of\nhuman trafficking, including rampant sex slavery\n<http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/226847.pdf> and forced labor\nin the agriculture and the textile industries, according to 2014 State\nDepartment documents. Malaysia\'s electronics industry also is rife with forced\nlabor\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/02/obama-trade-malaysia_n_7495750.html>.\nThis year, mass graves\n<http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/25/malaysia-migrant-mass-graves-police-reveal-139-sites-some-with-multiple-corpsesl>\n for trafficking victims were discovered in Malaysia near its northern\nborder with Thailand.\n\nReuters reports that Malaysia will soon be upgraded to a "Tier 2" country,\nallowing it to sidestep the ban imposed by the Menendez legislation. The\nState Department said it does not comment on its human trafficking list\nbefore it is formally issued. In a statement to HuffPost, Menendez said the\nmaneuver would undermine the international legitimacy of America\'s human\nrights efforts.\n\n"If true, this manipulation of Malaysia\xe2\x80\x99s ranking in the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s\n2015 TIP report would be a perversion of the trafficking list and undermine\nboth the integrity of this important report as well as the very difficult\ntask of confronting states about human trafficking," Menendez said in the\nstatement. "The deplorable human trafficking crisis in Malaysia merits a\nglobal cry for action and justice -- not an attempt to sweep them under the\nrug for political expediency."\n\nMalaysia passed a law\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/18/malaysia-human-trafficking_n_7616702.html>\n in June amid international controversy over its human trafficking record\nthat would provide additional protections for victims. Human trafficking\nhas long been illegal in Malaysia, however. The country\'s critics --\nincluding the State Department -- have not focused on its legal standards,\nbut on its willingness to enforce those standards.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has persistently\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/19/human-trafficking-tpp_n_7323044.html>\n criticized Obama administration efforts to undermine the Menendez language.\n\nMalaysia partially controls the Strait of Malacca\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/30/malaysia-slavery-trade_n_7472682.html>,\na key shipping lane for Middle Eastern oil bound for China. The Obama\nadministration has repeatedly argued that its Trans-Pacific Partnership\ntrade pact is designed to contain China\'s growing economic clout.\n'
