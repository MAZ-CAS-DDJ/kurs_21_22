Though somewhat relieved for him and his family as it seemed to be quite a tough road these last couple of years. \n\nDo you know if there will be a service?  I want to go if I can. \n\nThinking of you. And I miss you!  Though you are always in the news so it's almost almost like having you around tho not quite. Would love to see you. \n\nXd\n\nSent from my iPad"
