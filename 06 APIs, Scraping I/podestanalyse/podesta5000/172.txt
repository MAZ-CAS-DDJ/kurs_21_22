Anthony Weiner.\r\nTwo officers from the New Castle County Police Department arrived at the girl\'s home around 4:30 p.m. and asked to speak with the girl\'s mother about the daughter\'s contact with Weiner. Another officer appeared at the home a short time later. A FoxNews.com reporter was at the home when the police arrived.\r\nThe girl, whose name is being withheld because she is a minor, told FoxNews.com, "I\'m doing OK."\r\nThe police left the home after about 30 minutes, followed by the daughter and mother, who left in a separate car. It was not clear if the mother and daughter were going to continue the conversation with police at another location.\r\nSources close the student said the girl followed Weiner on Twitter after seeing him speak during a school trip to Washington on April 1. Weiner, after signing on to follow the girl\'s Twitter feed, direct-messaged the girl on April 13, the sources said, though it is not clear what other communication the two may have had between or after those dates.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead more: http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/06/10/exclusive-weiners-messages-to-teenage-girl-in-delaware-draw-police-attention/#ixzz1Ouk9EaSv\r\n'
