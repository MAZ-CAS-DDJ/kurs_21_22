john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John,\n\nThis week I received a job offer, and my contact at OPP mentioned that you\nhad recommended me. I can\x92t say how appreciative I am. More than that I\x92m\npersonally honored that you would consider me adequate to recommend, because\nthere are few people who I admire as much as you. I\x92ve sent a proper thank\nyou letter to your office.\n\nI need to decide on the offer by Friday, and was hoping to get a little bit\nof advice.  Your assistant told me that you are traveling, so I thought I\x92d\nreach out with an email even though I don\x92t expect that you will have the\nchance to read it.\n\nThe Schedule C position I was offered is technically Special Assistant to\nthe PDUSDP James Miller, however I would actually be on full time rotation\nfor at least a year to DAS Ochmanek\x92s Force Resources office, in order to\nwork on the Quadrennial Defense Review and the Guidance to Development of\nForce.\n\nMy primary long term policy interests are intelligence reform, and WMD.\nAlthough not in line with my primary interests,  I would be part of the\neducational and impactful QDR process, and would get some policy experience.\nAt the same time I would not have the high level optic that some SA\npositions offer.  I have competing offers from CIA and a contractor, and I\nwould be deferring a Master\x92s program for one year if I take this job. I was\nunable to find a job that would allow me to directly start working on\ncollection oversight and reform or on WMD. A dream job would be in the\noffice of DCIA, or on a commission similar to the Iraq WMD Commission.\n\nI have asked several knowledgeable people for advice and some say \x93You\x92d be\ncrazy to turn down any Series C appointment!\x94 Which sounds true to me! But\nothers say \x93Take the job only if you want to work on the QDR above your\nother options.\x94  Still others say \x93Take the job if you want to spend several\nyears climbing up the defense policy ladder, but not if you plan to go to\nMIT or switch to intelligence after a year.\x94\n\nSorry this email is so long! On the off chance that you do read it and have\nany feedback, however brief, I\x92m certain it would be instrumental in my\ndecision.\n\nThank you again for your guidance, help, and your faith in me!\n\nSincerely,\nJordanna Polis Schutz\n\nc: 857 222 5656\n'
