Sheila Jackson Lee\n\nJuly 24, 2014 3:10 pm\n\n\n\nAs a Senior Member on both the Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees\nand the Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security,\nI have worked diligently on human trafficking issues and seen its\ndevastating impact in the city of Houston, which is known as the epicenter\nof human trafficking.\n\n\n\nHuman trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery where men, women, and\nchildren are forced into servitude. Some victims are trafficked for sex;\nsome are trafficked for domestic labor. All are held against their will.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard for many in the United States to fully comprehend that this goes\non within our borders and on our streets. But it does, and it breaks my\nheart.\n\n\n\nDid you know that there are more individuals enslaved today than at the\nheight of the transatlantic slave trade?\n\n\n\nEven more surprising, human trafficking doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just occur in illegal or\nunderground operations. Victims of this horrible practice can also be found\nworking in private homes, hotels, nail salons, restaurants, and bars.\n\n\n\nIn Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s new book \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices,\xe2\x80\x9d she so adeptly reminds us,\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe crime of human trafficking is not limited to Cambodia or Southeast\nAsia. Nearly 30 million people around the world are in modern-day slavery\nof one form or another, trapped in prostitution or laboring in fields or\nfactories or on fishing boats.\xe2\x80\x9d She continues, \xe2\x80\x9cThe United States is not\nimmune.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton has been engaged in this issue since the 1990s, she\nplayed a key role at the State Department in bringing modern-day slavery to\nthe forefront of United States\xe2\x80\x99 foreign and domestic policy.\n\n\n\nAs Sec. Clinton herself wrote in 2009, \xe2\x80\x9cThe United States funds 140\nanti-trafficking programs in nearly 70 countries, as well as 42 domestic\ntask forces that bring state and local authorities together with\nnongovernmental organizations to combat trafficking. But there is so much\nmore to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHaving the privilege to serve on the two jurisdictional committees, I am\nthankful for the steps Hillary Clinton took while Secretary of State.\nPresently and looking forward, I want to work with more leaders who will\ndraw attention to this horrific practice and take action to eradicate it by\nworking with members of the faith community, law enforcement officials, and\ncommunity leaders. We must rescue victims, strengthen our justice system,\nand bring criminals to justice.\n\n\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s all take Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s lead, for, as she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a\nmoment for people to ask themselves not just what government can do to end\nmodern slavery, but what can I do, what can we do together.\xe2\x80\x9d We can save\nlives. We can change history.\n\n\n\nSheila Jackson Lee is the representative for the 18th Congressional\nDistrict of Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Washington Examiner: Clinton, Clinton, Clinton!

The book\'s first\nprinting of 1 million copies showed that her publisher expected a good\nreturn on its $14 million advance, especially since Clinton\'s book tour\nwould receive the kind of blanket coverage accorded a prospective\npresidential candidate.\n\nBut sales of the book have been disappointing, with only about 200,000 hard\ncopies having sold so far. And while Clinton has received extensive media\nattention, much of it has focused on her missteps, notably her assertion\nthat she and her husband Bill were \xe2\x80\x9cdead broke\xe2\x80\x9d when they left the White\nHouse in January 2001.\n\nStill, Clinton has become the most valuable name in the publishing industry\nthis summer, although only in part because of her own memoir. She and\nformer President Clinton have also inspired three other heavily promoted\nbooks, all by right-leaning authors: Blood Feud: The Clintons vs. The\nObamas by Ed Klein; Clinton, Inc.: The Audacious Rebuilding of a Political\nMachine by Daniel Halper; and The First Family Detail: Secret Service\nAgents Reveal the Hidden Lives of Presidents by Ronald Kessler, parts of\nwhich have been leaked ahead of its Aug. 5 release.\n\nKlein\xe2\x80\x99s Blood Feud, in spite of its many dubious claims and some outright\nfact errors, surpassed Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s memoir recently to become the No. 1 New\nYork Times bestselling nonfiction work. Even after it fell a few spots this\nweek, it still outsold Hard Choices.\n\n"I\'ve been amazed at what a cottage industry it is,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said of books\nabout her. She made her observation during a recent appearance on \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nDaily Show\xe2\x80\x9d with Jon Stewart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother book?\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill marveled to the New York\nPost when asked about Kessler\xe2\x80\x99s work.\n\nMerrill and other Clinton allies are navigating familiar territory. In the\nsummer of 2007, Clinton faced the publication of three major books about\nher alone or in combination with her husband: A Woman in Charge: The Life\nof Hillary Rodham Clinton by Carl Bernstein, Her Way: The Hopes and\nAmbitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr. and\nFor Love of Politics: Inside the Clinton White House by Sally Bedell Smith.\n\nIn 2007, Clinton\'s team tried to dismiss the books and their revelations as\nnothing new. "Is it possible to be quoted yawning?" her spokesperson\nPhilippe Reines said at the time. But all three books became bestsellers.\n\nThis time, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s allies are working to discredit Halper\xe2\x80\x99s and Kessler\xe2\x80\x99s\nbooks in a more aggressive fashion, as they have with Klein\xe2\x80\x99s, dismissing\ntheir authors as \xe2\x80\x9cdespicable\xe2\x80\x9d and agenda-driven.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Klein, Halper and Kessler, we now have a Hat Trick of despicable\nactors concocting trashy nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d Merrill charged in an interview with\ntheWashington Examiner. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir behavior should neither be allowed nor\nenabled, and legitimate media outlets who know with every fiber of their\nbeings that it is completely made up should not get down in the gutter with\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHalper speculated in a recent Politico Magazine column that other\ncounter-offensives have been launched behind the scenes, including a leak\nof his book in its entirety to hundreds of journalists. (Clinton\'s office,\nfor its part, has denied any involvement.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy might they leak the book early?\xe2\x80\x9d Halper wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cThe best explanation\nis so that the book\xe2\x80\x99s contents could come out well before publication and\nthe Clintons can then rely on another standard mode of operation \xe2\x80\x94\ndenouncing any unfavorable allegations as \xe2\x80\x98old news.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s allies insist that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t losing sleep over the new\nbooks. If they\xe2\x80\x99re looking to sully Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s reputation, said Adrienne\nElrod, communications director at Correct The Record, a pro-Clinton group,\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe right-wing\xe2\x80\x99s tactics are ineffective and are not working."\n\n"The anti-Clinton literature industry has been pushing lies and profiting\noff the Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s for well over two decades,\xe2\x80\x9d Elrod said, \xe2\x80\x9cyet Bill and\nHillary Clinton remain two of the most popular, admired individuals\nthroughout the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*New York Times blog: The Caucus: \xe2\x80\x9c10 Questions for Hillary Rodham Clinton\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/24/10-questions-for-hillary-rodham-clinton/?_php=true&_type=blogs&smid=tw-thecaucus&_r=0>*\n\n\n\nBy John Harwood\n\nJuly 24, 2014, 4:26 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nAs she ponders a second bid for the presidency in 2016, former Secretary of\nState Hillary Rodham Clinton continues a string of media appearance\npromoting her foreign policy memoir, \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke Thursday with\nThe Times\xe2\x80\x99s John Harwood on the National Public Radio program \xe2\x80\x9cOn Point\xe2\x80\x9d\nabout America\xe2\x80\x99s current foreign policy crises, potential presidential\nrivals and her relationship with the press.\n\n\n\nWhat follows is a condensed, edited transcript of their conversation.\n\n\n\nQ.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99d like to start with simply the range of problems facing us in the world:\nSyria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Gaza. I\xe2\x80\x99m well aware of the propensity\nfor an out-party to look at events like that and say the party in the White\nHouse is to blame for all of it. The party in the White House says, \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\nwe can\xe2\x80\x99t control events in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d But how much responsibility should\nthe Obama administration accept, and should you accept, having run foreign\npolicy for four years, for the chaos that we see right now?\n\n\n\nA.\n\nWell, John, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I wrote this book, \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices.\xe2\x80\x9d One of the main\npoints I make in the book is that we are living in a much more complex,\nfast moving world for many reasons. Obviously the end of the bipolar world\nwith the collapse of the Soviet Union, which I think we\xe2\x80\x99re still trying to\nadjust to and manage, the increase in nonstate actors, terrorist groups\nfirst and foremost, but also other players, for good and for bad. The rise\nof technology, which has been overall a real positive, but which has\nempowered all kinds of people and groups.\n\n\n\nIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do us much good to point fingers at each other. What we should\nbe trying to do is re-establish a bipartisan consensus on foreign policy\nthat requires America to demonstrate leadership, to be deeply involved in\ntrying to do what we can to manage these crises. I negotiated the last\ncease-fire in Gaza November 2012. It lasted until this month. I fully\nsupport Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to try to end the violence once again.\nBut look at what happened in just two years. You had Hamas getting access\nto much more technologically sophisticated missiles, to launch at Israel.\nYou had the very serious problem of the tunnels. You had a change in\nleadership in Egypt that we certainly had nothing to do with, the overthrow\nof the Muslim Brotherhood president, Morsi. So you constantly have to be\nevaluating, where can we make a difference? But the one big lesson that I\nhope Americans are taking from this is when we back off, or step away, that\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t bode well for either managing or resolving a lot of these disputes.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ.\n\nFor Americans who are looking and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, do we want the party\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s controlling foreign policy now, or do we want to make a different\nchoice when we move forward in elections,\xe2\x80\x9d are you saying to them, \xe2\x80\x9cThese\nproblems are not to any degree our fault or my fault?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA.\n\nWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that every administration, every party in the White House,\nhas the responsibility during the time it\xe2\x80\x99s there to do the best we can, to\nlead and manage the many problems we face, and I think we did in the first\nterm.\n\n\n\nIf you look at what we accomplished, number one, restoring American\nleadership and reputation after inheriting two wars, Guant\xc3\xa1namo, Abu Ghraib\nand a collapsed economic system, I think that President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s leadership\nand those of us who were his partners did a great deal to move us forward\nin the right direction. The pivot to Asia was necessary because many of our\nAsian friends and partners thought the United States had basically walked\naway from being a presence in the Pacific. I brought about three\nface-to-face meetings between Netanyahu and Abbas in an effort to continue\nto push for a two-state solution. The United States can help facilitate,\nbut not dictate to other people what they should be doing for their own\nself-interest.\n\n\n\nBut we never stopped working, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the headlines,\nJohn, it\xe2\x80\x99s what I call the trend lines. Not only re-establish our\nreputation and our leadership, but beginning to do more to try to improve\nconditions around the world that affect women and girls. That\xe2\x80\x99s not just a\nnice thing to do, that\xe2\x80\x99s very integrated into our foreign policy objective,\nbecause where women are treated fairly and equally you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to see\nmore stability, more democracy, less insecurity and terrorism. I think\nthere was an enormous amount accomplished in four years.\n\n\n\nQ.\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s talk about Russia for a second. There is a line of criticism that the\npresident\xe2\x80\x99s reset didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, that he was played by Vladimir Putin. You\npoint out in your book, of course, that when George W. Bush with a doctrine\nof preventive war was president, Russia seized parts of Georgia. You say in\nthe book that America can\xe2\x80\x99t solve everything, but nothing can be solved\nwithout America; we\xe2\x80\x99re the indispensable nation. If neither approach \xe2\x80\x94 the\nBush administration\xe2\x80\x99s or the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 worked with Putin,\nwhat exactly are we indispensable for?\n\n\n\nA.\n\nWell, I would take issue with the way you characterize that, because what I\nthink I demonstrate in the book is that the reset worked. It was an effort\nto try to obtain Russian cooperation on some key objectives while Medvedev\nwas president. Of course Putin still pulled the strings but he gave\nMedvedev a certain amount of independence to negotiate, number one, a new\narms control treaty, which was absolutely necessary. We brought Russia\naround to understanding why we thought there needed to be international\nsanctions against Iran.\n\n\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget the meeting that we had, the president and I and just one\nother person on our side and Medvedev and two on his side, where we told\nhim that we had evidence, conclusive evidence, about Iran building an\nunderground facility. And the Russians were shocked because they thought\nthey knew what was going on in Iran. So we brought them to the table, at\nthe Security Council, we got those tough sanctions, and we were eventually\nable to get to the negotiations that are going on now with the hope that\nsomething real can come out of them. We got support from the Russians to go\nacross Russia, to resupply our troops in Afghanistan. The reset was a\ndevice to try to refocus attention on the transactional efforts that we\nneeded to get done with the Russians.\n\n\n\nNow, when Putin announced in the fall of 2011 that he was coming back, I\nhad no illusions. I wrote two memos to the president pointing out that we\nwere going to have to change our thinking and approach. We\xe2\x80\x99d gotten all we\ncould get from the reset. The reset succeeded, but we had to make\nadjustments, given the fact that Putin was going to resume both the real\nposition of presidency and begin, I thought and argued, to be more\naggressive in his foreign policy.\n\n\n\nQ.\n\nLet me go back to Gaza for a second. Are you pleased that the F.A.A.\nreversed its decision after complaints from Mike Bloomberg and Prime\nMinister Netanyahu and allowed U.S. flights back into Tel Aviv even though\nmany European countries have not?\n\n\n\nA.\n\nWell, a number of Europeans have reversed their policy as well. Look, I\nthink it needs to be based on the best understanding of the circumstances\nand I think that the F.A.A. received additional information about steps\nthat Israel has taken. From my understanding, with the reversal here and\nthen the reversal in a number of European nations, they were basically\nsending a message out to passengers that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep a close watch\non this and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be aware of potential changes in plans as we go\nforward.\n\n\n\nQ.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a Methodist, as you are. You say in your book that you were inspired to\ngo into public service by the Methodist faith \xe2\x80\x94 do as much good as you can\nfor as long as you can. The United Methodist Church yesterday signed a\nletter with other religious organizations saying the underlying cause of\nthe resumption of violence after repeated cease-fires is what they call the\n\xe2\x80\x9clegal, structural, physical violence inherent in Israel\xe2\x80\x99s siege of Gaza\nand the West Bank.\xe2\x80\x9d Do they have a point? Are they right?\n\n\n\nA.\n\nWell I\xe2\x80\x99m very proud to be a Methodist too, John, and very grateful for my\nlifetime involvement in the church. Of course they have a point. There are\nalways arguments that can be made that have merit to them. But I think that\nparticular analysis right now misses what I believe to be the central\nreason why this conflict has once again flared up, and that is the desire\nby Hamas to assert itself since it feels it\xe2\x80\x99s got its back to the wall. It\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t really have very many friends left in the region \xe2\x80\x94 thrown out of\nDamascus by Assad, basically losing their relationship in Cairo.\n\n\n\nI think they\xe2\x80\x99re doing it both out of a calculation that they can engender\nmore sympathy and support for their cause, but also to put Israel on the\nback heel. And I have no doubt it was a deliberate provocation. Now, I do\nthink if we can get to another cease-fire \xe2\x80\x94 which I think is going to be\ndifficult because Hamas wants to hold out for all kinds of substantive\nnegotiations, which will be very difficult to negotiate and agree upon in\nthe kind of time pressure that a cease-fire requires \xe2\x80\x94 then issues like\ngreater access to Gaza or food and another materials can certainly be taken\ninto account. But I think in this particular case, I think the\nresponsibility falls on Hamas. I think they knew exactly what they were\ndoing, which was to try to put Israel in this position and try to engender\nsome sympathy because they don\xe2\x80\x99t really have support very much anymore.\n\n\n\nQ.\n\nAnother thing you say in the book when you\xe2\x80\x99re describing your role as\nsecretary of state: It includes the policy element, but it also involves\nbeing the C.E.O. of the big, vast State Department apparatus. Every four\nyears when people run for president, governors say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to elect a\ngovernor because we\xe2\x80\x99ve run things, we know how to manage.\xe2\x80\x9d Are part of the\nproblems we\xe2\x80\x99re now seeing in the Obama administration, both in foreign\npolicy and domestically, a function of the fact that their leading figures,\nPresident Obama, Joe Biden, you as secretary of state, were legislators who\ncame out of the Senate and not people who had run things before?\n\n\n\nA.\n\nOh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t expect me to agree with that, do you? Look, I think it\ndepends on the individual. I had serious disagreements with George Bush and\nhe was a two-term governor.\n\n\n\nQ.\n\nBut is there a management deficit in this administration?\n\n\n\nA.\n\nI think there is a political deficit in Washington because of gridlock and\nopposition to the president that started the first day he went into office.\nAnd I find that so regrettable. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sound naive or\nPollyanna-ish about it, but I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got two big crises in our country.\n\n\n\nOne of them is the economic crisis, which we all know has just dramatically\nincreased inequality and stagnated middle-class incomes and outcomes. But\nwe also have a political crisis. Our democracy is not working and I do not\nsee how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to resolve a lot of our issues. If you look at the\nreforms our president has put forward time and time again that would make\nthe government more manageable, move it into the 21st century, they\xe2\x80\x99re just\nmet by a solid wall of resistance.\n\n\n\nQ.\n\nA couple of things before we run out of time. Paul Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s out with a plan\ntoday proposing that states be allowed to take all of the programs for\nthose in need in one revenue stream as a way of finding better ways to make\nthem work. Is that a good idea?\n\n\n\nA.\n\nNo, not in the current atmosphere. It is not a good idea. All one has to\nlook at is that nearly half the states refuse to expand Medicaid to realize\nwhy it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad idea. If states won\xe2\x80\x99t even take what are very generous terms\nfrom the federal government to give working people and poor people access\nto health care, how can we turn over all of the resources that are meant to\nassist those in need?\n\n\n\nQ.\n\nJeb Bush, former governor of Florida, is out with an op-ed calling for\ncomprehensive immigration reform as you do, but saying that the law his\nbrother signed, which passed when you were in the Senate in 2008, ought to\nbe changed to make it easier to send those other than the \xe2\x80\x9cdeserving few\xe2\x80\x9d\nback to their home countries in Central America. Should that law be changed?\n\n\n\nA.\n\nI think it should be looked at as part of an overall package. We have two\ncategories of people that are represented by these poor children that have\ncome across our border. We have migrants, children who are leaving for a\nvariety of reasons \xe2\x80\x94 economic, they want to reunite with family members.\nAnd we have refugees, people who have reason to be threatened, people who\nhave bad probabilities if they return home as to what might happen to them.\n\n\n\nSo we do need more resources very quickly deployed, which is what the\npresident and the Democrats have asked for. We need some flexibility within\nthe laws. Our laws right now are not particularly well-suited for making\nthe kind of determinations that are required, and that we should, as\nAmericans, want to see happen.\n\n\n\nQ.\n\nLast question. It\xe2\x80\x99s about you and the press. Jill Abramson, my long-time\nboss and friend, said recently \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton has terribly unrealistic\nexpectations for journalists.\xe2\x80\x9d And my question for you is, have you been so\nscalded by your past interactions that it makes it difficult for you to\ncommunicate in the way that you would need to as a presidential candidate\nor otherwise?\n\n\n\nA.\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. I think maybe one of the points Jill was making is that I\ndo sometimes expect more than perhaps I should. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to work on my\nexpectations. But I had an excellent relationship with the State Department\npress that followed me for four years and I enjoyed working with them.\nWhatever I do in the future, I look forward to having the same kind of\nopportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Politico Magazine: \xe2\x80\x9cDid Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s Book Tour Work?\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/07/did-hillarys-book-tour-work-109358.html#.U9I8JvldV8E>*\n\n\n\n[No Writer Mentioned]\n\nJuly 24, 2014\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] Top Democratic and Republican strategists weigh in.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s book tour is winding down, so it\xe2\x80\x99s time to assess what\nthe Hard Choices rollout means for what just about everyone in American\npolitics assumes is her coming presidential bid.\n\n\n\nThus far, the former secretary of state has made a few blunders\xe2\x80\x94her comment\nabout being \xe2\x80\x9cdead broke\xe2\x80\x9d after leaving the White House, for instance, tied\nher in knots for days\xe2\x80\x94and invited fresh scrutiny toward her very well\ncompensated speeches (since leaving Foggy Bottom, she\xe2\x80\x99s pulled down an\nestimated $12 million). Her book itself, though lauded by some, has also\nbeen panned by critics as a cautious, colorless account of her time as\nsecretary of state. If Hillary Clinton is headed for a coronation, the\nchattering class hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten the invitation.\n\n\n\nSo we asked a panel of top strategists and analysts in both parties: What,\nif anything, does Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2014 book tour teach us about 2016? From Karen\nHughes to Newt Gingrich, Joel Benenson to Anita Dunn, here\'s what they told\nus.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nKaren Hughes\n\nRepublican strategist and former George W. Bush adviser\n\n\n\nThe 2014 book tour made me think a 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential race\nwould feel like a replay of the Bob Dole campaign, only two decades later.\nShe seemed defensive and cautious, with not much new to say. Her husband\nhad inspired us with the \xe2\x80\x9cbridge to the 21st century,\xe2\x80\x9d but it seemed as if\nshe was stuck on the wrong side of it. And her \xe2\x80\x9cdead broke\xe2\x80\x9d comment was\nrevealing because it shows she still feels put upon despite the many\nadvantages she has.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nAnne-Marie Slaughter\n\nPresident of the New America Foundation and former State Department official\n\n\n\nHaving taught a course that featured secretary of state memoirs from\nAcheson to Albright (paired with some international relations theory for\nballast), I can attest that it is a rather specialized genre. Secretary\nClinton followed in the footsteps of Albright\xe2\x80\x99s Madame Secretary, which was\nthe first such memoir to mix the high politics of foreign policy\nbrinkmanship with personal anecdotes (how and when she got her hair done)\nthat would make the business of the State Department more accessible and\nenjoyable for lay readers. Clinton similarly combines some genuinely new\nideas about how to conduct foreign policy in a world of digital\ncommunication and mass politics with personal stories about other world\nleaders (Aung San Suu Kyi, Angela Merkel) and her own life (preparing for\nChelsea\xe2\x80\x99s wedding). From my perspective, the chief lesson of the 2014 tour\nfor 2016 is that it is very hard to write a book about being secretary of\nstate for a press audience that is primarily interested in whether you will\nbe president.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nMark McKinnon\n\nFormer media adviser to George W. Bush and co-cofounder of No Labels\n\n\n\nThe one thing that is absolute about Hillary Clinton is that when it comes\nto the press, she\xe2\x80\x99s damned if she does, and she\xe2\x80\x99s damned if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nBefore the book tour she was being criticized for being too cloistered, and\nnot opening herself up in public and not being available to the press. Now\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s being criticized for being too spontaneous, too off the leash and too\nexposed.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, I think it hardly matters. I think just given the\nphysics, there was a real need for her to get out of the bubble. She did.\nTook a few hits. But she also relieved a lot of pressure that had been\nbuilding to be more public, answered a bunch of questions and still looks\nlike the Ferrari of the field.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nJoel Benenson\n\nDemocratic pollster\n\n\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that a single voter will care at all about Secretary\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s book tour or the media coverage of it. Elections\xe2\x80\x94especially\npresidential elections\xe2\x80\x94are about big things that are going on in people\xe2\x80\x99s\nlives at that time. and should Hillary Clinton decide to run, her success,\nlike any other candidate, will hinge solely on how strongly she makes that\nconnection.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nNewt Gingrich\n\nFormer speaker of the House and presidential candidate\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s book tour was a grim reminder of what happened during the\n2008 presidential campaign. She is very smart and very hard-working. She\nwould have been a very powerful senator if she had stayed. She seems to\nfind it very hard to find the rhythm of public media at a national level.\nHer performance did no damage among Democratic loyalists, but for\nindependents it raised dismaying questions about how out of touch she is\nwith reality. For Republicans, it was a wonderful comedy break from the\npain of the Obama presidency.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nDouglas E. Schoen\n\nDemocratic political consultant and former pollster for President Bill\nClinton\n\n\n\nThe book tour underscores in fine relief the challenges facing a\nprospective Hillary Clinton candidacy for president in 2016. As in 2008,\nthere is a compelling need for former Secretary Clinton to develop an\noverarching message of change and inclusion\xe2\x80\x94something the book tour\nsuggests quite compellingly is still very much a work in progress.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nWilliam Kristol\n\nEditor of the Weekly Standard\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s book tour should have emboldened any Democrat who\xe2\x80\x99s ever\ntoyed with the idea of running in 2016 to get to work organizing his or her\ncampaign. Hillary has sold many fewer books than expected. If she runs,\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll win many fewer delegates than expected.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nAnita Dunn\n\nSenior partner at SKDKnickerbocker and former Barack Obama adviser\n\n\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been amused by the many \xe2\x80\x9clessons\xe2\x80\x9d being drawn about 2016 out of a 2014\nbook tour, because the one lesson the press and political establishment\nnever seem to learn is what is important to voters and what isn\xe2\x80\x99t. A book\ntour in 2014 teaches us very little about a presidential campaign in 2016,\nparticularly because the book was a memoir as opposed to being the classic\n\xe2\x80\x9cpresidential campaign book\xe2\x80\x9d filled with policy proposals for the future.\nShould Secretary Clinton decide to run for the presidency, voters are going\npay a lot more attention to the vision she outlines for the future as a\ncandidate than to what happened in the spring of 2014 when she was talking\nabout her book, and they will have a lot of questions for her. Their\nquestions will be tough and pointed across a number of issues. How\nSecretary Clinton answers to the voters, should she choose to run, is what\nwill determine the success of her candidacy, not this book tour. And that\nis a lesson I think Secretary Clinton, who has run before, understands\nbetter than most of the other potential candidates.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nBeth Myers\n\nMitt Romney campaign adviser\n\n\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton have created a new post-presidential model that\nincludes self-promotion, corporate consulting, paid speaking fees,\nmega-book deals and massive wealth accumulation. There is nothing\nnecessarily wrong with accumulating great wealth, but no former first\nfamily has done anything like it before. The Washington establishment may\nhave embraced this model, but Hillary 2014 demonstrates that American\nvoters will want to understand \xe2\x80\x9cClinton, Inc.\xe2\x80\x9d a whole lot better before\nthey are sold on a Hillary Clinton candidacy.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nAlex Vogel\n\nCo-founder and managing partner, VogelHood research\n\n\n\nFirst, it shows the broader Democratic primary base that she is not in\nclose touch with the populist mood of her own party. Her struggle to deal\nwith questions about her own wealth highlights that disparity. Second,\nwhile her popularity remains high, her stumbles show there is a real\nopportunity for someone else in the race\xe2\x80\x94and will encourage them to hang\naround in case she trips harder. Third, and maybe most importantly, her\nless-than-amazing book sales show that people aren\xe2\x80\x99t looking for a new\ndefinition of Hillary. Americans have a fairly defined view of\nher\xe2\x80\x94something that cuts both ways\xe2\x80\x94and aren\xe2\x80\x99t hyper-interested in laying\ndown hardcover money to listen to a new version of it.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nRamesh Ponnuru\n\nConservative pundit\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s book tour doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell us much about how she will do in\n2016\xe2\x80\x94but what it does tell us isn\xe2\x80\x99t good news for her. She can\xe2\x80\x99t be happy\nabout the gaffe-filled coverage of it, or the fact that her favorability\nratings have been dropping. She will be a formidable candidate but not an\nunbeatable one. But then we already knew that.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nAna Navarro\n\nRepublican strategist\n\n\n\nThe Hillary book tour taught us that Hillary has the same problems\xe2\x80\x94being\noverly cautious, measured, scripted, uninspiring and boring\xe2\x80\x94going into 2016\nthat she had going into 2008. And she has one more: Now she has to stay\nwithin the lines of the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s coloring book.\n\n\n\nJetting around world capitals as secretary of state to talk lofty issues\nwith international leaders is very different from U.S. retail politics. She\ncame across as rusty. It was just crazy to see her dig herself deeper and\ndeeper in trying to explain her personal wealth. Calling the way she dealt\nwith it \xe2\x80\x9cunartful\xe2\x80\x9d is being charitable.\n\nWe also learned that she views not having seized in 2008 the historical\naspect of being the first woman candidate as a mistake. This time around,\nshe obviously plans to embrace it fully.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nLanhee Chen\n\nFormer Mitt Romney adviser\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s book tour showed us how out of touch a rusty politician\ncan look. But beyond the gaffes, I think it demonstrated that Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nefforts to showcase her record as secretary of state will end up\nbackfiring. In fact, what she thinks is her biggest political strength will\nactually be her biggest liability if she decides to run for president. The\nworld is in tumult, in no small part because of the role Clinton played as\nthe chief executioner of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s failed foreign policy. One needs\nto look no further than her obsession with pursuing a \xe2\x80\x9creset\xe2\x80\x9d in our\nrelations with Russia, her coddling of Bashar Assad in Syria or her\ninability to successfully negotiate a Status of Forces Agreement with the\nIraqis to see how her time as America\xe2\x80\x99s chief diplomat will come back to\nhaunt her. The media and political elites in Washington may have focused on\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s gaffes and other missteps during her recent book tour, but the\nbad news for her is that it showed us that the worst is yet to come.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nZac Moffat\n\nRepublican consultant\n\n\n\nIn 2008, the Obama campaign ran circles around Clinton, and the cycle has\ngotten exponentially faster since. It appears that the Clinton staff has\nbeen effective at getting one-off predetermined tweets through approval,\nbut much has changed since 2008, and their success will be contingent on\ntheir ability to adapt and be more responsive than their current\ncommunications strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Hill blog: Briefing Room: \xe2\x80\x9cClinton would back changing border law\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/213251-clinton-backs-changing-border-law>*\n\n\n\nBy Jesse Byrnes\n\nJuly 24, 2014, 1:31 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton said Thursday that she was open to changing a 2008\ntrafficking law to help the administration deal with an influx of child\nmigrants crossing the border illegally.\n\n\n\n"I think it should be looked at as part of an overall package," Clinton\nsaid on NPR\'s "On Point.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton said Obama needed more \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility\xe2\x80\x9d to deal with the crisis on the\nborder, noting the large number of migrants are fleeing their countries for\nmany reasons.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do need more resources very quickly deployed, which is what the\npresident and the Democrats have asked for. We need some flexibility within\nthe laws,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\n\n\n\nThe 2008 law has become a sticking point in the debate over how to handle\nthe large number of child migrants who have entered the U.S. this year.\n\n\n\nAbout three-quarters of the unaccompanied children crossing the southern\nborder are from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. More than 50,000 have\nimmigrated to the U.S. since October.\n\n\n\nThe William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act\nof 2008, named after the 19th-century British abolitionist, prevents\nofficials from quickly deporting migrants from countries other than Canada\nor Mexico.\n\n\n\nA House GOP border working group called for changes to the law, which\nRepublicans say creates an incentive for children to cross the border.\nRepublicans will likely include those changes in their $1.5 billion\nemergency funding bill for the border, while Senate Democrats are moving a\n$2.7 billion plan without changes to the 2008 law.\n\n\n\nCongressional Democrats oppose changing the law, saying that doing so would\nweaken legal protections for young migrants.\n\n\n\nBut the Obama administration has called for measures to help speed up the\ndeportation process.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said the law should be\nchanged to expedite processing for those ineligible for asylum.\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner on Wednesday urged President Obama to publicly\nsupport changing the law.\n\n\n\nClinton at a CNN Town Hall last month said unaccompanied immigrant children\nwould have to be sent home.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe laws, our laws right now are not particularly well suited for making\nthe kind of determinations that are required, and that we should, as\nAmericans, want to see happen,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Fast Company: \xe2\x80\x9cMost Americans Think the U.S. Would Be Better Governed If\nMore Women Were In Charge\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.fastcompany.com/3033477/strong-female-lead/most-americans-think-the-us-would-be-better-governed-if-more-women-were-i>*\n\n\n\nBy Kathleen Davis\n\nJuly 25, 2014, 5:43 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nTina Fey famously quipped on SNL in 2008 that \xe2\x80\x9cbitch is the new black,\xe2\x80\x9d\nasserting that the reason that Hillary Clinton was trailing Barack Obama\nwas because of a lot of not-so-subtle misogyny.\n\n\n\nOf course it\xe2\x80\x99s not just Hillary Clinton who has faced an uphill battle;\nmany female politicians have found themselves the subjects of questions,\ncriticisms, and scrutiny that their male counterparts never have to face.\n\n\n\nHowever, a new poll from Gallup shows that 63% of Americans say the country\nwould be better governed with more female political leaders, which is up\nslightly from 57% in past polls in 1995 and 2000. But not everyone feels\nthis way: While 78% of liberals as well as 78% of unmarried women think we\nneed more female political leaders, only 46% of Republicans feel that\nhaving more women in office would result in better government, and almost\none in five (19%) feel it would be worse.\n\n\n\n[GALLUP POLLS]\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, four in five Americans (81%) say the U.S. would be better\ngoverned if more people with business and management experience were in\npolitical office. Which means in theory that everyone in the tiny pool of\nwomen CEOs should run for office.\n\n\n\nOf course, a lot goes into the public\xe2\x80\x99s voting decisions, and while\nAmericans may claim to view demographic and professional backgrounds in a\ncertain way, their final voting decisions can be swayed by many other\nfactors. And there\xe2\x80\x99s the argument that less women than men run for public\noffice in the first place.\n\n\n\nStill, the proportion of women in elected offices remains staggeringly low\nwhen you consider that women make up 51% of the U.S. population: Women\xe2\x80\x99s\nrepresentation in both the House and the Senate hovers around 20% (there\nare currently 20 female U.S. senators and 79 female U.S. House members),\nand there are only five female state governors in office.\n\n\n\nAccording to Gallup\xe2\x80\x99s research however, we are at least slowly moving in a\nmore equitable direction. \xe2\x80\x9cFar more women have been elected to federal or\nstatewide office in the years since 1990,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Justin McCarthy in the\nGallup report.

The group is hosting a second\nWashington fundraiser at the Soho Tea & Coffee shop, a Dupont Circle joint\nwith bright art, mismatched tables, cement floors and, of course, a bar.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoho Tea & Coffee brings a unique flavor to D.C., like the candidate\nHillary Clinton,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams told Whispers. (The owner is also a big Clinton\nsupporter.) The event promises specialty drinks, fun and music. Beverages\nserved will include the nonalcoholic \xe2\x80\x9cHillary\xe2\x80\x99s Hammerhead,\xe2\x80\x9d a coffee\ndrink, and a \xe2\x80\x9cWhite House Wine Spritzer,\xe2\x80\x9d a boozy one. The pantsuit-themed\ndrink \xe2\x80\x8bwas served at the group\xe2\x80\x99s first fundraiser, which took place in\nJune, at a bowling alley in Georgetown, that\xe2\x80\x99s also a bar.\n\n\n\nTickets for the Thursday night event are $16. \xe2\x80\x9cA \xe2\x80\x98suggested donation\xe2\x80\x99 of\n$16 we felt would make it accessible to anybody who wanted to attend,\xe2\x80\x9d\nWilliams said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s a suggested donation as well,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated,\nsuggesting someone could get into the party for even less.\n\n\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a similar flavor here to what Ready for Hillary has tried to\naccomplish with small dollar donation parties, though the organizers of\nthat PAC, which is more connected with the Clintons, ask attendees for\n$20.16.\n\n\n\nWilliams said Hillary 2016 PAC isn\xe2\x80\x99t a copycat, but more authentically\ngrass roots.\n\n\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s because Williams has no ties to the Clinton family \xe2\x80\x93 he was born\nwhen they were already in the White House.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fell in love with Hillary when I was 3 years old,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams explained.\n\n\n\nThe super PAC came about earlier this year when Williams joined forces with\nKelley Johnson, a veteran of Terry McAuliffe\'s successful campaign for\ngovernor of Virginia in 2013, who also voted for Clinton when she ran for\nthe U.S. Senate in New York. Together, the two of them are trying to get\nyoung people involved. \xe2\x80\x9cThe things that we value and the things that the\nyoung progressive movement values \xe2\x80\xa6 [Clinton] spent her entire life on\nthose issues,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams explained, noting that young people don\xe2\x80\x99t\nnecessarily know her record.\n\n\n\nEvidence of that delighted conservatives when, in May, right-of-center\nvideo journalist Michelle Fields went to the campus of George Washington\nUniversity and failed to find a college student who could really pinpoint\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s record as secretary of state.

With a Clinton presidential\ncampaign a possibility, they want the same treatment New York voters got.\n\n\n\n"If there was an actual, authentic \'I am going to listen to you about your\nissues\' from Clinton, instead of kind of pounding the drum of inevitability\nand stampeding over the left on her way to assumed victory, that would be\neffective," said Sally Kohn, a progressive activist, CNN contributor and\nClinton critic.\n\n\n\nUntil then, the trust deficit between Clinton and the left of her party\nwill grow, Kohn and other liberals predict.\n\n\n\nActivists point to Clinton\'s voting record in the Senate, where she voted\nto authorize the Iraq war and increase domestic surveillance. They say that\nand decisions her husband made while president, like the Defense of\nMarriage Act and the authorization of the North American Free Trade\nAgreement, give her little street cred among liberals and populists.\n\n\n\nPossibly the biggest concern among liberals is Clinton\'s coziness with Wall\nStreet, their big bogeyman. Since leaving the State Department in 2013, she\nhas spoken at events sponsored by Wall Street giants like Fidelity, Goldman\nSachs and Ameriprise Financial, and during her Senate runs and 2008\npresidential run, Clinton defended lobbyists.\n\n\n\n"I don\'t think she has been aggressive on the banks," said Nelini Stamp, a\nprogressive political organizer from New York. "When I think of Hillary\nClinton, I actually think she is in bed with some of the banks and Wall\nStreet is her ally."\n\n\n\nThere is also an overarching suspicion among liberals that Clinton is\nsaying what she needs to get elected, but would govern differently.\n\n\n\n"You wonder if it is a pivot or whether she is saying what the moment\ndemands," Kohn said.\n\n\n\nStarting in May, before Clinton crisscrossed the country selling her book\n"Hard Choices," the former secretary of state started to talk about\npopulist and liberal issues like college affordability and income\ninequality.\n\n\n\nClinton told an audience at the liberal New American Foundation in May that\n"the dream of upward mobility that made this country a model for the world\nfeels further and further out of reach" and because of that, "many\nAmericans understandably feel frustrated, even angry."\n\n\n\nClinton has also recently labeled college affordability "one of the biggest\nproblems we have in the country," and says if she were elected president\nshe would "tackle growth, which is the handmaiden of inequality." People\nclose to her have started to trumpet her record on pay equity and the\nminimum wage.\n\n\n\n"She has come with a more populist tone because she knows what people want\nto hear," Stamp said. Asked if she trusts Clinton when she talks about\nincome inequality, Stamp said bluntly, "Right now, not that much."\n\n\n\nClinton\'s changing message has been overshadowed by gaffes during her book\ntour, like countering questions about her wealth by saying her family was\n"dead broke" when it left the White House.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, possible opponents from the left -- like Sen. Elizabeth\nWarren, Maryland Gov. Martin O\'Malley and Vice President Joe Biden -- have\ngenerated more buzz among liberals as alternatives to Clinton.\n\n\n\nOther than changing her tune, Clinton hasn\'t been quick to address liberals\nwho have questions for her. Instead of sitting down with them -- something\nthat a candidate would certainly do, especially one battling distrust --\nshe has continued to hold events around her book and her family\'s\nfoundation.\n\n\n\nPolls might explain why she hasn\'t reached out yet: Right now, liberals\ndon\'t matter that much to whether Clinton would win the Democratic\nnomination in 2016.\n\n\n\nA CNN/ORC International Poll from June found that only 11% of Democrats\nwant a more liberal option to Clinton. Twenty percent want someone more\nconservative and 63% want Clinton.\n\n\n\nWhat\'s more, a Washington Post/ABC News poll from the same time showed that\n72% of self-described liberals supported Clinton, a number that was larger\nthan moderate and conservative Democrats.\n\n\n\nBut liberals do make a lot of noise. Some of that has already boosted\npossible opponents from the left.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month both Biden and Warren ignited the crowd of liberal\nbloggers and activists at the annual Netroots Nation conference in Detroit.\nWarren\'s speech was interrupted by chants of "Run, Liz, Run" from eager\nsupporters who want to see her challenge Clinton for the presidency.\n\n\n\nClinton wasn\'t there, instead continuing with her "Hard Choices" memoir\ntour in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Madison, Connecticut.\n\n\n\nWhile Stamp, who attended Netroots Nation, said there wasn\'t an overarching\nfeeling of being snubbed by Clinton, she acknowledged, "It would have been\ninteresting to hear her in a progressive setting."\n\n\n\n"People want to hear from a potential candidate and have those candidates\nhear about the work they are doing on the ground," she added.\n\n\n\nAfter the conference, left-leaning Democrats said they felt more energized\nand organized than ever -- and they hope that will lead to more influence\non who their party nominates in 2016.\n\n\n\n"She shouldn\'t be the inevitable candidate," said Erica Sagrans, the\ncampaign manager for Ready for Warren, an effort to enlist Warren to run\nfor president in 2016. "Our take is that no one should feel like they can\'t\nsupport a candidate that they like or are excited about just because there\nis a lot of support for Hillary."\n\n\n\nReady for Warren is a direct response to what many liberal organizers say\nis an assumption of inevitability among the cadre of groups and political\noperatives organizing for a possible Clinton campaign. The name itself is a\nplay on Ready for Hillary, an organized group of Clinton loyalists who have\nraised over $8 million to help Clinton if she chooses to run in 2016.\n\n\n\nSagrans, whose group received a great deal of attention at Netroots this\nmonth, said it hopes to "channel the excitement about Warren into tangible\nresults and a tangible organization."\n\n\n\nBut just as much as the group\'s goal is to "elevate Warren," as Sagrans\nsaid, progressives also want to direct the 2016 conversation.\n\n\n\nOn this goal, progressives seem to be winning. Clinton has talked more\nabout populist issues since embarking on the book tour and will likely be\nforced to continue this rhetoric if she runs for president.\n\n\n\nAnd liberals hope their influence will grow with time.\n\n\n\n"There is this sort of inherent question, is Hillary ready for us?" Kohn\nsaid about 2016. "It is not enough to just be the next in line. The\nquestion is: Are you really, truly listening?"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Politico: \xe2\x80\x9cDeval Patrick: I\'m not \'pals\' with Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/deval-patrick-hillary-clinton-not-friends-109342.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Kyle Cheney\n\nJuly 24, 2014, 1:43 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nMassachusetts Gov.

It\xe2\x80\x99s\nvery thick.\n\n\n\nThe book\xe2\x80\x99s 650 pages have drawn complaints from the likes of Google CEO\nEric Schmidt, who compared its length unfavorably to his own 37-page book\nwhile interviewing Clinton this week. \xe2\x80\x9cThis would just slip under the door.\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine using that as a door stop,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton scoffed while holding\nSchmidt\xe2\x80\x99s slim text on stage. To other interviewers, Clinton has joked that\nher book can be used as an exercise weight, encouraging audiences to buy\ntwo copies so they can work out both arms at once.\n\n\n\nBut, Clinton revealed Thursday, her book could have been even longer. Much\nlonger. Speaking with CNBC\xe2\x80\x99s John Harwood, who was guest-hosting the public\nradio show \xe2\x80\x9cOn Point,\xe2\x80\x9d produced by WBUR in Boston, Clinton said her book is\na slimmed down version of what it could have been.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I wrote a long book, but I cut about two-thirds of it out!\xe2\x80\x9d she\nadded with a laugh. Harwood heartily agreed it was long.\n\n\n\nWith about 600 pages of text (minus the lengthy index, and other\nappendages), that suggests the potential presidential candidate could have\nproduced a roughly 1,800 page manuscript. \xe2\x80\x9dWar and Peace\xe2\x80\x9d runs about 1,400\npages in the Oxford World\xe2\x80\x99s Classic paperback printing.\n\n\n\nMore seriously, Clinton defended the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s controversial\n\xe2\x80\x9creset\xe2\x80\x9d policy with Russia, which has been criticized in the wake of\nRussia\xe2\x80\x99s incursion into Crimea and the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight\n17 last week. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I think I demonstrate in the book is that the reset\nworked,\xe2\x80\x9d she told Harwood, insisting it was successful in extracting key\nconcessions from then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev before Vladimir\nPutin resumed power. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d gotten all we could get from the reset. The\nreset succeeded, but we had to make adjustments, given the fact that Putin\nwas going \xe2\x80\xa6 to be more aggressive in his foreign policy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n*Sec.
