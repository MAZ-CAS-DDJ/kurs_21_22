Turns out he's already\nworking with the folks at the NNPA who we've been in touch with - and he's\nhelping them package together an AA GOTV newspaper at rate plan for March\nstates. He also said he'd help us drive down prices, so glad we made the\nconnection here.\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Feb 3, 2016, at 2:20 PM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com> wrote:\n\nGordon is my son-in-law.

So if you're\nlooking for marketing logistics support, especially for younger &/or\nminority demographics, I recommend that you talk to him.\n\nhttp://www.refuelagency.com/people/greg-anthony/\n\n-g\n\n\n\n*From:* Greg Anthony [mailto:GAnthony@refuelagency.com\n<javascript:_e(%7B%7D,'cvml','GAnthony@refuelagency.com');>]\n*Sent:* Wednesday, February 03, 2016 10:20 AM\n*To:* Rouse, Gordon\n*Subject:* FW: 2016 Election\n\n\n\nGordon,\n\n\n\nSee attached.  A couple months back, after ten years of work, I was able to\nbring the African American publishers and Hispanic publishers together.\nThere are 400 Hispanic publications and 300 African American publications\ncovering every state.\n\n\n\nThe reason for my email is that neither organization has endorsed a\ncandidate and I can help make that happen (what are friends for).  I can\nalso use publishers in every market for grass roots event and work.\n\n\n\nIf anyone is interested, have them yell at me.\n\n\n\n*Greg Anthony*\n\nEVP, National Sales Manager\n\n<image002.jpg>\n\nemail   ganthony@refuelagency.com\n<javascript:_e(%7B%7D,'cvml','ganthony@refuelagency.com');>\n\noffice   805.690.7011\n\nmobile 805.452.4317\n\nfax       877.335.3493\n\n\n\nrefuelagency.com\n\nfacebook.com/refuelagency | twitter.com/refuelagency\n\n104 W Anapamu St\n\nSuite 204b\n\nSanta Barbara  CA  93101\n\n\n<Task Force 9 24 15.docx>\n"
