john.podesta@gmail.comb"John,\n\nI hope you are doing well and I hate to email you out of the blue, but as\nyou know, I'm up for the DNC comms job.  One week ago I was told I had the\nsupport of the campaign, but now I hear that I am being torpedoed by two\npeople.\n\nI think it is unfair and I'd really like to talk to you if possible.  One\nof the people blowing me up doesn't surprise me one bit, but the other one\ncertainly does since we've never worked together.  And that person has\nrequested a phone call with DWS, which I find highly unusual.  I've been\nadvised to step up my efforts to get the support of high level people on\nthe campaign.\n\nDWS and I really hit it off and I believe she wants to hire me.  I\ncertainly would love to do the job -- and I know I would do a great job.\nMost importantly, I want to help Hillary.  I've observed the DNC\ncommunications operation for a while and have very specific ideas for how\nto improve the situation there.  I would relish the opportunity to get in\nthere and help ramp it up to the level it needs to for 2016 and for the\neventual nominee.\n\nBottom line, I want to fight for this job and I also want to prevent having\nmy name drug through the mud unnecessarily in Brooklyn.  I've been a loyal\nfoot soldier for many years and it is hurtful and surprising to have these\npeople try to block me from doing a job.\n\nPlease let me know if you can talk.  I know you are very busy, but I would\ntruly appreciate your time.\n\nThanks, John.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAmanda Crumley\n310-402-8869\n\n\n\n-- \nAmanda Crumley\nCrumley Communications & Public Strategies\nc: 310-402-8869\ne: amandacrumley@gmail.com\n"
