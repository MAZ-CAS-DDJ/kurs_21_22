john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John - \n\nLate last week, the White House announced its decision to send small arms to the forces fighting the Assad regime in the Syrian civil war.\n\nThis is the beginning of a slippery slope that leads to heavy arms that we have no way of tracking during the war and after its conclusion. With al Qaeda, Hezbollah, Sunni insurgents, Iran, and a host of others involved in this proxy war, can we afford them getting a hand on our arms?\n\nThankfully, Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico has forcefully stood in the way of this decision with his voice and his vote, and more senators should take note of his approach.\n\nPlease sign our petition thanking Senator Tom Udall for his vocal leadership against U.S. intervention in this millennia-old Sunni-Shia conflict.\n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/udall\n\nThis is a very important issue to VoteVets supporters, including the ones who fought in Iraq against the Sunni insurgents who may get their hands on our arms.\n\nThere may be a time to reconsider this question as we gather more intelligence and the Syrian resistance shows greater organization and structure.  \n\nBut now is not that time.\n\nBest,\n\nJon Soltz \n@jonsoltz \nIraq War Veteran and Chairman \nVoteVets.org\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/unsubscribe\nPaid for by VoteVets Action Fund\n\n'
