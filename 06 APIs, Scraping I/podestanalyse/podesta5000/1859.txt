If he's going to succeed, we'll need to give him everything we've got.\n\nJohn, I'm asking for a quick favor. Will you join me in helping John win this election?\n\nIf you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/foustq42014?refcode=em_FR_2014.10.31_b2_ma_ldnd&amp;recurring=auto&amp;amount=25&amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;firstname=John&amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;city=Washington&amp;state=DC&amp;zip=20016&amp;phone=2162818851&amp;occupation=&amp;employer=\n\nAs a Fairfax County Supervisor, John worked day and night for the people of Northern Virginia.
