The issues that you all have led and worked on for so many years were at the cornerstone of his remarks.\n\nPresident Obama committed in his final year to ensuring that \x91everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.\x92 Equal pay for equal work, raising the minimum wage, paid leave and worker voice were common themes throughout the speech \x96 all focused on building an America where \x91every American\x92s voice is heard.\x92\n\nHe also spoke about the importance in lifting up our business partners who\x92ve \x91figured out that doing right by their workers ends up being good for their shareholders, their customers and their communities.\x92\n\nToday Secretary Perez hit the road and travelled to Philadelphia to amplify these and other core messages from last night, focusing on the need to provide training and ensure workers have skills to succeed in the 21st century.\n\nBefore he left, he stopped by the White House to participate in the Big Block of Cheese day \x96 answering questions from people all around the country about the State of the Union address.\n\nSecretary Perez wearing a cheese head\n\nWe want to thank all of you for your continued hard and partnership work on these issues. As Secretary Perez always says, \x91we only have 373 days until the weekend.\x92\n\nWe look forward to continuing to work with you on these critical issues,\n\nAllison Zelman\nDepartment of Labor Office of Public Engagement\n\n\xa0\n\n \n\n [ http://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDOL/bulletins/1300678?reqfrom=share ]\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nUS DOL Seal Questions?
