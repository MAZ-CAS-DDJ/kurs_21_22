As you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, the\nidea here is to use this to lay out her thinking on TPA & TPP ahead of\naction on the Hill and a joint letter by all the former Secretaries of\nState and Defense. This draft assumes that she\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately going to\nsupport both TPA and TPP.  It focuses on what needs to happen to produce a\npositive result with TPP, and casts support for TPA as one of those steps.\nIt also says that we should walk away if the final agreement doesn\xe2\x80\x99t meet\nthe test of creating more jobs than it displaces, helping the middle class,\nand strengthening our national security.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to speak directly to\nthe most prominent concerns expressed by Labor and Hill Dems, including\nWarren.  Of course, if we go ahead with a meeting with HRC to lay out the\npros and cons and then come to a different conclusion, this letter would\nchange dramatically.\n\n Thanks\nDan\n'
