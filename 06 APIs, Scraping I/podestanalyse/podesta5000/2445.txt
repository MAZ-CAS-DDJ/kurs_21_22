The second wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened without the first, and I doubt that either would have happened if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been in the picture. \n\nI know we still have a tough race to run to slow and halt climate change, but after Paris, we have a path on which to run that race. That sure beats hacking our way through the thorns and wading through the swamps.  \n\nFor me, the number of people who will be helped \xe2\x80\x94 those alive today and those who may not be conceived until the next century\xe2\x80\x94 is so large that it is impossible to fully comprehend, impossible to see all those faces and feel the joy that would come with seeing so many people for whom you knew you had made such a difference.  But I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll pause long enough to try.\n\nThank you.\n\nWishing you (and the planet) a great year ahead.\n\nSandy\n\nSandy Newman | President | Voices for Progress| 1616 P St., NW, Suite 430| Washington, DC 20036 | (202) 669-8754\n\n\n\n\n\n'
