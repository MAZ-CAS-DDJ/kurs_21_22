john.podesta@gmail.comb'This mentions the Foundation a few times.  Any chance that you discussed\nthat with her at all?  I personally wouldn\'t suggest highlighting her\nFoundation work after election day but I recognizet hat\'s a much larger\ndiscussion with her!\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Cheryl Mills <cheryl.mills@gmail.com>\nDate: Sun, Oct 26, 2014 at 5:05 AM\nSubject: Re: Messaging Memo for 9:30am Call\nTo: Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>\nCc: Jake Sullivan <jake.sullivan@gmail.com>, Philippe Reines <\npir@hrcoffice.com>, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>, Robby Mook <\nrobbymook@gmail.com>\n\n\nA two assumptions:\n\n1. That we will run draft framework and message by others.\n\n2. That we will put ourselves on timeline to discuss this with her this\nweek.\n\nOn draft - My comments below are in text in caps in relevant sections (cut\nwhere i agreed to reduce length) - sorry on iPhone so no track changes or\nseparate document:\n\n.\nIntroduction\n\n\n\n[AGREE WITH OBSERVATIONS AND AUDIENCE TARGET OF THE INTRODUCTION]\n\n\n.\nTalking points\n\n\n\nNOTE: These are written in HRC\xe2\x80\x99s voice but once agreed upon can be adapted\nfor the communications team, surrogates, etc.\n\n\n\nQ: \xe2\x80\x8bAre you running for President?\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nI have not made a final decision.  Ultimately though, I am hoping to get to\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nBut this is a very personal decision for me, as I IMAGINE IT IS FOR OTHERS\nweighing something like this.  HAVING WALKED THIS PATH  UNSUCCESSFULLY\nBEFORE, HOW HARD YOU MUST WORK TO EARN THE TRUST OF AMERICANS WHO\n[WANT|NEED FILL IN]. THAT\'S WHY I WANT to make THIS DECISION on my own\nschedule, with as much thought AND INFORMATION as possible to GUIDE ME.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve had a wonderful year and a half since stepping down as Secretary.  I\nlaunched my Foundation programs, wrote a book about my TIME as Secretary of\nState, I gave speeches to organizations and causes. ONLY IN THE LAST FEW\nMONTHS, HAVE I GONE out and fought for THE values I WANT FOR OUR COUNTRY IN\nOUR ELECTED LEADERS in the midterms.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n[TKTK language based on the outcome of the election]\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nSo the next few months are going to be invaluable as I turn my attention to\nthis decision in earnest.  I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be talking to all kinds of people\naround the country about how to keep moving this country forward, about how\nwe can do better. And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be talking to people who have insight\ninto how a presidential campaign needs to look in 2015 & 2016 to have the\nbest chance of success. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to LEARN as much as possible so I can\nmake an informed a decision about what\xe2\x80\x99s best for me and what\xe2\x80\x99s best for\nour country.\n\n\n.\nManaging the Message\n\n\n\n[AGREE WITH SURROGACY FRAMEWORK]\n\n\n.\nTransparency\n\n\n\nWe should view this period as a pre-cursor to what would give way to a\nlarger strategy should she decide to run. Central to that will be\ncommunicating to the press how HRC is approaching this next phase.\n\n\n[AGREE]\n\n\n\nOur message, put simply, is this:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHRC is talking to a wide swath of people about all of the issues that will\naffect the future of this country, how she can impact that debate, and how\na campaign TODAY SHOULD WORK. SHE WANTS TO FIND AND UNDERSTAND the best,\nforward-looking ideas. SO SHE WILL cast a wide net. She may not agree with\neveryone, and they may not agree with her; but she wants to hear from\npeople.\n\n\n.\nExecution\n\n\n1.\nAfter Election Day, we work with a reporter to write about what the coming\nmonths will look like. We convey that while HRC has not decided whether to\nrun, we expand on her public answers by explaining that she plans to spend\ntime talking to people who have new ideas. Elements of such a story should\ninclude:\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nA sampling of people she will be reaching out to, with a heavy does on new\nfaces and previously unsupportive faces;\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nHer reaching out to several key power centers, such as Elizabeth Warren;\n\nTHE LIST BELOW WORRIES ME - IT IS CLOSE TO THE SAME LIST YOU COULD HAVE PUT\nIN 2008 (WHICH YOU FLAG AS IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS FURTHER DOWN IN THIS\nSECTION).  I WOULD SHORTEN AND/OR CATEGORIZE DIFFERENTLY AND I WOULD\nCONSIDER INTRODUCING NEW NAMES - REALIZE THIS IS HARD AS IT ALSO GOES TO\nWHO YOU WANT PRESS REACHING OUT TO AS AN AUTHORITATIVE VOICE BUT I WANT TO\nFLAG THIS AS AN AREA I WOULD WELCOME DISCUSSION ON OUR CALL\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nA basic list of those who legitimately have insight into the process and\nher thinking \xe2\x80\x93 including:\no\nMaggie\no\nCDM\no\nJohn\no\nHuma\no\nJake\no\nPhilippe\no\nCapricia\no\nMinyon\no\nHRC Personal Staff\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nSimilar thought needs to be given to who \xe2\x80\x93 if anyone \xe2\x80\x93 around WJC & CVC\nshould be named \xe2\x80\x93 or if the point should be conveyed that they are holding\ntheir advice close to the vest. Obviously this is not as much of an issue\nwith CVC, but the extended WJC network remains the most difficult to stay\nsynced up with; [WE NEED TO TRY WITH "THE CLOSE TO THE VEST" APPROACH YOU\nOFFER FOR WJC BECAUSE HE TOO NEEDS A NARRATIVE CHANGE FROM HOW HE IS\nPERCEIVED TO HAVE ENGAGED LAST TIME AND WE SHOULD BE SMART ABOUT HOW SHE,\nHE AND THOSE TALKING CONVEY THAT BEGINNING NOW]\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nState clearly and strongly that no personnel decisions have been made of\nany kind, and any assumptions of such are only that \xe2\x80\x93 assumptions,\nunfounded at that;\n\n\n2.\nOnce the story runs, we determine a natural time and place for HRC to\nconvey her evolution of thought to a public audience. We will work with the\nschedule to determine what timing and setting works best.\n\n [AGREE WITH REST]\n\n.\nConclusion\n\n\n\nThe goal of the next 8 weeks should be to practice discipline by conveying\na simple message to a wide audience to preserve HRC\xe2\x80\x99s ability to be\nthoughtful and make decisions on her own terms, with an increasing eye\ntoward how such a strategy would evolve if/when she \xe2\x80\x9cGets to yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd as stated at top, she and we need to do so as genuinely and as\nauthentically as possible.\n\n\n\n[TOTALLY AGREE]\n\ncdm\n\ncdm\n\nOn Oct 25, 2014, at 11:12 PM, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com> wrote:\n\nHi everyone,\n\nAttached please find a memo that Philippe and I put together that we think\ncaptures our conversation last weekend on a beginning frame for how to\nposition HRC, ourselves, and our surrogates following Election Day, along\nwith some of our ideas on how to execute.\n\nTalk to you all in the morning.\n\nNick\n\n\n\nOn 10/22/14, 11:19 AM, "Joanne Laszczych" <jlaszczych@cdmillsGroup.com>\nwrote:\n\nCall is confirmed for 9:30am EDT on Sunday, 10/26.\n\n\nPlease use:\n\n\nDial i:    1-530-881-1000\n\nCode:      742374#\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n\nFrom: Cheryl Mills [mailto:cheryl.mills@gmail.com <cheryl.mills@gmail.com>]\n\nSent: Wednesday, October 22, 2014 3:24 AM\n\nTo: Jake Sullivan\n\nCc: Philippe Reines; Nicholas S Merrill; John Podesta; Robby Mook; Joanne\n\nLaszczych\n\nSubject: Re: Follow - up Call\n\n\nDoes 930am work better for folks then?\n\n\ncdm\n\n\nOn Oct 21, 2014, at 11:45 PM, Jake Sullivan <jake.sullivan@gmail.com>\n\nwrote:\n\n\nI\'ll be on a flight and could do 930 (Robby and I were skedded to speak\n\nthen)\n\n\nOn Oct 21, 2014, at 8:17 PM, Cheryl Mills <cheryl.mills@gmail.com>\n\nwrote:\n\n\nDear all\n\n\nCan you advise Joanne if a call at 9am Sunday will work for a follow\n\nup call?\n\n\nBest.\n\n\ncdm\n\n\n<Memo 11.5.docx>\n'
