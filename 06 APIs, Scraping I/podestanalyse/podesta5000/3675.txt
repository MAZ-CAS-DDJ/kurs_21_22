john.podesta@gmail.comb'Friend -- \n\nI officially kicked off this campaign by asking you to help me fight for a country that works for you and every family.\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re with me, will you pitch in $1 right now to help build our campaign from the bottom up?\n\n http://links.hillaryclinton.com/ctt?kn=4&ms=MjI4NDUyMTgS1&r=MTExODA4Mjg2NjExS0&b=2&j=NTgxNDQzNzQ3S0&mt=1&rt=0 \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve spent my entire career standing up for America and fighting for families like yours. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t always been easy, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t won every battle. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that leadership is about perseverance and hard choices -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never given up on you or the issues that matter.\n\nAs a schoolgirl, and even as Secretary of State, my mother used to tell me, \xe2\x80\x9cHillary, life\xe2\x80\x99s not about what happens to you, it\xe2\x80\x99s about what you do with what happens to you \xe2\x80\x93 so get back out there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing. Too much is at stake for too many families, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to let you get knocked down again.\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to help me wage this fight, pitch in just $1 today:\n\n http://links.hillaryclinton.com/ctt?kn=1&ms=MjI4NDUyMTgS1&r=MTExODA4Mjg2NjExS0&b=2&j=NTgxNDQzNzQ3S0&mt=1&rt=0 \n\nThank you,\n\nHillary\n \n\n\n\n*************** \n\nPAID FOR BY HILLARY FOR AMERICA\n\nContributions or gifts to Hillary for America are not tax deductible.\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.
