john.podesta@gmail.comb"My update is as follows:\n\n1. *JOM*:  I had a good conversationw ith JOM on Monday.  She was very\ngracious; honored to be considered (and very complimentary of RM); did not\nthink there was a role that made sense for her to move her family given her\nrole as deputy campaign manager for 2012 where she had accountability for\nbuilding and operating substantial aspects of the campaign. Would be happy\nto be considered to be a part-time senior advisor if that made sense for\nthe ultimate manager.  She would be willing to travel back and forth and\nshared that in 2012, they had senior managers who had accountability for\nareas or projects so there was clear lines and expectations -- that is a\nmodel in which she would be able to participate best.  I asker here wehre\nshe thought, given the breadth of her experience she could best add value\n-- she said in two places:  1) as sounding board to manager on what and how\nthey structured and the campaign (and is happy to do that now without\ncompensation since much of that will happen in the next two months) and 2)\nas end-user consumer/evaluator and partner to ensure the tools built meet\nthe needs of field in specific places, including what tools are really\nvaluable and what are not and how to design to outcomes that are practical\nand accessible for field staff.\n\n2. *DG *-- exchanged emails with DG; she is on holiday until 5 January; we\nare connecting that Monday; I don't know that she will be looking to move\nfrom where she landed at her firm but will push; JJS advised that she is\nterrific though he thinks of her less operationally and more at the\nintersection of policy, politics and action (e.g., she believes she is\nexcellent at policy and politics).\n\n3. *Self-Research* -- spoke to HRC. As we discussed, her definition of what\nshe sees remaining with personal lawyers and HFS is the narrow areas we\ndiscussed (e.g., taxes, health, finances/speeches, family) though she added\nBZ.  I shared that HFS can continue to manage in partnership with outside\npersonal counsel (including DEK, HT, me) but that self-research as a whole\n(and explained the larger paradigm) should be in NY and run by someone\nsitting in NYC,with which she agreed.  We discussed HFS; she wants her\ndoing these areas, vetting, and personnel from a perch in the Legal Counsel\noperation or the COO operation -- RM let's discuss so it is consistent with\nyour vision, organizational paradigm and goals.\n\n4. *WC *--- she executed her paperwork and will be live in DC or NYC (she\nwants to be wherever RM will be) effective January 12 (the week before she\nhas to do some transition work for her team member who will be stepping in\nfor 90 days). I agreed to secure her housing -- which is done for NYC --\nbut if she is to come to DC, I need to do that so let me know.\n\nI think those are all my updates.\n\nbest.\n\ncdm\n"
