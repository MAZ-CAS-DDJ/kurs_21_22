Management out here has agreed to this - Plouffe\nwould like me on those calls which I'm sure John won't mind, and we\nshould draw up a plan.\n\n \n\nMy sense is that we talk to one person at each network, the Post, Times,\nand AP.  We do it Tuesday on an off-the-record basis to inform their\ncoverage and chit chat Tuesday night.  I'd be concerned about broadening\nthis group out much but you guys may disagree.\n\n \n\nThoughts?\n\n"
