john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hey folks-\n\n \n\nGlad to see all this movement on the US Chamber.  This past summer,\nCatholics United wrote a letter to the Tom Donohue, president of the chamber\nand fellow Catholic.  The letter has some pretty good signatures on it.  We\ngot a response from the US Chamber\'s chief counsel rebutting our claims.  I\nhaven\'t been able to figure out how to use this for any earned media.  If\nyou have ideas on how and whether to use this, can we find a time to talk?\n\n \n\nOne thing to remember is that Donohue is acting in direct opposition to the\nPope\'s latest encyclical on global economic justice.\n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nJs\n\n \n\nText of letter to Chamber below and attached.  Response  from Chamber  also\nattached.\n\n \n\nJames Salt\n\nOrganizing Director, Catholics United\n\njsalt@catholics-united.org\n\n305-978-1056 cell\n202-429-9685 desk\nskype:  james_salt\n\n \n\nDear Mr. Donohue,\n\nAs Catholic leaders committed to promoting values of truth, human dignity,\nand the common good,\n\nwe urge you to put an end to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\'s deceptive\nadvertising campaign\n\nagainst the Employee Free Choice Act.\n\nAs a fellow Catholic, you are surely aware of our Church\'s unequivocal\nsupport for workers\' rights\n\nand the dignity of labor. In his 1891 Encyclical Rerum Novarum - the\ninaugural document of Catholic\n\nSocial Teaching - Pope Leo XIII affirmed the Church\'s support for labor\nunions and the central role\n\nthey can play in ensuring human dignity in the workplace. In his recent\nencyclical Caritas in Veritate,\n\nPope Benedict XVI called on Catholics to honor labor "today even more than\nin the past, as a prompt\n\nand far-sighted response to the urgent need for new forms of cooperation at\nthe international level, as\n\nwell as the local level."\n\nCatholics may disagree in good conscience about whether the Employee Free\nChoice Act is the best\n\nway to realize Church teaching on workers\' rights and labor unions. However,\nthis does not excuse\n\nthe Chamber\'s use of scare tactics and deception in order to turn the\nAmerican public against the\n\nlegislation and demonize those who support it.\n\nHere are some of the distortions to which we object:\n\n* The Employee Free Choice Act does not, as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\nclaims, take away\n\na worker\'s right to a secret ballot election. It does take away the\nemployer\'s right to require a\n\nsecret ballot election when a majority of workers have signed union cards.\nElections are still\n\nrequired when less than a majority have signed cards or when workers choose\nto have an\n\nelection.\n\n* The Chamber purports to oppose the Employee Free Choice Act\'s binding\narbitration\n\nprovisions on the grounds that outside arbitrators should not resolve\ncontract disputes.\n\nHowever, the Chamber fails to mention that it strongly supports the use of\nbinding arbitration\n\nin resolving consumer disputes. Many of your members - such as credit card\ncompanies -\n\nrequire customers to waive their right to legal recourse and submit to\nbinding arbitration even\n\nbefore conflicts arise.\n\n* The Chamber claims that instituting harsher penalties for employers who\nviolate workers\'\n\nrights will place an undue burden on U.S. businesses. In reality, these\npenalties will correct a\n\nsystem that presently encourages such violations. The best way for employers\nto avoid\n\npenalties is to follow the law and respect the rights of their workers.\n\nPerhaps the most disturbing aspect of the Chamber\'s advertising campaign is\nits lack of recognition of\n\nthe injustices the Employee Free Choice Act is intended to remedy. Each\nyear, tens of thousands of\n\nU.S. workers are subjected to harassment and intimidation in the workplace\nbecause they exercised\n\ntheir legal and moral right to form a union, and many of the perpetrators of\nthese injustices are\n\nmembers of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. This situation is untenable by any\nreasonable Catholic or\n\nAmerican standard.\n\nIn light of Pope Benedict\'s renewal of the Church\'s commitment to organized\nlabor, we respectfully\n\nask that you discontinue any anti-Employee Free Choice Act advertising that\nis currently underway,\n\nrefrain from future deceptive messaging on the legislation, and correct the\nmisleading information\n\nthat is currently posted on the Chamber\'s Web site.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSr. Louise Akers, SC\n\nCoordinator of the Cincinnati Office of Peace,\n\nJustice and Integrity of Creation, Cincinnati, OH\n\nFr.

As the nation\'s largest lobbying shop, the Chamber is spending\nmillions of dollars from its corporate members against President Obama\'s\nprogressive agenda of health\n<http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/65477-us-chamber-employers\n-oppose-house-healthcare-bill>  care, energy\n<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/08/25/chamber-scopes-climate-trial/>\n, and financial <http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/09/08/chamber-ads/>\nreform. The Chamber claims that the "board\'s membership is as diverse as\n<http://www.uschamber.com/about/board/default>  the nation\'s business\ncommunity itself," but this is false. A ThinkProgress analysis of federal\nelection contribution data compiled\n<http://blog.littlesis.org/2009/11/12/following-the-chamber-money-trail-part\n-1/>  by the LittleSis project has found that the Chamber\'s 116-member board\nof <http://www.uschamber.com/about/board/all.htm>  directorshas given more\nthan six times as much money to Republican candidates and committees\n($4,741,747) as it has to Democrats ($778,282), with $1,074,697 flowing to\ncorporate political action committees:\n\n \n\nThe top beneficiary of this outpouring of conservative cash is the\nRepublican National Committee, which has received over ten times as much\nmoney from the Chamber\'s board as the Democratic National Committee -\n$1,257,201 versus $102,950. Contributions went 4.5 to 1 for John McCain\n($373,150) versus Barack Obama ($82,150).\n\n \n\n \n\nOf the board\'s 116 members, 96 have made major political contributions.\nSixty-eight directly contributed to the campaigns of George W. Bush or John\nMcCain. In contrast, only 27 gave to the campaigns of Al Gore, John Kerry,\nor Barack Obama. Forty-seven board members, including Chamber of Commerce\npresident Tom Donohue\n<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/10/26/donohue-climate-change/> , have\ncontributed more than 90 percent to Republicans, averaging $74,634 in GOP\ncontributions. Only seven members have contributed more than 90 percent to\nDemocrats, averaging $3,529 to Democrats.\n\n \n\nThe political giving is dominated by leading\n<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/07/29/newt-aswf-billionaires/>\nRepublican billionaire George Argyros, the Bush pioneer who served a\ndisastrous term as the U.S. ambassador to Spain. Argyros is also one of the\ntop backers of Newt Gingrich\'s right-wing American Solutions for Winning the\nFuture. The following visualization\n<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/COC_contributi\nons2.png>  of Chamber of Commerce board member contributions is a sea of red\nsurrounding a few small islands of blue. The size of each box is\nproportional to amount of total contributions per person, with the shading\nindicating percentage of Republican versus Democratic contributions:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-----\n\nAdam Jentleson\n\nCommunications Director, Progressive Media\n\nCenter for American Progress Action Fund\n\najentleson@americanprogressaction.org\n<mailto:ajentleson@americanprogress.org> \n\najentleson (AIM)\n\n202-247-8614 (cell)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign"\ngroup.\n \nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n \nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n \nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n\nThis is a list of individuals.
