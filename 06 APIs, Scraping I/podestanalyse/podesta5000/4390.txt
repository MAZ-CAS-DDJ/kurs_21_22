john.podesta@gmail.comb'Following up on attendees.  Confirmed:\n\nPresident Terry O\'Sullivan (LIUNA)\nPresident Lily Eskelsen Garcia (NEA)\nNEA Exec Director John Stocks\nNEA Political Director Carrie Pugh\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Jan 5, 2016, at 8:34 PM, Nikki Budzinski <nbudzinski@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\nHi John- We\'re hoping to get your feedback on agenda by Thursday morning if\npossible.\n\nNavin and I worked thru this draft agenda for the Labor Presidents meeting\non Jan. 12th from 9-11am at AFT.  I have shared a preliminary agenda with\nRandi as well for feedback, since I know some of this meeting\'s idea came\nfrom a conversation with her.  We have incorporate her feedback.\n\nPlease let us know your feedback and once this agenda is confirmed Navin is\ngoing build a presentation.  Confirmed to attend for the campaign, will be\nNavin, Joel Benenson, myself and you of course.\n\nConfirmed Union Attendees:\n-President Randi Weingarten and John Ost (AFT)\n-President Jim Callahan and Jeff Soth (IUOE)\n-President Doug McCarron, Frank Spencer (VP) & Tom Flynn (UBC)\n-President Sean McGarvey and Mike Monroe (NABTU)\n-Special Assistant to President Rick Terven (UA)\n-Vice President Terry Lynch and Chip Gardiner (Insulators)\n-Chief Of Staff Owen Hernstadt and Hasan Solomon (IAMAW)\n-Other unions confirmed to attend and waiting on attendees names:  AFSCME,\nSEIU, NEA, IUPAT, AFGE, LIUNA, Ironworkers\n\nFeedback and comments on attached agenda:\n\n   - Under "Introductions" I think a big thank you will be important.\n   Labor in 2015 contributed $5.75 to Priorities and $1 million to the Hillary\n   Victory Fund in addition to the member to member paid mail communications\n   program and on the ground resources (AFSCME had 70 members hit yesterday in\n   IA, as an example).  The NEA is moving forward on a message training with\n   80 of their rank and file members from the March primary states to prepare\n   them to be communicators.  They are bringing these members into DC on Jan.\n   22-24th and the campaign will participate in this program.\n\n\n   - Under the section of "Goals & Overview of Meeting"-John, I think it\n   would be helpful if you could provide a quick snapshot/lay of the land for\n   the primary.  I think they will be interested in pre NH and then our March\n   plan. Can I help you with any preparation?\n\n\n   - What are your thoughts about me speaking to our labor mobilization\n   efforts in state and where our needs are moving forward in the primary?\n   This seems like a good opportunity to outline where our most pressing field\n   needs are while we have a captive audience.  I know that\'s not the primary\n   purpose of the meeting, so wanted to run by you.\n\n\n   - Feedback from Randi was to focus on the primary and message and spend\n   less time on general.  The agenda reflects that but connecting the primary\n   and general are obviously important so its in there.\n\n\n   - Regarding the bullet point for "Discussion, how to engage union\n   members" I thought I would tee up a few unions (NEA and AFSCME and a trade\n   union) to talk about their member engagement programs to date and what\n   they\'re hearing on the ground.  I thought this could help initiate\n   discussion and Q&A.\n\n\n   - One thing to flag is that the public sector unions have invested a lot\n   in economic framework messaging, I am sure they will refer to this in the\n   meeting.  They did this in coordination with the AFL-CIO.  I don\'t think we\n   need to proactively add it to the agenda unless you disagree, but I\'m sure\n   they will mention it.\n\nNavin and I will await your feedback and then prepare documents from\nthere.  I\'ll have a event memo for you.\n\n-- \nNikki Budzinski\nLabor Outreach Director\nHillary for America\n646-854-1442 (direct)\n\n<Labor Meeting 1.12.16.docx>\n'
