So don't let up now.\n\nChip in before midnight:\n\nhttps://www.quinnforillinois.com/last-chance\n\nDays like this confirm my belief that grassroots campaigns really can go up against billionaires like Bruce Rauner and win.\n\nThanks for your support. You are awesome.\n\nMarty\n\nMarty Reggi\nDeputy Finance Director\nQuinn for Illinois\n\n\n\n\n\nContributions are not tax deductible.
