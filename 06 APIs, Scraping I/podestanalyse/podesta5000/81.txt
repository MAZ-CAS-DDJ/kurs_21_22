john.podesta@gmail.comb'Sorry to miss the call.  I talked to Chad who said he isn\'t sure what she\nsaid is totally incorrect, it is what WJC uses to talk about the decision,\nbut it is very contested.  He doesn\'t think it helps us to explain it.\nBetter to say it was wrong in 1994 and wrong today, she\'s glad so many did\nso much to tear it down and now we have to focus on the battles ahead.  He\nsuggested she deliver a speech on equality building on what she said at HRC\na few weeks ago and go beyond what anyone has said.  He thinks we need to\nget out of the 90s narrative.\n\nOn Sun, Oct 25, 2015 at 6:28 PM, Dominic Lowell <dlowell@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Jumping on a call with the kitchen cabinet now to give them an update.\n> Will turn to this ASAP.\n>\n> The most recent Blade article has Elizabeth Birch quoted as saying there\n> was no amendment threat in 1996.

Although that was\n>>>>>>>> only 17 years ago, it was a very different time. In no state in the union\n>>>>>>>> was same-sex marriage recognized, much less available as a legal right, but\n>>>>>>>> some were moving in that direction. Washington, as a result, was swirling\n>>>>>>>> with all manner of possible responses, some quite draconian. As a\n>>>>>>>> bipartisan group of former senators stated in their March 1 amicus brief to\n>>>>>>>> the Supreme Court, many supporters of the bill known as DOMA believed that\n>>>>>>>> its passage \xe2\x80\x9cwould defuse a movement to enact a constitutional amendment\n>>>>>>>> banning gay marriage, which would have ended the debate for a generation or\n>>>>>>>> more.\xe2\x80\x9d It was under these circumstances that DOMA came to my desk, opposed\n>>>>>>>> by only 81 of the 535 members of Congress.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> On March 27, DOMA will come before the Supreme Court\n>>>>>>>> <http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2012/12/07/the-supreme-court-takes-up-doma/>,\n>>>>>>>> and the justices must decide whether it is consistent with the principles\n>>>>>>>> of a nation that honors freedom, equality and justice above all, and is\n>>>>>>>> therefore constitutional. As the president who signed the act into law, I\n>>>>>>>> have come to believe that DOMA is contrary to those principles and, in\n>>>>>>>> fact, incompatible with our Constitution.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> Because Section 3 of the act defines marriage as being between a\n>>>>>>>> man and a woman, same-sex couples who are legally married in nine states\n>>>>>>>> and the District of Columbia are denied the benefits of more than a\n>>>>>>>> thousand federal statutes and programs available to other married couples.\n>>>>>>>> Among other things, these couples cannot file their taxes jointly, take\n>>>>>>>> unpaid leave to care for a sick or injured spouse or receive equal family\n>>>>>>>> health and pension benefits as federal civilian employees. Yet they pay\n>>>>>>>> taxes, contribute to their communities and, like all couples, aspire to\n>>>>>>>> live in committed, loving relationships, recognized and respected by our\n>>>>>>>> laws.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> When I signed the bill, I included a statement\n>>>>>>>> <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/scotts/ftp/wpaf2mc/clinton.html> with\n>>>>>>>> the admonition that \xe2\x80\x9cenactment of this legislation should not, despite the\n>>>>>>>> fierce and at times divisive rhetoric surrounding it, be understood to\n>>>>>>>> provide an excuse for discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d Reading those words today, I know\n>>>>>>>> now that, even worse than providing an excuse for discrimination, the law\n>>>>>>>> is itself discriminatory. It should be overturned.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> We are still a young country, and many of our landmark civil rights\n>>>>>>>> decisions are fresh enough that the voices of their champions still echo,\n>>>>>>>> even as the world that preceded them becomes less and less familiar. We\n>>>>>>>> have yet to celebrate the centennial of the 19th Amendment, but a society\n>>>>>>>> that denied women the vote would seem to us now not unusual or\n>>>>>>>> old-fashioned but alien. I believe that in 2013 DOMA and opposition to\n>>>>>>>> marriage equality are vestiges of just such an unfamiliar society.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> Americans have been at this sort of a crossroads often enough to\n>>>>>>>> recognize the right path. We understand that, while our laws may at times\n>>>>>>>> lag behind our best natures, in the end they catch up to our core values.\n>>>>>>>> One hundred fifty years ago, in the midst of the Civil War, President\n>>>>>>>> Abraham Lincoln concluded a message to Congress by posing the very question\n>>>>>>>> we face today: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not \xe2\x80\x98Can any of us imagine better?\xe2\x80\x99 but \xe2\x80\x98Can\n>>>>>>>> we all do better\n>>>>>>>> <http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29503>?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> The answer is of course and always yes. In that spirit, I join with\n>>>>>>>> the Obama administration, the petitioner Edith Windsor\n>>>>>>>> <http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/edie-windsors-fight-for-same-sex-marriage-rights-continues-even-after-partners-death/2012/07/19/gJQARguhwW_story.html>,\n>>>>>>>> and the many other dedicated men and women who have engaged in this\n>>>>>>>> struggle for decades in urging the Supreme Court to overturn the Defense of\n>>>>>>>> Marriage Act.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> On Oct 25, 2015, at 4:19 PM, Kate Offerdahl <\n>>>>>>>> kofferdahl@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> Hi all - we are going to do 4:30.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> Those here at the Hilton can take the call from the staff room.\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> Call-In: 718-441-3763, no pin\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> On Oct 25, 2015, at 4:14 PM, Heather Stone <\n>>>>>>>> hstone@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>> Looping in Kate.
