Because our race is neck-and-neck, the press and\npolitical pundits will pay extra close attention to our\nfundraising numbers.\n\nWill you make a $5 donation today and make sure we reach our \n$50,000 online grassroots goal before Sunday's deadline?\n\nhttps://donate.terrymcauliffe.com/new-poll\n\nThanks for your support at this critical juncture.\n\nRobby Mook\nCampaign Manager\nTerry McAuliffe for Governor\n\n\n\nDONATE NOW: https://donate.terrymcauliffe.com/new-poll\n\n\n\n---\nPaid for by Terry McAuliffe for Governor\n---\n\nUnsubscribe: http://action.terrymcauliffe.com/page/unsubscribe?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\n\n"
