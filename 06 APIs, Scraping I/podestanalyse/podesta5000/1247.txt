john.podesta@gmail.comb'*For Immediate Release\nContact* Eddie Vale 202-637-5018\n\n*Statement by AFL-CIO President John Sweeney On *\n\n*The Appointment of Judge Sonia Sotomayor*\n\nMay 26th, 2009\n\n\n\nAmerica\x92s workers applaud the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the\nUnited States Supreme Court.  She is a brilliant jurist and in her\ndistinguished career has worked at almost every level of our judicial system\n- as a prosecutor, litigator, trial court and appellate judge \x96 and would\nbring more federal judicial experience to the Supreme Court than any justice\nin 100 years.\n\n\n\nJudge Sotomayor will also bring to the Supreme Court a direct and personal\nunderstanding of the struggles America\x92s workers endure every day.  She grew\nup in public housing in the Bronx, the daughter of a factory worker, and\nunderstands the real world consequences of the decisions she makes from the\nbench.\n\n\n\nJudge Sotomayor\x92s record reflects an understanding of the law\x92s impact on\nworking families and has consistently interpreted our labor laws in the\nmanner in which they were intended.  In the baseball strike of 1995, she\nrecognized that the owners had forced the strike by engaging in unlawful\nconduct, and issued an injunction which reversed the unlawful acts. She has\nenforced the rights of all workers to be free of all types of discrimination\nat work, to be paid the correct wages and to receive health benefits to\nwhich they are entitled.  She has recognized that persecution for union\nactivity can be a basis for granting asylum in this country.\n\n\n\nJudge Sotomayor is a bipartisan choice \x96 she was initially appointed to the\nbench by President George H.W. Bush and has previously been confirmed by the\nSenate \x96 we urge the Senate to swiftly confirm her to the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\n\n###\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
