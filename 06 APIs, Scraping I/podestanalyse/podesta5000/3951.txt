john.podesta@gmail.comb'Madame Secretary -\n\nAmanda and I have been working on the Puerto Rico debt and health care\ncrisis in order to advise you politically and substantively on making a\npublic statement on the matter.  Per your good advice, I\'ve spoken several\ntimes to Dick Ravitch (who is very involved in the situation both advising\nthe Governor of Puerto Rico, as well as in regular conversation with\nSecretary Lew about it) and Amanda has been in regular touch with Jeff\nFarrow, who you may remember was President Clinton\'s special advisor on\nPuerto Rico and still does a tremendous amount of work on PR issues.\n\nWith their expert counsel, we have drafted a statement for your review,\nwhich I am attaching and pasting below (and also sending under separate\nclean email for your quick review).  A couple of important points to note\non messages we want to convey:\n\n(1) All agree that we need to make clear the Puerto Ricans are American\nCitizens and we must express empathy and bring the power of the federal\ngovernment to the table to provide them with tools and supports to get out\nof this crisis and on a path to prosperity;\n\n(2) On Chapter 9 bankruptcy and debt restructuring. Dick Ravitch wants to\nmake sure that you understand that the current bill put forward by the PR\nCongressional Rep. Pedro Pierluisi would only allow PR to grant Chapter 9\nbankruptcy reorganization to their publicly owned companies (e.g. water,\nelectricity and highway authorities) and municipalities (in the same way\nStates can provide this authority to cities - e.g. Detroit and Stockton),\nbut would not give the authority to PR itself.  Dick feels strongly that PR\nis ultimately going to need this authority themselves, but that politically\nit will be hard to get for two reasons: (1) giving it to PR is\nacknowledgement that PR is not a state and is distinct from states, which\nare prohibited from declaring bankruptcy under the Constitution; (2) the\nhedge funds have invested in PR itself, whereas mutual funds have\ninvestment in the utilities - hedge funds are hoping that the debt\nrestructuring happens in the government entities to free up dollars to make\nthem entirely whole.  Despite these constraints, Dick\'s advice is to make\nclear that you recognize that PR needs debt restructuring authority under\nChapter 9 and call for support of the bill as a first step.\n\n(3) Health - In 2008, you made very clear that you support full parity with\nPuerto Rico on Medicare and Medicaid.  Since this time, the health crisis\nhas heightened -- 60 percent of Puerto Ricans rely on Medicaid or Medicare\nto get their health insurance, and we have continued to underfund them so\nthat doctors are fleeing the island and residents are fleeing to relocate\nto Florida in order to seek health care.  As a bargain in the ACA\nnegotiations, PR was given a $6.5 billion Medicaid grant that was supposed\nto last them until 2019, but they are expected to use this money up by the\nend of 2017.  And they now have 75 percent of their Medicare recipients on\nMedicare Advantage, but the government announced an 11 percent cut in\npremium subsidies to MA which will impact their access. We believe that you\nshould recommit to parity, but recognize that we need to start on a\n"pathway to parity."  Chris Jennings and I did a back of the envelope\nestimate (CBO has scored parity) and guess that it could cost $40-50\nbillion over 10 years to get there so we want to be careful about\novercommitting.\n\n(4) On the politics, Jeff Farrow and others strongly have urged us to make\nyour position clear on allowing Puerto Ricans to express their will on the\nquestion of statehood (same thing you said in 2008).  We have included this\nsentiment in the final paragraph and I\'m also attaching some background\npulled together by our policy team on the PR statehood vote in 2012 and the\nDOJ money allocated for a vote in 2014.  This memo also includes\ninformation on what the other candidates have said on the debt crisis and\nstatehood question.\n\nPlease let Amanda or me know if you have questions and let us all know\nwhether you APPROVE of this statement below and attached.\n\nThanks,\nAnn\n\n*DRAFT HRC Statement on Puerto Rico Debt Crisis*\n\n*July 2, 2015*\n\n\n\nThe people of Puerto Rico, our fellow American Citizens, are hurting right\nnow under a weak economy that has been struggling for years. Puerto Ricans\nare proud American citizens who work hard and contribute to our Nation\nevery day and they deserve a chance to get ahead.  Congress and the Obama\nAdministration need to partner with Puerto Rico by providing real support\nand tools so that Puerto Rico can do the hard work it will take to get on a\npath toward stability and prosperity.\n\n\n\nThe challenge is multi-faceted, and will ultimately require broad authority\nto allow Puerto Rico to restructure its debt and pay back its debtors in an\norderly fashion.  As a first step, Congress should provide Puerto Rico the\nsame authority that states already have to enable severely distressed\ngovernment entities to restructure their debts under Chapter 9 of the\nBankruptcy Code.  This authority would allow Puerto Rico to provide a\ndebt-restructuring tool to its municipalities and public agencies,\nincluding the three largest government corporations \xe2\x80\x93 the electricity,\nwater and sewer, and highway authorities \xe2\x80\x93 which hold over a quarter of all\nthe government debt.\n\n\n\nWe\'re not talking about a bailout, we\'re talking about a fair shot at\nsuccess.\n\n\n\nWe also have to step back and look hard at how Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s economy\narrived at this dire situation.  The deficit is a consequence of an economy\nthat has lagged that of the States for decades and shrunk for eight of the\nlast nine years.  Puerto Rico needs a longer-term plan to address a\ndeclining population, eroding employment base, high utility rates and the\nimpact of unequal federal investments.  It will take tough decisions and\nreal economic reforms.\n\n\n\nBut we should also recognize that the inconsistent \xe2\x80\x94 and incoherent \xe2\x80\x94\ntreatment of Puerto Rico in federal laws and programs has substantially\ncontributed to the economic decline.  One troubling example of this\ntreatment is the lack of equity in federal funding for Puerto Rico under\nMedicaid and Medicare.  This problem has been demonstrated in recent months\nby a scheduled cut in Medicare Advantage premium reimbursement rates.  In\n2008, I called for an end to the disparate treatment of Puerto Rico in\nfederal health programs.  Today, I renew that call, and commit to helping\nPuerto Ricans get on a path towards equitable treatment under Medicaid and\nMedicare.\n\n\n\nUnderlying all of this is the fundamental question of Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s\nultimate future. That question needs to be resolved in accordance with the\nexpressed will of our fellow citizens, the people of Puerto Rico. And let\xe2\x80\x99s\nnot forget that no matter the outcome, Puerto Ricans will remain proud\nAmericans who contribute to our Nation every day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nAnn O\'Leary\nSenior Policy Advisor\nHillary for America\nCell: 510-717-5518\n'
