Americans have a long history of bestowing their own \'monickers\' on serial killers and gangs of various sorts. If someone in a leadership position were to call this group by a name more suited to what they truly are , for example : @ TSIS for Terrorist State in Iraq & Syria or @TSIL for Terrorist State of Iraq & the Levant, and requested the media and political leaders to follow suit, they would be taking a formal and very hard line position against a serious threat to our country. As a Christian (sometimes), I understand that not all Muslims represent or admire Jihad . This group is not about religion, it is about terror and I feel the first person who calls them out for what they are rather than catering to their distorted vision will strike an affirmative chord with all Americans. \nSorry for running on so long .

While there appears to be no one posing any sort of \'threat\' to Secretary Clinton\'s Democratic nomination for the Presidency, there are plenty of Republican challengers ready to put her down because she is a woman. Four little words, wielded appropriately, could set her apart as the logical choice for this country. I\'d be happy to share them if you are interested. If this phrase were adopted, even the President would have to follow her lead as would her opponents ( or they\'d be left looking less than Presidential).\n>> Please feel free to email me or my information is available on our webpage: bluemoonponies.com.
