john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi John and Eryn,\r\n\r\nThank you very much for the lunch and information about Equitable Growth.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve told Matt to work with heather on a proposal for some funding for our fall board meeting in October.\r\n\r\nOne question I had after the presentation is whether it would be possible to expand the kind of research we can get the academics to do and to think about.  Antitrust is one such example and labor is another.  There is no doubt that a big piece of inequality is caused by the tax code but I would guess equally to blame is the lack of bargaining power for workers and the monopolization of the economy.  I know both these things are out of favor and have been intellectually destroyed by the right, and so it will be hard to rehabilitate them in a new light.  But it is hard to imagine the right wing abandoning two of the pillars of their economy because we attacked them hard.  If you can imagine Nebraska outlawing the death penalty we could imagine trust busting and robust workers collectives.\r\n\r\nJust a thought on a Friday afternoon.\r\n\r\nWarm Regards,\r\n\r\nMolly\r\n\r\nMolly McUsic | President\r\nThe Wyss Foundation\r\n1601 Connecticut Ave. NW, Suite 802 |  Washington, DC 20009\r\nPhone: 202-232-4418 Ext. 12 | Fax: 202-232-4419\r\nwww.wyssfoundation.org<http://www.wyssfoundation.org/>\r\n\r\nFrom: John Podesta [mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com]\r\nSent: Thursday, May 28, 2015 8:56 AM\r\nTo: Molly McUsic; Sandler, Herbert; Daetz, Steve; Susan Sandler\r\nSubject: Fwd: Antitrust, Rent Seeking and Inequality\r\n\r\nFyi\r\n\r\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\r\nFrom: Fishman, Ira <Ira.Fishman@nflpa.com<mailto:Ira.Fishman@nflpa.com>>\r\nDate: Wednesday, May 27, 2015\r\nSubject: Antitrust, Rent Seeking and Inequality\r\nTo: "Heather Boushey (hboushey@equitablegrowth.org<mailto:hboushey@equitablegrowth.org>)" <hboushey@equitablegrowth.org<mailto:hboushey@equitablegrowth.org>>, "John Podesta (john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>)" <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>>\r\n\r\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-america-became-uncompetitive-and-unequal/2014/06/13/a690ad94-ec00-11e3-b98c-72cef4a00499_story.html\r\n\r\nhttp://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2474&context=facpub\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nIra Fishman\r\nManaging Director | COO\r\n\r\n[Image removed by sender.
