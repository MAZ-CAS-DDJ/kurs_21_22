"And he means exactly what he says." \n\nMost presidential candidates say they don\'t encourage the outside groups,\nand donors are accustomed to taking those words with a grain of salt. The\ncandidates\' words are typically seen as mere legal defenses against\nallegations that the campaigns are illicitly coordinating with outside\ngroups. \n\nThe donors have been considering entreaties from Progressive Media USA, run\nby conservative-journalist turned liberal media critic David Brock; from\nformer Clinton aide John Podesta\'s Fund for America; and from America Votes,\na group backed by billionaire George Soros that focuses on voter\nmobilization, among other efforts. \n\nBut in recent days, major donors have begun to conclude that Obama is\nserious in trying to cut off funds to the outside groups. \n\n"It\'s given donors pause," said one prominent Democratic donor of Pritzker\'s\nwords. \n\nDonors and Democratic activists have been quietly debating Obama\'s motives:\nIs he simply interested in keeping his Democratic efforts within his\ncampaign, which is so well funded he doesn\'t need outside help? Or is he, as\nsome believe, cutting off funds to groups whose leaders - Brock and Podesta\n- some Obama aides view as too tightly linked to Clinton? \n\nIn either case, Pritzker\'s words are the latest in Obama\'s remarkably swift\nand complete consolidation of Democratic Party power. It\'s an unprecedented\nseizure of control that has built him, over the course of a year, the most\npowerful field organization and the largest financial network in American\npolitics, leaving many existing structures - traditional party organizations\nin many states, the Clintons\' long-nurtured national network - in the dust. \n\nJust last summer, Matt Bai\'s widely accepted\n<http://www.amazon.com/Argument-Billionaires-Bloggers-Democratic-Politics/dp\n/1594201331>  analysis identified the "billionaires" and the "bloggers" as\nthe key, emergent players in the Democratic Party\'s infrastructure. But\nObama has marginalized both groups. Pritzker\'s words are part of a move to\nkeep Obama\'s grip on the sole important funnel of Democratic money this\nyear. And his campaign has largely ignored the existing network of liberal\nbloggers, and actively opposes their embrace of fierce partisanship. \n\n"Obama has created a number of significant infrastructure pieces through his\ncampaign, displacing traditional groups the way he promised he would by\nsignaling the end of the old politics of division and partisanship," the\nblogger Matt Stoller wrote <http://openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=5637>\nrecently of Obama\'s "consolidation of the party," which he called\n"stunning." \n\nMany of the figures Obama has shut out have, sometimes grudgingly, embraced\nthe sheer effectiveness of his organization, and his potential to create a\nlasting new Democratic majority. The open question is whether Obama\'s\nmovement is about something more than the candidate, and whether it will\ncohere after he wins or loses in November.\n\n"Will the Obama movement be a real movement that pushes its leader to keep\nhis promises?" Micah Sifry wrote recently on the blog TechPresident\n<http://techpresident.personaldemocracy.com/blog/entry/25112/what_is_obama_s\n_movement> . "Or will it be more of a personalized movement of followers\nattracted to a charismatic star?" \n\nObama\'s campaign has been remarkably effective so far this year at\nmaintaining a coherent message, built around Obama\'s biography and his\nappeal for a new kind of politics. Part of his success has been tight\nmessage discipline: The campaign has been virtually leak-free, and the line\nof control from Obama to his chief strategist David Axelrod to campaign\nmanager (and Axelrod business partner) David Plouffe is unchallenged. \n\nMany involved in the independent efforts find it hard to quibble with that\nsuccess, and may have second thoughts about continuing that work over\nObama\'s explicit objection. \n\n"If he were to make a definitive statement, we\'d have to think hard about\nit," said one. \n\nThe campaign\'s opposition to the outside groups is, donors and activists\nsaid, being felt more sharply by the groups established to attack McCain\nthrough television advertising, as the lavishly funded Media Fund attacked\nBush in 2004. \n\nThe chairman of Progressive Media USA, Brock, declined to comment on Obama\'s\nstance. \n\nMartin Frost, the president of America Votes, also suggested that the Obama\ncampaign stance had had more impact on media groups than on ones focused on\nturnout. \n\n"We\'re continguing with our fundraising and things have been going well for\nus," he said. "You really need to ask someone who\'s dealing with the media\naspect." \n\nBut Democrats who support the work of the media 527s say Obama\'s making a\nmistake. Progressive Media USA has aired anti-McCain television ads and\ndeveloped a website intended <http://mccainsource.com/>  to be a hub for\nnegative information about McCain. \n\n"Obama needs a baseline to the melody of his positive message," said a\nDemocratic strategist who backs the group\'s aims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
