john.podesta@gmail.comb'John --\n\nMy son, Daniel, was a smart, quiet kid.\n\nHe\'d just become a straight-A student, and he was\novercoming his shyness as a new member of the debate team.\n\nOn April 20th, 1999, my beautiful and bright 15-year-old\nson was killed by two teenagers with guns in the library of\nColumbine High School -- one of 12 innocent kids who lost\ntheir lives for no reason at all.\n\nIt\'s been 14 years since that horrible day -- 14 years of\nfighting so no family has to grieve like ours did.\n\nThese tragedies keep happening, and so far, Congress has\nfailed to take common-sense action to stop them -- even\nthough nine in 10 Americans have agreed that expanding\nbackground checks would help close the loopholes that put\nguns in the hands of dangerous people and prevent future\nviolence.\n\nToday, OFA and allied organizations are standing up for a\nnational Day of Action to ask members of Congress: What\nwill it take to finally act to prevent gun violence?\n\nI hope you\'ll join in -- say you\'ll do one thing this week\nto show Congress you want action to prevent gun violence:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Do-One-Thing-for-Gun-Violence-Prevention\n\nThe evening of the shooting at Columbine High was the most\nhopeless I\'ve ever felt.\n\nSince Daniel\'s death, I\'ve found a way to honor him: by\ntrying to prevent other families from feeling this pain.\nI\'ve advocated locally and nationally for smarter gun laws\n-- even helping achieve a statewide ballot victory here in\nColorado.\n\nIn December, when I heard about the shooting in Newtown, I\nsat in my office and broke down. I was watching another\ncommunity torn apart by guns -- more parents grieving, more\nkids who would never see graduation, or a wedding, or a\nfamily of their own.\n\nAnd in the wake of another tragedy, nine in 10 Americans\nagreed that it was time to act -- expand background checks\nto close the loopholes that put guns in the hands of\ndangerous people.\n\nBut Congress disappointed us, putting politics above the\nsafety of our kids.\n\nThat\'s why this week, we\'re asking: How many parents will\nhave to go through what I did before we say "enough"?\n\nYou should be a part of this, too. Tell Congress you\'re\ngoing to keep asking until they act:\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/Do-One-Thing-for-Gun-Violence-Prevention\n\nThank you,\n\nTom\n\nTom Mauser\nLittleton, Colorado\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaid for by Organizing for Action.\n\nThis email was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo update your address, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/change-address?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\nTo unsubscribe from these messages, go to: http://my.barackobama.com/unsubscription\nOrganizing for Action, P.O.
