a five,\nseven-day background check?\n\n\n\n*BERNIE SANDERS: *we are willing to look at anything that makes sense, that\nkeeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. but i\'m not\ngoing to be defensive on that issue. i lost an election in 1988, probably\nlost an election because i had the courage back then to say assault weapons\nshould not be sold in america.\n\n\n\n*CHUCK TODD: *let me ask you quickly about the iran deal. is iran still an\nenemy of the united states given what\'s going on? the improved diplomatic\nrelations?\n\n\n\n*BERNIE SANDERS: *it\'s funny. if you think back to 2007 during the campaign\nin which secretary clinton ran against barack obama she was critical of\nhim, a question was asked to obama and said "would you sit down and talk to\nthe iranians?" and he said "yeah, i would." point bag in you talk to your\nadversaries, you don\'t run away from that. secretary clinton i think called\nhim naive. turns out that obama was right so clearly we have many, many\nissues and many concerns with iran but clearly also we want to improve our\nrelationship with this very powerful country. i think the agreement to make\ncertain iran does not get a nuclear weapon was a huge step forward. the\nfact we have the prisoner release was a good important step forward. so i\nhope we can continue to go forward to improve relations with iran.\n\n\n\n*CHUCK TODD: *senator sanders, i\'ll leave it there. we\'ll look forward to\nseeing you, secretary clinton and martin o\'malley on stage on nbc thank\nyou, sir. it\'s going to be a humdinger of a debate. you heard senator\nsanders there mentioned hillary clinton in almost every single answer.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups\n"HRCRR" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an\nemail to hrcrr+unsubscribe@hillaryclinton.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrr@hillaryclinton.com.\n'
