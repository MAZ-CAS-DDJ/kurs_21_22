Will you\n   chip in $15 to help fight back?\n                                 [1]Donate Now\n\n   Dear John,\n\n   Anti-choice extremists just filed a lawsuit to overturn one of NARAL\n   Pro-Choice America's most important victories this year.^1\n\n   For years, anti-choice crisis pregnancy centers have been lying to women\n   about their reproductive health options. And California Gov. Jerry Brown\n   just signed a law we fought for to finally do something about it. Now\n   they're suing to get rid of it.\n\n   [2]We're launching an emergency campaign to defend this important law.\n   Will you chip in donate $15?\n\n   The Reproductive FACT Act simply requires facilities that offer pregnancy\n   information to inform women about the reproductive health-care services\n   available to them in California and for unlicensed facilities to disclose\n   that they are, in fact, unlicensed.\n\n   Seems pretty simple, right? No legitimate health-care provider should have\n   a problem with that... unless they have something to hide.\n\n   But that's exactly why the anti-abortion activists are suing. They want to\n   keep lying to women, and they know if they don't kill this law in\n   California, it will become a model for other states.\n\n   Passing this law was one of our biggest priorities this year, and we won.\n   NARAL Pro-Choice America researchers investigated the crisis pregnancy\n   centers, our policy staff crafted the legislation, and our grassroots\n   activists pushed for it.\n\n   California Attorney General Kamala Harris is a pro-choice champion who\n   will fight hard to defend this law. But we need to have her back. Will you\n   chip in to make sure we have the resources to win?\n\n   [3]Yes, I'll donate $15 to help defend abortion rights.\n\n   Thank you for helping to make reproductive freedom real for all women.\n\n   Ilyse G. Hogue\n   President, NARAL Pro-Choice America\n\n                                 [4]DONATE NOW\n\n   --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   Source:\n\n   1.
