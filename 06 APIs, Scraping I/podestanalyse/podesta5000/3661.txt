The book\'s\nrelease is the latest salvo from a conservative cottage industry that aims\nto make money and political hay out of both Benghazi and Clinton smears.\n\n\n\nKlein, a senior reporter for the birther site WND, is not a credible author\n-- one of his recent books portrayed President Obama as a "Manchurian\nCandidate" whose autobiography was ghostwritten by Bill Ayers.\n\n\n\nThe Washington Examiner\'s Paul Bedard, who reviewed an advance copy of\nKlein\'s Benghazi book, reported that Klein argues "Clinton was unwilling to\nprovide additional security to the diplomatic outpost and even played a\nrole in sending Stevens to his \'doomed mission.\'"\n\n\n\nKlein\'s contention that Clinton "was unwilling to provide additional\nsecurity to the diplomatic outpost" seems to reference the long-debunked\nconservative claim that the then-Secretary of State personally signed off\non cables rejecting requests for additional security. When congressional\nRepublicans first made that claim in April 2013, diplomatic reporters noted\nthat every cable sent to the State Department from overseas facilities is\naddressed to the secretary, and every cable sent from the State Department\nis signed by the secretary, even though the secretary rarely reviews them.\n\n\n\nIn her 2014 memoir, Clinton wrote that she had never seen the cables in\nquestion, stating, "That\'s not how it works. It shouldn\'t. And it didn\'t."\n\n\n\nKlein\'s claim that Clinton "played a role in sending Stevens" to his death\nin Benghazi has also been debunked. The State Department\'s Accountability\nReview Board reported that Stevens "made the decision to travel to Benghazi\nindependently of Washington, per standard practice," with the trip\'s timing\n"driven in part by commitments in Tripoli." Gregory Hicks, who was Stevens\'\ndeputy, also testified before Congress that the ambassador "chose to go" to\nBenghazi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Wall Street Journal: \xe2\x80\x9cMaryland Governor Inches Toward Presidential Run\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://online.wsj.com/articles/maryland-governor-martin-omalley-inches-toward-democratic-presidential-run-1409702260?mod=WSJ_hp_RightTopStories>*\n\n\n\nBy Peter Nicholas\n\nSeptember 2, 2014, 7:57 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] Fundraisers Say Gov. Martin O\'Malley Tells Them Hillary Clinton\nCandidacy Wouldn\'t Stop Him\n\n\n\nANNAPOLIS, Md.\xe2\x80\x94Democratic fundraisers say Maryland Gov. Martin O\'Malley has\ntold them he would enter the presidential race even if front-runner Hillary\nClinton is a candidate, suggesting she would face at least some competition\nfor her party\'s nomination from an established elected official if she runs.\n\n\n\nMr. O\'Malley\'s camp had signaled earlier this year that the governor likely\nwouldn\'t join the field if Mrs. Clinton sought the Democratic nomination.\nBut some party fundraisers say they have come away from private\nconversations with Mr. O\'Malley with a clear impression that he wouldn\'t\nstand down should Mrs. Clinton run.\n\n\n\nAs is the case with Mrs. Clinton, the governor says he is still deciding\nhis course. Asked if he would compete against Mrs. Clinton, Mr. O\'Malley,\nin a recent interview in the State House, said: "I\'m not inclined to talk\nabout that at this point. But I don\'t blame you for asking."\n\n\n\nDespite his public reticence, Mr. O\'Malley\'s message to fundraisers and\nother recent actions show him to be making the sorts of moves that would\nposition him for an eventual run.\n\n\n\nHe will be the keynote speaker at a Sept. 26 Democratic Party fundraising\ndinner in New Hampshire, the state that holds the nation\'s first primary,\nand has dispatched a couple of dozen campaign staffers to states with\ncompetitive races in the midterms. He is planning a trip to California\nlater in the month to raise money for a political-action committee he has\nused to give money to candidates and party committees in states that loom\nlarge in presidential races.\n\n\n\nHis PAC gave $5,000 to the New Hampshire Democratic Party in May and $2,500\nto a New Hampshire Democratic congresswoman in July, federal election\nrecords show.\n\n\n\n"He\'s building up a series of IOUs and he\'s showing a willingness to serve\nthe party, and he thereby creates goodwill," said Lou D\'Allesandro, a\nDemocratic state senator in New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nA two-term governor who leaves office in January, Mr. O\'Malley signed a law\nraising the state\'s minimum wage to $10.10 an hour by 2018. Last year,\nafter the shootings at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., he signed\nlegislation banning various kinds of assault weapons and imposing new\nlimits on the size of gun magazines. The same year, he pushed through the\nfirst state gas-tax increase since 1992, which supporters said was needed\nto improve the state\'s aging transportation network.\n\n\n\nThis summer, Mr. O\'Malley said unaccompanied minors illegally entering the\nU.S. shouldn\'t be returned to home countries where they would be in\ndanger\xe2\x80\x94a position at odds with the White House, which was warning that\nchildren who weren\'t eligible to remain in the U.S. would be sent home.\n\n\n\n"He should have been more of a centrist if he really thought he was going\nto run for president," said Kathy Szeliga, GOP whip in the state house of\ndelegates.\n\n\n\nAn O\'Malley supporter disputes that. "The proof is in the pudding," said\nMaryland state Sen. James Rosapepe, a Democrat. "We lead the region in job\ncreation, we have the best rated schools in the United States\xe2\x80\xa6So I think\nthat\'s a very mainstream record that will appeal to people across the\ncountry.\n\n\n\nDoug Goldman, a major fundraiser for President Barack Obama who lives in\nSan Francisco, said he met with Mr. O\'Malley privately in the spring.\n"Martin O\'Malley is making it pretty clear that his ultimate goal is\npresident of the United States," Mr. Goldman said. He said the governor\nindicated that, "Yes, that\'s the next step for him, that he is running."\n\n\n\nAnother Democratic fundraiser said he asked Mr. O\'Malley in recent months\nwhat he would do if Mrs. Clinton entered the race. This person said he\nasked because he didn\'t want to spend time assisting with Mr. O\'Malley\'s\nfundraising if in the end the governor would retreat in the face of a\nClinton candidacy. He "told me flat out he\'s going to run either way," the\nperson said.\n\n\n\nA third Democratic fundraiser said Mr. O\'Malley told supporters at an event\nlast year in California without qualification that he was running for\npresident.\n\n\n\nAides to Mr. O\'Malley said it is possible donors misconstrued the\ngovernor\'s unwillingness to rule out a bid against Mrs. Clinton as a clear\nstatement he would run against her. "Right now, he is thinking long and\nhard about this, and he will make his decision irrespective of what other\npeople do," an O\'Malley aide said.\n\n\n\nMr. O\'Malley\'s deliberations come as Democrats debate whether Mrs. Clinton\nwould clear the field should she run. Some of Mr. O\'Malley\'s supporters,\nalong with prominent Democrats nationally, say the better course would be\nto have a meaningful primary-election debate about the party\'s direction.\n\n\n\n"Competition is really good," said Terry Lierman, who has raised campaign\nmoney for Mr. O\'Malley. "It\'s good in business, it\'s good in sports and\nit\'s essential in politics. It makes better candidates.\xe2\x80\xa6I don\'t think\nMartin O\'Malley or any candidate should be scared by another candidate."\n\n\n\nA spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, Nick Merrill, said Tuesday: "She as much as\nanyone knows that running for president is a very personal and weighty\ndecision that people need to make on their own, based on whatever factors\nthey want to take into account."\n\n\n\nFor Mr. O\'Malley, a major hurdle is building a national profile. A July\nGallup Poll showed that, among Democrats and those who lean toward the\nparty, 84% had either never heard of or had no opinion of him. Polls have\nconsistently shown Mrs. Clinton with far more support than Mr. O\'Malley,\nVice President Joe Biden and other Democrats.\n\n\n\n"In 2008 Hillary Clinton was the favorite to win," said Bill Burton, who\nwas part of the 2008 Barack Obama campaign team that defeated Mrs. Clinton.\n"But in 2016 her infrastructure is so much bigger and her resources will be\nso much grander and the ability to spend money will be so much more vast\nthan it was in \'08 that it would be very tough for a primary contender to\nbeat her."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*MSNBC: \xe2\x80\x9cGlenn Beck: \xe2\x80\x98Hillary Clinton will be the next president\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/glenn-beck-hillary-clinton-will-be-the-next-president>*\n\nBy Alex Seitz-Wald\n\nSeptember 2, 2014, 5:53 p.m. EDT\n\nHe may have once called President Barack Obama the racist puppet of a vast\nglobal conspiracy, but conservative talk show host Glenn Beck seems to be\nmore sanguine about his potential replacement, Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nBeck, who left Fox News in 2011 to start his own media empire, predicted\nthis week that the former secretary of state will be the next president,\nand not through any kind of trickery or skullduggery.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton will be the next president of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\non his radio show Monday, citing a conversation he said a friend of his had\nwith some \xe2\x80\x9cHillary people\xe2\x80\x9d who outlined her alleged 2016 campaign plans.\nBeck said that as he heard the strategy laid out, he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cOh my gosh,\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s going to win the presidency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhile the right will be \xe2\x80\x9cfighting on Benghazi and everything else,\xe2\x80\x9d Beck\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cHillary is going to [say], \xe2\x80\x98Do you remember when America was good?\nDo you remember when we had jobs and we were building towards a brighter\nfuture, and things were really happening?

Instead, the pundit\nsaid that the potential candidate has a \xe2\x80\x9cvision for the future\xe2\x80\x9d while the\nGOP is \xe2\x80\x9call about the past,\xe2\x80\x9d with a focus on issues like the Benghazi\nincident and the IRS scandal.\n\n\n\nBeck\xe2\x80\x99s sourcing is, of course, dubious, and Clinton doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any kind\nof full-scale political strategy team around her yet. Still, many expect\nthe former first lady, who has said she will decide on a potential 2016\npresidential run by the end of this year, to draw on the popularity of her\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Blaze: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Glenn Beck Said Hillary Clinton \xe2\x80\x98Will Be the Next\nPresident of the United States\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/09/02/why-glenn-beck-said-hillary-clinton-will-be-the-next-president-of-the-united-states/>*\n\n\n\nBy Erica Ritz\n\nSeptember 2, 2014, 3:36 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nGlenn Beck said on his radio program Tuesday that \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton will be\nthe next president of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBeck said he received information from a friend of his, who is also friends\nwith the \xe2\x80\x9cHillary people,\xe2\x80\x9d about Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign strategy in 2016.

But Clinton\'s\nspeech is sure to be the biggest draw and attract the most scrutiny.\n\n\n\nHere what the energy world is watching for:\n\n\n\nWill She Split With Obama?\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest stories of Clinton\'s summer of media appearances was her\ncriticism of elements of President Obama\'s foreign policy in an interview\nwith The Atlantic. It\'s unclear whether any ruptures are in the offing on\nenergy and climate policy. Back when both were running for president in\n2008, they split over a gasoline-tax holiday (Clinton favored it, Obama\ndidn\'t).\n\n\n\nMore recently, Clinton has praised Obama\'s carbon regulations for power\nplants, but energy and climate policy are sprawling topics, so there\'s\nplenty of room for differences\xe2\x80\x94eventually.\n\n\n\nDo Climate Deniers Get an Olive Branch or a Baseball Bat?\n\n\n\nObama has minced no words of late when he talks about opponents to his\nclimate-change efforts, poking at members of Congress who "stubbornly and\nautomatically reject the scientific evidence about climate change." Clinton\nhas likewise been dismissive of climate deniers, but will she try to strike\na more conciliatory stance to keep open the prospect of cooperation with\nRepublican foes?\n\n\n\nAt a June speech at a Biotechnology Industry Organization conference,\nClinton instead went after the media for creating a "false equivalency" by\nbringing on climate deniers to balance the beliefs of 98 percent of\nscientists. "It isn\'t a debate," Clinton said. "The debate is settled. What\nis not settled is what we\'re going to do about the debate."\n\n\n\nFinessing the Fracking Boom\n\n\n\nThe U.S. oil and gas surge is a potential minefield for anyone facing\nDemocratic primaries, even a juggernaut like Clinton. Many\nenvironmentalists don\'t like Obama\'s "all of the above" mantra that\nembraces oil and gas drilling. But at the same time, the production boom\nhas given the U.S. more leverage on the global stage when it comes to\nissues like oil sanctions against Iran and the longer-term possibility of\nusing U.S. gas exports to counter Russia\'s influence in Europe\xe2\x80\x94topics\nClinton understands well.\n\n\n\nClinton, for her part, has praised the natural-gas surge while\nacknowledging environmental concerns with fracking and methane emissions,\ncalling for "smart regulations." How Clinton addresses oil and gas\ndevelopment, not to mention whether the U.S. should export crude oil, is\nsomething to watch this week (if she broaches it) and going forward.\n\n\n\nWe\'ll Always Have Paris \xe2\x80\xa6 to Look Forward To\n\n\n\nClinton devotes a chunk of Hard Choices, her recent State Department\nmemoir, to detailing her and Obama\'s work at the 2009 United Nations\nclimate summit in Copenhagen, which ultimately produced a voluntary\nagreement among countries to cut emissions. She\'s since said that she wants\nthe 2015 U.N. meetings in Paris to net a stronger deal, writing that her\nhope is for "a new legal agreement on emissions and mitigation that is\napplicable to every country in the world." Clinton made climate change a\nfocus of her State Department tenure and has talked up the international\nimplications on her book tour, so she\'ll likely keep the pressure high as\nleaders prepare for a climate summit in New York this month.\n\n\n\nDetails or Platitudes?\n\n\n\nThe crowd of energy executives, environmentalists, and clean-tech insiders\nat Reid\'s summit will be hungry for specifics on Clinton\'s energy plans.\n\n\n\nThere\'s plenty to wonder about, like Clinton\'s take on the future of energy\ntax credits (beyond the broad-brush support for "targeted incentives" from\nher recent book) and whether Clinton, who cosponsored cap-and-trade bills\nas New York senator, would try to push major climate and energy\nlegislation. The plans of a Clinton Environmental Protection Agency are a\nkey topic too, including whether she would push for carbon-emissions rules\nfor sources like refineries and big factories that won\'t face regulation on\nObama\'s watch.\n\n\n\nBut the crowd may go home disappointed: There\'s nothing to stop Clinton\nfrom playing it safe by speaking only in broad strokes about the economic\nbenefits of leading in green-energy markets, climate risks, and energy\nsecurity.\n\n\n\nClinton may be more likely to stray into the world of energy diplomacy.\nHard Choices touts formation of the department\'s Bureau of Energy Resources\non her watch. The book counts energy among the topics that must be at the\n"heart" of American diplomacy. How she applies that idea to hot spots like\nUkraine going forward is something that will surface sooner or later on the\nstump.\n\n\n\nDon\'t Get Your Hopes Up About Keystone\n\n\n\nClinton has so far artfully dodged weighing in on the controversial\nAlberta-to-Gulf Coast oil-sands pipeline, declining to mention the Keystone\nXL in her book and sidestepping direct questions about it. Take this answer\nfrom a June interview with the Toronto Globe & Mail: "[T]his particular\ndecision is a very difficult one because there are so many factors at play.\nI can\'t really comment at great length because I had responsibility for it\nand it\'s been passed on and it wouldn\'t be appropriate, but I hope that\nCanadians appreciate that the United States government\xe2\x80\x94the Obama\nadministration\xe2\x80\x94is trying to get it right."\n\n\n\nIt\'s unlikely that Clinton will break her silence on the pipeline this\nweek, especially since the State Department will weigh in on the pipeline\'s\npermit after the November midterms and before her own campaign would start\nin earnest, giving her some measure of cover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Advocate opinion: Kerry Eleveld: \xe2\x80\x9cClinton\xe2\x80\x99s New Challenge: The\nMillennials\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.advocate.com/politics/2014/09/03/clinton%E2%80%99s-new-challenge-millennials?page=0,0>*\n\n\n\nBy Kerry Eleveld, former Advocate White House reporter\n\nSeptember 3, 2014, 4:00 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] Millennials are more progressive on LGBT rights than Hillary\nwas in 2008. Can she inspire them to the polls in a 2016 run?\n\n\n\nIf there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing no one expected, it\xe2\x80\x99s that Hillary Clinton would make\none of her first campaign missteps over the gays. But there it is. Clinton\nwent after NPR\xe2\x80\x99s Fresh Air interviewer Terry Gross in June during a\nseven-minute exchange about same-sex marriage, DOMA, and whether Clinton\nhad an actual change of heart on marriage equality or simply changed her\npolitical calculation as voter attitudes shifted.\n\n\n\nNot all seven minutes were a disaster. Clinton lost her cool only in the\nlast minute and a half. It\xe2\x80\x99s also not clear that her main offense was\nsubstance so much as it was tone, though some publications, such as The\nAtlantic, argued otherwise. But after Gross tried several times to nail\ndown Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s true motivations for changing her marriage position,\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s patience waned.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I have to say, I think you are being very persistent, but you\nare playing with my words, and playing with what is such an important\nissue,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n\n\n\nGross pressed gently forward. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to clarify so I can\nunderstand \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9d Then came Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s worst moment.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you are trying to clarify,\xe2\x80\x9d she charged. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re\ntrying to say I used to be opposed and now I\xe2\x80\x99m in favor and I did it for\npolitical reasons. And that\xe2\x80\x99s just flat wrong. So let me just state what I\nfeel that you are implying and repudiate it. I have a strong record. I have\na great commitment to this issue. And I am proud of what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done and the\nprogress we\xe2\x80\x99re making.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nUp to that point, Clinton had played the happy warrior most of the way\nthrough the marriage questioning, telling Gross \xe2\x80\x9cI think we have all\nevolved\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m proud of our country.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe interview was sliced and diced and reinterpreted to death by the\nBeltway media. It was, in fact, interesting to see Clinton stumble on a key\nissue involving a constituency that has mostly adored her for years. After\nall, a November 2007 poll by Hunter College found that lesbian, gay, and\nbisexual likely voters preferred Clinton (63%) over Obama (22%) and Edwards\n(7%), which roughly corresponds to what 2008 exit polls in New York and\nCalifornia wound up showing.\n\n\n\nMost interesting is the media\xe2\x80\x99s fascination with Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s past positions\non LGBT issues \xe2\x80\x94 as if this movement\xe2\x80\x99s aims are complete and all that\nremains is to explore the subject in historical terms. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s past is\nthe least interesting part of her positions and probably the least of her\nworries on same-sex marriage and LGBT issues.\n\n\n\nWhat lies ahead could very well be a marriage case at the Supreme Court in\neither 2015 or 2016. If people think questions about Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s previous\nstances were thorny, try these: Do you support full marriage equality\nacross the nation? As president, would your administration write an amicus\nbrief supporting the freedom to marry nationwide? Now that ENDA is on the\nouts, do you support an amendment adding gender identity and sexual\norientation to the Civil Rights Act of 1964?\n\n\n\nIf your only audience is the LGBT community, the answers are easy: Yes to\nall. But from Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, answering that way on the marriage\nquestions could give a mainstream audience pause. In fact, during her\ninterview with Gross, Clinton reiterated her 2008 stance, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cfor me,\nmarriage had always been a matter left to the states.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThat answer may have worked in 2008 in the shadow of a proposed federal\namendment that would have banned same-sex marriage nationwide. But it won\xe2\x80\x99t\nseem appealing to queer rights activists today, and it\xe2\x80\x99s uncertain from the\ninterview whether Clinton thinks any differently now than she did then.\n\n\n\nThe question about the Civil Rights Act, meanwhile, is still gaining\ntraction in the LGBT community and has yet to debut with the broader\nDemocratic base \xe2\x80\x94 in particular, African Americans. So just as people\nwondered in 2008, How do you plan to repeal DADT?, this election cycle they\nwill wonder, How do you plan to secure employment and housing protections\nfor LGBT Americans?\n\n\n\nThe difference between LGBT issues in 2008 and now is that the answers are\nless clear-cut. And there isn\xe2\x80\x99t complete consensus within the LGBT\ncommunity on the path forward. Additionally, Clinton isn\xe2\x80\x99t yet running amid\na pack of other candidates, so she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the cover of comparisons to\nher opponents. She is being judged against herself.\n\n\n\nIn the last contested Democratic presidential campaign, for instance, as\nearly as June 2007, all eight Democratic candidates supported repealing\n\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d And by August 2007, the big three \xe2\x80\x94 Hillary\nClinton, John Edwards, and Barack Obama \xe2\x80\x94 had settled comfortably into a\nconsensus of supporting civil unions, repealing \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d\npassing ENDA, and overturning the Defense of Marriage Act. Trying to\ndifferentiate between their policy positions was a matter of splitting\nhairs. For the candidates, that meant that wooing the LGBT community was\nlargely about outreach and access; it was more tonal than substantive.\n\n\n\nNow we\xe2\x80\x99re in uncharted territory as the LGBT movement pushes past the\nremnants of its 2008 issues. And Clinton, for the time being, must confront\nthe dual challenges of tone and substance.\n\n\n\nThe question now becomes, is it possible for her to be a leader and a\ncandidate at the same time? Candidates typically don\xe2\x80\x99t lead. They\nfollow...the polls. They take positions that both they and a majority of\nthe public can feel good about. Then they work on being likable and\ninstilling confidence in their ability to run the country. Obama, for\ninstance, didn\xe2\x80\x99t provide a road map to change in 2008; he offered a vehicle\n\xe2\x80\x94 himself \xe2\x80\x94 and asked the nation to trust him.\n\n\n\nBeyond name recognition, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s head start in 2016 clearly lies in her\nability to govern. The only candidate who comes close to matching her grasp\nof foreign and domestic policy or her 360-degree view of Washington from\nthe White House to Congress to the federal agencies is Vice President Joe\nBiden. Yet even he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the benefit of having served as Secretary\nof State.\n\n\n\nBut Clinton still needs to inspire people to jump on her bandwagon in the\nsame way Obama did in 2008. And insofar as LGBT issues are concerned in\n2016, one of her biggest audiences won\xe2\x80\x99t simply be the queer community; it\nwill be millennials who voted for Obama at a rate of 66% in 2008 and 60% in\n2012. If Clinton is to re-create Obama\xe2\x80\x99s voting blocs in the general\nelection, she needs to win their vote by large margins, but she also needs\nto inspire them to turn out at the polls in numbers similar to 2008 and\n2012, when they made up 18% and 19% of the electorate, respectively.\n\n\n\nIf Clinton wants to do that, LGBT rights is the place to start. Fully 51%\nof millennials consider themselves supporters of gay rights, according to\nthe Pew Research Center, as opposed to just 37% of Gen X\xe2\x80\x99ers and about a\nthird of older adults. In fact LGBT rights is one of the most galvanizing\nissues for millennials. By comparison, 49% describe themselves as\npatriotic, just 36% as religious, and only 32% as environmentalists. This\ngroup matters for Clinton in both the primaries and the general election.\nIn Iowa in 2008, Obama took 57 percent of voters under 30, shocking the\nDemocratic establishment with a win that would fuel his eventual victory.\n\n\n\nThough some gays are intent on rehashing the \xe2\x80\x9990s, the millennials likely\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking for authenticity on the issues of today, as\nwill many LGBT Americans. And while LGBT voters have a long history with\nClinton, millennials are still just getting to know her. She needs to give\nthem a reason to go to the polls, and looking like a leader on LGBT issues\nis one way to do it.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s unclear that relying on the states\xe2\x80\x99 rights fallback on marriage\nequality is going to fill the bill. And sooner or later, journalists will\nstart asking the marriage question in a way that forces Clinton to choose\nbetween states\xe2\x80\x99 rights and full federal equality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Los Angeles Times opinion: Michele Willens, guest blogger: \xe2\x80\x9cThe question\nisn\'t really \'will Hillary Clinton run?\' but rather \'can\'t we do better\'?\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-hillary-clinton-president-2016-20140902-story.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Michele Willens\n\nSeptember 2, 2014, 2:29 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nA significant number of Republican women \xe2\x80\x94 49% \xe2\x80\x94 find their party \xe2\x80\x9cstuck in\nthe past.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s according to an internal memo from the conservative\ngroups Crossroads GPS and American Action Network that made the rounds last\nweek.\n\n\n\nThis would seem to be the perfect moment, then, for a female presidential\ncandidate of any stripe. The problem is there is only one on the horizon,\nHillary Rodham Clinton, who has to overcome a queasiness that polls don\xe2\x80\x99t\nquite know how to measure. Is it a combination of political cynicism,\nfeminist angst, post-menopausal petulance and postponed pride felt by many\nof us who want to embrace this woman as well as what she represents?\n\n\n\nI keep recalling the words of a friend in Massachusetts who said recently,\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery time I get right up to the point of finally liking Hillary, she does\nsomething that knocks me right back down again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nI am not alone in my hesitancy to put my arms around Hillary, but neither\nam I necessarily the norm. Judging by the long lines at the bookstores,\nthere are real fans, or at least many who want to say they shook hands with\npotential history. So why, when I should be celebrating the possible\ncoronation of one of my own, am I instead filled with conflicting emotions?\n\n\n\n   - The feminist in me applauds any \xe2\x80\x9cmature\xe2\x80\x9d woman who lets her years of\n   accomplishment, and lines of experience, speak for themselves. The\n   narcissist in me wishes Hillary would lose 15 pounds and get to the\n   dermatologist.\n\n\n\n   - The fighter in me is impressed that as secretary of State, she was the\n   toughest one in those White House meetings. The liberal in me wishes she\xe2\x80\x99d\n   lean *out* when it comes to warfare. And lean *in *on issues like\n   Ferguson before her consultants calculate it is OK to do it.\n\n\n\n   - The Ms. in me accepts she has a unique marriage that works. The Mrs.\n   wishes she would draw a few boundaries. (Did he really have to deliver the\n   eulogy for the man who funded all those anti-Clinton programs?)\n\n\n\n   - The professional in me is envious she is making a zillion dollars an\n   hour for her first-class time. The private citizen in me is offended by her\n   tone-deaf idea of what is fair.\n\n\n\n   - The boomer in me is thrilled to see an older woman succeed. The\n   realist in me is concerned she would be 69 as she begins the toughest job\n   in the world.\n\n\n\n   - The historian in me appreciates the commitment of families like the\n   Adamses, the Roosevelts and the Kennedys. The voter in me is really tired\n   of the Clintons.\n\n\n\nThis all may qualify as one of those white women\xe2\x80\x99s problems, but it is\nentirely possible that Hillary is the lens through which many of us see\nourselves.\n\n\n\nWhat really rankles, though, is the Clinton sense of entitlement. For some\nreason, I think back to a classmate who was elected student body president\nof Lincoln Junior High in Santa Monica three straight years. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nremember anyone particularly liking her \xe2\x80\x94 she was that girl who got high\nscores and never once detention \xe2\x80\x94but she made us feel that we should honor\nher. A friend in Seattle, a longtime Democrat barely getting by as a\nlandlord, summed it up with, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I guess we\xe2\x80\x99re stuck with Hillary.\xe2\x80\x9d That\nsense of inevitability not only conjures up resentment toward those who\nalways got in, but it also reminds us how many of us felt left out.\n\n\n\nIs all this too much to place on one person\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders? Of course it is,\nnot to mention asking her to embody an idea whose time has come. Barack\nObama did it, but he had an arguably greater personal story, and he was new\nschool. Hillary has paid her dues, stood by her man and devoted most her\nlife to public service. But one thing feminism has taught us is not to\nsettle, and in that spirit, I wonder if others aren\xe2\x80\x99t as qualified,\nincluding Claire McCaskill and Elizabeth Warren \xe2\x80\x94 maybe even someone from\nthe party still \xe2\x80\x9cstuck in the past.\xe2\x80\x9d Hey, maybe my former classmate is\navailable.\n\n\n\nAh well, Hillary is the ultimate survivor, and for that alone, I will\nlikely give her my vote, if not a hug.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Politico: Roger Simon: \xe2\x80\x9cIs Mitt Romney really a loser for life?\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/is-mitt-romney-really-a-loser-for-life-simon-says-110521.html?ml=co>*\n\n\n\nBy Roger Simon\n\nSeptember 3, 2014, 5:13 a.m. EDT\n\n\n\nUnlikely as it might seem, Mitt Romney actually put it best.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have looked at what happens to anybody in this country who loses as the\nnominee of their party,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThey become a loser for life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHere he makes a gesture with his right hand, forming his thumb and index\nfinger into an \xe2\x80\x9cL\xe2\x80\x9d and holding it up to his forehead as if it were a\nbranding iron.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe just brutalize whoever loses,\xe2\x80\x9d Romney says. \xe2\x80\x9cI know that. I know that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThis is from the documentary \xe2\x80\x9cMitt,\xe2\x80\x9d which was released this year and\ncovers Romney\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 and 2012 campaigns.\n\n\n\nRomney was aware that if he ran for the nomination in 2008 and failed to\nget it, this would not be fatal. Numerous failed nominees have gone on to\nget the nomination in future contests.\n\n\n\nBut if one gets the nomination and then fails to win the presidency, that\nis a different story.\n\n\n\nRepublican Thomas Dewey did it, losing in both 1944 and 1948. Democrat\nAdlai Stevenson did it, losing in both 1952 and 1956. And Richard Nixon did\nit, losing the presidency in 1960, but winning it in 1968.\n\n\n\nBut this is ancient history in political terms. In modern times, if you get\nyour party\xe2\x80\x99s nomination and then lose the general election, nobody wants to\nhear from you again.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMike Dukakis is mowing lawns,\xe2\x80\x9d Romney says.\n\n\n\nBut Romney enters the fray anyway, losing the nomination in 2008, winning\nthe nomination in 2012, but losing the general election.\n\n\n\nSo Romney should be, by his own analysis, a \xe2\x80\x9closer for life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut odd things are happening. Republican candidates have been asking him to\nstump for them in the November elections, and he has been glad to oblige.\n\n\n\nA CNN/ORC poll released in late July asked people whom they would vote for\nif the 2012 election were held again. Romney won by 9 percentage points, 53\npercent to 44 percent. (In the actual election, Romney lost by 3.9\npercentage points.)\n\n\n\nOne can dismiss this as typical buyer\xe2\x80\x99s remorse: Presidents never quite\nlive up to expectations, and challengers always look better in retrospect.\nBut one senior Republican strategist told me dryly: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember\nanyone urging John Kerry to run for president again after he lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIs anybody really urging Romney to run again, however?\n\n\n\nIowans seem to like the idea. A recent Suffolk University poll of Iowa\ncaucus-goers showed Romney topping the field with 35 percent and Mike\nHuckabee an almost invisible second with just 9 percent.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d love to run for president; I loved running for president,\xe2\x80\x9d Romney told\nradio talk show host Hugh Hewitt last week. \xe2\x80\x9cHad I believed I would\nactually be best positioned to beat Hillary Clinton, then I would be\nrunning.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRomney says, however, that some player to be named later could be a better\ncandidate. \xe2\x80\x9cI actually believe that someone new that is not defined yet,\nsomeone who perhaps is from the next generation, will be able to catch\nfire, potentially build a movement and be able to beat Hillary Clinton,\xe2\x80\x9d\nRomney said.\n\n\n\nRepublicans are already looking past their biggest weakness \xe2\x80\x94 the current\nRepublican field \xe2\x80\x94 to what they believe will be their biggest strength:\nHillary Clinton as the standard-bearer for Obama\xe2\x80\x99s third term.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think Hillary is going to own the Obama record,\xe2\x80\x9d Stuart Stevens, who was\nRomney\xe2\x80\x99s chief strategist in 2012, told me. \xe2\x80\x9cIn many ways it looks like\n2016 will be a referendum on Obama in the same way 2008 was a referendum on\n[George W.] Bush.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhich is the race Republicans would like: to bury Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s popularity\nunder Obama\xe2\x80\x99s unpopularity. But Hillary could upset that strategy by\ndistancing herself from Obama, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\n\n\n\nStevens doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think so. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Hillary says something even mildly critical\nof the Obama administration, the Democratic base erupts with hostility,\xe2\x80\x9d\nStevens said.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton is no dope, however. She will find a way to distance\nherself from Obama where she can. But this plays right into the Romney game\nplan, said one former top Romney aide.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be Barack Obama? Fine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the aide.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe person who is most not Barack Obama is Mitt Romney. If he decided to\nrun, he\xe2\x80\x99d have a good chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWashington Post senior correspondent Dan Balz, author of \xe2\x80\x9cCollision 2012:\nThe Future of Election Politics in a Divided America,\xe2\x80\x9d just released in\npaperback, said Romney was not a particularly good campaigner in 2012 but\n\xe2\x80\x9che had some things to say in the campaign that look smarter in retrospect\nthan they did at the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBalz says that Romney\xe2\x80\x99s campaign statements about Russia being \xe2\x80\x9ca\ngeopolitical foe\xe2\x80\x9d today looks \xe2\x80\x9cmore astute than he was given credit for.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut Balz is not predicting that Romney will run in 2016.

O\xe2\x80\x99Leary\n\nSeptember 2, 2014, 4:26 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton revved up the true believers in a weekday\nrally putting the onus on them to get a second term for Gov. Dannel P.\nMalloy.\n\n\n\nIn a reprise of help he gave Malloy in 2010, Clinton was back in the state,\nthis time in New Haven \xe2\x80\x94 a city he knows well, having graduated from Yale\nLaw School in 1973, along with his wife, Hillary Clinton, and U.S. Sen.\nRichard Blumenthal. Clinton stopped by Katalina\xe2\x80\x99s bakery before heading to\nthe Omni New Haven Hotel at Yale.\n\n\n\nThe 42nd president of the United States said party members only have a few\nweeks to determine how this tight race turns out, with some polls showing\nRepublican contender Tom Foley pulling ahead.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe polls ... are based on an assumption that the turnout in a mid-term\nelection will be very different than a turnout in a presidential election.\nIf that happens, shame on us,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n\n\n\nThe president offered an analogy.\n\n\n\nRemembering his time in a cottage in Milford more than 40 years ago, he\nsaid he would watch as people walked out to a nearby island, but then\nforgot about the tide.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love Connecticut. You have been good to me in personal and political\nways. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to take your eye off the tides in this election,\xe2\x80\x9d\nClinton said.\n\n\n\nClinton said based on Malloy\xe2\x80\x99s record, he \xe2\x80\x9cshould be re-elected by 10\npoints or more, going away,\xe2\x80\x9d which brought cheers from several hundred\nparty regulars, elected officials and campaign staffers in the hourlong pep\nrally.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a job to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he told them again and again.\n\n\n\nThere were also references to Hillary Clinton and what the next two years\nmean for her.\n\n\n\nAlluding to her expected run for president in 2016, New Haven Mayor Toni\nHarp welcomed the \xe2\x80\x9chomecoming for the first President Clinton.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton said he was \xe2\x80\x9ccaptivated\xe2\x80\x9d by Malloy in 2010, learning how he\novercame his personal challenges of dyslexia.\n\n\n\nMalloy is an example of a true leader, who will make the hard decisions,\nClinton said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want somebody who won\xe2\x80\x99t look at the polls, but will look at the future\nand think about what is good for the children. ... Are things coming\ntogether or being torn apart?\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton asked.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy those tests, this man has more than earned the chance to finish the job\nhe started four years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d the former president said, also to cheers from\nthe crowd.\n\n\n\nClinton said a leader has vision, a strategy, executes that strategy and\nhandles \xe2\x80\x9cincoming fire.\xe2\x80\x9d He said Malloy hits all those targets. He said the\nRepublican mantra is the promise to cut taxes.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been listening to this for over 30 years. They talk tough, but they\ngovern soft,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n\n\n\nThe Connecticut Republican Party, in a statement, said the event was\n\xe2\x80\x9cpoorly attended.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems like Bill Clinton can fill any room in the country, unless he\xe2\x80\x99s\nsharing the stage with Dan Malloy,\xe2\x80\x9d said CT GOP spokesman Zak Sanders. \xe2\x80\x9cAt\nthis point even Democrats can sense that Gov. Malloy is falling far behind,\nand enthusiasm in his campaign is waning.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDan Malloy has proved that he is willing to do or say whatever it takes to\nget re-elected and, with desperation setting in, he\xe2\x80\x99s decided to make his\ncampaign about cheap personal attacks instead of the real issues facing our\nstate. Voters know that we need new leadership and a new direction for\nConnecticut\xe2\x80\x99s future \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s why they\xe2\x80\x99re supporting Tom Foley and\nHeather Somers,\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders said.\n\n\n\nClinton said he was the last president to make headway on gun control by\npassing the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban and by eliminating\nammunition clips. He said he countered the criticism then by pointing out\nto gun owners that they can still hunt, sport shoot and protect their\nfamilies.\n\n\n\nHe said that is the message in Connecticut and added that \xe2\x80\x9cyou have to have\nuniversal background checks, you got to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton said the agenda of Malloy and Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman is specific.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir opponent basically says they made too many hard decisions, too many\npeople said \xe2\x80\x98ouch.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Vote for me I will make it easy on you. I\xe2\x80\x99m just going\nto cut everybody\xe2\x80\x99s taxes. Hold on, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you later where we are going\nto go,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n\n\n\nScott McLean, political science professor at Quinnipiac University, said\noutside surrogates are needed by both campaigns.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth Clinton and (New Jersey Gov. Chris) Christie are in our state not\nonly to raise cash, but also to give much-needed charisma transplants to\nthe gubernatorial candidates,\xe2\x80\x9d McLean said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolls show voters just aren\xe2\x80\x99t enthusiastic for either (Tom) Foley or\nMalloy,\xe2\x80\x9d McLean said.\n\n\n\nThe party faithful with tickets paid $50 for the privilege to hear Clinton,\nwhile shortly before the rally started a small group of bigger donors met\nwith the president, but there was no comment on how much they raised.\n\n\n\nMalloy and Foley have multiple debates scheduled before Nov. 4, while\nindependent expenditure groups are pouring millions into Connecticut for\ntheir own ads.\n\n\n\nClinton is in demand as a speaker in a party that fears it will lose\ncontrol of the U.S. Senate in November.\n\n\n\nThe elected party leaders took turns praising Malloy and denigrating Foley.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are always things we can do better in this state, but I am sick and\ntired of Tom Foley telling me how terrible my state is. I am sick and tired\nof the constant incessant daily pessimism that comes out of Republican\ncandidates and at some level, they are living in alternate reality,\xe2\x80\x9d U.S.\nSen. Chris Murphy said.\n\n\n\nThe senator delivered the harshest criticism of Foley, saying his\nmotivation is to \xe2\x80\x9cpad his resume,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than acting through a passion for\ngoverning.\n\n\n\nHe said Foley\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to expound on his positions \xe2\x80\x9cis half political\nstrategy and half indifference.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMurphy said Malloy is \xe2\x80\x9csomebody who loves the state and wants to make it\neven better, versus someone who talks down the state at every opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMurphy said he was \xe2\x80\x9cdamn proud\xe2\x80\x9d of the boost in the minimum wage and the\n60,000 private sector jobs brought on during the administration.\n\n\n\nThe junior senator said he was happy to be from the state that says it\nshould be the law of the land \xe2\x80\x9cthat if you are so sick that you can\xe2\x80\x99t show\nup for work, you should be able to stay home for work and still get\ncompensated occasionally for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe said during the Clinton years, poverty and unemployment dropped and \xe2\x80\x9call\nboats were being lifted,\xe2\x80\x9d a model for states.\n\n\n\nNot to dampen the achievements of Clinton, Murphy said unemployment\nnationally dropped by 2 percentage points in four years\xe2\x80\x99 time. Under\nMalloy, it is down almost 3 percentage points in the same timeframe, Murphy\nsaid. It was 9.3 percent in 2011 and is now 6.6 percent.\n\n\n\nThe message from all the speakers was that Malloy has a \xe2\x80\x9cgreat story to\ntell,\xe2\x80\x9d as they listed a dip in crime and a start on universal\npre-kindergarten and he challenged the Republican candidate to match\nMalloy\xe2\x80\x99s record.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ready to go out and tell the story to the people of Connecticut?\xe2\x80\x9d\nMurphy asked.\n\n\n\nBlumenthal and Wyman continued the analogies between Clinton and Malloy.\n\n\n\nAll of them emphasized the strict gun reform bill adopted in April 2013 in\nthe wake of the killing of 20 first-graders and six educators in Newtown in\nDecember 2012 that has become a point of contention with Foley.\n\n\n\nMurphy called it Malloy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdeepest\xe2\x80\x9d achievement, while the governor\ncharacterized it as \xe2\x80\x9cgreat.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe said it has been a tough four years given Newtown, the economy and the\nnumerous devastating storms.\n\n\n\nMalloy described Foley as a \xe2\x80\x9cguy who prays for rain on a sunny day. This is\nthe guy who purchased a seat in the cheap section and has been making cheap\nshots ever since the last election was over. He actually feels that he is\nentitled to be the governor of the state of Connecticut.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got news for you, you run to be the governor of the state of\nConnecticut,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nContinuing the theme of a negative picture of Connectiuct, Malloy said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t put down the state I was born in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe predicted Foley will cut funding to schools and cut funding to towns so\nthere will be municipal cuts, based on his tax and budget proposals.\n\n\n\nFoley, however, has said he would not do either, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said where\nhe would cut as he holds funding flat for two years with a projected $1.4\nbillion deficit in fiscal 2016. He wants to eliminate the business entity\ntax and cut the sales tax from 6.35 percent to 5.85 percent.\n\n\n\nMalloy said Foley would \xe2\x80\x9cstack the pardons and parole board to do what he\nwants done\xe2\x80\x9d on gun control.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is worth having a fight over. We have to make the people of\nConnecticut as safe as we possibly can and that is what we will do,\xe2\x80\x9d Malloy\nsaid.\n\n\n\nThe gun issue is expected to play a part in the election with the\n15,000-member Connecticut Citizens Defense League endorsing Foley.\n\n\n\nFoley disagrees with the punishment for not registering the weapons that\nhave been added to the greatly expanded list of banned firearms. He has\nsaid he would recommend to the state\xe2\x80\x99s attorney that he not prosecute\nviolators and he would impact the law by the people he names to the pardon\nboard.\n\n\n\nMalloy said Foley will end up cutting jobs just like he did at the Bibb Co.\nwhen he ran it in the 1990s. The Democrats continue to hammer him on Bibb,\nsomething they also did in 2010 when Malloy ran against him the first time.\n\n\n\nFoley has said he added 3,000 jobs at Bibb before it went into bankruptcy\nunder his management. It closed after it was sold.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not a job creator, he is a job destroyer,\xe2\x80\x9d Malloy said.\n\n\n\nIn a quick press conference after the event, Malloy asked Foley where he\nwould have cut in 2010 faced with the $3.6 billion deficit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*BuzzFeed: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Exactly Is Amy Klobuchar Up To?\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/katenocera/what-exactly-is-amy-klobuchar-up-to#2wwn3q7>*\n\n\n\nBy Kate Nocera\n\nSeptember 2, 2014, 10:04 p.m. EDT\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] The relatively unknown Minnesota Democrat has been all over the\ncountry this year.\n\n\n\nA few weeks ago at a Washington cocktail party, Sen. Amy Klobuchar was\nchatting with someone who asked why she was going to Iowa again.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was invited!\xe2\x80\x9d Klobuchar insisted, laughing, an attendee who heard the\nconversation recalled.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic Senator is being invited a lot of places these days \xe2\x80\x94 which\nis surprising considering her name I.D. outside of her home state of\nMinnesota isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly sky high. Klobuchar has crisscrossed the country in\nthe last few months, keynoting Democratic Party Dinners, fundraising for\nSenate candidates (her PAC has maxed out to several candidates), and\nbuilding up her profile with the party base. She\xe2\x80\x99s toured a popcorn store\nwith Bruce Braley in Iowa, co-chaired an economic roundtable with Jeanne\nShaheen in New Hampshire, and spoke at the Sanford Hunt Frye in North\nCarolina on behalf of Sen. Kay Hagan. All told, Klobuchar has traveled to\nmore than 10 states this cycle.\n\n\n\nFurious travel schedules like these are usually meant to do one thing:\nproduce a big spike in a politician\xe2\x80\x99s influence.\n\n\n\nOne Democratic operative compared Klobuchar\xe2\x80\x99s 2014 to what Sen. Kirsten\nGillibrand has done in recent cycles.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGillibrand had a little bit more of a profile \xe2\x80\x94 she was starting at a\nslightly higher base than Amy does,\xe2\x80\x9d the operative said. \xe2\x80\x9cGillibrand was\nusing her \xe2\x80\x98off the sidelines\xe2\x80\x99 project to build a national base and now she\nis, if not a household name, a Democratic base-hold name and I think Amy\nwants to do the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nLike Gillibrand, Klobuchar maintains the relentless campaigning is in\nservice of a bigger goal: electing more Democratic women to the Senate.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve gone this around the country a lot because we don\xe2\x80\x99t have that many\nwomen in the Senate, though about a year ago we had a traffic jam in the\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s bathroom for the first time in history,\xe2\x80\x9d the senator said in an\ninterview. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I\xe2\x80\x99ve been helping them. It goes back to when I headed up the\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s Senate network for the last two cycles of the [Democratic\nSenatorial Campaign Committee].\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nKlobuchar has been deeply involved with Emily\xe2\x80\x99s List, a group that works to\nhelp elect women supportive of abortion rights. She co-chairs the group\xe2\x80\x99s\n\xe2\x80\x9cimpact series\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 quartly events that highlight the work of women supported\nby Emily\xe2\x80\x99s List are doing in Congress. During the 2012 cycle, when\nKlobuchar was up for re-election and doing well, she worked in both\nWisconsin and North Dakota to help with the elections of Tammy Baldwin and\nHeidi Heitkamp.\n\n\n\nShe went to Georgia to help Michelle Nunn this time around \xe2\x80\x94 a weird place\nfor a progressive midwestern senator. What does a Minnesota senator have in\ncommon with the voters of Georgia? A lot if you ask Klobuchar, who argued\nGeorgia and Minnesota are more alike than different in terms of their\nbusiness and farming communities.\n\n\n\nThat trip speaks to a core reason for Klobuchar\xe2\x80\x99s schedule: no one would be\ninviting her anywhere if they thought she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any good. Operatives\ndescribe Klobuchar as approachable and likeable on the stump.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople may not know who she is, but they walk away from her liking her and\nunderstanding her message,\xe2\x80\x9d said a campaign staffer for one Democratic\ncandidate in a tight race.\n\n\n\nAnd while Klobuchar\xe2\x80\x99s certainly cognizant of the big priority (keeping the\nSenate in Democratic hands), the progressive senator emphasized the\nimportance of moderate, red state Democrats in the Senate.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of it is trying to elect good people trying to move the country\nforward and not just stand in corners of the boxing ring,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\nme that\xe2\x80\x99s very, very important. The majority people that are up would be\nconsidered moderate Democrats and they do try and find common ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are people that want to get things done for the country and that\xe2\x80\x99s\nwhy this election to me is so important and of course getting these women\nelected, knowing how fragile this is,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cWe lose them, we\nlose a good part of the women in the Senate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nKlobuchar ticked off the accomplishments of her female colleagues this past\ncongress: Patty Murray\xe2\x80\x99s work on the budget negotiations, Debbie Stabenow\xe2\x80\x99s\nwork on the farm bill, Barbara Mikulski\xe2\x80\x99s work as appropriations chairwoman.\n\n\n\nShe left herself off the list. But, like Gillibrand, she\xe2\x80\x99s likely got some\nnext thing in mind.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one of these senators thinks that he or she can be the next\npresident of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist\nand Harry Reid\xe2\x80\x99s former communications director. \xe2\x80\x9cClearly she has\nambitions; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they are right now. Is she building chips in\nthe caucus as she moves up the ladder in the Senate or is it broader than\nthat? I just can\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Daily Beast: \xe2\x80\x9cGail Sheehy Books Passage to the Past\xe2\x80\x9d\n<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/03/gail-sheehy-books-passage-to-the-past.html>*\n\n\n\nBy Lizzie Crocker\n\nSeptember 3, 2014\n\n\n\n[Subtitle:] The legendary journalist and \xe2\x80\x98Passages\xe2\x80\x99 author talks about her\nnew memoir, the glory days of the new journalism, and the denizens of Grey\nGardens.\n\n\n\nIn the summer of 1971, reporter Gail Sheehy fled Manhattan every weekend\nfor East Hampton, seeking an escape from what had become a six-month\ninvestigation into prostitution in New York City. But instead of tending to\nher verdant tomato garden, Sheehy found herself drawn down the road to Grey\nGardens, a decaying mansion overrun by howling cats and home to Big Edie\nand Little Edie Beale, dotty and reclusive relatives of former first lady\nJacqueline Bouvier Kennedy.\n\n\n\nJust a few miles away and 43 summers later, Sheehy sits in a Sag Harbor\nrental cottage and reflects on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Secrets of Grey Gardens,\xe2\x80\x9d her\nnow-infamous New York magazine cover story about the Beales, outcasts from\nthe wealthy WASP culture that was their birthright. \xe2\x80\x9cWASPs are like the\nAlawites of America, a rare breed,\xe2\x80\x9d says the now 70-year-old Sheehy.\nLooking youthful in jeans and a turquoise linen t-shirt, a helmet of red\nhair framing her animated face, she is diminutive, quick-witted, and\ndisarmingly warm. (She addresses me in various terms of endearment, as one\nwould an old friend, and invites me to swim in her pool after lunch). It\xe2\x80\x99s\na quality that surely worked to her advantage while interviewing the Beales.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh God, that was so much fun,\xe2\x80\x9d Sheehy says, wedging a cookie between two\nheaping scoops of ice cream\xe2\x80\x94dessert. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was one of my favorite stories,\nnot only because of the characters but because it was a social history,\ngoing back to the grandfather who was a paterfamilias and managed\neverybody\xe2\x80\x99s lives and then cut them all off as heirs. And the Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s\nwere in the White House!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt was one of Sheehy\xe2\x80\x99s breakout pieces of \xe2\x80\x9cnew journalism,\xe2\x80\x9d establishing\nher as a worthy contemporary of writers like Tom Wolfe, Hunter Thompson,\nand Joan Didion. As a pioneering female journalist in the \xe2\x80\x9860s and \xe2\x80\x9870s,\nshe covered everything from the culture wars\xe2\x80\x94with particular focus on\nfeminism and the sexual revolution\xe2\x80\x94to the emerging civil war in Northern\nIreland. Between 1968 and 1977, she would file more than 50 stories for New\nYork magazine. She\xe2\x80\x99s since written 17 books, including the best-selling\nPassages, which the Library of Congress declared one of the most\ninfluential books of our time; blurring the boundaries between self-help\nand pop psychology, the book was embraced\xe2\x80\x94particularly by American women\xe2\x80\x94as\na new way of thinking about adulthood and its accompanying crises. It also\nestablished Sheehy as a celebrity author and household name (she milked its\nsuccess in four subsequent books that were all variations on the Passages\ntheme).\n\n\n\nIn Daring: My Passages, Sheehy now chronicles the ups and downs of her own\nlife, from the fallout of divorce and single motherhood in her late \xe2\x80\x9820s to\nher sudden and dizzying success in her \xe2\x80\x9830s, and a life-changing second\nmarriage in her late \xe2\x80\x9840s.\n\n\n\nMuch of Daring is a tribute to Sheehy\xe2\x80\x99s second husband, the late New York\nmagazine founding editor Clay Felker, and the narrative style of the \xe2\x80\x9cnew\njournalism movement\xe2\x80\x9d that he tirelessly promoted. (The movement\xe2\x80\x99s\nstars\xe2\x80\x94like Wolfe and Gay Talese\xe2\x80\x94were among the original members of the New\nYork family, many of whom Felker brought with him from the New York Herald\nTribune.) Sheehy recalls fondly the excitement of writing social commentary\nin the \xe2\x80\x9860s and \xe2\x80\x9870s, two decades that \xe2\x80\x9cspawned more new lifestyles than\ncould be contained in any magazine.\xe2\x80\x9d While radical activists were\nattempting to change society, New York and its stable of writers were\npermanently altering the direction of journalism. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly in retrospect did\nwe appreciate our good fortune in being part of a utopian experiment in\nAmerican journalism,\xe2\x80\x9d she writes. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the time, we were too busy having\nfun.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn Sag Harbor, Sheehy breathlessly recalls the staff feeding off each\nother\xe2\x80\x99s ideas during weekly editorial lunches. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was this incredible\ncross-fertilization at the table. We\xe2\x80\x99d be there for two hours and get so\nhyped that we would literally run out of the meeting to start doing our\nresearch.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe remembers how the small staff of Felker\xe2\x80\x99s fledgling magazine would\ngather at The Palm near the United Nations building, which played host to\njournalists, dignitaries, and future presidents. \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge H.W. Bush was our\nrepresentative to the U.N. [at the time] and would always be at a table in\nthe corner, late, and with a different girlfriend every time,\xe2\x80\x9d she says,\ngrinning.\n\n\n\nIt was an auspicious time to be a reporter, especially as a Columbia\nJournalism School student studying under cultural anthropologist Margaret\nMead. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had the Black Panthers scaring the shit out of the white\nradicals, who were desperately trying to compete,\xe2\x80\x9d she says of the\nprivileged white students who fancied themselves revolutionaries. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then\nyou had the early feminists who were making their young husbands shrivel up\nbecause they could never do anything right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThe earliest [feminists] were the most extreme: the radical redstockings\nand the Ti-Grace Atkinsons. They were really hard-nosed. And that was\nbefore Gloria [Steinem] got into it, too. I was writing about it early on,\nbut I was writing about it in a somewhat satirical way. Because that was\nsort of the safe way, and it was fun to make fun of it.\xe2\x80\x9d But Sheehy wanted\nto be taken seriously by her feminist colleagues, particularly Steinem, who\nwas fast becoming a leader in the movement. (In 2013, Sheehy wrote about\nthe survival of \xe2\x80\x9cthe feminist spirit\xe2\x80\x9d for The Daily Beast).\n\n\n\nBut Daring is more than just a personal memoir; it\xe2\x80\x99s a fast-paced romp\nthrough the second half of the 20th century, told through the prism of\nstories that shaped Sheehy\xe2\x80\x99s career: her first political piece on Bobby\nKennedy\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign in California; an award-winning series on\nprostitutes and their pimps; a brush with death in Northern Ireland on\nBloody Sunday, which was the impetus for writing Passages; the forgotten\nCambodian refugee children who survived Pol Pot\xe2\x80\x99s genocide; profiles of\npolitical figures like Margaret Thatcher, George H.W. Bush, and Hillary\nClinton.\n\n\n\nHer political writings weren\xe2\x80\x99t received without controversy. When Sheehy\xe2\x80\x99s\nbiography of the former First Lady came out in 1999, the Clintons went into\nattack mode. \xe2\x80\x9cHillary had [Clinton aide] Sidney Blumenthal call people\nbefore my book came out, trashing it,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are vicious when it\ncomes to trying to silence anyone who has been critical of them.\xe2\x80\x9d But she\nnevertheless declares herself to be sympathetic to the former secretary of\nstate. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t find her to be particularly likeable, but I am a great\nadmirer and I always like to see her succeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAt the heart of Daring is Sheehy\xe2\x80\x99s Pygmalion-like romance with her mentor,\neditor, and husband, Clay Felker. But she acknowledges that their\npartnership wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always romantic. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a creative intimacy from the\nvery beginning,\xe2\x80\x9d she explains. Over time, their potent mentor-mentee\nrelationship evolved into a passionate on-again, off-again love affair. But\nit was intellectual ferment that Sheehy craved above all else. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we\nlived together, the most fun we had was reading the papers in the morning\nover breakfast, digesting the world and spitting it out and arguing about\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nLike Sheehy, Felker had also been previously married and they were both\nleery of commitment. Sheehy was in her mid-thirties when she broke off the\nrelationship.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought that was the most daring decision of my life,\xe2\x80\x9d she remembers.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I loved him and didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose him. And it could have gone\nwrong. But I knew I had to strike out on my own and prove myself without a\nmentor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSheehy reunited with Felker after she finished Passages, which sat on the\nNew York Times bestseller list for three whole years. The two were married\nin 1984, 22 years after they first met, and remained so until Felker\xe2\x80\x99s\ndeath in 2008.\n\n\n\nToday, Sheehy is a poster girl for young female journalists: a dogged\nreporter who seduced wary subjects by charming her way past their defenses\nand then winning their confidence\xe2\x80\x94pretty much the same way she disarmed\nthis intimidated prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9.\n\n\n\nAs she gears up for a publicity tour on her most personal work, Sheehy says\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s more emotionally equipped than ever before to dodge the slings and\narrows that come with promoting a book.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had the experience of having a book praised but then it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sell.\nOr not praised but then it sells. Every combination you can think of, so I\nguess I\xe2\x80\x99m sort of bulletproof at this point.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nShe pauses, laughing at herself.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, not really.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calendar:*\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sec.
