She wants to tweet, release the more robust statement, and\ntalk to Walter tomorrow on camera \xe2\x80\x94 so all of the above.\n> The text she approved is below.  If anyone has any further concerns or\nedits, please let us know.  Still time to make another run at her if folks\nfeel strongly.  Otherwise, we\xe2\x80\x99ll plan on moving ahead.\n> Thanks for all the help on this.\n> Dan\n>\n> Tweet:\n>\n>\n>\n>  \xe2\x80\x9cI commend President Obama for taking action on immigration in the face\nof inaction.  Now let\xe2\x80\x99s turn to permanent bipartisan reform.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>\n>\n>\n> Draft Statement:\n>\n>\n>\n> I support the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to begin fixing our broken immigration\nsystem and focus finite resources on deporting felons rather than\nfamilies.  I was hopeful that the bipartisan bill passed by the Senate in\n2013 would spur the House of Representatives to act, but they refused even\nto advance an alternative. Their abdication of responsibility paved the way\nfor this executive action, which follows established precedent from\nPresidents of both parties going back 70 years.  But, only Congress can\nfinish the job by passing permanent bipartisan reform that keeps families\ntogether, treats everyone with dignity and compassion, upholds the rule of\nlaw, protects our border and national security, and brings millions of\nhard-working people out of the shadows and into the formal economy so they\ncan pay taxes and contribute to our nation's prosperity.  Our disagreements\non this important issue may grow heated at times, but I am confident that\npeople of good will and good faith can yet find common ground. We should\nnever forget that we\xe2\x80\x99re not discussing abstract statistics \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99re talking\nabout real families with real experiences.  We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about parents\nlying awake at night afraid of a knock on the door that could tear their\nfamilies apart, people who love this country, work hard, and want nothing\nmore than a chance to contribute to the community and build better lives\nfor themselves and their children.\n>\n>\n"
