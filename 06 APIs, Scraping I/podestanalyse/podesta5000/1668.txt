Hsu <http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/spencer-s-hsu> February\n23 at 2:21 PM\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/us-judge-weighs-deeper-probe-into-clintons-private-email-system/2016/02/23/9c27412a-d997-11e5-81ae-7491b9b9e7df_story.html?postshare=2511456256355024&tid=ss_tw\n\n\n\nA federal judge on Tuesday ruled that State Department officials and top\naides to Hillary Clinton should be questioned under oath about whether they\nintentionally thwarted federal open records laws by using or allowing the\nuse of a private email server throughout Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s tenure as secretary of\nstate from 2009 to 2013.\n\nThe decision by U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of Washington came in\na lawsuit over public records brought by Judicial Watch, a conservative\nlegal watchdog group, regarding its May 2013 request, for information about\nthe employment arrangement of Huma Abedin, a longtime Clinton aide.\n\nA State Department official said that the department is aware of the order\nand that it is reviewing it but declined to comment further, citing the\nongoing litigation.\n\nADVERTISING\n\nAlthough it was not immediately clear whether the government will appeal,\nSullivan set an April deadline for parties to lay out a detailed\ninvestigative plan that would extend well beyond the limited and carefully\nworded explanations of the use of the private server that department and\nClinton officials have given.\n\nSullivan also suggested from the bench that he might at some point order\nthe department to subpoena Clinton and Abedin, to return all records\nrelated to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s private account, not just those their camps have\npreviously deemed work-related and returned.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere has been a constant drip, drip, drip of declarations. When does it\nstop?\xe2\x80\x9d Sullivan said, adding that months of piecemeal revelations about\nClinton and the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s handling of the email controversy create\n\xe2\x80\x9cat least a \xe2\x80\x98reasonable suspicion\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d that public access to official\ngovernment records under the federal Freedom of Information Act was\nundermined. \xe2\x80\x9cThis case is about the public\xe2\x80\x99s right to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn granting Judicial Watch\xe2\x80\x99s request, Sullivan noted that there was no\ndispute that senior State Department officials were aware of the email\nset-up, citing a January 2009 email exchange including Undersecretary for\nManagement Patrick F. Kennedy, Clinton chief of staff Cheryl D. Mills and\nAbedin about establishing an \xe2\x80\x9coff-network\xe2\x80\x9d email system.\n\nThe watchdog group did not ask to depose Clinton by name, but its requests\nin its lawsuit targeted those who handled her transition, arrival and\ndeparture from the department and who oversaw Abedin, a direct subordinate.\n\nSullivan\xe2\x80\x99s decision came as Clinton seeks the Democratic presidential\nnomination and three weeks after the State Department acknowledged for the\nfirst time that \xe2\x80\x9ctop secret\xe2\x80\x9d information passed through the server.\n\n[State Department says Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s email correspondence contained\n\xe2\x80\x98top secret\xe2\x80\x99 material]\n\nThe FBI and the department\xe2\x80\x99s inspector general are continuing to look into\nwhether the private setup mishandled classified information or violated\nother federal laws.\n\nFor six months in 2012, Abedin was employed simultaneously by the State\nDepartment, the Clinton Foundation, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s personal office and a private\nconsulting firm connected to the Clintons.\n\nThe department stated in February 2014 that it had completed its search of\nrecords for the secretary\xe2\x80\x99s office. After Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive use of a\nprivate server was made public in May, the department said that additional\nrecords probably were available.\n\nIn pursuing information about Abedin\xe2\x80\x99s role, Judicial Watch argued that the\nonly way to determine whether all official records subject to its request\nwere made public was to allow it to depose or submit detailed written\nquestions about the private email arrangement to a slew of current and\nformer top State Department officials, Clinton aides, her attorneys and\noutside parties.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know discovery in FOIA cases is not typical, and we do not ask for it\nlightly,\xe2\x80\x9d Judicial Watch President Thomas J. Fitton said before the\nhearing. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s not appropriate under these circumstances, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult\nto imagine when it would be appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFitton noted that the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s inspector general last month\nfaulted the department and Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s office for overseeing processes that\nrepeatedly allowed \xe2\x80\x9cinaccurate and incomplete\xe2\x80\x9d FOIA responses, including a\nMay 2013 reply that found \xe2\x80\x9cno records\xe2\x80\x9d concerning email accounts that\nClinton used, even though dozens of senior officials had corresponded with\nher private account.\n\nJustice Department lawyers countered in court that the State Department is\npoised to finish publicly releasing all 54,000 pages of emails that\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys determined to be work-related and that were returned to\nthe State Department at its request for review.\n\nThe case before Sullivan, a longtime jurist who has overseen other\npolitically contentious FOIA cases, is one of more than 50 active FOIA\nlawsuits by legal groups, news media organizations and others seeking\ninformation included in emails sent to or by Clinton and her aides on the\nprivate server.\n\nThe State Department has been releasing Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s newly recovered\ncorrespondence in batches since last summer with a final set due Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, former Clinton department aides Mills, Abedin, Jacob Sullivan\nand Philippe Reines have returned tens of thousands of pages of documents\nto the department for FOIA review, with releases projected to continue into\nat least 2017.\n\nThe State Department also has asked the FBI to turn over any of an\nestimated 30,000 deleted emails deemed personal by Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys that\nthe FBI is able to recover in its investigation of the security of the\nprivate email server.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no doubt that [the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s] search for responsive\nrecords has been exceedingly thorough and more than adequate under FOIA,\xe2\x80\x9d\naccording to filings by Justice Department civil division lawyers, led by\nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer.\n\nThey argued that FOIA requires the agency to release records only under its\ncontrol \xe2\x80\x94 not under the control of its current or former officials \xe2\x80\x94 and\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cfederal employees routinely manage their email and \xe2\x80\x98self-select\xe2\x80\x99\ntheir work-related messages when they, quite permissibly, designate and\ndelete personal emails from their government email accounts.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSullivan\xe2\x80\x99s decision will almost certainly extend through Election Day an\ninquiry that has dogged Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, frustrating allies and\nproviding fodder to Republican opponents.\n\nFOIA law generally gives agencies the benefit of the doubt and sets a high\nbar for plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 requests for discovery. However, one similar public\nrecords battle during Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s presidency lasted 14 years and led to\ndepositions of the president\xe2\x80\x99s White House counsel and chief of staff.\n\nBecause of the number of judges hearing the FOIA cases, there is likewise a\nchance that the fight over Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s emails could \xe2\x80\x9ctake on a life\nof their own,\xe2\x80\x9d not ending \xe2\x80\x9cuntil there are endless depositions of top\n[agency] aides and officials, and just a parade of horribles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne L.\nWeismann, executive director of the Campaign for Accountability. Weismann\nalso is a former Justice Department FOIA litigation supervisor who oversaw\ndozens of such fights from 1991 to 2002.\n\nStill, she said, such drawn-out legal proceedings could be valuable if they\nshed light on whether the State Department met its legal obligations under\nopen-government laws or systematically withheld releasable records.\n\nLast month, one of Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s colleagues, U.S. District Judge James E.\nBoasberg, dismissed lawsuits brought by Judicial Watch and the Cause of\nAction Institute that sought to force the government to take more\naggressive steps to recover Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s deleted emails under the Federal\nRecords Act.\n\nPlaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9ccannot sue to force the recovery of records that they hope or\nimagine might exist,\xe2\x80\x9d Boasberg wrote Jan. 11, adding that, to date,\nrecovery efforts by the State Department and the National Archives under\nthat law \xe2\x80\x9ccannot in any way be described as a dereliction of duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe server\xe2\x80\x99s existence was disclosed two years after Clinton left, in\nFebruary 2013, as secretary of state and as the department faced a\ncongressional subpoena and media requests for emails related to scores of\nmatters, including attacks that killed a U.S. ambassador in Benghazi,\nLibya, and fundraising for the Clinton family\xe2\x80\x99s global charity.\n\n[Clinton receives key endorsement, but faces new questions]\n\nIn seeking records related to Abedin\xe2\x80\x99s employment, Judicial Watch asked to\nbe allowed to depose or submit written questions to current and former\nState Department employees and Clinton aides, including Kennedy; John F.\nHackett, director of information services; Executive Secretary Joseph E.\nMacmanus; Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff, Mills; lawyer David E. Kendall; Abedin;\nand Bryan Pagliano, a Clinton staff member during her 2008 presidential\ncampaign who helped set up the private server.\n\nMore broadly, the group\xe2\x80\x99s motion targets who oversaw State Department\ninformation systems, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s transition and arrival at the department,\nher communications, and her and Abedin\xe2\x80\x99s departure from the agency.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat emails . . . were deleted . . . who decided to delete them, and\nwhen?\xe2\x80\x9d Judicial Watch asks in filings.\n\nThe group also asks whether any archived copies of sent or received emails\non the private server existed, including correspondence with Clinton\ntechnology contractors Platte River Networks and Datto.\n\nRosalind S.
