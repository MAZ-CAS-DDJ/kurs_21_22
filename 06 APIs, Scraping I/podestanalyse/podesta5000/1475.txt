We have accommodated everyone\'s preferences recorded on our survey circulated last month.\n\nAs before, we\'ll meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12:00 until 1:20 pm.  When a single large workshop is scheduled, we\'ll meet in the Hotung Dining Room. On those Thursdays when two smaller workshops are scheduled, we\'ll let you know well in advance the room locations. We\'ll circulate the papers approximately one week in advance of the corresponding workshop.\n\nWe\'ll commence this Thursday, January 22, when Barry Friedman of NYU and his co-author Maria Ponomarenko will present their paper, "Governing Policing" (Barry Friedman \x96 Governing Policing<http://goo.gl/gGMVEq>).\n\nA great week to all until then, see you soon.\n\nAll best wishes,\nAllegra\n\n--\nAllegra M.
