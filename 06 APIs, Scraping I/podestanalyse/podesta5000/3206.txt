Brien, as well as leading the fight in a key political test in 2004 that paved the way for it to be filed. Additionally, Bill Barnhart \'68 served as a sounding board to the book\'s authors, one of whom, Tom Witosky, is a Knox parent. Mr. Witosky states that "There is no doubt that this couple\'s role in the case was crucial to the eventual success of the lawsuit. Equal Before the Law highlights their role in the case."\nUnlike the earlier decisions in Massachusetts and Connecticut, Varnum v. Brien was unanimous and unequivocal. It catalyzed the unprecedented and rapid shift in law and public opinion that continues today. Equal Before the Law tells the stories behind this critical battle in the fight for marriage equality and traces the decision\'s impact.\nKnox College2 East South StGalesburg, IL 61401If you wish to be removed from this group\'s mailing list, http://knox.imodules.com/?sid=289&gid=1&pgid=37&cid=51&seiid=2539&ecatid=6&puid=f5701d0f-abb6-4e97-b2af-f24a590bbfbc\n'
