Jeffrey Smith\n\nWashington Post Staff Writer\n\nFriday, October 31, 2008; A01\n\n \n\nThe White House is working to enact a wide array of federal regulations,\nmany of which would weaken government rules aimed at protecting\nconsumers and the environment, before President Bush leaves office in\nJanuary.\n\n \n\nThe new rules would be among the most controversial deregulatory steps\nof the Bush era and could be difficult for his successor to undo. Some\nwould ease or lift constraints on private industry, including power\nplants, mines and farms.\n\n \n\nThose and other regulations would help clear obstacles to some\ncommercial ocean-fishing activities, ease controls on emissions of\npollutants that contribute to global warming, relax drinking-water\nstandards and lift a key restriction on mountaintop coal mining.\n\n \n\nOnce such rules take effect, they typically can be undone only through a\nlaborious new regulatory proceeding, including lengthy periods of public\ncomment, drafting and mandated reanalysis.\n\n \n\n"They want these rules to continue to have an impact long after they\nleave office," said Matthew Madia, a regulatory expert at OMB Watch, a\nnonprofit group critical of what it calls the Bush administration\'s\npenchant for deregulating in areas where industry wants more freedom. He\ncalled the coming deluge "a last-minute assault on the public . . .\nhappening on multiple fronts."\n\n \n\nWhite House spokesman Tony Fratto said: "This administration has taken\nextraordinary measures to avoid rushing regulations at the end of the\nterm. And yes, we\'d prefer our regulations stand for a very long time --\nthey\'re well reasoned and are being considered with the best interests\nof the nation in mind."\n\n \n\nAs many as 90 new regulations are in the works, and at least nine of\nthem are considered "economically significant" because they impose costs\nor promote societal benefits that exceed $100 million annually. They\ninclude new rules governing employees who take family- and\nmedical-related leaves, new standards for preventing or containing oil\nspills, and a simplified process for settling real estate transactions.\n\n \n\nWhile it remains unclear how much the administration will be able to\naccomplish in the coming weeks, the last-minute rush appears to involve\nfewer regulations than Bush\'s predecessor, Bill Clinton, approved at the\nend of his tenure.\n\n \n\nIn some cases, Bush\'s regulations reflect new interpretations of\nlanguage in federal laws. In other cases, such as several new\ncounterterrorism initiatives, they reflect new executive branch\ndecisions in areas where Congress -- now out of session and focused on\nthe elections -- left the president considerable discretion.\n\n \n\nThe burst of activity has made this a busy period for lobbyists who fear\nthat industry views will hold less sway after the elections. The doors\nat the New Executive Office Building have been whirling with corporate\nofficials and advisers pleading for relief or, in many cases, for\nhastened decision making.\n\n \n\nAccording to the Office of Management and Budget\'s regulatory calendar,\nthe commercial scallop-fishing industry came in two weeks ago to urge\nthat proposed catch limits be eased, nearly bumping into National Mining\nAssociation officials making the case for easing rules meant to keep\ncoal slurry waste out of Appalachian streams. A few days earlier,\nlawyers for kidney dialysis and biotechnology companies registered their\ncomplaints at the OMB about new Medicare reimbursement rules. Lobbyists\nfor customs brokers complained about proposed counterterrorism rules\nthat require the advance reporting of shipping data.\n\n \n\nBush\'s aides are acutely aware of the political risks of completing\ntheir regulatory work too late. On the afternoon of Bush\'s inauguration,\nJan. 20, 2001, his chief of staff issued a government-wide memo that\nblocked the completion or implementation of regulations drafted in the\nwaning days of the Clinton administration that had not yet taken legal\neffect.\n\n \n\n"Through the end of the Clinton administration, we were working like\ncrazy to get as many regulations out as possible," said Donald R.\nArbuckle, who retired in 2006 after 25 years as an OMB official. "Then\non Sunday, the day after the inauguration, OMB Director Mitch Daniels\ncalled me in and said, \'Let\'s pull back as many of these as we can.\' "\n\n \n\nClinton\'s appointees wound up paying a heavy price for procrastination.\nBush\'s team was able to withdraw 254 regulations that covered such\nmatters as drug and airline safety, immigration and indoor air\npollutants. After further review, many of the proposals were modified to\nreflect Republican policy ideals or scrapped altogether.\n\n \n\nSeeking to avoid falling victim to such partisan tactics, White House\nChief of Staff Joshua B. Bolten in May imposed a Nov. 1 government-wide\ndeadline to finish major new regulations, "except in extraordinary\ncircumstances."\n\n \n\nThat gives officials just a few more weeks to meet an effective Nov. 20\ndeadline for the publication of economically significant rules, which\ntake legal effect only after a 60-day congressional comment period. Less\nimportant rules take effect after a 30-day period, creating a second\ndeadline of Dec. 20.\n\n \n\nOMB spokeswoman Jane Lee said that Bolten\'s memo was meant to emphasize\nthe importance of "due diligence" in ensuring that late-term regulations\nare sound. "We will continue to embrace the thorough and high standards\nof the regulatory review process," she said.\n\n \n\nAs the deadlines near, the administration has begun to issue regulations\nof great interest to industry, including, in recent days, a rule that\nallows natural gas pipelines to operate at higher pressures and new\nHomeland Security rules that shift passenger security screening\nresponsibilities from airlines to the federal government. The OMB also\napproved a new limit on airborne emissions of lead this month, acting\nunder a court-imposed deadline.\n\n \n\nMany of the rules that could be issued over the next few weeks would\nease environmental regulations, according to sources familiar with\nadministration deliberations.\n\n \n\nA rule put forward by the National Marine Fisheries Service and now\nunder final review by the OMB would lift a requirement that\nenvironmental impact statements be prepared for certain\nfisheries-management decisions and would give review authority to\nregional councils dominated by commercial and recreational fishing\ninterests.\n\n \n\nAn Alaska commercial fishing source, granted anonymity so he could speak\ncandidly about private conversations, said that senior administration\nofficials promised to "get the rule done by the end of this month" and\nthat the outcome would be a big improvement.\n\n \n\nLee Crockett of the Pew Charitable Trusts\' Environment Group said the\nadministration has received 194,000 public comments on the rule and\nprotests from 80 members of Congress as well as 160 conservation groups.\n"This thing is fatally flawed" as well as "wildly unpopular," Crockett\nsaid.\n\n \n\nTwo other rules nearing completion would ease limits on pollution from\npower plants, a major energy industry goal for the past eight years that\nis strenuously opposed by Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups.\n\n \n\nOne rule, being pursued over some opposition within the Environmental\nProtection Agency, would allow current emissions at a power plant to\nmatch the highest levels produced by that plant, overturning a rule that\nmore strictly limits such emission increases. According to the EPA\'s\nestimate, it would allow millions of tons of additional carbon dioxide\ninto the atmosphere annually, worsening global warming.\n\n \n\nA related regulation would ease limits on emissions from coal-fired\npower plants near national parks.\n\n \n\nA third rule would allow increased emissions from oil refineries,\nchemical factories and other industrial plants with complex\nmanufacturing operations.\n\n \n\nThese rules "will force Americans to choke on dirtier air for years to\ncome, unless Congress or the new administration reverses these\neleventh-hour abuses," said lawyer John Walke of the Natural Resources\nDefense Council.\n\n \n\nBut Scott H. Segal, a Washington lawyer and chief spokesman for the\nElectric Reliability Coordinating Council, said that "bringing common\nsense to the Clean Air Act is the best way to enhance energy efficiency\nand pollution control." He said he is optimistic that the new rule will\nhelp keep citizens\' lawsuits from obstructing new technologies.\n\n \n\nJonathan Shradar, an EPA spokesman, said that he could not discuss\nspecifics but added that "we strive to protect human health and the\nenvironment." Any rule the agency completes, he said, "is more stringent\nthan the previous one."\n\n \n\nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/10/30/2008-10-30_barack_ob\nama_to_have_white_house_team_re.html?print=1&page=all\n\n \n\nNew York Daily News - Barack Obama to have White House team ready fast\n\n \n\nBy THOMAS M. DeFRANK and KENNETH R. BAZINET\n\nDAILY NEWS WASHINGTON BUREAU\n\n \n\nUpdated Thursday, October 30th 2008, 11:24 PM\n\n \n\nWASHINGTON - Expect a turbocharged transition if Barack Obama wins, with\na Treasury secretary and White House chief of staff named days after his\nelection, Democratic sources told the Daily News Thursday.\n\n \n\n"They would like to make Treasury the first appointment as a symbol and\nhave the other big ones done in the first week," said one source close\nto the Obama transition team.\n\n \n\nConfronting the economic crisis is the prime reason for the urgency.\n\n \n\n"People will have a good idea where we\'re going with this very early,"\nadded an Obama adviser.\n\n \n\nThe list of candidates for Treasury secretary includes former Clinton\nadministration Treasury chief Larry Summers; Timothy Geithner, president\nof the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and ex-Fed Chairman Paul\nVolcker, among others, said sources familiar with candidates who have\nbeen recommended to Obama.\n\n \n\nObama is also well along in deciding on his picks for State, Defense and\nJustice, sources said.\n\n \n\nAs another indicator of the importance Obama attaches to getting his\neconomic brain trust in place, his transition team already has scores of\nprospective appointees undergoing FBI background checks for top\nadministration slots.\n\nRELATED: HINCKLEY: \'REALITY\' SHOW AIMS AT UNDECIDED VOTERS\n\n \n\nWhile the candidates have hammered each other for months, transition\nplanning for either an Obama or John McCain win has been quietly\nunderway at all levels of the federal government.\n\n \n\n"There\'s action all over town," said presidential scholar Martha Kumar.\n"The White House is active. Congress is active. The campaigns are\nactive."\n\n \n\nThe chief of staff\'s job may come down to former Senate Democratic\nleader Tom Daschle of South Dakota or Chicago Rep. Rahm Emanuel. But\nmultiple sources believe Emanuel is more interested in staying on the\nfast-track in the House leadership.\n\nRELATED: IN HARLEM, MANY STILL WORRY OVER RACE\n\n \n\n"Rahm wants to be Speaker of the House one day," said a senior\ncongressional source.\n\n \n\nWilliam Timmons, a Washington lobbyist who worked in the Ford and Reagan\nadministrations, is heading McCain\'s transition team. Several sources\nsaid that effort is not as ambitious or as far along as Obama\'s.\n\n \n\nCloaked in Vatican-like secrecy, the Obama operation headed by Bill\nClinton\'s ex-chief of staff John Podesta is a taboo topic for Obama\'s\ncampaign aides. Staffers have been warned that if they get caught\ndiscussing the transition they face being fired immediately. Even the\nmost innocuous inquiries are turned aside.\n\n \n\nTeam Obama mostly does not want to come off as "measuring the drapes,"\nas McCain loves to say on the stump.\n\n \n\nOf the nearly 8,000 administration jobs filled by presidential\nappointees, 1,177 of them require Senate confirmation.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.nypost.com/php/pfriendly/print.php?url=http://www.nypost.com/\nseven/10312008/news/politics/rahm_in_bam_plans_136133.htm\n\n \n\nNY Post - RAHM IN BAM PLANS\n\n \n\nBy SALLY GOLDENBERG\n\n \n\nOctober 31, 2008 --\n\n \n\nBarack Obama is looking to a fellow Illinois Democrat, US Rep. Rahm\nEmanuel, to be his White House chief of staff, officials said yesterday.\n\n \n\nEmanuel, who served as a senior advisor to President Bill Clinton,\nquickly ascended the political ladder since he joined the House in 2003,\nrepresenting Obama\'s home city of Chicago.\n\n \n\nIt was not immediately clear when Obama approached Emanuel for the\nposition, which would make him the top White House aide.\n\n \n\nAs chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Emanuel is currently the\nfourth-most-powerful member of that body.\n\n \n\nAn Emanuel staffer denied there was a formal offer.\n\n \n\nEmanuel, 48, a regular on the campaign trail for Obama, "has not been\ncontacted to take a job in an administration that does not yet exist,"\nsaid the staffer, Sarah Feinberg.\n\n \n\nOther big names that have been floated as possibilities are former\nSenate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (SD); real-estate executive Valerie\nJarrett; and former Secretary of Commerce William Daley, the brother of\nChicago Mayor Richard Daley, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\n \n\nEmanuel, a Sarah Lawrence graduate and a three-term congressman, served\nas chairman of the Democratic campaign committee two years ago.\n\n \n\nHis father, Benjamin, was born in Jerusalem. And Rahm Emanuel served as\na civilian volunteer for the Israeli army during the 1991 Gulf War.\n\n \n\nBoth presidential candidates have authorized their teams to begin\ntransition operations.\n\n \n\nLast night, Obama dodged the question, telling reporters at a campaign\nstop in Colombia, Mo., "I\'m trying to win an election."\n\n \n\n"[Campaign manager] David Plouffe is my chief of staff."\n\n \n\nBut Alex Conant, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee,\ncalled Emanuel "among the most vitriolic and partisan people in American\npolitics."\n\n \n\n"Reports that Obama wants him to be White House chief of staff undercut\nany claims to unity and bipartisanship, and should alarm every voter,"\nhe said.\n\n \n\nMeanwhile, Obama said yesterday that if elected president, he would want\nto meet immediately with the heads of the Big Three automakers and the\nUnited Auto Workers. He said such a summit would craft a strategy to\nmake the US car industry, once king of the world, competitive again.\n\n \n\nObama was riding high yesterday when TV ratings showed his 30-minute\nprime-time ad Wednesday night drew nearly 34 million viewers.
