john.podesta@gmail.comb'I believe we started out the campaign about 20 points behind Sanders in Iowa on the question of who would best stand up to Wall Street and that was when we were about 40 points ahead.\n\nIf you want to make the question of the campaign, who will best stand up to Wall Street, Sanders is the answer and he\'ll give you $35 million reasons why.  \n\nWe have good strong things to say about our plans and we have a great whack on the GOP.  I don\'t know why we would choose to fight this out on Sanders best turf,\n\n\n\nMandy Grunwald\nGrunwald Communications\n202 973-9400\n\n\n> On Jan 6, 2016, at 3:20 PM, Jake Sullivan <jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n> \n> Why is it not credible that he has really dumb plans for Wall Street?\n>  \n> From: Mandy Grunwald [mailto:gruncom@aol.com] \n> Sent: Wednesday, January 6, 2016 3:07 PM\n> To: Jake Sullivan <jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com>\n> Cc: Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com>; Jennifer Palmieri <jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com>; ha16@hillaryclinton.com; john.podesta@gmail.com; re47@hillaryclinton.com; jbenenson@bsgco.com; Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com; Kristina Schake <kschake@hillaryclinton.com>\n> Subject: Re: Bernie Contrast in Nevada\n>  \n> We don\'t need to prove he\'s bad on Wall Street-- that\'s not really credible.\n>  \n> We need to prove we\'re ok.\n>  \n> Most of all, we don\'t want this fight.\n>  \n> That\'s my view.\n>  \n> \n> \n> Mandy Grunwald\n> Grunwald Communications\n> 202 973-9400\n>  \n>  \n> \n> On Jan 6, 2016, at 1:50 PM, Jake Sullivan <jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com> wrote:\n> \n> My concern on this continues to be that Bernie gets to whack her around and she is purely positive to him in reply.\n>  \n>  \n>  \n> From: Mandy Grunwald [mailto:gruncom@aol.com] \n> Sent: Wednesday, January 6, 2016 1:46 PM\n> To: jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com; dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com\n> Cc: jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com; ha16@hillaryclinton.com; john.podesta@gmail.com; re47@hillaryclinton.com; jbenenson@bsgco.com; Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com; kschake@hillaryclinton.com\n> Subject: Re: Bernie Contrast in Nevada\n>  \n>  \n> If HRC is asked about Sanders\' Wall Street comments, can I suggest this as a response?\n>  \n> I know Senator Sanders attacked me on this, that his choice. But the truth is, he and I both want to crack down on the risky behavior on Wall Street, we both want to make sure people go to jail when they cross the line.  I think my plan is tougher because it also cracks down on the shadow banking world but the real difference is that every single Republican wants to get RID of the new financial regulations.  I am going to make sure that that does not happen.  We shouldn\'t be easing up on the kind of behavior that crashed our economy.  We should be strengthening accountability so that never happens again.  That\'s what\'s at stake in this election.\n> \n> Mandy Grunwald\n> Grunwald Communications\n> 202 973-9400\n>  \n> \n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Jake Sullivan <jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com>\n> To: Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com>\n> Cc: Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com>; Jennifer Palmieri <jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com>; Huma Abedin <ha16@hillaryclinton.com>; John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>; Robby Mook <re47@hillaryclinton.com>; Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com>; Jim <Jim.Margolis@gmmb.com>; Kristina Schake <kschake@hillaryclinton.com>\n> Sent: Wed, Jan 6, 2016 10:45 am\n> Subject: Re: Bernie Contrast in Nevada\n> \n> I think this is good.

The differences between us pale compared to what we see on the other side.  But your choice in this primary really matters.

I have plans that will actually help families get ahead and stay ahead\xe2\x80\xa6 that will make the wealthy pay their fair share, hold corporate price gougers, polluters, and Wall Street speculators accountable, and prevent the Republicans from taking us backwards.
