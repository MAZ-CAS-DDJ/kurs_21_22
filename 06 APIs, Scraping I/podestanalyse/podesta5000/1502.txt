Would 8:00am EST or an\nafternoon call on Tuesday work for you?\n\nMany thanks,\nMarissa\n\nFrom:  Robby Mook <robbymook@gmail.com>\nDate:  Saturday, January 24, 2015 at 4:42 PM\nTo:  Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com>\nCc:  "Sepp, Eryn" <Eryn_M_Sepp@who.eop.gov>, Cheryl Mills n\n<cheryl.mills@gmail.com>, Joanne Laszczych <jlaszczych@cdmillsgroup.com>,\nJohn Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>, Huma Abedin <Huma@clintonemail.com>,\nMarissa Astor <marissa.astor@icloud.com>, Sawsan Bay <sbay@hrcoffice.com>\nSubject:  Re: REMINDER:  SUNDAY, January 25, 8:00am EST - Standing Call\n\nMy apologies--my schedule just changed again.
