john.podesta@gmail.comb'\n\nYou know I hate to brag.  O.K., at least this time it\'s not about me.  I feel like\na proud grandparent about the incredible group of new lawyers joining Susman Godfrey\nthis Fall:\n\n* Matt Allen joins the firm after clerkships with Judge DeMoss on the Fifth Circuit\nand Judge Kazen on the Southern District of Texas. A veteran of the United States\nMarine Corps, Matt is ready to battle for his clients and lead his trial teams to\nvictory in the courtroom.\n* Shawn Blackburn joins us after a clerkship for Judge Prost on the Federal Circuit.\nHe prepared for the science of winning complex commercial disputes by earning a \nPh.D. in Cell and Molecular Biology from the University of Pennsylvania before law\nschool.\n* Lindsay Calkins clerked for Judge Betty Fletcher on the Ninth Circuit and then\n spent a year arguing cases in Washington appellate courts; having participated \nin the appeals process for several years, she\'s ready to craft some trial court \nvictories.\n* Tania Culbertson clerked for Judge Tallman on the Ninth Circuit. Before law school\nshe worked in marketing and advertising in Austin, and now she turns her talents\n to packaging winning arguments for our clients.\n* Adam Hockensmith clerked for Judge King on the Fifth Circuit. As a former NCAA\n wrestler, he\'s ready to grapple with opponents in the courtroom.\n* Krysta Kauble clerked for Judge Gutierrez on the Central District of California.\nShe serves on the Board of Governors for the Women Lawyers Association of Los Angeles,\nand we expect her to serve on the Board of Governors of Susman Godfrey in the near\nfuture.\n* Kristin Malone clerked on the Sixth Circuit for Judge Rogers before joining Susman\nGodfrey.  She worked as a paralegal before law school, so she already knows how \nto put together a winning case.\n* Mark Musico is spending a year at Susman Godfrey in between a clerkship for Judge\nBoudin on the First Circuit and a clerkship with Justice Ginsburg on the U. S. Supreme\nCourt. He\'ll become one of the 8 Susman Godfrey lawyers who have had a Supreme Court\nclerkship.\n* Abigail Noebels clerked for Judge Haynes on the Fifth Circuit. Before law school,\nshe honed her advocacy and problem-solving skills as Legislative Aide to a Houston\nCity Council Member.\n* Omar Ochoa comes to SG after two federal clerkships, with Judge Kethledge on the\nSixth Circuit and Judge Thapar of the Eastern District of Kentucky. At the University\nof Texas in Austin, Omar earned three degrees, was the first Latino elected to be\nStudent Body President, and was the Editor in Chief of the Texas Law Review.\n* Megan O\'Hara Easley clerked for Judge Wesley on the Second Circuit.  Megan also\nworked in the Rackets Bureau of the Manhattan DA\'s Office, so she isn\'t going to\n be intimidated by anyone or anything.\n* Steven Shepard clerked for Judge Kozinski on the 9th Circuit, then for Justice\n Kennedy on the U.S. Supreme Court, and then did a 3-year stint with the U.S. Navy\nJAG Corps. Having spent lots of time with drunken sailors, he\'s well-prepared for\nSusman Godfrey.\n* Trevor Stutz clerked for Judge Paez on the Ninth Circuit. He must understand our\n"work hard, play hard" philosophy because he called us from the Coachella Valley\n Music and Arts Festival to accept our job offer.\n\nIt\'s because of lawyers like these that we were recognized this week (click here\n to view the article [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001VF2-bwT8FEhoOp2OvbIJI_AxGP62YWdu4QqdeTsolIkvwQPYEwyFVWXZyjEUHm9oot_w17zmEnP3NCAtAjhMKWIb1jDef76L-2ZV0zbzLktDQJ3MGPPkFwp__XMbJfj7_J1mZOZ8NbJtPhGMrUIELEaHRo1ZvN_AJ61d8HWHcg575r9RXShuEVbf1w8qmPFa89bQ7KaH7fu9FDGl2pDi8g==])\nas one of The Most Feared Plaintiffs Firms and at the same time were last week able\nto achieve a stunning high profile Defense Verdict (click here to view the press\n release [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001VF2-bwT8FEjJLJPpErrbRP-01tdLpUGDgAXLTwCv1Kc9Kg8yUrhejXZZl35n-7Z-0QUUPJQhFWVd4iFxyJMjAOb1eCXL9ZDXpJ0CT98bbBL3VyvhqsEKP77I4jtbwbxGtfea4J2ycMH_cx3ALUnwUSO3vmSoohWwdaLcvS0riyAWtvl9e3qmOKqeGgUx6rY7FkIEDtw7nGm3fKRd3Hr11w==]).\nAlthough we now have 100 trial lawyers, we do not hire lawyers for leverage but \nrather continue to advocate being paid for results and not effort.   Our formula\n must work because we\'ve been around for over 30 years, and more than a dozen of\n our partners have been at Susman Godfrey for 25 years or more.
