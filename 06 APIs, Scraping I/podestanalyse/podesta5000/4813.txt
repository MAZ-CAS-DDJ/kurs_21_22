The 48 names that Eloise submitted to me have collectively raised over $1 million for Hillary for America. Please see the spreadsheet below with everyone's numbers, for a total of $1,229,941.28. However, as you know, if one raiser is attributed to another, up to $50,000 of their money raised will also be attributed to that person. Because this is the case with some of the Millstarters, the actual dollars in are slightly lower than the totals we see below. For that reason we ask that you please don't share the specific numbers below -- besides the total of course!\r\n\r\nThe group of women that you have suggested clearly has the capacity to continue to raise a significant amount of money for Hillary, and we are grateful to you for putting this together!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nOlivia\r\n\r\n"
