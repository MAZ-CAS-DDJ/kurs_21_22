A former Supreme Court law clerk, Dave has\nargued many important cases before the Court.  He's a terrific human\nbeing and I've worked with him as co-counsel in a number of cases.  I've\nfound him to be a pleasure to deal with, very good judgment and calm\ndemeanor.  Here's his resume in case you haven't gotten it from\nelsewhere.   Please give me a call if you need more info on David.  He'd\ntruly be great.\n \nI know you must be having some very exciting times.  \n"
