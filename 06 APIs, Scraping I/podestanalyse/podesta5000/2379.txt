john.podesta@gmail.comb'Finally checking email after acclimating to life as normal...  So much fun.  So much challenge.  I\'m amazed how much I love it at the end!  The team is what makes it, though, and John & eryn and their ragnarians are the absolute best!  Through thick and thin (and Eryn, absent your phenomenal assistance, the thins would be far more prevalent!), you are all what makes this experience such fun.  Thanks for letting me be a part of the fun.\n\nIf anyone is ever in Charlottesville -  call!\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Oct 4, 2015, at 11:59 AM, bdeese@gmail.com wrote:\n> \n> Adding my thanks to Eryn and John and Mary.
