john.podesta@gmail.comb"Hi all\n\nA reminder that we are organizing one or two brown bag lunches at which Larry Solum, our maestro of Canvas, will be demonstrating the features he uses.   Please sign up so that we can determine which day is better.   Larry Solum Canvas Brown Bag<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pu03cd5yiTK8JpRB5BTDxdPe-R6ZW7PqnAdj72PxxqE/edit?usp=sharing>.  (If you\x92re available for both sessions please sign up for both.)  To make the most of Larry\x92s session, you are encouraged to sign up for the course site we set up \x93Canvas as an LMS.\x94  To do so, email Julie Salah at jms552@law.georgetown.edu.  The first functions  to learn before the session are: making an announcement and uploading a file.\n\nWe created a survey to determine faculty preferences in moving to Canvas. If you haven\x92t already filled out the survey,  here it is: Survey<http://questionpro.com/t/CSn6aZQABFz>.  We will be using the survey results to determine our training priorities and schedule.\n\nA number of our faculty assistants have already begun to learn to use Canvas.  We will be rolling out training sessions for them and clinic administrators beginning next week.\n\nLast (for now),  Georgetown's Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship, aka CNDLS,  has kindly agreed to send down Kyle Kuhn, a senior instructional design specialist,  to demonstrate Canvas features that enhance its teaching capabilities. I very much encourage you to attend one of the sessions.  I\x92ve worked with Kyle, and he is very good at what he does.  I\x92ve created a doodle poll here<http://doodle.com/fsbsrxs3y2p6hywa>, so that we can determine the best dates and times.  (The sessions are likely to last approximately an hour and a half.)\n\nEnjoy the long weekend!\n\nTanina\n\n\n"
