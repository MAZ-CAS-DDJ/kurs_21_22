So who do you want?\n\nA governor who isn\xe2\x80\x99t interested in governing? Who has let the Department of Human Services run amok, prompting a disability rights group to alert the federal government to his refusal to follow the law?\n\nA governor with no clear grasp of the job\xe2\x80\x99s scope? Branstad's\xc2\xa0actions have\xc2\xa0twice been ruled as unconstitutional overreaches of his job's authority.\n\nLuckily there is another promising candidate for this position: Jack Hatch.\n\nJack\xe2\x80\x99s spent his time in both the private and the public sector actually helping people, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s providing affordable housing where others won\xe2\x80\x99t build or ensuring health care for the children of Iowa, Jack has proven himself.\n\nContribute $25, $50, or $100 to help Jack win this race and sign Terry Branstad\xe2\x80\x99s pink slip. \nhttps://act.myngp.com/Forms/1111552770193032960\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s time we get a fresh start.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nGrant Woodard\n\nCampaign Manager\n\nHatch/Vernon for Governor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 Neighbors for Hatch, Inc.
