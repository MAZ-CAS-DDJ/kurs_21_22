I have thousands of supporters like you.\n\nChip in $5 or more right now to show that our grassroots campaign is stronger than a handful of billionaires:\n\nhttps://www.quinnforillinois.com/dont-let-them-buy-illinois\n\nAll of my life, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that the best way to counter big money is with people.\n\nOur government should be of the many, not the money. That\xe2\x80\x99s what is at stake in this election.\n\nThank you for standing with me.\n\nGovernor Quinn\n\n\n\n\nContributions are not tax deductible.
