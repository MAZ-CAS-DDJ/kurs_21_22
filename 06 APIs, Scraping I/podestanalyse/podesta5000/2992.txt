john.podesta@gmail.comb'Alyssa - You\'ve raised lots of questions that we need to consider, and\nyour questions have generated other questions on my end.  So let me\nspend some time thinking about this, and I\'ll email all three of you\nback with some preliminary thoughts.\n\n \n\nFrom: Peter Rouse [mailto:cats02@verizon.net] \nSent: Monday, October 13, 2008 12:38 AM\nTo: Chris Lu; John Podesta\nCc: Alyssa Mastromonaco\nSubject: Who should these questions be directed to?\n\n \n\nTo:       Transition Team\n\nFrom:   Alyssa Mastromonaco, Director of Scheduling and Advance\nDate:    October 9, 2008\n\nRe:       Nov 5th and beyond \n\n \n\nNot knowing where the transition will be taking place and that the\nScheduling and Advance staff currently located in Chicago have leases\nending on or around Election Day, I wanted to submit a memo of questions\nto get an understanding of what exactly this department should be\nprepared for in the event Barack Obama is the president-elect on\nWednesday, November 5th. \n\n \n\nIf there is a reference or document that exists online that can answer\nany of these questions, please let me know. Thanks very much.\n\n \n\n*\tIs there a schedule/plan being prepared for November 5th (in the\nevent of a "win" scenario)?\n*\tIf so, who is putting together the schedule for BO for November\n5th \n*\tBeyond November 5th who is in charge of BO\'s schedule, is there\na plan/schedule being prepared? \n*\tAre there provisions for some advance and scheduling staff to be\nimmediately switched to transition payroll? This provides that BO will\ndo a staff thank-you event, victory tour and/or first trip to Washington\nDC.  Should I be preparing a plan of who would be transitioned?\n*\tIs there an operation in place that switches over method of\npayment for expenses for midnight on the 5th and beyond? A transition\ncredit card? Will we need to rely on wire transfers?\n*\tFor any national advance staff traveling on the road, should we\nensure we purchase their tickets to their homes prior to Election Day?\nWill there be any ability to use OFA funds past Election Day if we in\nfact win. \n*\tWe have a contract for our 757. Do I need to have a new contract\nprepared and ready to go in the event we win and are a new entity?\n\n\t*\tWhat aircraft does the president-elect travel on?\n\n*\tShould the traveling staff have arrangements in place to remain\nin Chicago? Should they be sent to Washington DC?\n\n'
