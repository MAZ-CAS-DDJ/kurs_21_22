john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi Carol,\n\nThanks so much for making the time to speak with me on Tuesday.  I  \nappreciate how busy this time is, and was glad to have a chance to  \ntalk as you are putting together your team.\n\nI want to offer a few further thoughts in response to your question on  \nthe specific contributions that I would bring to the daily work of  \nyour office.\n\nThere will be an ongoing need for someone on your climate and energy  \nstaff, specifically focused on inter-agency coordination in those  \nareas directly related to economic development, housing,  \ninfrastructure and jobs.  As you suggested, the position will have a  \nroll in creating accountability -- both positively as a cheerleader  \nand in enlisting the full commitment and work of agency staff in  \nmeeting White House priorities.  This person will need to be engaged  \nin supporting their policy development to ensure that these key  \nagencies keep the green dimensions of their mission high in their  \npriorities.\n\nThe position we discussed will require proficiency in a broad range of  \nskills from direct policy engagement, to public communications,  \nlegislative strategy, budget, and project management.  In addition, it  \nwill require specific knowledge not only of climate and clean energy  \nissues, but of housing finance, infrastructure policy, regulatory  \naffairs, and workforce development.\n\nI believe that I can be useful in all of these areas, and can serve as  \na strategic resource to you in linking environmental and economic  \ndevelopment efforts.  In addition, I have long experience and trust  \nworking with the labor, urban, clean tech business, and housing  \ncommunities, and can bring those relationships to bear to engage  \noutside stakeholders as political allies in support of global warming  \nsolutions that build a low carbon economy.\n\nAgain, I am honored to be considered for a position as a member of  \nyour core team, and I think that I can bring focused analysis,  \nspecific understanding of the economic development implications of the  \nclimate crisis, and a deep set of relationships with core  \nconstituencies and agencies, in support of the effectiveness of your  \noffice and in service to the incoming President.\n\nI look forward to working with you as we move into a new administration.\n\nMany thanks and best regards,\nBracken\n\n\n\nCell: 301-502-0532\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n'
