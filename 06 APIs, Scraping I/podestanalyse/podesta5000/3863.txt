When you turn into the main entrance, you\nwill go all the way to the end then make the first left. Lobby 3 will be on\nyour right side and you can park in any available spot (not vanpool).\n\n\nWhen you arrive at Building 20 Lobby 3 they will check you in at the front\ndesk and bring you up to Zuckerberg's office. Zuckerberg's assistant Andrea\nBesmehn will be around in case you have any questions about this. Her cell\nis 510.579.5823.\n\nHere are the directions to 1 Facebook way in plain text.  Below is a google\nmaps picture and attached you'll find a PDF from Facebook these directions\nand another map.\n\n\n*From the North:*\n\n1. Hwy 101 South\n2. Take CA-84/MarshRd East exit.

Turn right into the main entrance on Bayfront Expressway (SR84) between\nWillow Rd and Chilco St\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x8b\n\n--\nMilia Fisher\nSpecial Assistant to the Chair\nHillary for America\nmfisher@hillaryclinton.com\no: 646.854.1198 c: 858.395.1741\n"
