Press will ask if she ever emailed close staff like Huma, Philippe and Cheryl on their personal accounts.  \n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Mar 7, 2015, at 2:04 PM, Robby Mook <robbymook2015@gmail.com> wrote:\n> \n> My edits attached.  The one thing in here I feel strongly about is that she NOT include the part about meeting with other former secretaries and that they told her she should do this.  I recognize that the boss will have to approve, but if she wants to include that, I'd say we should discuss with her.  I worry it opens a major can of worms and deflects the heat in a potentially unhelpful way.\n> \n>> On Sat, Mar 7, 2015 at 1:42 PM, Heather Samuelson <hsamuelson@cdmillsgroup.com> wrote:\n>> All:\n>> \n>> Per our call today, attached is the DRAFT statement.\n>> \n>> As a reminder, this is a DRAFT and should not be circulated.\n>> \n>> Please note that Katherine Turner from David Kendall\xe2\x80\x99s office is copied on here, and she and/or David should be copied on all future communications.\n>> \n>> Let us know your thoughts.\n>> \n>> Best.\n>> Heather \n> \n> <2015-03-07 Draft statement - updated for review - REM Edits.docx>\n"
