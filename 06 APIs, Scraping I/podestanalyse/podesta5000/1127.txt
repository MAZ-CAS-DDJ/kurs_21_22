john.podesta@gmail.comb"Hi John - I hope you are well.  Cold weather, resurgent cold war, budget\ncuts, sanctions, etc.  I am sure there are no shortage of challenges every\nday.\n\nI have some good personal news to share.  I took a job at National\nGeographic Society working on their project to save the last wild places in\nthe oceans all over the world.  I am very excited about it.\nhttp://ocean.nationalgeographic.com/ocean/\n\n*Very confidentially*, we have a project in Africa that was recently\nsuccessfully concluded and are planning a big announcement to coincide with\nthe African summit in August.  President Bongo of Gabon will be in town for\nthe Summit and will announce the creation of a system of no take marine\nparks in Gabon covering 20% of the country's EEZ.  It is the first of its\nkind in the region.  There will also be a public-private partnership to\ncover management costs and, most importantly, to crack down on IUU fishing.\n\nWe would like to invite the President to attend our announcement.  It would\nbe a great way for him to praise Gabon and Bongo for what they have done\nand encourage other African coastal states/leaders to do the same kind of\nno take reserves.  We have an expedition in Mozambique next month, which\ncould lead to a similar reserve there.  There is no one in the world who\ncould make this point better than POTUS to this group of leaders.  And it\nis a good news story that could help publicize the Summit.  We will do it\nright at National Geographic -- so close to the WH -- and work around his\nschedule and the Summit events.\n\nWhat is the best way to get this into consideration for the POTUS'\nschedule?\n\nThanks so much!! Please let me know what else I need to do and/or who I\nshould be in touch with about this!  Thanks so much,  Monica\n"
