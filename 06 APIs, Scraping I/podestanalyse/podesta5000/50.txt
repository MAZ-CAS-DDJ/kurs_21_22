"For too long,\nthe rules have been written and enforced for Wall Street, by Wall\nStreet. Now groups funded by AIG and others are spending billions of\ndollars on a massive public relations and media campaign to keep things\nexactly the way they are. It\'s time for the Big Banks and brokers to\ncall off the dogs and stop blocking real protection for ordinary\nAmericans."\n\n \n\nAdditionally, today, the Center for Responsible Lending\n<http://www.responsiblelending.org/>  released a new policy brief\n<http://www.responsiblelending.org/mortgage-lending/policy-legislation/r\negulators/regulators-failure-to-enforce-consumer-protections.html.>\nthat chronicles the repeated failure of federal bank regulators over the\nyears to rein in irresponsible lending practices.
