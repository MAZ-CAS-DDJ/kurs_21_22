Yet, at the same time, there is some hope, but only if you help us redouble our efforts.\n\nUnfortunately, we lost some great Iraq and Afghanistan veterans in Congress, including Patrick Murphy, Joe Sestak, Chris Carney, and John Boccieri. In an election that trended against their party, though, they all were competitive. In Minnesota, though, Tim Walz won his reelection battle.\n\nAt the same time, we were able to help a great veterans advocate \xe2\x80\x93 Senator Harry Reid \xe2\x80\x93 win reelection in Nevada. To remind you, we put $600,000 into that race, because of your donations. And, while there are votes to still be counted, one of the best friends that veterans have ever had, Senator Patty Murray, looks like she'll win, as well. We worked hard in that state, knocking on thousands of doors, spreading word about her record on vets' issues. Additionally, we worked in Colorado to return Senator Bennet, who has been a friend and ally to veterans, and he won his race. \n\nWhat's this all mean? Well, first of all, it means we're going to have to work even harder during this new Congress to preserve veterans programs from the budget ax. It means we're going to have to fight even more tenaciously to push for energy independence that gets us off Middle East Oil. It means we're going to have to speak even more loudly when it comes to continuing to restore America's place in the world.\n\nSecond of all, it means that we will need to encourage more veterans to run for public office, and help them win. And, in that area, there is some good news. While a good number of our Congressional allies lost on Tuesday, we had some great victories among our Emerging Leaders \xe2\x80\x93 young veterans running for lower office. \n\n  * In Nevada, Elliot Anderson, a former Marine who was a state captain for VoteVets.org, is now going to be a State Assemblyman. \n\n  * Ruben Gallego, one of our leaders in Arizona won his election to become a new State Representative.\n\n  * Harold Naughton, an Iraq War Veteran, will continue to serve in the Massachusetts State House. \n\n  * In Missouri, Iraq veteran Steven Webber won his race for state house. \n\n  * In Delaware, Beau Biden, the son of the Vice President, and an Iraq war veteran, won re-election as Delaware Attorney General. \n\nSo, the next generation of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans entering public life are well on their way.\n\nStill, we have a lot of tough work ahead of us \xe2\x80\x93 tougher because of the results on Election Day. But, as tough as it is, it's nowhere near as tough as what our men and women in uniform face every day, or what veterans faced when they came home. We're not going to lay down or quit \xe2\x80\x93 we never have \xe2\x80\x93 and you can't either.\n\nSo, dust yourself off, and commit to working even harder with us, starting today.\n\nThanks for your support.\n\nSincerely,\nJon Soltz\nIraq War Veteran\nChairman, VoteVets.org\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n\nVoteVets.org \n\n [ http://www.facebook.com/pages/VoteVetsorg/8501031021 ]  [ http://www.twitter.com/votevets ]  [ http://www.youtube.com/votevets ] \n\nYou are subscribed to this list as john.podesta@gmail.com.
