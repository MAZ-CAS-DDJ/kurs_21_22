john.podesta@gmail.comb'Sunday\'s NYT has new evidence of Palin\'s desire to remove a book about\nhomosexuality from her local library. We just posted an interview with the\nauthor of that book.\n\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/13/author-of-book-palin-targ_n_126236.html\n Author Of Book Palin Targeted Lashes Back: She\'s My Mortal\nEnemy<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/13/author-of-book-palin-targ_n_126236.html>\n\nThe author of the book Sarah Palin reportedly tried to have removed from her\nhometown library blasted back Saturday evening, saying the Alaska Governor\nhad a "small-town mind," was an enemy of intellectual freedom and a\n"disastrous choice" for vice president.\n\n"I rather suspected one of my books might be the one she targeted," said\nMichael Willhoite, author of "Daddy\'s\nRoomate<http://www.amazon.com/Daddys-Roommate-Michael-Willhoite/dp/0613787137/ref=sr_11_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1221355889&sr=11-1>"\nand several other children\'s books. "I can tell you right now, Ms. Palin is\na very good mother and everything. But she is my mortal enemy. She is one of\nthe enemies of the First Amendment and I can hardly [organize] my thoughts\nhere, I am so offended by this."\n\nReached by phone, Willhoite was ultimately not surprised he had once been\nPalin\'s target. In fact, he admitted to being "strangely flattered" that he\nwas "on her list."\n\n"I wasn\'t on Nixon\'s enemies list," he said, "I was too young for that."\n\nAfter all, Willhiote has been at the center of religious conservative\ncomplaint ever since his work - which is about a young boy discussing his\ndivorced father\'s new, gay roommate - was first published in 1989. The book\nwas the no. 2 "most frequently challenged book" between 1990 and 2000,\naccording\nto<http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/bannedbooksweek/bbwlinks/100mostfrequently.cfm>the\nAmerican Library Association. But that didn\'t make him any less\ncritical\nof Palin, who he saw as a dangerous politician, both on issues of press and\nliterary freedoms as well as gay rights.\n\n"I don\'t think Ms. Palin will care for me, but that is fine," said\nWillhoite, who is openly gay. "I don\'t really care for her, not at all. I\nthink John McCain made a disastrous choice. Unfortunately she seems to be\ndoing well in the polls but I would think the honeymoon period will be\nending soon."\n\nOn Sunday, the New York Times\nfleshed<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/us/politics/14palin.html?hp=&adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1221343324-tGxa66AkDRYq1tsNYpjoIw&pagewanted=all>out\nrumors that as mayor of Wasilla, Palin had asked the town\'s librarian\nto\nremove certain books from the library\'s shelves. Citing contemporary news\naccounts and witnesses - including Palin\'s predecessor, John Stein, and her\nformer campaign manager, Laura Chase - the paper reported that:\n\n[I]n 1995, Ms. Palin, then a city councilwoman, told colleagues that she had\nnoticed the book "Daddy\'s Roommate" on the shelves and that it did not\nbelong there, according to Ms. Chase and Mr. Stein. Ms. Chase read the book,\nwhich helps children understand homosexuality, and said it was inoffensive;\nshe suggested that Ms. Palin read it.\n\n"Sarah said she didn\'t need to read that stuff," Ms. Chase said. "It was\ndisturbing that someone would be willing to remove a book from the library\nand she didn\'t even read it."\n\n"I\'m still proud of Sarah," she added, "but she scares the bejeebers out of\nme."\n\nPalin, in an interview before the Times\' article, dismissed the charge that\nshe had fired the town\'s librarian for banning books as an "old wives\'\ntale." The McCain campaign, too, has called\nthe<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/09/mccain-camp-responds-to-f_n_124947.html>entire\nmatter a smear attack on the vice presidential candidate.\n\n"This is categorically false. The fact is that as Mayor, Palin never asked\nanyone to ban a book and not one book was ever banned, period," McCain\ncampaign spokesman Brian Rogers said.\n\nAsked how he feels about his book being thrust back into the political fire\n19 years after it first caused waves of outrage, Willhoite fancied himself\nquite fortunate.\n\n"The fact is my book did very well in the first years of publication," he\nsaid, "and the lot of the reason it did as well as it did is because of the\nchallenges from the right."\n\nBut Willhoite expressed a sense of shock that a vice presidential candidate\ncould harbor such positions, even if he predicted that issues of books and\ncensorship would no longer be on Palin\'s radar.\n\n"To tell the truth I don\'t think it is something she will attend to," he\nsaid. "There will likely other more damaging things she will attend to. As a\nmayor of a small town she was attending a small town issue for small town\nminds. She has a small town mind, you see."\n\n\n\n\n\nNico Pitney\nThe Huffington Post\nP: 202.834.0301\nAIM: njpitney\nGTalk/MSN: nico.pitney@gmail.com\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
