It\'s good to be with you. I want to speak very briefly, and then\ntake your questions. I have the privilege today of speaking before my\nopponent, Senator Obama, whose talent as an orator, as you might notice, is\nsomewhat greater than mine. I will not overemphasize that fact by indulging\nyour patience with a lengthy speech. Fortunate for me and you, I enjoy\nlistening and responding to my audience\'s questions more than I do\ndelivering formal remarks. So, I want to share just a few thoughts with you,\nand then move quickly to your questions, comments or insults.\n\nWe meet after another week of rising gasoline prices, another stock market\nsell-off, more mortgage foreclosures and the increasing loss of the American\npeople\'s confidence in the economy. The question of how government should\nrespond to these troubling developments will shape much of the debate in\nthis election, and I want to offer a few thoughts about what I believe we\nshould do and not do.\n\nIt is a terrible mistake to raise taxes during an economic downturn.\nIncreasing the tax burden on Americans impedes job growth, discourages\ninnovation and makes us less competitive. Small businesses are the biggest\njob creators in our economy. Keeping individual tax rates low isn\'t intended\nas a favor to wealthy Americans. Most small business owners pay those rates,\nand taking more money from them deprives them of the capital they need to\ninvest and grow and hire. There are two million Latino owned businesses in\nAmerica, a number that is growing very rapidly. The first consideration we\nshould have when debating tax policy is how we can help those companies grow\nand increase the prosperity of the millions of American families whose\neconomic security depends on their success.\n\nGovernment should be on their side, not in their way.\n\nOur current business tax rate, the second highest in the world, will\npostpone our recovery from this downturn and make us increasingly less\ncompetitive in the world economy. When a corporation plans to expand and\nhire more workers, they face a choice between building a new plant here at\nhome and building it in a country like Ireland where they will pay less than\nhalf the tax rate they now pay. Employers can hire more people, or they can\npay more taxes. We can no longer afford the luxury of nostalgia for past\ntimes when American business faced little serious competition in the world.\n\nThe global economy is here to stay. We cannot build walls to foreign\ncompetition, and why should we want to. When have Americans ever been afraid\nof competition? America is the biggest exporter, importer, producer, saver,\ninvestor, manufacturer, and innovator in the world. Americans don\'t run from\nthe challenge of a global economy. The courage, patriotism, ingenuity and\nindustry of our forbears earned the reverence we hold for our storied past.\nBut we have never been a country that substitutes nostalgia for optimism. We\nhave never been a country that would rather go back than forward. We are the\nworld\'s leaders, and leaders don\'t fear change, hide from challenges, pine\nfor the past and dread the future. We make the future better than the past.\nThat\'s why I reject the false virtues of economic isolationism. Any\nconfident, competent government should embrace competition - it makes us\nstronger - not hide from our competitors a nd cheat our consumers and\nworkers. We can compete and win, as we always have, or we can be left\nbehind. Lowering barriers to trade creates more and better jobs, and higher\nwages. It keeps inflation under control and interest rates low. It makes\ngoods more affordable for low and middle income consumers. Protectionism\nthreatens all those benefits.\n\nOpening new markets for American goods and services is indispensable to our\nfuture prosperity. But in the global economy what you learn is what you\nearn. Today, half of Latinos and half of African Americans entering high\nschool will never graduate. By the 12th grade, U.S. students in math and\nscience score near the bottom of all industrialized nations. As Bill Gates\nsaid, "This isn\'t an accident or flaw in the system. It is the system." Many\nparents fear their children won\'t have the same opportunities they had. That\nis simply unacceptable in a country as great as ours. In many schools,\nparticularly where people are struggling the hardest, the situation is dire,\nand I believe poses the civil rights challenge of our time. We need to shake\nup failed school bureaucracies with competition; hold schools accountable\nfor results; strengthen math, science, technology and engineering\ncurriculums; empower parents with choice; remove barriers to qualified\ninstructors, attract and reward superior teachers, and have a fair but sure\nprocess to weed out incompetents.\n\nI have spent the last two weeks addressing the problem that is causing\nAmericans the most pain right now, our dependence on imported oil, and how\nto free ourselves from a situation that threatens our economy, our\nenvironment and our national security. Obviously, the crisis most acutely\naffects lower income Americans, who often drive the furthest to work and own\nthe oldest cars. There are a few, but not many, things we can do in the\nshort term to alleviate the economic distress Americans are feeling as they\npay more and more of their income for gasoline, and higher prices for\ngroceries and almost all goods that are affected by spiraling increase in\nthe price of oil. But we must commit ourselves to addressing this problem as\nquickly as humanly possible, and we must commit this country to the great\nnational cause of breaking our strategic dependence on foreign oil. To do\nthat, we must address both the supply and demand sides o f the problem. We\nmust produce more oil at home, and while exploration and production will\ntake some time, it will have an earlier effect on the oil futures market.\nWhen futures traders believe the supply of oil will increase in the years\nahead and the cost of a barrel of oil will be lower, it will help curb some\nof the speculation in those markets that are driving prices so much higher\ntoday.\n\nBut the lasting solution to all the problems associated with our dependence\non foreign oil is to begin in the term of the next president the most\nambitious program ever to reduce our demand for the fuel that is a powerful\ninflationary force in our economy; is causing our climate to change with all\nthe unimaginable problems that creates; and is ransoming our future to\nregimes that care little for our values or our security. We need to unleash\nthe competitive forces of the free market to encourage clean alternatives \x97\nwind, solar, tide, nuclear, and clean coal. But to really achieve energy\nsecurity, we must address the area where the demand for oil is the greatest\nthe way we fuel our transportation system. I have promised a plan, which I\ncalled the Lexington Project, for the place where America\'s war for\nindependence began, which will encourage the investment and innovation\nnecessary to wean our cars, buses, and trucks off of our complete dependence\non gasoline. This will take time, but the longer we wait to begin, the\nlonger it will take to achieve. It is an ambitious plan, but I am confident\nthat our industry and entrepreneurs, and all Americans are up to this next\ngreat challenge in our history. The genius, hard work and courage of\nAmericans have never failed us, and will not fail us now.\n\nLet me close by talking briefly about my respect and gratitude for the\ncontributions of Hispanic-Americans to the culture, economy and security of\nthe country I have served all my adult life. I represent Arizona where\nSpanish was spoken before English was, and where the character and\nprosperity of our state owes a great deal to the many Arizonans of Hispanic\ndescent who live there. And I know this country, which I love more than\nalmost anything, would be the poorer were we deprived of the patriotism,\nindustry and decency of those millions of Americans whose families came here\nfrom Mexico, Central and South America. I will honor their contributions to\nAmerica for as long as I live.\n\nI and many other colleagues twice attempted to pass comprehensive\nimmigration legislation to fix our broken borders; ensure respect for the\nlaws of this country; recognize the important economic necessity of\nimmigrant laborers; apprehend those who came here illegally to commit\ncrimes; and deal practically and humanely with those who came here, as my\ndistant ancestors did, to build a better, safer life for their families,\nwithout excusing the fact they came here illegally or granting them\nprivileges before those who did. Many Americans, with good cause, did not\nbelieve us when we said we would secure our borders, and so we failed in our\nefforts. We must prove to them that we can and will secure our borders\nfirst, while respecting the dignity and rights of citizens and legal\nresidents of the United States. But we must not make the mistake of thinking\nthat our responsibility to meet this challenge will end with that accomplish\nment. We have economic and humanitarian responsibilities as well, and they\nrequire no less dedication from us in meeting them.\n\nWhen I was in prison in Vietnam, I like other of my fellow POWs, was offered\nearly release by my captors. Most of us refused because we were bound to our\ncode of conduct, which said those who had been captured the earliest had to\nbe released the soonest. My friend, Everett Alvarez, a brave American of\nMexican descent, had been shot down years before I was, and had suffered for\nhis country much more and much longer than I had. To leave him behind would\nhave shamed us. When you take the solemn stroll along that wall of black\ngranite on the national Mall, it is hard not to notice the many names such\nas Rodriguez, Hernandez, and Lopez that so sadly adorn it. When you visit\nIraq and Afghanistan you will meet some of the thousands of\nHispanic-Americans who serve there, and many of those who risk their lives\nto protect the rest of us do not yet possess the rights and privileges of\nfull citizenship in the country they love so well. To love your country, as\nI discovered in Vietnam, is to love your countrymen. Those men and women are\nmy brothers and sisters, my fellow Americans, an association that means more\nto me than any other. As a private citizen or as your President, I will\nnever, never do anything to dishonor our obligations to them and their\nfamilies or to forget what they and their ancestors have done to make this\ncountry the beautiful, bountiful, blessed place we love.\n\nThank you.\n\n*Question and Answer:\n*1 Q): What will you do to keep the American Dream Alive\nMCCAIN: People should be allowed to get FHA guaranteed loans at new value of\nhomes. Jokes about Congresses low approval ratings.

I tried twice but\nfailed. We must build a border first, it is what the American people want.\nWe must treat immigratns humanely\n\n4 Q): How will you Handle the Health care crisis?\nMCCAIN: The problem is not quality it is availability. Some of the worlds\nrichest people travel to the states for health care. Mentions his $5,000 tax\ncredit so that individuals can go across state boarders for insurance. Says\nit is better then what companies have now. Stresses Wellness and Fitness and\nmentions State and Federal Governments working together to create risk pools\nfor those with chronic illnesses.

Says charter schools work, although\nthey are not much better then public schools\n\n6 Q): How can we strengthen American leadership globally while securing\ndomestic Jobs\nMCCAIN: I believe in free trade like the Colombian Free Trade Agreement.\nMentions Mexico\'s current battle with drug cartels and praises the president\nof Mexico. Says he is for free trade but that we shouldn\'t be callous to the\nvictims of free trade.\n\n7 Q): Latinos have a large representation in the front lines of the war. As\na Vietnam vet and a father of a military member in Iraq I ask what is your\nfuture policy for Iraq?\nMCCAIN: War was terribly mishandled. I went and saw the problems came back\nand asked for a new strategy, that new strategy is now working. Says he can\nurge our young Americans to serve a cause greater then their self interest\n\n8 Q): Latinos have challenged some of the current enforcement of\nimmigrations laws as being ineffective and inhumane. What policy will you\nhave that will help secure America but also be humane?\nMCCAIN: They are all gods children, I supported Regan\'s bill for Amnesty,\nImmigrants need to be treated humanely. Illegal Immigrants are sometimes\ntaken advantage of and treated inhumanely because they are illegal.\n\n\n-- \nAndres Moreno\nDeputy Director - Tracking/Media Monitoring\nProgressive Media USA\n202-609-7688 (office)\n703-501-6661 (cell)\namoreno@progressivemediausa.org\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
