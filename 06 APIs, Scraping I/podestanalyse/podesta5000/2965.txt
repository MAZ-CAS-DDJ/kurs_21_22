At any rate, it won\'t be presented as "middle class" in the\nspeech so  guess we are okay.\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Jul 9, 2015, at 10:24 PM, Joel Benenson <jbenenson@bsgco.com> wrote:\n\n  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think if we don\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x93 press won\xe2\x80\x99t write it?

I think the headline we want is \xe2\x80\x9cClinton\npromises economic agenda to increase middle class incomes\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cClinton\ndeclares rising middle class incomes the challenge of our times.\xe2\x80\x9d   But is\nthe tagline \xe2\x80\x9cget ahead, stay ahead,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfamilies succeed, you succeed?\xe2\x80\x9d  Just\nlike to resolve that.\n\n\nThanks all\n'
