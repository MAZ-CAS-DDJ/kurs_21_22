Verbatim, here is their guidance on your options, as well as the\nguidance from the student handbook:\n\n"Prof. Podesta and Judge Leon could either have the student withdrawn from\ntheir course, or wait until he does not submit the paper at which point he\nwould receive an \xe2\x80\x9cAF\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Administrative Failure."  I didn\'t see "AF" as an\noption on the grades website (just "F"), so I\'m asking them how that\'s\npossible if you choose to go that route, or if submitting as an F is the\nsame thing.\n\nPer the Student Handbook - " Regular and punctual attendance at all class\nsessions is required of each student. Student participation is expected in\nall courses. A student who, even though registered for a course, has not\nregularly attended, participated, or otherwise met class requirements may,\nat the professor\xe2\x80\x99s option, be withdrawn, excluded from attending class\nsessions, excluded from sitting for a final examination or submitting a\nfinal paper (with the same consequences as a voluntary failure to appear\nfor a final examination or submit a final paper), or receive a lowered\ngrade in the course."  See pp. 16 at\nhttp://www.law.georgetown.edu/campus-services/registrar/handbook/upload/Juris_Doctor_Program.pdf\n.\n\n\n\n-- \nEryn M. Sepp\nCell: 818-456-2881\n'
