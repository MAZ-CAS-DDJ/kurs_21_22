john.podesta@gmail.comb'Friends \xe2\x80\x93\n\nWanted to flag for you a couple of noteworthy items.\n\n\n*New PPP Poll Shows Hillary Clinton Holding Wide Lead Among Iowa Democrats*\n\nFirst, a new Public Policy Poll released today shows Hillary Clinton with a\nlead of 21 points for the Democratic nomination in Iowa.  Her standing in\nIowa has remained steady since last month. Read more on the poll\xe2\x80\x99s findings\nhere.\n<http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2015/09/trump-still-leads-iowa-clinton-in-good-shape.html>\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton Announces Opposition to Keystone XL Pipeline*\n\nHillary spend today in Iowa, where she held a town hall on her plan to\nlower prescription drug costs and participated in an editorial board\nmeeting with the Des Moines Register.\n\n\nDuring the town hall when asked where she stood on the Keystone XL project,\nshe voiced her opposition saying:\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\'ve got a responsibility to you and other voters who ask me about this.\nAnd I think it is imperative that we look at the Keystone Pipeline as what\nI believe it is\xe2\x80\x94a distraction from the important work we have to do to\ncombat climate change, and unfortunately, from my perspective, one that\ninterferes with our ability to move forward to deal with all the other\nissues. Therefore, I oppose it. And I oppose it because I don\'t think it\'s\nin the best interest of what we need to do to combat climate change. I will\nbe rolling out in a few days my plan for a North American approach to\nfighting climate change and clean energy. Because for me, we need to be\ntransitioning from fossil fuels\xe2\x80\x94I know it will take time\xe2\x80\x94to clean renewable\nenergy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nTalking points on Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s position on the Keystone pipeline are attached.\n\n\n\n\n*GOP\xe2\x80\x99s Offensive, Anti-American Rhetoric*\n\n\n\nIn recent days, leading Republicans like Ben Carson and Donald Trump have\nmade offensive comments about whether Muslims can be President\xe2\x80\x94comments\nthat are wrong both in fact and in what we stand for as Americans.\n\n\n\nWhile some Republicans have disagreed, their party has been too dismissive\nof the melting pot that America has been and continues to be built on. In\nfact, just today, Jeb Bush argued that \xe2\x80\x9cwe should not have a multicultural\nsociety,\xe2\x80\x9d ignoring the many different cultures that make America great. See\nBush\xe2\x80\x99s comments here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWdojg6otgg>.\n\n\n\nAs we have done throughout this campaign, Hillary Clinton and her team have\ncalled out the Republicans on their divisive views:\n\n\n\n*Huma Abedin* <https://twitter.com/HumaAbedin> *@HumaAbedin*\n<https://twitter.com/HumaAbedin>\n\nYou can be a proud American, a proud Muslim, and proudly serve this great\ncountry. Pride versus prejudice.\n\n\n\n*Hillary Clinton* @HillaryClinton <https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton>\n\nCan a Muslim be President of the United States of America? In a word: Yes.\nNow let\'s move on. -H\n\n\n\n In response, the Republicans have launched false attacks against\n\xe2\x80\x8bClinton.\n As you know, any suggestion that Hillary Clinton or her campaign started\nthe Birther movement is false. Byron Tau, who wrote a story for Politico\nabout the origins of Birtherism told FactCheck.org\n<http://www.factcheck.org/2015/07/was-hillary-clinton-the-original-birther/>\nthat\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe never found any links between the Clinton campaign and the rumors in\n2008.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tau\xe2\x80\x99s co-author for the story, Ben Smith, has said the conspiracy\ntheories did not come from \xe2\x80\x9cClinton herself or her staff.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThank you! Have a great evening.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x8bAdrienne \xe2\x80\x8b\n\n-- \n\nAdrienne K.
