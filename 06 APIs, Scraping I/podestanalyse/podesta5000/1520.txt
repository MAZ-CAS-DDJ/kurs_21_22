john.podesta@gmail.comb"Thanks Heather. Looks great.\n\nOn Wednesday, November 18, 2015, Heather Zichal <heather.zichal@gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n>\n> John - I hope this note finds you well. Wanted to send along some info\n> that I thought you and the campaign might find of interest.\n>\n> After I left the White House I gave a lot of thought to how we bring new\n> voices in the climate debate. And, more importantly, how we expand the\n> conversation to climate risk and preparedness. Well...fast forward a year\n> and change, a lot of analysis and the work by a great team of\n> researchers....and voila: http://statesatrisk.org/ comes to life.\n>\n> Earlier today, leaders from government, policy, business, planning and\n> academia launched this first-of-its kind report highlighting how states\n> across the country are largely unprepared to face the significant and\n> increasing risks posed by changing levels of extreme weather - specifically\n> extreme heat, drought, wildfires, inland flooding and coastal flooding\n> threats. The report, States at Risk: America\xe2\x80\x99s Preparedness Report Card,\n> was prepared by the States at Risk Project and provides a grade to each of\n> the 50 states based on their unique profile of threats to help provide a\n> benchmark to assess risks and build and implement action plans to increase\n> preparedness levels.\n>\n>\n> WHY:\n> Between 2011 and 2013, the federal government spent $136 billion \xe2\x80\x93 or\n> almost $400 in taxes from each American household each year \xe2\x80\x93 on disaster\n> relief. From providing emergency health services to rebuilding\n> infrastructure, recovering from extreme weather events is extraordinarily\n> expensive\xe2\x80\x94 and unfortunately, very few states have taken significant action\n> to prepare for future threats.\n>\n> About States at Risk: America\xe2\x80\x99s Preparedness Report Card\n> States at Risk: America\xe2\x80\x99s Preparedness Report Card is the first-ever\n> quantitative assessment of how prepared the 50 states are to face risks\n> posed by changing levels of extreme heat, drought, wildfires, inland\n> flooding and coastal flooding linked to climate change. The Report Card is\n> designed to help provide a path forward for states to assess risks and\n> build and implement action plans to increase their preparedness levels.\n>\n> Please check it out if you have some time. The press release and messaging\n> guidance is attached. We spent a lot of time in battleground states\n> figuring out how to fine tune the message. And we are going to be pushing\n> this in six key states with local events. To date, we have a lot of\n> interest from local news outlets, with a major focus on meteorologists.\n>\n> Hope it's helpful in some way!\n>\n> Best,\n> Heather\n>\n>\n"
