john.podesta@gmail.comb"John - \n\nWe've sent you a lot of email lately about our campaign to make Mitch McConnell pay for his efforts to block $21 billion to improve veterans' health care. \n\nAnd you're gonna get a few more messages over the next couple of weeks.\n\nBut it's important to note that VoteVets was started in large part as an effort to elect progressive veterans, and that remains a core focus of our efforts. We have a chance to do just that this November, and we hope you'll help us send a few to Washington, D.C.\n\nThey all have a shared FEC deadline tomorrow night - their last of the campaign - and I hope we can we count on you to split a small contribution to the full VoteVets slate to show your support.\n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/vv-candidates\n\nHere are the list we're supporting for federal office in 2014.\n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/page/-/Email%20Images/VV%20Email%20Image%20140929%20Candidates.png\n\nThe four candidates in the picture that I've highlighted in yellow all won Democratic primaries for U.S. House seats this year. Which means we'll hopefully have four new, progressive Iraq and Afghanistan veterans in Congress next year.\n\nIn addition to those, we're backing statewide candidates like Lt. Governor Anthony Brown's race for Governor of Maryland, and State Rep. Connie Pillich campaign for Treasurer in Ohio.\n\nAnd our emerging leader program supports 20 veteran candidates running for County Council to State Senate seats and everything in between.\n\nBut today - please consider a small contribution to our federal candidates as a show of support ahead of tomorrow's final quarterly FEC Deadline of the 2014 campaign.\n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/vv-candidates\n\nYour commitment and support of VoteVets allows us to continually expand our electoral work.\n\nThank you,\n\nRick Hegdahl\nIraq War Veteran\nVoteVets.org\n\n\n\n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/unsubscribe\nPaid for by VoteVets Action Fund\n\n"
