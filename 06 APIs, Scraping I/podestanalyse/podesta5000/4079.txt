We've had such a surge of momentum that Tim says we could actually match Karl Rove's Super PAC in the last week if we can quickly raise another $24k.\n\nBut decision time is coming quickly. 4:30 P.M. is the deadline to wire more money to boost our TV buy. \n\nWe're really under the gun here. If there's any chance you can help us out, now's the time. In a few hours, there'll be nothing more we can do to reach voters on TV. \n\nAfter all the blood, sweat and tears, winning or losing comes down to what we do right now. If you can help, click here. Every dollar is going straight up on TV.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/seanmaloney?refcode=20121102d&amounts=20,50,100,250,1000\n\nI've honestly been overwhelmed by your support during this campaign. I'll never forget your support and friendship. Thank you.\n\nSean\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\nPaid for by Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n\nSean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n18 W Main St\nBeacon, NY 12508\n\nTo unsubscribe from this mailing list, click here - http://images.myngp.com/unsubscribe.aspx?crypt=Casv%2frrJxGAq9DTl%2f1OHiHqjYnYu9HWTU%2fDi1gOjLgc%3d\n\nPowered by NGP VAN, Inc.\n\n"
