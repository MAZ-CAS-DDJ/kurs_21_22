Congresswoman Hayworth has dumped $1.3 million of her own money in her campaign - we need your help to fight back. We can\'t do it without you.\n\nWe\'ve got a big debate tonight and tomorrow is the FEC deadline, so it\'s all hands on deck here at HQ. We\'re doing everything we can to make sure Sean can fight back against Hayworth\'s radical Tea Party agenda - but we need to raise $10,000 by the FEC deadline tomorrow, and we need your help.\n\nPlease chip in $250 to get us to our goal before the FEC deadline, Otherwise, Sean has NO path to victory.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20141014am-od-ld&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\nIt\'s getting closer every day, and we will lose without your help.\n\nThanks,\n- Maura\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com. \n\nTo unsubscribe from the Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress email list, please click here:\n\nhttp://action.seanmaloney.com/page/unsubscribe/?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\n\n\nPaid for by Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n\n\n\n'
