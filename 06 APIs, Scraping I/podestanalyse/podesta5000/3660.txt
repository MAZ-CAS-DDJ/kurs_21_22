If that is the\ncase then, HRC might be able to do something about 3:00 p.m. in the Denver\narea.\n\n If we have two hours to work with, I would have her do a community meeting\nwith the Latino community in northwest Denver at La Casita restaurant,\nwhich was built and run by former State Senator Paul Sandoval who died two\nyears ago. His wife Paula Sandoval is the current owner and in her own\nright a political leader including State Senator and City Council member.\nOver the years this has been the hub of Latino political activity in\nDenver.  In addition to some regular customers, we could have the twelve\nLatino Senators and Representatives attend. This would be easy to put\ntogether.\n\n If not northwest Denver, we should get her into Adams County or Arapahoe\nCounty in Aurora in a similar venue.\n\n My fear is that the impression of Hilary in Aspen and at the Polo Club is\nnot something we want to highlight.\n\n Finally, I continue to think we need a keystone Colorado Political\nDirector who knows the players and the landscape. Jim and I shared our\nviews with you and John.\n\n I hope this is helpful.\n\n Ken\n\n\n If n\n\nSent from my iPad\n\nOn Jul 10, 2015, at 8:22 AM, Amanda Renteria <arenteria@hillaryclinton.com>\nwrote:\n\n  We have 3 fundraisers in total.
