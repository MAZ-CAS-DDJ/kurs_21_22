The television ad will begin airing\r\ntoday in Washington D.C., Ohio, Colorado, and New Hampshire, with events\r\ntaking place in Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Nevada, New Mexico, and\r\nWisconsin.\r\n\r\n"While soaring gas prices have crippled our economy and hardworking\r\nfamilies are hurting, the big oil companies are rolling in some\r\n$40,000,000,000 in profits in just the past three months alone," said Cathy\r\nDuvall, Sierra Club Political Director. "Barack Obama has a plan that takes\r\non Big Oil and would provide us with $1,000 in real relief to get us\r\nthrough today\'s crisis, while putting us squarely on the road to energy\r\nindependence.  Meanwhile, John McCain\'s taken over $2,000,000 in campaign\r\ncash from Big Oil and now wants them to have another $4,000,000,000 in\r\ngovernment giveaways.  We literally cannot afford another president who\r\nsides with Big Oil instead of American consumers."\r\n\r\nAs gas prices have skyrocketed and our pain at the pump has increased, oil\r\ncompany profits have also soared.  Just this week, Big Oil is reporting yet\r\nanother quarter of billions in record-breaking profits -- profits far\r\noutstripping even last year\'s record haul.  ConocoPhillips raked in\r\n$5,400,000,000, BP pulled down $9,470,000,000 (exceeding analysts\'\r\nexpectations by more than $1,500,000,000), and just today Shell announced a\r\nrecord of $11,560,000,000.   ExxonMobil\'s quarterly profit is expected to\r\ncome in around $13,000,000,000 -- the largest ever posted by a corporation,\r\nanytime, anywhere.  A recent Rice University analysis shows Big Oil is\r\ninvesting only a small percentage of its profits in exploration\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nmid-single digits figure unchanged since the 1990s, while the industry\'s\r\nspending on stock buybacks and dividends in order to further enrich its\r\ninvestors has increased from 1 percent of profits in 1993 to a whopping 55\r\npercent today.\r\n\r\nJohn McCain\xe2\x80\x99s Plan Calls for Billions in Additional Giveaways to Big Oil\r\n\r\nJohn McCain\'s economic plan calls for a drastic cut in the corporate tax\r\nrate.  This would not only permanently bust the budget with its $1.7\r\nTRILLION price tag, it would tremendously benefit Big Oil.  John McCain has\r\nalready refused to cut off more than $13,000,000,000 in government\r\ngiveaways to Big Oil and his new plan would give just the five largest\r\nAmerican oil companies another $3,800,000,000 handout each year\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nExxonMobil alone getting an astonishing $1,200,000,000.\r\n\r\n"It\'s American consumers--not ExxonMobil--that need help from the\r\ngovernment," said Duvall.  "John McCain claims his gas tax holiday would\r\nhelp consumers, but that\'s nothing more than a gimmick and a hoax. Over 230\r\nleading economists have said that it wouldn\'t do anything to help us and\r\nwould instead just add to the oil companies\' record profits."\r\nBarack Obama Has a Plan for Real Relief That Will Benefit Consumers\r\n\r\nBarack Obama has called for a second stimulus package and $1,000 in\r\nimmediate tax relief for consumers in order to help Americans deal with the\r\nrising costs of energy, food, and other goods.  He would pay for this plan\r\nby ending the billions in government giveaways to Big Oil and by making\r\nsure the oil industry is paying its fair share on its record profits.  His\r\nplan also would create over 5,000,000 new jobs and build the clean energy\r\neconomy by investing $150 billion in clean, renewable energy.\r\n\r\n"Obama\'s plan gives us real relief and will help end Big Oil\'s chokehold on\r\nour economy and politics once and for all," commented Duvall.  "Instead of\r\nMcCain\'s gimmicks and schemes that will benefit no one but Big Oil and do\r\nnothing to actually lower gas prices, Obama\'s plan sides with hardworking\r\nfamilies and will help put America back on the right rack."\r\n\r\nNew TV Ad Underscores Who Benefits--Consumers or Big Oil--Under Candidates\'\r\nEnergy Plans\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Club\xe2\x80\x99s new TV spot, entitled "Full Nelson," is airing in\r\nWashington D.C., as well as the key battleground states of New Hampshire,\r\nColorado, and Ohio. The buy could be expanded to additional markets in the\r\nweeks ahead.\r\n\r\nThe ad can be viewed at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO3kbVb79Q8\r\n\r\n\r\n"Full Nelson"\r\n30 seconds\r\n\r\nScript:\r\n[Shot of family being squeezed by oil barrels overflowing with cash]\r\n"Big Oil companies have our economy and politics in a choke hold."\r\n"They are getting billions from the government...raking in record\r\nprofits...while we pay $4 a gallon for gas."\r\nCite: Cox News Service,04/02/2008\r\n[Shot of McCain in front of the Capitol]\r\n"John McCain\xe2\x80\x99s answer?"\r\n"Another $4 billion giveaway to Big Oil."\r\n[$4,000,000,000 pops out of the Capitol like an old-fashioned cash\r\nregister]\r\nCite: Center for American Progress Action Fund, 06/18/2008\r\n[Shot of Obama in front of the White House]\r\n"But Barack Obama has a plan the breaks the grip of Big Oil..."\r\n[Shot of people installing solar panels]\r\n"...It invests in clean energy options and gives families energy tax\r\nrebates."\r\nCite: http://www.barackobama.com/\r\n[Shot of Obama]\r\n"Barack Obama.
