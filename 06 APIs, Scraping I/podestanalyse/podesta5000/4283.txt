But, we're still short our media budget before tonight's midnight deadline.\n\nIf you use this link, we can put your dollars into action immediately. http://action.thehousemajoritypac.com/AlisAsking#John\n\nWe need funds to be in before midnight to be wired for tomorrow.\n\nLet's go win this!\nAli\n\n----- Original Message -----\n\nDid you see Governor Dean's message, John?\n\nHe's right. 2014 isn't about winning the majority -- it's about laying the groundwork for electing a Democratic majority in 2016 to get our next Democratic president's back.\n\nBut John, we need your support before tonight's two-week-out budget deadline tonight -- so that in 2016 we don't have to win back seats in Connecticut or New York or New Hampshire. Can you click here and donate today?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/suit_bo?refcode=em1021142&amp;amount=25\n\nThanks, now let's go fight and WIN!\n\nAli\n\n----- Howard Dean's Message ------\n\nJohn,\n\nI'm not one for desperate subject lines or breathless histrionics, so hopefully, if you have made it this far into this email, you will give me a minute of your time.\n\nI don't think I will shock anyone by saying that it is an uphill climb to win a majority in the House this year. But that doesn't mean we can't lay the groundwork for 2016 now.\n\nWe know what the Boehner speakership looks like: obstruction, incivility, and intransigence. Important legislative actions like raising the minimum wage and immigration reform are virtually dead. Instead House Republicans would prefer to waste their time trying to dismantle Obamacare.\n\nThat is exactly the fate our next Democratic president's agenda will suffer in 2016 if we don't regain the majority.\n\nBut to have a shot at 2016, we can't walk away from competitive seats now. If we lose members like Carol Shea-Porter in New Hampshire, Tim Bishop in New York, and Elizabeth Esty in Connecticut, Democrats will have to spend twice as much in 2016 to try to win those seats back. That's money that could go to picking up new seats, not trying to retake old ones.\n\nHouse Majority PAC needs your help. Outside Republican groups have announced they are pouring an additional $12 million into House races this cycle. If we want to have a chance at 2016, we have to hold the line in the House now.\n\nWill you join me in supporting House Majority PAC? http://action.thehousemajoritypac.com/HMPHoldtheLine\n\nThank you,\n\nHoward Dean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContributions or gifts to House Majority PAC are not tax deductible\n\nPaid for by House Majority PAC. www.thehousemajoritypac.com.
