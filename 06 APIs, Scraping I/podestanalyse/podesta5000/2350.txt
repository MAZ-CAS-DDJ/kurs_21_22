We can get this passed, but we need your help: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=GFw00VCCI0Sa1zg3Lt0hiA .\n\nJohn,\n\nJoin our campaign to protect our families from toxic chemicals! Help LCV raise $100,000 by May 31st to jump start our campaign to get the Safe Chemicals Act passed: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=o7JjcexLOetUdQT4A_GNig .\n\nLast month, the Safe Chemicals Act was reintroduced in the Senate by New York Senator Kristin Gillibrand and New Jersey Senator Frank Lautenberg. This bill would protect Americans from dangerous toxic chemicals found in our everyday products.\n\nThis is common-sense legislation that needs to get passed by Congress and signed into law by the President.\n\nRight now, we're prepping for a serious grassroots organizing push. The key to getting this critical legislation passed is to make sure lawmakers hear from their constituents.\n\nThis is the perfect time to pitch in and help. We need to raise $100,000 by May 31st to launch this unprecedented mobilization effort this summer. We urgently need your support today.\n\nMake a gift to LCV before the May 31 deadline to encourage lawmakers to pass this critical legislation and protect our kids from dangerous, toxic chemicals: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=49Jki4E0I10uTnukmLJoBA .\n\nWe're going into a tough battle -- the chemical industry's lobbying has been so powerful that they've kept Congress from reforming the Toxic Substances Control Act since 1976. Why? Without changing the law, the EPA has only been able to test a few hundred of the 80,000 different chemicals currently on the market and chemical companies don't have to prove that the chemicals they make are safe before they end up in our products. This includes toxic chemicals that have been linked to rising instances of childhood cancer, learning disabilities, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, reproductive disorders, and asthma -- but the chemical companies don't care as long as their profits increase.\n\nBut we're not standing for this any longer. In April, we launched Phase One of our campaign to protect our children from toxic chemicals -- we banded together with the Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families Coalition to demand retailers tell their suppliers to take the 100 most dangerous chemicals out of their products. The first part of this campaign was a success, with nearly 40,000 LCV members calling on retailers to put safer products in their stores.\n\nNow it's on to the next step -- demanding that our members of Congress pass the Safe Chemicals Act into law. Your support can't come soon enough. Give today, and your donation will help LCV kick off efforts to pass this bill and allow us to finally know that the chemicals used in our products are being tested to make sure they're safe: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=fAVX89xH_gzueIgW_RcSdQ .\n\nHere's our plan to get the Safe Chemicals Act passed into law:\n\n*  Educate the public about where lawmakers stand on the Safe Chemicals Act and push our message out to the media to counteract the lies being spewed by retailers and suppliers who claim these dangerous chemicals have no ill effect on our children's health.\n\n*  Flood the U.S. Senate with our seasoned and skilled lobbying team. There's no better policy and lobbying team in the country and our experienced advocates will put the heat on senators up and down the aisle to make sure the Safe Chemicals Act gets passed.\n\n*  Pound Senate offices with calls from LCV members demanding that their legislators vote with our children, not with big chemical companies, and pass this critical bill ASAP.\n\nHelp us hold Big Chemical accountable and pass the Safe Chemicals Act to protect our families. Give as generously as you can by May 31 to help us reach our $100,000 goal: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=a2X56LcY9mBLawBwq7D77Q .\n\nWith the health and well-being of all our families at stake, we must pull out all the stops to ensure that sound environmental and public health policies -- like the Safe Chemicals Act -- get signed into law.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nGene\n\nThanks to our partners at Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families for the image.\n\nUpdate Your Profile\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=CfNLKZ-Hf3IUTTvlS38RXg\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=idYIgRg04MlApI9AEfID3P8siiUylkNA&cid=0\n\n1920 L Street, NW Suite 800\nWashington, DC 20036\n202-785-8683\n\n"
