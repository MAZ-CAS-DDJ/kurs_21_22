Sue Tierney will meet you in person and Charlotte Pera will join by telephone.\n\nIn the meantime,  please find attached an electronic orientation binder with basic information about ClimateWorks. You don't need to review the binder in advance of August 28, but we wanted you to have it in case you are ready to dive in or have some basic questions. Sue and Charlotte are also thinking ahead to additional material they might want to share with you as part of the orientation meeting, such as a summary of funding levels from our Funders Table participants, so please let us know in advance if there is anything that would be particularly helpful or interesting.\n\nHave a great weekend, and we'll talk to you next on Monday morning's teleconference.\n\nBest regards,\nGretchen Rau\n\n____\n\nGretchen Rau\nClimateWorks<http://www.climateworks.org/>\nClimateWorks Board Secretary\nAssociate Director of the Executive Office\n415-433-0521 | gretchen.rau@climateworks.org<mailto:gretchen.rau@climateworks.org>  | Twitter: @ClimateWorks<https://twitter.com/ClimateWorks>\n\nClimateWorks mobilizes philanthropy to solve the climate crisis and ensure a prosperous future.\n\n\n\n\n"
