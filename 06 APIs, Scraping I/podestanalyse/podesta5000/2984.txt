john.podesta@gmail.comb'PRESS RELEASE  August 31, 2014\n\nPDF Copy Attached \n\nThe 2014 Russian War against Ukraine\n\nIn the past few weeks, what was painfully obvious from the very beginning to\nUkrainians [that the terrorist conflict in Eastern Ukraine was artificially\nmanufactured, clandestinely funded, militarily supplied with weapons and\nfighting personnel, and secretly orchestrated by the Kremlin] is now\ngrudgingly acknowledged by the rest of the world.  Russia has now openly\ninvaded Ukraine and only Putin\'s generously paid Western apologists or the\nextremely na\xefve could argue otherwise.  The Russian government\'s continuing\nboldfaced lies that the alleged Donbas "separatists" are self-reliant\ndisgruntled Ukrainians who are Russian speakers seeking only to protect\ntheir rights can no longer be credulously accepted by the West.  This ruse\nhas run its course.  Russia is and has for months been in a state of war\nagainst Ukraine -- its sole objective is to eradicate Ukraine\'s\nindependence, and return it to a vassal state under the dictatorship of\nMoscow thus giving a rebirth to a new USSR-like empire.  \n\nSince the cataclysmic events of World War II, the world\'s nations have\nattempted to establish basic principles of international law and behavior to\nbe adhered to by the governments of all nations so as to prevent future\nconflagrations on a global scale.  The UN Charter, the Helsinki Final Act\n[the charter document of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope] and the various organic documents of the European Union, have had as\ntheir linchpin the principle of territorial integrity and security and the\ninviolability of borders of independent states.  NATO was created in part to\nprotect the territorial integrity of its member states from outside military\nthreats.  Since 1994, when it entered NATO\'s Partnership for Peace Program,\nUkraine has participated in NATO outreach programs and took part in NATO-led\nmissions around the world and alongside American troops in such places as\nIraq and Afghanistan.  It was this principle - territorial integrity and\nsovereignty of independent states - that was solemnly invoked - jointly and\nseverally - by the United Kingdom, the Russia Federation and the United\nStates in the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 which fervently pledged assurances\nby these countries of the inviolability of Ukrainian borders, an on which\nassurances Ukraine relied and voluntarily relinquished 1600 nuclear warheads\n- the then third largest nuclear arsenal on the globe.  \n\nIt is now self evident that the Kremlin has not and will not adhere to any\nof its internationally made pledges regarding the territorial integrity and\nsovereignty of states thus undermining the bedrock upon which European peace\nis built in the aftermath of World War II.  Rather, Russia has intentionally\ntrampled upon Ukraine\'s political and economic sovereignty and its\nterritorial integrity for quite some time in full view of the world.\nRegrettably, the response from the United States and the European Union has\nbeen a blinders-like muted scolding of Putin with tempered economic\nsanctions but specifically excluding any military assistance to Ukraine.\nThis piecemeal approach has only emboldened Putin and has given him a\nstrategic time-advantage to fully implement his invasion of Ukraine, which\nin turn, will directly affect the economic and political stability of the\nmember states of the EU.  In recent days, and to the world\'s astonishment,\nPutin has brandished not so veiled bellicose threats emphasizing the nuclear\narmament power that he has at his disposal. Clearly, it is in the long range\nself-interest of the West to take meaningful steps to stop and reverse\nRussia\'s aggression against Ukraine and thus protect its own political and\nterritorial integrity from future jeopardy.\n\nTowards this end, the United States and the United Kingdom have a particular\nresponsibility under the Budapest Memorandum.  There are those apologists\nthat argue that the Budapest Memorandum is not a "treaty" [even though it\nwas part of Ukraine\'s accession to the Non-Proliferation Treaty] and,\naccording to their flawed logic, its breach is not enforceable nor has any\nconsequential obligations for its other signatories.  However, The Budapest\nMemorandum is clearly a contractual agreement under which three countries\n[Russia, the US and UK] together obtained a valuable and tangible concession\nfrom Ukraine for their joint benefit - i.e. the relinquishment of 1600\nnuclear warheads - in consideration for which these three countries [Russia,\nthe US and UK] together gave their joint assurances for the territorial\nintegrity and economic independence of Ukraine.  As such, since one of the\nbeneficiaries of the Budapest Memorandum [Russia] egregiously breached its\npromise to respect Ukraine\'s territorial integrity, it is the obligation of\nthe other two beneficiary signatories of the Budapest Memorandum [the US and\nUK] to make certain that Ukrainian territorial integrity is fully restored.\nFailure to do so will undoubtedly completely undercut any future\nnegotiations with other nuclear powers in the hope of achieving nuclear\ndisarmament and world peace.\n\nThe time has now come for the West to take strong and meaningful action in\nsupport of Ukraine\'s independence and territorial integrity.  The West must\nstop moving the goal line in order to placate Putin in the unlikely\nPollyanna-like expectation that he will take an "off-ramp" and deescalate\nthe situation in Ukraine.  The hard and uncontroverted evidence proves\nexactly the contrary - Putin only interprets such peace intended initiatives\nas a sign of weakness.  He only respects decisiveness and power.  Therefore,\nthe West must face him with resolve and strength.\n\nIt is crystal clear that neither the United States nor the EU will put boots\non the ground in Ukraine.  However, as Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko\nhas expressed to world leaders, - Ukrainians have the resolve and will to\ndefend their homeland \x96 what Ukrainians need are military supplies and\nweaponry to aid them in their battle for national survival. Therefore, we\nstrongly urge that the following steps be implemented immediately by the\nUnited States government, NATO, and its European allies.\n\n\xb7        Military assistance in the form of lethal weapons and nonlethal\nmilitary supplies, as well as advisors and related intelligence and\nequipment.\n\n\xb7        The imposition of full sector sanctions, especially in the banking\nand fossil fuel industries, and the bank accounts of Russian governmental\nbusiness entities frozen.\n\n\xb7        Ukraine\'s accession to non-NATO ally status by the United States\nshould be expeditiously granted.\n\n\xb7        Increased humanitarian medical and other assistance by the\ninternational community for persons injured in the war and for the displaced\npersons from Eastern Ukraine and Crimea should be accelerated.\n\n\xb7        All sales of military or dual use equipment should be immediately\nstopped - especially by France which is planning in the near future to\ntransfer two Mistral type helicopter attack carriers to Russia.\n\n\xb7        Additional monetary funding for the Ukrainian government in the\nform of guaranteed loans should be provided to help Ukraine weather the\neconomic crisis caused by the Russian invasion.\n\nThe United States and Europe are at a historically crucial crossroad.\nAmerica must take strong and decisive action and reaffirm its world\nleadership position now!  If Western governments continue on the existing\npath of placating Putin and "doing business as usual", then they will\ncondemn our children and grandchildren to a probable conflagration on the\nEuropean continent that will be as great or even greater than the horrors of\nWorld War II [recall Putin\'s recent verbal flexing of his nuclear muscle]\n.....and from which America will have no escape.\n\n \n\nFor further information, please contact \n\nMyroslaw Smorodsky, Esq.\n\nCommunications Director of the Ukrainian American Bar Association (UABA)\n\nTel: 201-507-4500; Email;  <mailto:myroslaw@smorodsky.com>\nmyroslaw@smorodsky.com; Website;  <http://www.smorodsky.com/>\nwww.smorodsky.com\n\n \n\n \n\n'
