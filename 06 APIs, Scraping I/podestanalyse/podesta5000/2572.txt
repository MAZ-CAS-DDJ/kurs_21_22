Based on the available facts and the relevant precedents, criminal prosecution of Clinton for mishandling classified information in her emails is extraordinarily unlikely.\n> \n> My exasperation with Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s use of a private email server while secretary of state is long-standing and unabated. Lucky for her, political idiocy is not criminal.\n> \n> Ruth Marcus is a columnist for The Post, specializing in American politics and domestic policy. View Archive <http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/ruth-marcus>\n> \xe2\x80\x9cThere are plenty of unattractive facts but not a lot of clear evidence of criminality, and we tend to forget the distinction,\xe2\x80\x9d American University law professor Stephen Vladeck, an expert on prosecutions involving classified information, told me. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is really just a political firestorm, not a criminal case.\xe2\x80\x9d\n> \n> Could a clever law student fit the fact pattern into a criminal violation? Sure. Would a responsible federal prosecutor pursue it? Hardly \xe2\x80\x94 absent new evidence, based on my conversations with experts in such prosecutions.\n> \n> There are two main statutory hooks. Title 18, Section 1924 <https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1924>, a misdemeanor, makes it a crime for a government employee to \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly remove\xe2\x80\x9d classified information \xe2\x80\x9cwithout authority and with the intent to retain such documents or materials at an unauthorized location.\xe2\x80\x9d\n> \n> Prosecutors  <http://www.ncwd.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/general/Petraeus.pdf>used this provision <https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/03/petraeus-factual-basis.pdf> in securing a guilty plea from former CIA director David H. Petraeus, who was sentenced to probation and fined $100,000 <https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/petraeus-set-to-plead-guilty-to-mishandling-classified-materials/2015/04/22/3e6dbf20-e8f5-11e4-aae1-d642717d8afa_story.html>. But there are key differences between Petraeus and Clinton.\n> \n> Petraeus clearly knew the material he provided to Paula Broadwell was classified and that she was not authorized to view it. \xe2\x80\x9cHighly classified .\xe2\x80\x89.\xe2\x80\x89. code word stuff in there,\xe2\x80\x9d he told her <http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-03-03/david-petraeus-to-plead-guilty-to-classified-information-charge>. He lied to FBI agents, the kind of behavior that tends to inflame prosecutors.\n> \n> In Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s case, by contrast, there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified. Second, it is debatable whether her use of the private server constituted removal or retention of material. Finally, the aggravating circumstance of false statements to federal agents is, as far as we know, absent.\n> \n> The government used the same statute in 2005 against <https://fas.org/irp/congress/2007_rpt/berger.pdf> former national security adviser Sandy Berger <https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2005/April/05_crm_155.htm>, who was sentenced to probation and fined $50,000 <http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/08/berger.sentenced/>. Here, too, the conduct was more evidently egregious than what the public record shows about Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s. Berger, at the National Archives preparing for the 9/11 investigations, twice took copies of a classified report out of the building, hiding the documents in his clothes.\n> \n> For Clinton, the worst public fact involves a 2011 email exchange  <http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/265367-clinton-defends-telling-aid-to-send-data-through-nonsecure-channel>with aide Jake Sullivan. When she has trouble receiving a secure fax, Clinton instructs Sullivan to \xe2\x80\x9cturn [it] into nonpaper [with] no identifying heading and send nonsecure.\xe2\x80\x9d But Clinton has said she was not asking for classified information. In any event, it does not appear her instructions were followed.\n> \n> Another possible prosecutorial avenue involves the Espionage Act. Section 793(d) <https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793> makes it a felony if a person entrusted with \xe2\x80\x9cinformation relating to the national defense\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully communicates, delivers [or] transmits\xe2\x80\x9d it to an unauthorized person. That might be a stretch given the \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.\n> \n> Section 793(f) covers <http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2015/09/did-hillary-violate-the-law-against-disclosing-defense-information-a-preliminary-analysis.php> a person with access to \xe2\x80\x9cnational defense\xe2\x80\x9d information who through \xe2\x80\x9cgross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust.\xe2\x80\x9d The government has used the \xe2\x80\x9cgross negligence\xe2\x80\x9d provision to prosecute a Marine sergeant who accidentally put classified documents in his gym bag <https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/03/18/us-inconsistent-when-secrets-are-loose/6a928f72-d79b-430d-9c0b-93c67af05568/>, then hid them in his garage rather than returning them, and an Air Force sergeant who put classified material in a Dumpster so he could get home early.\n> \n> The argument here would be that Clinton engaged in such \xe2\x80\x9cgross negligence\xe2\x80\x9d by transferring information she knew or should have known was classified from its \xe2\x80\x9cproper place\xe2\x80\x9d onto her private server, or by sharing it with someone not authorized to receive it. Yet, as the Supreme Court has said, \xe2\x80\x9cgross negligence\xe2\x80\x9d is a \xe2\x80\x9cnebulous <http://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2252&context=lawreview>\xe2\x80\x9d term. Especially in the criminal context, it would seem to require conduct more like throwing classified materials into a Dumpster than putting them on a private server that presumably had security protections.\n> \n> My point here isn\xe2\x80\x99t to praise Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s conduct. She shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been using the private server for official business in the first place. It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible she was cavalier about discussing classified material on it; that would be disturbing but she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be alone, especially given rampant over-classification.\n> \n> The handling of the emails is an entirely legitimate subject for FBI investigation. That\xe2\x80\x99s a far cry from an indictable offense.\n> \n> Read more from Ruth Marcus\xe2\x80\x99s archive <https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/ruth-marcus>, follow her on Twitter <https://twitter.com/RuthMarcus> or subscribe to her updates on Facebook <http://www.facebook.com/ruthmarcus>.\n'
