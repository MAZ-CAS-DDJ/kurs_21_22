Joining us now are two of them, Alex and Brett\nHarris. They started Huck\'s Army, an online grassroots campaign for Governor\nMike Huckabee when he was still in the presidential race. They also wrote\nthe book, "Do Hard Things: A Teenage Rebellion Against Low Expectations."\n[\x85] You are now supporting John McCain, he had some trouble winning over\nsome very prominent evangelical leaders, why is he your man?\n\nBRETT HARRIS: Well, first, just to talk about Barack Obama because the\nquestion always is for young people, young people are supposed to be behind\nObama. That\'s the way it goes so, why McCain? And we are so excited about\nwhat Obama has accomplished, it\'s historic. And we\'re absolutely thrilled at\nthe possibility of the face of America might be a face of color. And one of\nthe things that especially excites us is how Obama has energized young\npeople our generation, really got them engaged in the political process. *But\nit\'s not enough to be engaged, you also have to be informed. That\'s the next\nstep, to be smart voters. And that comes from really weighing the issues,\nbeing really knowledgeable about the issues, and then looking at the\ncandidates as complete packages. And it was doing that that really caused us\nto go for John McCain.*\n\nCHETRY: So was there a time where you were thinking, possibly, of supporting\nBarack Obama?\n\nALEX HARRIS: You know what, Barack Obama has a lot of similar qualities as\nMike Huckabee, the man that we were originally supporting. They\'re both very\ncharismatic, great communicators, and there\'s something, they can really get\nin touch with the common person, you know the man on the street. *But right\nnow, we really knew what our core issues were, and our convictions, and\nthose lined up with John McCain.* As much as we are excited about, and\nappreciate, and honestly like a man like Senator Obama.\n\nCHETRY: Alright so what were some of those points then that made you\nultimately choose John McCain?\n\nALEX HARRIS:  Well really it\'s kind of like, well we\'re going through\nsomething right now that a lot of young people are going through. We\'re\nbuying a car before we head off to college. And you can go into a showroom\nand there\'s some really nice cars, a sweet car and it looks good and it\nfeels good and it smells good, and that\'s where a lot of young voters are\nright now. We\'ve, we\'re engaged, we\'re looking at cars and we\'ve found the\nshiny one. But when you sit down, you have to look at the price tag, and I\nthink it really for us was, sitting down and what is this going to cost?\nWhat are the long-term consequences? *Because our generation are the ones\nthat are going to have to pay for these programs and these issues. And I\nthink it was at that point that we really knew that John McCain was the\nchoice for us.*\n\nCHETRY: Alex, let me ask you about this, cause you know there are many in\nthe evangelical community who are not throwing their support behind John\nMcCain, in fact James Dobson the founder of the conservative group, Focus on\nthe Family, said that he felt that John McCain wasn\'t doing enough to bring\nin conservatives. In fact he said quote, "He was driving conservative away."\nWhat is it going to take for others to really believe that John McCain cares\nabout the issues that are important to evangelicals?\n\nALEX HARRIS: Well I think if you want to put your finger on the pulse of\nwhere evangelicals are, for us where young conservatives are with Senator\nMcCain, I think you need to look at first, Governor Huckabee and his strong\ncampaign and his strong support from those demographics because here was a\nman that was absolutely solid on the issues like the sanctity and the value\nof every human life, on the protection of the family. But who also\nunderstood that conservatives does, and really talks to issues that really\nmaybe fall outside the traditional republican box. *Things like healthcare,\neducation, being wise stewards of the environment. And that\'s an\nunderstanding that I think Senator John McCain shares, and that\'s an\nunderstanding that I think is appealing, not just to evangelicals, not just\nto conservatives, but to Americans on both sides of the political\nfence.*<https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/s9g5hb8ao4>\n\n\nHighlight #3\n*GMA Covers McCain Hypocrisy and Lobbyists Still Running the Show in His\nCampaign* (ABC, 06/20/08, 7:15am)\nJAKE TAPPER: *John McCain will likely opt into the public financing system,\nbut his rhetoric against big money influence also does not always match the\nreality.* For years McCain has portrayed himself as a crusader against the\ninfluence of lobbyists and big money.\n\n[McCain Clip: We need to close the door firmly on corporate lobbyists]\n\nTAPPER: *But he did not close the door firmly on corporate lobbyists helping\nto run his campaign. Dozens have raised money for him and several have\nhelped run his campaign until McCain instituted a new policy banning current\nlobbyists. But several former lobbyists are still running the\nshow.*<https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/qkn67hz40g>\n\n\nHighlight #4\n*Paula Abeles, Former Clinton Supporter Who Now Supports John McCain,\nDiscusses Racist Threats And Anger At Her For Switch* (FNC, 6/20/08, 7:27am)\nBRIAN KILMEADE: She\'s a life long democrat who volunteered for Hillary\nClinton\'s campaign, but now she\'s supporting John McCain and she claims\nshe\'s under attack by Barack Obama supporters. Paula Abeles joins us right\nnow from Washington D.C. Paula, what do you mean you\'re under attack?\n\nPAULA ABELES: Well, essentially 48 hours after I organized a tele-conference\ncall for Hillary supporters for John McCain, and it was a very successful\ntele-conference, we had about 6,000 supporters on the line, I was attacked\nin the internet blogs and by Keith Olberman as a racist. And I\'ve been\nreceiving threats to my home and threats to my children, and you know, I\'m\nall over the internet as a racist. And this is the most irresponsible kind\nof journalism, and they\'ve had absolutely no attempt to contact me, you\nknow, get my side of the story, ask for a comment, anything. And frankly,\nI\'m just outraged about it.\n\nKILMEADE: Paula, do you believe the Barack Obama camp is behind this, or\njust his supporters are behind this?\n\nABELES: *Well, I know immediately, whenever someone is taking a public\nposition to question the legitimacy or the qualifications of Barack Obama,\nthere\'s an immediate attempt to discredit them in the media.* One of my\ninternet bloggers sent me an email and they said, you know, they\'ve called\nHillary a racist, they\'ve called Bill a racist, they\'ve called Geraldine\nFerraro a racist, so you\'re actually in very exalted company. So I guess,\nmaybe they\'re getting our message, that we, *as Clinton supporters, are not\ngoing to toe the party line, we\'re not going to vote for an unqualified\ncandidate,* and we\'re not going to tolerate this kind of abusive and\nbullying behavior anymore.\n\nKILMEADE: So why did you switch parties? Do you think John McCain\'s policies\nare a lot closer to Hillary Clinton\'s policies and beliefs than Barack\nObama\'s?\n\nABELES: Well if you look very narrowly on the issues than obviously\nClinton\'s positions on the issues is closer to Obama\'s. *But if you take a\nbroader view, an ideology, than I think it\'s very clear that McCain and\nClinton both share a very centrist, a very moderate ideology, they\'re both\nvery strong on national defense, and frankly, Barack Obama, in my opinion,\nis not qualified to be president.* There has to be a minimum standard of\naccomplishment and achievement and experience, and he simply does not bring\nthat to the table. And in these perilous times we need a leader that\'s\nreally going to be able to really, you know, be able to solve some of these\nissues that are facing us. <https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/yd8mwtklcs>\n\n\nHighlight #5\n*Scarborough Pushes Holtz-Eakin on How We Can Afford to Extend the Bush Tax\nCuts *(MSNBC 06/20/08 7:50am)\nJOE SCARBOROUGH: Douglas Holtz Eakin, it\'s a bleak outlook for the US\neconomy right now. Many linking John McCain to George W. Bush\'s economic\npolicies. Tell us, why should Americans not blame John McCain for the\neconomic mess that\'s occurred under George W. Bush\'s presidency?\n\nDOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: Oh, John McCain\'s about, you know, growth, prosperity,\na great opportunity for America\'s future. That\'s what he\'s promised\nAmericans. He\'s got a recipe for how to get jobs going and how to compete\ninternationally, make sure our kids are educated, lower the cost of health\ncare. That\'s a recipe for success. And we have to be all about \x96\n\nSCARBOROUGH: Doug, Doug, Doug, that sounds like George W. Bush, what he said\nin 2000 and 2004. He was for growth, he was for opportunity, he was for tax\ncuts. Does John McCain believe tax cuts is going to stimulate this economy?\n\nHOLTZ-EAKIN: In this race we have, you know, one candidate that promised to\nkeep jobs in America by cutting the corporate tax. We have one candidate\nwho\'s going to, you know, going to raise taxes and, you know, Mr. Obama\'s\ngot a big problem. He\'s gone back on his pledge for public financing and,\nyou know, he\'s promising to cut taxes for everyone under $250,000, who is\ngoing to believe him now?\n\nSCARBOROUGH: Okay, let\'s look at Senator McCain\'s record on the issue of tax\ncuts and ask if people can believe John McCain. This is what he said in\n2001. "I cannot in good conscious support a tax cut in which so many\nbenefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle class\nAmericans who need the most tax relief." And then, of course, a few days ago\nwe had somebody else from the McCain campaign, Carly Fiorina repeat what\nJohn McCain has said, that we have to have those tax cuts now, that we\ncouldn\'t afford tax cuts in 2001 because of deficits but we can afford them\nnow. Do you think we can really afford tax cuts in 2008?\n\nHOLTZ-EAKIN: John McCain has a plan to bring the budget to balance by 2013,\nby doing what he wanted to do back in 2001. Which is, control spending and\nbe a little careful with America\'s money. We\'re spending money hand over\nfist. I\'m an economist; I can\'t even count how much money has been spent in\nthe last\x97\n\nSCARBOROUGH: Can we afford the tax cuts now?\n\nHOLTZ-EAKIN: Uh, look, we have an economy that is raising about 19% of\nAmerica\'s income in federal taxes. Americans don\'t need the federal\ngovernment taking away more of their taxes. They need to be able to go out,\nhave a vacation, send their kid to college, take care of the necessities at\nhome.\n\nSCARBOROUGH: Can we afford to extend George W. Bush\'s tax cuts?\n\nHOLTZ-EAKIN: We\'ve got a tax system right now, top rate is 35%. We\'ve got\ndividends and capital gains at 15 \x96\n\nSCARBOROUGH: No, no, I\'m asking the question, yes or no. Can we afford\x97\n\nHOLTZ-EAKIN: Oh yeah.\n\nSCARBOROUGH: --to extend George W. Bush\'s tax cuts?\n\nHOLTZ-EAKIN: This is all about how much you spend. You do this in your life.\nIf you spend the money, you might put it on a credit card. You\'ll pay it at\nsome point. How much you spend and, you know, John McCain has a great record\nof using the taxpayer\'s money wisely.\n\nSCARBOROUGH: You\'re saying we can afford, just a yes or no, we can afford to\nextend George W. Bush\'s tax cuts?\n\nHOLTZ-EAKIN: Yes.\n\nSCARBOROUGH: Okay. Well in 2001 when Senator McCain voted against George\nBush\'s tax cuts he said we couldn\'t afford it because it would create a\ndeficit. In 2001, we had a $155 billion surplus. This year, in 2008, when he\nnow supports the tax cuts, as you know, we are moving towards a $300 billion\ndeficit. How can we afford tax cuts in 2008 with a $300 billion deficit that\nJohn McCain said we couldn\'t afford in 2001 when we had $155 billion\nsurplus?\n\nHOLTZ-EAKIN: Look, the guy is a pretty good forecaster. He ran in 2000 on a\ntax cut to put the middle class first in line, protected social security and\nhad strict spending controls. What did we see? Social security wasn\'t\nprotected, no control on spending and, so, let\'s do it right the next time.\nHe\'s committed to taking care of important problems and that means having\nthe economy grow, letting people have a job and bringing the budget to\nbalance.\n\nSCARBOROUGH: But, again, you can understand why it would be confusing to\nAmericans if John McCain said we can\'t afford tax cuts in 2001 because of\nthe deficit and then the deficit\'s about $400 billion worse about eight\nyears later and he said, okay, forget what I said in 2001, now we can\nsupport it.\n\nHOLTZ-EAKIN: Oh no, I think if they had given him the controls in 2001, we\nwould be fine. But the American people didn\'t and now they have a chance to\ngive him, fulfill his pledges to the American people and take care of their\nbusiness and, you know, keep the economy going and having a balanced budget\nat the end of it.\n\nSCARBOROUGH: All right, thank you so much. Douglas, was that fun, Douglas?\n\nHOLTZ-EAKIN: That was so exciting to be here. You have no idea. They don\'t\nlet me out much. <https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/41yore60wk>\n\n\nHighlight #6\n*Obama\'s Communication Director Hits McCain on Drilling Flip-Flop *(MSNBC\n06/20/08\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI: . . .

I am here today at your invitation to answer questions about\nwhat I know regarding the Valerie Plame episode. Back in 2005, I was\nprohibited from discussing it by the White House ostensibly because of the\ncriminal investigation underway, but I made a commitment to share with the\npublic what I knew as soon as possible. That commitment was one of the\nreasons I wrote my book.  *Unfortunately, this matter continues to be\ninvestigated by Congress because of what the White House has chosen to\nconceal from the public. Despite assurances that the administration would\ndiscuss the matter once the Special Counsel had completed his work, the\nWhite House has sought to avoid public scrutiny and accountability. *The\ncontinuing cloud of suspicion over the White House is not something I can\nremove because I know only one part of the story. Only those who know the\nunderlying truth can bring this to an end. Sadly, they remain silent. The\nresult has been an increase in suspicion and partisan warfare, and a\nperpetuation of Washington\'s scandal culture, one of three core factors that\nhave poisoned the atmosphere in Washington for the past two decades. The\ncentral message in my book is the need to change the way Washington governs.\nWe need to minimize the negative influence of the permanent campaign, end\nthe scandal culture, and move beyond the philosophy of politics as war. No\none has a better opportunity to make that happen than the president. To do\nso, he must first fully embrace openness and candor and then constantly\nstrive to build trust across the aisle and seek common ground to unite\nAmericans from all walks of life and political persuasions. I believed\nPresident Bush could be that kind of leader for the country when I first\nwent to work for him in Texas. He was a popular, bipartisan leader who had a\nrecord of working with Democrats. Unfortunately, like many good people who\ncome to Washington, he ended up playing the game by the existing rules\nrather than transforming it. The larger message of my book is bigger than\nany person or party. It is about restoring civility and bipartisanship and\ncandor to our national political discourse. It is about putting our Nation\'s\ninterests above partisan goals. Indeed, all of us\x97especially those in\nelected office\x97can do more to make this happen by promoting openness and\nengaging in civil discourse. The permanent campaign leads to just the\nopposite. Substantive debates over policy give way to a contest over which\nside can most effectively manipulate the media narrative to its advantage.\nIt is about power and electoral victory. Governing becomes an offshoot of\ncampaigning rather than the other way around. Vicious attacks, distortions,\npolitical manipulation and spin become accepted. Complex issues are reduced\nto black-and-white terms and oversimplified in the context of winners and\nlosers and how they will affect the next election. Too often, the media\nunwittingly ignores the impact of government on the daily lives of\nAmericans, focusing foremost on the Beltway game and lionizing those who\nplay it most skillfully. There is no more recent example of this unsavory\nside of politics than the initial reaction from some in Washington to my\nbook. I received plenty of criticism for daring to tell the story as I knew\nit. Yet few of my critics tried to refute the larger themes and perspectives\nin the book. Instead of engaging in a reasoned, rational, and honest\ndiscussion of the issues raised, some sought to turn it into a game of\n"gotcha," misrepresenting what I wrote and seeking to discredit me through\ninaccurate personal attacks on me and my motives. The American people\ndeserve better. Governing inevitably has an adversarial element. People and\ngroups will always differ about the proper use of limited government\nresources. But should government be a process of constant campaigning to\nmanipulate public opinion, or should it be centered as much as possible on\nrational debate, deliberation, and compromise? Writing this book was not\neasy for me to do. These are my words, my experiences, and my conclusions. I\nsought to take a clear-eyed look at events. To do so, I had to remove my\npartisan lens and step back from the White House bubble. Some of the\nconclusions I came to were different from those I would have embraced at the\noutset. My book reflects the only idea of loyalty that I believe is\nappropriate in democratic government, and that is loyalty to the ideals of\ncandor, transparency and integrity, and indeed to the constitutional system\nitself. Too often in Washington, people mistakenly think that loyalty to an\nindividual officeholder should override loyalty to basic ideals. This false\nloyalty is not only mistaken, but can exercise a corrupt influence on\ngovernment. I am here because in my heart I am a public servant who, like\nmany Americans, wants to improve the way Washington governs and does not\nwant to see future administrations repeat the mistakes this White House\nmade. *I do not know whether a crime was committed by any of the\nAdministration officials who revealed Valerie Plame\'s identity to reporters.\nNor do I know if there was an attempt by any person or persons to engage in\na cover-up during the investigation. I do know that it was wrong to reveal\nher identity, because it compromised the effectiveness of a covert official\nfor political reasons.* I regret that I played a role, however\nunintentionally, in relaying false information to the public about it. I\'ll\ndo my best to answer any questions on this matter that members of the\ncommittee may wish to ask. <https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/b8vvp1sg8o>\n\n\nHighlight #10\n*Bush Comments on the Telecom Bill and War Funding *(MSNBC 06/20/08 9:11am)\nGEORGE W. BUSH: Congress moved forward on two important issues affecting the\nnational security of our country. Yesterday the House passed a responsible\nwar funding bill that will provide vital resources to our men and women on\nthe front lines in the war on terror. This legislation gives our troops the\nfunds they need to prevail without tying the hands of our commanders in the\nfield or imposing artificial timetables for withdrawal. The bill also\nsupports our military families by passing an expansion of the GI Bill that\nmakes it easier for our troops to transfer unused education benefits to\ntheir spouses and their children. I want to thank the members of Congress\nfor their action on this legislation, and I urge the Senate to pass it as\nsoon as possible. Members of the House and Senate also reached a bipartisan\nagreement yesterday on legislation to allow our intelligence professionals\nto quickly and effectively monitor the plans of terrorists abroad, while\nprotecting the liberties of Americans here at home. My Director of National\nIntelligence and the Attorney General tells me that this is a good bill. It\nwill help our intelligence professionals learn our enemies\' plans for new\nattacks. It ensures that those companies whose assistance is necessary to\nprotect the country will themselves be protected from liability for past or\nfuture cooperation with the government. The enemy who attacked us on\nSeptember the 11th is determined to strike this country again. It\'s vital\nthat our intelligence community has the ability to learn who the terrorists\nare talking to, what they\'re saying, and what they are planning. I encourage\nthe House of Representatives to pass this bill today, and I ask the Senate\nto take it up quickly so our intelligence professionals can better protect\nAmericans from harm. I\'m pleased with the bipartisan cooperation on both\nthese bills, and I thank the members for their efforts. Thank you.\n\n\nLocal Highlight #1\n*Local Minnesota News Covers AFSCME\'s & Other\'s Protests of McCain\'s\nFundraiser in St. Paul* (St. Paul Minneanapolis MN kARE, 6/19/08, 5:06pm)\nDIANE PIERCE: Well no republican presidential candidate has won Minnesota\nsince Richard Nixon back in 1972.

Many of them from AFSCME,\nthe country\'s largest public employee union which today endorsed Barack\nObama for president.* Most polls in Minnesota give Obama a sizeable lead\nhere. But days like make it clear, both sides see this state as a\nbattleground. As John McCain comes to Minnesota hoping to sway undecided\nvoters, Minnesotans hoping to keep the state blue got a head start. The\nService Employees International Union, which endorsed Barack Obama,\ncriticized McCain\'s plan to offer tax credits and savings accounts to help\npay for health insurance.\n\nSHANE ALLERS: *His plan would discourage employers from providing coverage\nand leave workers to defend for themselves against insurance companies.*\n\nGOLDBERG: And the political arm of Planned Parenthood in Minnesota and the\nDakota\'s announced it\'s endorsement of Barack Obama.\n\nSARAH STOESZ: We are very concerned that there be a new president who will\nappoint justices to the Supreme Court who will support access to all forms\nof reproductive health care for women.\n\nGOLDBERG: As McCain targets women, particularly democratic women who\nsupported Hillary Clinton, Planned Parenthood released a poll that shows 51\npercent of women voters do not know McCain\'s position on abortion. His\nwebsite says clearly, "Roe v. Wade is a flawed decision that must be\noverturned." Planned Parenthood\'s Action Fund is planning a campaign to\neducate women about McCain.\n\nSTOESZ: *It will be abundantly clear to them that he is not a friend to\nwomen and that the only friend for women in this presidential race is\nSenator Obama.*\n\nBEN GOLNIK: I chalk them up to partisan attacks by special interest groups.\n\nGOLDBERG: McCain\'s regional campaign manager dismissed the criticism from\nboth groups.\n\nGOLNIK: With healthcare, he wants to make it more accessible, he wants to\nhelp with preventative care. We\'ve had numerous calls from Hillary Clinton\nsupporters who are now very interested in joining the McCain campaign, so I\ndon\'t think those are fair attacks.\n\nGOLDBERG: Money will of course be pivotal in McCain\'s efforts to spread his\nmessage across Minnesota and the upper Mid-West, and he\'ll reel in a pile of\nmoney today. Though his campaign won\'t say exactly how much, this event here\nat the Hilton is for people who contributed between $1,000 and $50,000\ndollars to his campaign and to the republican party.\n\n[\x85]\n\nJOHN CROMAN: Well, you know, the fundraiser is something that\'s going to be\nimportant to his campaign no matter where he\'s campaign, but being here in\nMinnesota is actually going to be more important because of the media impact\nit has to have McCain in the state and it\'s seen by people in surrounding\nstates. Wisconsin, Iowa, and the Dakota, which are all in play in this\nelection. The event tonight at the Landmark Center is being dubbed as a town\nhall forum for undecided voters. Now, that is drawn more than a few snickers\nfrom DFL\'ers who point out that you have to get a ticket to get into this,\nand all the ticket holders tonight have been screened by the McCain\ncampaign. But they say they\'ve really gone out of their way to find a\ncross-section of voters who will ask tough questions, and they say that\nunder the circumstances it\'s the most impartial crowd they could get.\n\nGOLNIK: It\'s difficult to just open the doors and say we\'re going to have\n2,000 people there. I think it just becomes, from a logistics standpoint,\nhelping with the advanced work for some of these events, it\'s a lot of, it\ntakes a lot of time and effort to do that, and they do need to do that now\nthat Senator McCain does have Secret Service protection as does Senator\nObama. There\'s a lot more vetting, in terms of running a quick background\ncheck on all these people and making sure there aren\'t any problems there.\n\nCROMAN: Now Golnik also said that if Barack Obama would accept John McCain\'s\ninvitation to do joint town hall meetings, they would love to have Obama\nhere tonight, then both camps could actually screen about half of the votes\nor half of the ticket holders. And then you\'d get, kind of an evenly divided\ncrowd here, so we\'ll see how it works out.\n[\x85]<https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/a57o29140k>\n\n\nLocal Highlight #2\n*Local Iowa News Covers SEIU\'s Protest of McCain\'s Healthcare Stance Ahead\nof Visit to Flood Areas* (IA-5-KSTP, 06/19/08, 4:34pm)\nLEAH MCLEAN: A message from healthcare workers to John McCain, just ahead of\nhis visit today.\n\nPASTOR PAUL SLACK: There are 47 million people in this greatest nation of\nthis world, who have no healthcare coverage. There is a breach in our\nnation.\n\nMCLEAN: *The SEIU Local 284 Healthcare Worker\'s Union believes that John\nMcCain\'s plan would make it harder for average people to get healthcare\ncoverage. *McCain is in town for a private fundraiser at 5:30 in\nMinneapolis. That\'s followed by a 7:00pm invitation only town hall meeting\nthat will be held in St. Paul.\n\n\nLocal Highlight #3\n*Local Minnesota News Covers Importance of Upper Mid-West States This\nElection, and the Protesters Out To Paint McCain as McSame as\nBush*(MN-4-WCCO, 06/19/08, 5:04pm)\nPAT KESSLER: John McCain spent most of today in Iowa touring some of those\nflood damaged areas, terrible news down there. Tonight he\'s raising money\nhere in Minnesota at two separate events, including here at the Landmark\nCenter. He\'s got that town hall meeting later on tonight. *He\'s raising his\nprofile in a state, contrary to what you might here, could go republican for\nthe first time since 1972.* Barack Obama drew tens of thousands to a pair of\nrallies in Minnesota earlier this year. But what you see may not be how\nMinnesotans vote in November.\n\nLARRY JACOBS: The upper mid-west is the most competitive region in the\ncountry.\n\nKESSLER: *Minnesota is no longer a state safe for democrats, according to\npolitical analysts. And John McCain\'s visit is a signal of a state that\ncould go either way.*\n\nJACOBS: John McCain sees real success in winning over not only independents,\nbut even some democrats, perhaps some Hillary Clinton supporters, making big\nappeals to women and perhaps some of the white working class voters who\ndeserted Barack Obama in Ohio and some of those other states.\n\nKESSLER: George Bush came very close in 2004 to winning the upper mid-west.\nLosing Minnesota by 3 percentage points, Wisconsin by less than 1 percent.\nAnd he won Iowa outright by less than 1 percent. Close enough to make it\nworth a fight. McCain\'s Minnesota campaign calls it ground zero.\n\nBEN GOLNIK: Certainly Minnesota still leans slightly democrat, leans\nslightly blue, however, I think John McCain is a candidate that\'s really\ngoing to sell well here in Minnesota.\n\nKESSLER: *But democrats call John McCain, John McSame. They will portray him\nas a steady ally of an unpopular president.*\n\nDONNA CASSUTT: *Senator McCain has stood firmly with George Bush and his\npolicies. Voting with him over 95 percent of the time in this past year\nalone.*\n\nKESSLER: *And that\'s going to be the campaign in a nutshell. Tying McCain to\nGeorge Bush. McCain trying to separate himself.* Interesting concept and one\nthat\'s not lost on the presidential campaigns of either party. If you add up\nMinnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin\'s electoral votes, it\'s 27. Frankly, that\'s\nthe same number as Florida, which is a big big state for both campaigns.\n<https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/xcwpwhy8ks>\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
