In the email was a\n>>>>> transcript from one of the shows and a note from Sullivan saying that Rice\n>>>>> had made the administration\'s view clear that the attacks started\n>>>>> spontaneously and then evolved. Two weeks later, Sullivan sent HRC an email\n>>>>> outlining what she had said publicly about the matter, assuring her that\n>>>>> she had never described the attacks as spontaneous and she had never\n>>>>> characterized the attackers\' motives.\n>>>>> HRC did not send many long emails. Many of them were to Sullivan and\n>>>>> included news stories and the message: "Please print." The emails show that\n>>>>> four of HRC\'s closest advisers at the State Department used private email\n>>>>> accounts for some of their correspondences with her when she was Secretary\n>>>>> of State. The documents show messages between HRC\'s personal account and\n>>>>> the private ones of her chief of staff, Cheryl Mills; senior adviser,\n>>>>> Philippe Reines; personal aide Huma Abedin; and Mr. Sullivan.\n>>>>>\n>>>>>\n>>>>>\n>>>>> The questions I have for you are the same ones I sent before:\n>>>>>\n>>>>>\n>>>>> Why did the advisers use private email accounts - instead of\n>>>>> government ones - to correspond with Mrs. Clinton?\n>>>>>\n>>>>> Was this the normal practice?\n>>>>>\n>>>>> Why did Mrs. Clinton suggest that her emails were being captured in\n>>>>> the State Department system when she was corresponding at times with her\n>>>>> aides on their personal accounts?\n>>>>>\n>>>>> Were Mrs. Clinton\'s advisers given legal advice about whether it was\n>>>>> appropriate for them to correspond with her using their personal accounts?\n>>>>>\n>>>>> Why did Mrs. Clinton rely on the advice of Sidney Blumenthal?\n>>>>>\n>>>>>  ---------\n>>>>>\n>>>>>   Hi Michael,\n>>>>>\n>>>>>  Given the nature of the below involving facts that are under review\n>>>>> by both the State Department and the select committee, I\'m asking that this\n>>>>> all be considered *off the record*.  I say this because I want to\n>>>>> share some of these details in an effort to better convey why we still find\n>>>>> ourselves not clear on the core elements of this story, making it difficult\n>>>>> to respond to your questions.\n>>>>>\n>>>>>  Here\'s what I know.  I know that you have emails or information\n>>>>> about emails that were sent between Secretary Clinton and a personal\n>>>>> account of one of her staff.  You described that the majority of them came\n>>>>> from the 300 turned over to the select committee by the State Department,\n>>>>> but that based on your reporting you weren\'t certain.  I would note that by\n>>>>> definition if the emails involved personal addresses and were not forwarded\n>>>>> to the State system, they had to come from the 300 grouping, because\n>>>>> otherwise State would not have had them until they received the latest\n>>>>> batch (the 300 earlier this year).  So either they are part of a group that\n>>>>> came from a batch that the State Department already had in their\n>>>>> possession, which would seem to contradict your premise, or they came from\n>>>>> the 300.\n>>>>>\n>>>>>  Based on this, assuming they came from the 300, we\'re familiar with\n>>>>> the 300.  One of the things we know is that there is a handful of emails as\n>>>>> part of that 300 that did not eventually go to the state.govsystem,\n>>>>> as I told you last night.  This was more often than not because they were\n>>>>> personal in nature but handed over in an abundance of caution, came from\n>>>>> outsiders but had some of the keywords (like Libya) in them, or because\n>>>>> they were news articles simply sent to or from a personal account.  The\n>>>>> thing we are having trouble figuring out is that based on what you have\n>>>>> told us, and the names provided below, the two don\'t match up.\n>>>>>\n>>>>>  And I\'d remind you that there is no prohibition on the use of\n>>>>> personal email accounts, as you noted on the phone last night, as long as\n>>>>> they are preserved, and of course, by virtue of you having these emails,\n>>>>> they were not only preserved but disclosed.\n>>>>>\n>>>>>  So while we want to address your questions, without any sense of the\n>>>>> frequency, volume and any characterization of the interactions that were\n>>>>> had, nor any verifiable sense of whether these emails did or did not get\n>>>>> forwarded to the state.gov system, it\'s difficult to do so,\n>>>>> particularly since you are asking questions below that seem to characterize\n>>>>> these interactions as frequent, but it\'s unclear whether that\'s\n>>>>> substantiated.\n>>>>>\n>>>>>  So, in short, can we ask you to provide more information about what\n>>>>> you intend to write and the facts that will support it so we can more\n>>>>> accurately address your questions.\n>>>>>\n>>>>>  Thanks very much.\n>>>>>\n>>>>>  Nick\n>>>>>\n>>>>>\n>>>>\n>>\n>\n'
