After doing some research and\nbeginning to outline my paper, I\xe2\x80\x99ve realized that I\xe2\x80\x99d prefer to shift the\nfocus of my paper to a related topic\xe2\x80\x93the issue of interference in ongoing\ncriminal investigations by the investigative work of Members of Congress\nand committee staff. As I began writing about the Fifth Amendment and Lois\nLerner, I realized that there could be somewhat of an appearance of\nimpropriety given some summer work I did at the Public Integrity Section of\nDOJ. Moreover, because there's been so much ink spilled on Lois Lerner\ninvoking her Fifth Amendment privilege, I've had trouble figuring out a\nnovel approach.\n\nWould that shift in focus be okay?\n\nThank you for a wonderful semester!\n\nAll the best,\n\nMichaela\n"
