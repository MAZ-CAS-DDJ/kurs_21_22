It is\n>>> essential to the safety and security of all Americans - and could\n>>> raise the bar for all future transitions.\n>>>\n>>> We encourage you to reach out to the presidential campaigns with an\n>>> offer:  the committees of the Senate will consider, and the Senate\n>>> leaders will schedule a vote - as soon as possible after\n>>> Inauguration Day - for individuals designated by the President-elect\n>>> for as many key Cabinet and Subcabinet positions affecting national,\n>>> homeland and economic security as is feasible.  In order to meet\n>>> this highly ambitious and unprecedented timetable, the President-\n>>> elect would need to provide the names of his designees to enable the\n>>> Senate to conduct a thorough, but swift, review.\n>>>\n>>> The Senate has an opportunity through this proposal to initiate a\n>>> new standard of excellence in the selection and confirmation of\n>>> presidential appointees.
