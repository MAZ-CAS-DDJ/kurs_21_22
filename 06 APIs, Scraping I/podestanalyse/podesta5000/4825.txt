john.podesta@gmail.comb'>From what I can gather, checking in with Pete is not necessary (seems like\nhe is just going to let Michelle decide).  But checking in with Rahm  - to\nsay whatever it would be that you would have to say on this uncomfortable\nsituation -  would be helpful.  Cutter said she needs to have me meet with\nhim at some point, but nothing is scheduled.\n\nAlso, if you have time later today to talk about SEIU and DA, give me a call\non my cell.\n\nThank you.\n'
