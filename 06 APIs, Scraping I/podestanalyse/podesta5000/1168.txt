john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear Friend,\n\nWe are "back in the saddle" and heading out onto the summer campaign trail.\n\nAs the Philadelphia Daily News reported:\n\n"Sestak has developed a reputation within both parties for his no-nonsense style, superhuman work ethic and legislative ambitions in a wide range of issues."\n\nWhile the Philadelphia Inquirer reported:\n\n"Sestak \xe2\x80\xa6 never stops working \xe2\x80\xa6 he disdains politics and derides grubby \'deals.\'"\n\nWe finished "hard and fast" with our primary victory, now we are asking you to "spur our momentum" into the general election battle.  https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=ejune2link1\n\nA new Garin Hart Yang Research poll out this morning, has the race Sestak 47%  - Toomey 40%! ... However, we are at a significant cash disadvantage (because of the contested primary we went through, while Toomey was not in a primary battle). \n\nAs Time reported:\n\n"With Sestak, the race turns into a basic ideological clash between a standard-issue Democrat and an extremely conservative Republican in a Democratic state.  Toomey is undoubtedly bummed."\n\nTo "ride herd" over Pat Toomey\'s radical, extreme conservative positions that are backed by the national Tea Party movement, WE NEED to begin whittling down his financial advantage.  https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=ejune2link2\n\nPlease help us "kick-off" the general election race by making a contribution.  As we learned in the May primary \xe2\x80\xa6 every dollar can, and does, make a difference!  https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=ejune2link3\n\nIt\'s time to ride \xe2\x80\xa6 into what will be a hard-fought battle!\n\nBest regards,\nRich Sestak\nCampaign Director\n\n\nContributions are not tax deductible.\n\nContribute: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=ejune2linkb\n\nVolunteer: http://JoeSestak.com/volunteer\n\nUnsubscribe: http://JoeSestak.com/unsubscribe \n\nSestak for Senate\nPO Box 1936 Media, PA 19063\n\n(610) 891-8956\n\nPaid for by Sestak For Senate'
