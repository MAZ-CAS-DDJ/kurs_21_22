McCain has\nrepeatedly been wrong about central facts about the surge.  McCain\'s\nmisunderstanding of "the surge" undermines his credibility and makes it\ndifficult to ignore the McCain\'s role in the race to war or the command of\nthe first five years of the war.*\n\n*McCain Wrong About Iraq Policy, Loses Credibility. *\n\n* *\n\n\xb7         *McCain Asserted, and Re-Asserted Fundamental Misunderstanding\nAbout Iraq Surge**. *McCain again shows that he does not understand what is\nhappening in Iraq.
