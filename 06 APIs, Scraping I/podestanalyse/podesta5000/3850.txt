Led by eight stalwart Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee has passed a constitutional amendment to overturn the awful Citizens United and McCutcheon Supreme Court decisions.\n\n      The next step will be a vote in the full Senate.\n\n      Sign the petition: The U.S. Senate must pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and McCutcheon.\n\n      Citizens United and McCutcheon opened up the floodgates for unlimited campaign spending by the 1%, and we will keep seeing horrible court decisions like these until we change the U.S. Constitution to end the absurd notion that money is "speech."\n\n      That\'s why we are doing something amazing before the final Senate vote. Together with our progressive partners, we are going to deliver more than 2,000,000 signatures in support of the constitutional amendment to the offices of the 20 key Senators who will decide the outcome.\n\n      Gideon Rodeh, please sign your name before we deliver this mega-petition: The U.S. Senate must pass a Constitutional Amendment to overturn Citizens United and McCutcheon.\n\n      Keep fighting,\n      Rachel Colyer, Daily Kos\n     \n\n      P.S.
