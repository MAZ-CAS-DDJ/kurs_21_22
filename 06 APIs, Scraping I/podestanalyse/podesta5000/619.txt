Afterwards, she said she thought it was\nexcellent and that she wanted to do more.  Mission accomplished!  I think a\nsuggestion moving forward would be to have a H4A backdrop for future google\nhang outs.  That would add a nice visual to the presentation.\n\nI'll send around notes to everyone regarding the Q&A.  I also recorded the\npresentation as well, so we can pull a transcript.  Overall the\npresentation was 40 minutes and included six Questions from the Executive\nBoard.\n\n1.  Voter Suppression\n2.  Trade\n3.  Labor law reform\n4.  What will be President Clinton's role in the your campaign?  (Everyone\nlaughed about that one)\n5.  Income inequality and CEO pay\n6.  Social Security and pensions\n\nLet me know if you have questions!\n\n-- \nNikki Budzinski\nLabor Outreach Director\nHillary for America\n646-854-1442 (direct)\n"
