Right now, we are so close to hitting our goal this week. \n\nWhen Baron set a goal of raising $5000 from our grassroots supporters this week, I worried he was being a little ambitious. But you are coming through and we are just $1,192 from hitting our goal.* *Can you help us get over the top by pitching in now?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/bh-march?refcode=20160317abx&amount=5\n\nThere are a lot of important reasons to be a part of Baron's team, but I'll just give you one key example. *Yesterday, BOTH of Baron's opponents said they don't think we should even hold hearings on the Supreme Court nominee.* Not that there shouldn't be vote or that they should vote Judge Garland's nomination down, they don't think Senators should even hear what he has to say! It's that kind of partisanship and over-the-top rhetoric that is preventing leaders from fixing problems in DC. \n\nThat's why we need people like you. We are building a grassroots team across the state to elect a senator that puts fixing problems ahead of the political games. \n\nWill you chip in $3 right away and get us to our goal?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/bh-march?refcode=20160317abx&amount=5\n\nAnne Krapu \nFinance Director \nBaron Hill for Indiana\n\nDONATE\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/bh-march?refcode=20160317nd&amount=5\n\n\nPaid for by Baron Hill for Indiana\n\n\n\nThis message was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com.\nIf you'd no longer wish to receive updates from our campaign, please click here [ http://salsa4.salsalabs.com/o/51479/p/salsa/supporter/unsubscribe/public/?Email=john.podesta@gmail.com&email_blast_KEY=1302001 ]. \n\n\n\nPO Box 30675\nIndianapolis, IN 46230"
