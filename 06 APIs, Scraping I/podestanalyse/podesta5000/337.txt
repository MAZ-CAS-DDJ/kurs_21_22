I added this bit on\nUSAction to the appendix based on stuff from Blum.\n\n*USAction *\n\n\n\nUSAction is designed to create a bridge between groups (outside of labor)\nspecializing in low-income community organizing and those specializing in\nmiddle-income community organizing.  In 2006, USAction focused primarily on\nissue-based work, and in 2007, it worked with MoveOn and SEIU to help lead\nthe creation of Americans Against Escalation in Iraq.  Now, the group is\nfocused on building a new anti-war movement, and readying its 2008 program\nto take this organizing well outside the usual progressive community\x97groups\nlike military families and Reagan Democrats, key constituencies needed for\nmajorities in 2008 and beyond.\n\n\n\nUSAction's state affiliates are key leaders of state progressive coalitions,\nbringing together powerful groups of labor, environmental, social justice,\nand human service organizations.\n\n\n\nUSAction's estimated total (c)(4) civic engagement budget through 2008 is $9\nmillion USAction Education Fund's comparable budget is $10 million. Priority\nstates are AZ, CO, CT, FL, IA, IL, NH, NJ, NY, ME, OH, MI, MN, MO, PA, WA,\nWI and WV.\n\n\nOn 9/21/07, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com> wrote:\n>\n> When do you expect the labor piece?\n>\n> On 9/21/07, John Halpin <jlrhalpin@gmail.com> wrote:\n> >\n> > With revised Iraq language; (no labor section yet).
