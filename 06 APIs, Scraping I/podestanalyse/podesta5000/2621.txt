john.podesta@gmail.comb'This new partnership of the New York Review of Books and Vice seems to be quite interesting. The film accompanying George\xe2\x80\x99s readings clearly provide color and context to the reading. It\xe2\x80\x99s not required listening, but having read George\xe2\x80\x99s remarks earlier, I found it worthwhile. Clearly, something new.\r\n\r\nFrom: George Soros [mailto:info@georgesoros.com]\r\nSent: Friday, January 16, 2015 6:02 AM\r\nTo: Sandler, Herbert\r\nSubject: Europe vs. Russia\r\n\r\n[Description: Image removed by sender.
