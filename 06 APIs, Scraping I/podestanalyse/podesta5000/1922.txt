Think you would have had fun.\nOn Feb 18, 2015 8:52 PM, "Tiernan Sittenfeld" <tiernan.sittenfeld@gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hi John,\n>\n>\n> Great news about the monuments this week...huge thanks once again!  I hope\n> you\'re getting some time off and and am sorry for interrupting if so, but I\n> want to follow up about a couple things.\n>\n> 1. I\'m so flattered that you thought of me for the WH legislative affairs\n> job, and it would be a tremendous honor to help defend the administration\'s\n> incredible progress on the environment. That said, I reluctantly came to\n> the conclusion that it doesn\'t make sense for me at this time.  At a\n> personal level, my boys are 5 and 7 and need to see more rather than less\n> of their mom.  At a professional level, I\'ve got a lot on my plate at LCV,\n> including heading up our coordinated electoral work, and I intend to do all\n> we can to help elect Secretary Clinton.  And I really would love to work\n> for her someday, so please keep me in mind for the future...\n>\n> 2. On another note, my brother, PG Sittenfeld, is running for U.S. Senate\n> in Ohio. For the last several years, PG has been working to build better,\n> stronger schools in Cincinnati, and he has been a member of the Cincinnati\n> City Council since 2011. PG\xe2\x80\x99s priorities include raising the minimum wage, expanding\n> educational opportunity and helping bring down crippling student loan debt,\n> strengthening retirement security for all Americans, and promoting a clean\n> energy future that combats climate change.  As his proud older sister I am\n> clearly biased, but I think he would be a valuable addition to the U.S.\n> Senate.  I also think he makes a compelling case for why he can win a\n> general election. I\'ve attached info both on him and the race in case it\'s\n> of interest.  I know PG would really appreciate the chance to talk with you\n> briefly if you have a few minutes.  Would it be ok for him to call or email\n> you at some point?\n>\n> Thanks for all,\n> Tiernan\n>\n'
