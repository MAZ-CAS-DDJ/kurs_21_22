I know that the schedule has been set, the dates will be Thurs 09/24 \xe2\x80\x93 Sun 09/27, there will be 16 films and a ticket is $35.00.  There will be a preview of the films Wed, 08/26 at which time the films will be named and tickets will go on sale. \n>>  \n>> First, do you still want to go\xe2\x80\xa6we\xe2\x80\x99ve not gone in the past because tickets sell out so quickly because of the positive reviews it gets?  Next, are you comfortable committing to buy tickets without knowing the line-up?  If history repeats itself, tickets may sell out at the preview presentation so we won\xe2\x80\x99t have time to think and ponder.  On the other hand, if they sell out and we choose not to go after we bought tickets, we may be able to sell them to some unlucky soul.    \n>>  \n>> Let me know what you would like to do\xe2\x80\xa6I am planning to go to the preview and will be happy to get the tickets and then forward the schedule to you.\n>>  \n>> Hope to see everyone in Sept for movies and bourbon?!?!?\n>>  \n>> Patti\n'
