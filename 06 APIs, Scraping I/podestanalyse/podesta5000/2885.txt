He thinks that we should get a better balance in the\nparagraph on the wraparound of how deal should be judged in broader\ncontext.\n\nSuggest this:\n\nAs a result, America is less competitive than we should be.  Workers have\nfewer protections, the potential positive effects of trade are diminished\nand the negative effects are exacerbated.  We\xe2\x80\x99re going into this with one\narm tied behind our backs.\n\nInstead of: .\n\nAs a result, America is less competitive than we should be, workers have\nfewer protections, and the negative effects of trade are exacerbated.  That\nmeans even a generally strong trade agreement may put us at a\ndisadvantage.  We\xe2\x80\x99re going into this with one arm tied behind our backs.\n\n\n\nSTATEMENT\n\n\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m continuing to learn about the details of the new Trans-Pacific\nPartnership, including looking hard at what\xe2\x80\x99s in there to crack down on\ncurrency manipulation, which kills American jobs, and to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re\nnot putting the interests of drug companies ahead of patients and\nconsumers.  But based on what I know so far, I can\xe2\x80\x99t support this agreement.\n\n\n\nAs I have said many times, we need to be sure that new trade deals meet\nclear tests:  They have to create good American jobs, raise wages, and\nadvance our national security.  The bar has to be set very high for two\nreasons.\n\n\n\nFirst, too often over the years we haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten the balance right on\ntrade.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that even a strong deal, like our agreement with South\nKorea, which President Bush negotiated and President Obama improved, can\nfall short on delivering the promised benefits.  So I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we can\nafford to keep giving new agreements the benefit of the doubt.  The risks\nare too high that, despite our best efforts, they will end up doing more\nharm than good for hard-working American families whose paychecks have\nbarely budged in years.\n\n\n\nSecond, we can\xe2\x80\x99t look at this in a vacuum.  Years of Republican obstruction\nat home have weakened U.S. competitiveness and made it harder for Americans\nwho lose jobs and pay because of trade to get back on their\nfeet.  Republicans have blocked the investments that we need and that\nPresident Obama has proposed in infrastructure, education, clean energy,\nand innovation.  They\xe2\x80\x99ve refused to raise the minimum wage or defend\nworkers\xe2\x80\x99 rights or adequately fund job training.  As a result, America is\nless competitive than we should be, workers have fewer protections, and the\nnegative effects of trade are exacerbated.  That means even a generally\nstrong trade agreement may put us at a disadvantage.  We\xe2\x80\x99re going into this\nwith one arm tied behind our backs.\n\n\n\nI still believe a strong and fair trans-Pacific trade agreement is both\npossible and necessary, just as I did when I was Secretary of State.  And I\napplaud the hard work that President Obama and his team have put into this\nprocess.  But the bar here is very high and so far I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe TPP has\nmet it.\n\n\n\n<2015-10-07 TPP statement - 3pm.docx>\n\n\n\n\n\n*From:* Nick Merrill [mailto:nmerrill@hillaryclinton.com]\n*Sent:* Wednesday, October 7, 2015 3:05 PM\n*To:* Dan Schwerin <dschwerin@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Cc:* Jake Sullivan <jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com>; John Podesta <\njohn.podesta@gmail.com>; Christina Reynolds <creynolds@hillaryclinton.com>;\nBrian Fallon <bfallon@hillaryclinton.com>; Jennifer Palmieri <\njpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com>; Kristina Schake <kschake@hillaryclinton.com>;\nRobby Mook <re47@hillaryclinton.com>; Mandy Grunwald <gruncom@aol.com>;\nConnolly Keigher <ckeigher@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Subject:* Re: TPP Statement\n\n\n\nShe likes it.
