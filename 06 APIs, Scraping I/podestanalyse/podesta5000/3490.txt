See me for audio of the meeting (a little sketchy) and the statement\n(good, there was a mult)\n\n\n\nThe meeting started at 3:34 p.m. in the Kelly Center on the campus of\nWilmington College. The tables were set up in a large rectangle and two\ndozen community members sat around it, all with nametags.\n\nMcCain closed the meeting with a statement on what he plans to do to help\nthe Wilmington area cope.\n\nHe said he would do two things on behalf of Wilmington\x97the first would be to\nsend a letter, along with Congressman Mike Turner, to the CEO of Deutsche\nPost AG, of which DHL is a unit, and "ask him to come over and have this\ndiscussion at least have an encounter to the representative of the people\nwho are affected by this decision."\n\n"I value our friendship and our alliance with Germany and the German people,\nMcCain said, then added: "I think it\'s more than appropriate to come in and\nto talk to the individuals whose lives are being affected."\n\nThe second thing he promised to do as a result of the meeting is call for\n"congressional hearing on this situation as quickly as possible." That\nearned a big round of applause and a single "woo" from the two dozen\ncommunity members who were gathered.\n\nThen McCain offered some "straight talk."\n\n"I also have to say to you I don\'t know if all of this will work. I have to\nsay that. I have to give you straight talk. I do," he said. "I can\'t assure\nyou that this train wreck isn\'t going to happen but I will do everything in\nmy power to see that we avert it."\n\nHe continued: "I wanna assure you that if there is a worse case scenario\nthat I stand ready to do everything necessary, including these issues of\nemployment benefits because there\'s not enough hours, etcetera, all of those\nthings have to go into the trash can when we\'re talking about the lives of\nindividuals."\n\nThen he talked directly to Mary HOUGHTALING, the woman who asked the\nquestion at the town hall meeting on July 9 and who asked the campaign for\nthis meeting.\n\n\'I have to give you straight talk Mary," he said, adding that he knew about\nthe situation before that day but "I never knew it in the way that you\ndescribed it to me in the human terms."\n\nThen he repeated his disclaimer: "I can\'t look you in the eye and say I\'m\nsure we\'re going to avert this."\n\nHe said he would do everything to fight it not just for the community but\nalso on constitutional and legal grounds. "You have my sympathy but you also\nhave my support because of the legalities and the anti-competitiveness of\nthis that you so eloquently stated."\n\n"Please know that this has been very helpful to me but it\'s also very\nheart-wrenching to me to hear you speak Elizabeth," he said.\n\nThe meeting ended at 4:19 p.m. McCain shook hands and signed autographs.\nYour pooler was escorted out of the room to the holding area for the\nstatement.\n\n\n\nMORE COMING SOON\n\n\n\nBy Elizabeth Holmes /WSJ\n\nelizabeth.holmes@wsj.com\n<mailto:elizabeth.holmes@wsj.com<elizabeth.holmes@wsj.com>\n>\n\n202-615-2575\n\n\n\n-- \nMatthew DeLong\nReporter/Blogger\nThe Washington Independent\nmdelong@washingtonindependent.com\n(C) 928-310-8500\n(H) 480-209-1383\n\n\n\n\n-- \nMatt DeLong\nCell 928-310-8500\nmatthewedelong@gmail.com\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
