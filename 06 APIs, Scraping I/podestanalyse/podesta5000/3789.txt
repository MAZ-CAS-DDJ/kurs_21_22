It will be the only debate of the campaign.\n\nIt will be a studio debate, hosted by the Pennsylvania Association of Broadcasters, that will take place in the studios of FOX - WTXF TV in Philadelphia. The debate will be broadcast live to various stations across Pennsylvania. \n\nBelow is the most current list of stations in Pennsylvania that are covering the debate, either live or on tape-delay. I ask you to please tune in to watch, as well as letting your family, friends and colleagues know of this important event.\n\nFor those residing outside the state of Pennsylvania, you will be able to access the debate at JoeSestak.com.\n\nIt really is time for a new generation of leadership in Pennsylvania, and in Washington, DC, where principle really does triumph over politics! \n\nWarmly,\nJoe Sestak\n\nSTATIONS TO AIR DEBATE:\n\nErie:\nABC - WJET TV, Live\n\nPittsburgh:\nABC - WTAE TV, Live\nPCNC TV, Live (WPXI TV cable station)\n\nJohnstown:\nNBC - WJAC TV, 7:30 PM\nCBS - WTAJ TV, Live\n\nHarrisburg/Lancaster/York:\nABC - WHTM TV, Live\nCBS - WHP, TV, Live and streaming on website\nCW - WLYH TV, Live and streaming on website\nNBC - WGAL, May 2, 5 PM\n\nWilkes-Barre/Scranton:\nMyNetworkTV - WQMY TV, Live\nCW - WSWB TV, 11 PM\nFox - WOLF TV, May 1, Midnight\nABC - WNEP TV, Live on WNEP 2\n\nPhiladelphia:\nCBS - KYW TV, Live and streaming at cbs3.com\nFox - WTXF TV, Following NASCAR race\nABC - WPVI TV, Live\nCW - WPSG TV, May 2, 11 AM\nMyNetworkTV - WPHL TV, 9 PM\nWFMZ TV 69, Live on 69.3 and streaming on WFMZ.com\nNBC - WCAU TV, May 2, 9 AM\n\n \nContribute: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=eb\n\nVolunteer: http://JoeSestak.com/volunteer\n\nUnsubscribe: http://JoeSestak.com/unsubscribe \n\nSestak for Senate\nPO Box 1936 Media, PA 19063\n\n(610) 891-8956\n\nPaid for by Sestak For Senate'
