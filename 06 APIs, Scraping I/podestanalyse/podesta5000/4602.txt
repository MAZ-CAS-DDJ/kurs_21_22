On\nFriday, Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign released her personal financial disclosure\nform for 2014 through the present, which reported that she and her husband\nhad earned $25 million delivering paid speeches.\n\n\n\nThe State Department is proposing a deadline of January 2016 to complete\nits review and public release of 55,000 pages of emails former Secretary of\nState Hillary Clinton exchanged on a private server and turned over to her\nformer agency last December.\n\n\n\nLAST NIGHTS EVENING NEWS\n\nThere was no 2016 coverage on last night\xe2\x80\x99s major outlets except for to\nhighlight President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s tweet to President Obama about his new\ntwitter handle. Instead they covered the biker gang shooting in Waco, Texas\nwhere 9 died and 170 were arrested, coverage of the progress being made by\nAmtrak to recover the affected tracks. Also featured on ABC World News\nTonight was a special segment on Elian Gonzalez and immigration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF TODAY\xe2\x80\x99S\nNEWS................................................................. 1\n\nLAST NIGHTS EVENING\nNEWS................................................................. 1\n\nTODAY\xe2\x80\x99S KEY\nSTORIES............................................................................\n4\n\n*In Iowa for second visit, Clinton keeps to her low-key, tilt-left strategy*\n// WaPo // Robert Costa - May 18, 2015               4\n\n*Why Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Campaign Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the Most Liberal Ever* // TIME //\nHaley Sweetland Edwards - May 18, 2015      6\n\n*Hillary Clinton May Not Need a Second Chance to Make a First Impression*\n// NYT // Amy Chozick \xe2\x80\x93 May 19, 2015    7\n\n*State Department won\'t release Hillary Clinton\'s emails until January 2016*\n// Politico //  Josh Gerstein - May 18, 2015         10\n\n*More Clinton Fees to Be Disclosed* // WSJ // Rebecca Ballhaus and Peter\nNicholas - May 18, 2015          12\n\nSOCIAL\nMEDIA........................................................................................\n13\n\n*Bill Clinton (5/18/15,  12:57 PM)* Welcome to @Twitter, @POTUS!

She arrived quietly in a\nminivan trailed by Secret Service agents and ducked inside to greet a crowd\nof volunteers, who were given \xe2\x80\x9ccommit to caucus\xe2\x80\x9d cards to share with\nfriends. The tightly controlled setting also allowed her to continue to\nsteer clear of the press pack following her.\n\n\n\nHolding court in the living room, Clinton embraced her ties to President\nObama and cast herself as his tested and natural heir. It was an\nacknowledgment that Obama\xe2\x80\x99s leftover network remains a coveted coalition in\nIowa and an assertion that her time on the world stage is an asset, rather\nthan a liability, as Republicans have challenged.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going into this race with my eyes wide open about how hard it is to be\npresident of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton told approximately 50 Democrats\ngathered. \xe2\x80\x9cI do have that experience to know what is possible and how best\nto proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn economics, her message was populist. Facing vocal competition from\nbank-bashing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and other likely rivals for the\nDemocratic nomination, Clinton said she is as frustrated as anyone with the\ngap between the rich and the poor.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said. She\nattacked \xe2\x80\x9chedge-fund managers\xe2\x80\x9d and other financiers for exploiting\nloopholes in the U.S. tax code.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWarren Buffett has said it, but so have a lot of other people. There\xe2\x80\x99s\nsomething wrong when the average American CEO makes 300 times more than the\ntypical American worker,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n\nBut Clinton continued her stretch of declining to take questions from\nreporters \xe2\x80\x94 ignoring the media contingent outside the house and bypassing\ncontroversial topics, such as the debate over U.S. trade policy that has\nroiled Congress for weeks. Reporters were ushered out of the home after she\ndelivered her remarks, unable to record her exchanges with attendees.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s talk also came days after reports that she and husband, former\npresident Bill Clinton, have earned more than $25 million since early last\nyear in speaking fees \xe2\x80\x94 a development she did not mention during her\ncomments about the unsettling power of wealthy Americans.\n\n\n\nRepublicans seized on her event\xe2\x80\x99s closed nature and her refusal to take\nquestions from reporters. On Twitter, the Republican National Committee\npromoted its \xe2\x80\x9c#AskHillary\xe2\x80\x9d hashtag campaign in an attempt to pressure\nClinton to engage with the media.\n\n\n\nAs Clinton left the house Monday, reporters shouted questions that went\nunanswered, including this from Fox News\xe2\x80\x99s Ed Henry: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy won\xe2\x80\x99t you answer\nany questions?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton is scheduled to appear Tuesday in nearby Cedar Falls for a\nroundtable with small-business leaders. The stop, like Monday\xe2\x80\x99s, will be\nopen only to invited guests.\n\n\n\nMany people in the house were excited about getting a chance to hear her up\nclose, but some onlookers were less than enthused.\n\n\n\nDoug Bell, 59, a farmer from Thornton, Iowa, waited outside for an hour to\ncatch a glimpse of Clinton but left without getting a chance to speak with\nher.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI caucused for her in 2008, but the world has changed, and I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get\nher update about what\xe2\x80\x99s been happening with us, the backbone of America,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe said.\n\n\n\nClinton said she understood the concerns of everyday Iowans and would guard\nthe landmark policies of the Obama years, particularly the president\xe2\x80\x99s\nhealth-care law, to \xe2\x80\x9creignite\xe2\x80\x9d the national economy and give a lift to\nthose struggling.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe aren\xe2\x80\x99t running yet, but we are on our feet,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said.\n\n\n\nTurning to the issue of drug abuse and mental health, Clinton sounded\ncompassionate and solemn. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is below the surface people are talking about\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is something hard to deal with.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not believe I would be standing in your living room talking about\nthe drug abuse problem, the suicide problem and the mental health problem,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I am convinced I have to talk about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe visit was also a nod to solidarity with the gay rights movement,\nincluding her own shift toward supporting same-sex marriage as a\nconstitutional right. Genth, one of her hosts, is a board member of One\nIowa, the largest gay rights organization in the state, and was a prominent\nbacker of Obama in 2008. He and Swenson were married in 2009, soon after\nthe Iowa Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex unions.\n\n\n\nAcross Iowa, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign already has 21 organizers and six regional\ndirectors building her ground game \xe2\x80\x94 far more than other Democratic\ncontenders and part of her plan to cultivate skeptical liberals who may be\ntempted to back a lesser-known candidate.\n\n\n\nFor Clinton, that means going small, rather than big. Cookies, grapes and\nbottles of water were offered at the home, and no signs were displayed on\nthe lawn. If it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for the row of satellite trucks outside, there would\nhave been little evidence in the neighborhood that a presidential candidate\nwas mixing and mingling just up the block.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the best way to make those connections,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said of her\napproach.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Campaign Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the Most Liberal Ever\n<http://time.com/3882496/hillary-clinton-liberal-issues-mainstream-polling/>\n// TIME // Haley Sweetland Edwards - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nA number of Beltway pundits have recently decided that Hillary Clinton is\nnot just running a liberal campaign, but perhaps the most liberal campaign\nin decades. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not entirely accurate.\n\n\n\nJust as you can\xe2\x80\x99t step into the same river twice, no presidential campaign\never faces the same electorate. And on a range of issues, America has\nbecome more liberal since the last time Clinton ran.\n\n\n\nWithout exception, the positions that have been cited as \xe2\x80\x9cboldly liberal\xe2\x80\x9d\nare entirely in line with mainstream public opinion.\n\n\n\nTake gay marriage, which Clinton endorsed in 2013. As of last year, 6 in 10\nAmericans\xe2\x80\x94and a whopping 74% of Democrats\xe2\x80\x94were in favor of it too,\naccording to a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll.\n\n\n\nOr immigration. Last week, Clinton was congratulated by many liberals for\nbacking a broad path to citizenship for roughly 11 million undocumented\npeople. But in an NBC/WSJ poll last fall, 60% of Americans were in favor of\na \xe2\x80\x9cpath to citizenship\xe2\x80\x9d and nearly 75% were even more in favor of it if the\nplan involved asking immigrants to jump through certain hoops, such as\npaying back taxes.\n\n\n\nOr criminal justice reform. Last week, Clinton called for reforming\nsentencing laws and reducing how much military-grade equipment is funneled\noff to police departments. But as of last year, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much exactly\nwhere most Americans were, too: 63% were against mandatory minimum\nsentences for non-violent crimes, according to Pew Research, and nearly 60%\nthought militarization of police had gone too far.\n\n\n\nThe same is true on other socially liberal issues that Clinton has backed\nlately, much to the delight of the liberal base, including better gun\ncontrol measures, a minimum wage increase, and paid family leave. As of\n2013, 91% of Americans supported mandating criminal background checks\nbefore someone is allowed to purchase a weapon, and 60% supported\nreinstating a ban on assault weapons, according to Gallup. Roughly\ntwo-thirds of Americans are now in favor of raising the minimum wage and\n60% believe that employers ought to give paid time-off to employees when\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re sick, according to a February AP-GfK poll.\n\n\n\nIn early May, liberal activist groups claimed victory after Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\ncampaign manager, Robby Mook, hinted that the Democratic front-runner would\nsoon announce a comprehensive plan to make college more affordable. But\nagain, she\xe2\x80\x99s right in line with most Americans. According to the Harvard\nInstitute of Politics, 79% of Americans described student debt as \xe2\x80\x9ca\nproblem\xe2\x80\x9d that needs to be addressed.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Clinton has kept mum on some liberal ideas that are more\ndivisive. She\xe2\x80\x99s avoided taking a stance on President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s big new free\ntrade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which many liberals have\ncriticized. While she\xe2\x80\x99s made some populist remarks about reining in Wall\nStreet, she\xe2\x80\x99s stopped short of getting specific on liberal ideas like\ncapping CEO pay or breaking up the big banks. And she\xe2\x80\x99s not taken a\ndefinitive stance on the construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline,\nwhich has become a signature issue for environmentalists hoping to address\nclimate change.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s possible, then, to imagine a more liberal campaign than the one\nClinton is running. And if seems like she has the most liberal campaign in\nhistory, that\xe2\x80\x99s partly because she\xe2\x80\x99s facing an America that is more liberal\non those issues.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton May Not Need a Second Chance to Make a First Impression\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/us/politics/hillary-clinton-may-not-need-a-second-chance-to-make-a-first-impression.html?_r=0>\n// NYT // Amy Chozick \xe2\x80\x93 May 19, 2015\n\n\n\nJeb Bush has his famous last name as a calling card, for better or worse.\nBut Scott Walker\xe2\x80\x99s name does not ring many bells outside Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nTed Cruz is not even well known in Texas.\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential hopefuls will spend millions of dollars trying to\nget voters to remember their names and something that sets them apart. But\nthe one White House contender who needs no introduction faces a different\nsort of problem:\n\n\n\nEverybody knows Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n\n\nShe did not just co-star in a national soap opera during her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\neight-year presidency: She reinvented herself as a senator from the\nnation\xe2\x80\x99s biggest media market, New York; reintroduced herself again, this\ntime to the nation, as a presidential candidate in 2008 and then remade\nherself into the country\xe2\x80\x99s chief diplomat.\n\n\n\nShe never left the stage.\n\n\n\nNot since Richard M. Nixon mounted a comeback in 1968, historians and\npollsters say, has a candidate entered a presidential contest with so low a\nbar for name recognition or so high a bar for changing voters\xe2\x80\x99 opinions.\n\n\n\nThe campaign playbooks of Nixon and Mrs. Clinton seem to share some pages.\n\n\n\nNixon strove to show a more casual side by bypassing journalists and\nstaging town-hall-style events \xe2\x80\x94 orchestrated by his media consultant,\nRoger Ailes \xe2\x80\x94 at theaters across the country packed with friendly\naudiences. Taking softball questions, he kept to his talking points and\nstruck television viewers as more relaxed than the sweaty man they\nremembered from his debates against John F. Kennedy in 1960.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of people who thought they\xe2\x80\x99d made up their minds about him saw a\ndifferent version,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenneth L. Khachigian, a speechwriter for Nixon\nand later for Ronald Reagan. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a prime example of someone who had a\nlot of perceived political baggage and who remade himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton, too, has been ducking reporters and instead holding\nround-table discussions with carefully chosen voters in early voting\nstates. (Aides say the questions those voters ask are not screened.) She\nhas used the sessions to share lesser-known vignettes from her past: her\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s impoverished upbringing; her middle-class childhood in Chicago;\nher work in the 1970s as an advocate for children; her juggling work and\nchild rearing as a young lawyer in Arkansas.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, she will talk to small-business owners in Cedar Falls, Iowa,\npart of her second swing through the state.\n\n\n\nAt one event in Las Vegas, she sat with high school students whose parents\nare undocumented immigrants. It was a canny move: Young people and Latinos\nare two demographic groups whose opinions Mrs. Clinton may still be able to\nshape, Democratic pollsters say.\n\n\n\nThere are not many others.\n\n\n\nOnly 1 percent of voters have never heard of Mrs. Clinton, a CNN poll found\nin March (suggesting the network\xe2\x80\x99s pollsters managed to reach a few people\nliving in caves).\n\n\n\nA larger number, but still just 11 percent of all voters, said they did not\nknow enough about her to form an opinion, according to a New York Times-CBS\npoll published this month. By contrast, 43 percent said they did not know\nenough about Mr. Bush, the best-known Republican contender.\n\n\n\nOn the bright side for Mrs. Clinton, she enters the race with a devoted\nbase of supporters, mostly women, who appear solidly in her corner. Women\nin big states like Ohio and Pennsylvania heavily favored Mrs. Clinton in\nthe 2008 Democratic primaries, driving her defeat of Barack Obama in those\nstates.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton remains highly popular with African-Americans,\ncollege-educated women and single women, said Celinda Lake, a Democratic\npollster.\n\n\n\nScott Keeter, director of survey research at the Pew Research Center, said\nMrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s profile in the polls was like that of an incumbent facing\nre-election.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know from political science that a significant majority of the\nelectorate, upward of 90 percent, know how they\xe2\x80\x99ll vote,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\ntalking about 10 to 15 percent of the electorate who are in play, and then\nyou have to factor in enthusiasm and turnout.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe slivers of swing voters Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign hopes she can sway\ninclude married women in the suburbs. \xe2\x80\x9cThey love her experience,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Lake\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cand they like the idea of having a woman president.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe unknown\xe2\x80\x9cwild card\xe2\x80\x9d is whether Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s chance to make history as\nthe first female president will motivate voters who may be less inclined to\nsupport her, Mr. Keeter said.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, voters under 30 years old were far more likely to be undecided\nor to say they did not have an opinion of Mrs. Clinton, according to the\nTimes-CBS poll.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven though she\xe2\x80\x99s so well known, there\xe2\x80\x99s an aspect of a slate that can be\nwritten upon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jennifer Granholm, the former governor of Michigan who\nis co-chairwoman of Priorities USA Action, a pro-Clinton \xe2\x80\x9csuper PAC.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung people may need to be reminded about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThis year\xe2\x80\x99s cozy round-table discussions are not the first time Mrs.\nClinton has tried to show voters a softer side. In her 2008 campaign,\nthough, she waited until her favorability ratings had fallen during her\nheated primary battle with Mr. Obama.\n\n\n\nThe effort then included warm video testimonials about \xe2\x80\x9cthe Hillary I know\xe2\x80\x9d\nfrom her oldest friends and people she had met as a senator. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought she\nwas a bit remote,\xe2\x80\x9d Shannon Mallozzi, a Long Island mother said in one\nvideo. \xe2\x80\x9cShe sat with me, and she was just phenomenal. That day, it was two\nmoms sitting in a car.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut the effort seemed to some to be a calculated attempt by a candidate who\nwas behind.\n\n\n\nTrying too hard to change voters\xe2\x80\x99 minds about a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s character or\nlife story can be a trap, as Mitt Romney discovered in 2012.\n\n\n\nStung by attacks portraying him as a ruthless corporate titan, his aides\ntried to change public opinion about Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s years at Bain Capital.\nKevin Madden, who was a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, said it was a mistake\nnot to keep focused on communicating the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s forward-looking ideas.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of reintroducing his businessman profile, it should have been,\n\xe2\x80\x98How are we going to tackle the big economic challenges?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nThe 2016 campaign is still in its early days, making this the prime time\nfor the candidates to try to shape what the voters think of them. The later\nit gets, the harder that can be.\n\n\n\nIn 2004, the Democratic nominee, John Kerry, who battled an image of being\neffete, took a well-publicized hunting trip dressed in camouflage, hoping\nto show he could relate to voters who drive pickup trucks with gun racks.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was authentic, but perceived as inauthentic,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mark Mellman, a\npollster who advised Mr. Kerry. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is, he did actually bag a lot of\nbirds on that trip.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cChanging people\xe2\x80\x99s deeply held views,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cis the hardest thing to\ndo in politics and in life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nState Department won\'t release Hillary Clinton\'s emails until January 2016\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/state-department-wont-release-hillary-clintons-emails-until-january-2016-118078.html>\n// Politico //  Josh Gerstein - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nThe State Department is proposing a deadline of January 2016 to complete\nits review and public release of 55,000 pages of emails former Secretary of\nState Hillary Clinton exchanged on a private server and turned over to her\nformer agency last December.\n\n\n\nThe proposal came Monday night in a document related to a Freedom of\nInformation Act lawsuit Vice News filed in January seeking all of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nemails.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Department\xe2\x80\x99s plan \xe2\x80\xa6 would result in its review being completed by the\nend of the year. To factor in the holidays, however, the Department would\nask the Court to adopt a proposed completion date of January 15, 2016,\xe2\x80\x9d\nState\xe2\x80\x99s acting director of Information Programs and Services John Hackett\nsaid in a declaration filed in U.S. District Court in Washington.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Department understands the considerable public\xe2\x80\x99s [sic] interest in\nthese records and is endeavoring to complete the review and production of\nthem as expeditiously as possible. The collection is, however, voluminous\nand, due to the breadth of topics, the nature of the communications, and\nthe interests of several agencies, presents several challenges,\xe2\x80\x9d Hackett\nadded.\n\n\n\nThe controversy over Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s private email account led to a turbulent\nstart for her presidential campaign, which she announced last month. She\nhas said she wants the emails public and is eager for State to release them\nas quickly as possible.\n\n\n\nThe State Department\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, however, could mean a delay of almost 13\nmonths between the time Clinton turned over her records and the bulk of\nthem being made public.\n\n\n\nSoon after the New York Times revealed in March that Clinton had\nexclusively used a private email account as secretary of state, State\nDepartment spokespeople repeatedly said that they expected the review of\nthe Clinton records to take \xe2\x80\x9cseveral months.\xe2\x80\x9d They did not immediately\nrespond to messages Monday night seeking an explanation of why that\nestimate was so off base.\n\n\n\nHackett said 12 State staffers have been assigned full-time to reviewing\nthe Clinton emails and that it took until sometime this month to scan in\nthe records, which were provided on paper by Clinton in 12 \xe2\x80\x9cbanker\xe2\x80\x99s boxes\xe2\x80\x9d\nin December. He said the scanning process took five weeks and was\n\xe2\x80\x9ccomplicated\xe2\x80\x9d by some of the printouts of Clinton emails being double-sided.\n\n\n\nState Department officials did say they planned an earlier disclosure of a\nbatch of the emails provided to a House committee investigating the\nBenghazi attacks. However, the department\xe2\x80\x99s spokespeople have said only\nthat the initial release will come \xe2\x80\x9csoon,\xe2\x80\x9d declining to be more specific\nabout the timing of that first release.\n\n\n\nAsked by POLITICO Friday when that Libya-related batch of records should\nemerge, State spokesman Jeff Rathke was vague. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update to\nshare. But yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re aware that there\xe2\x80\x99s interest out there, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid at a daily briefing for reporters.\n\n\n\nState Department lawyers have complained in court of a \xe2\x80\x9ccrushing burden\xe2\x80\x9d of\nFOIA requests as well as at least 79 FOIA lawsuits pending against the\ndepartment. They have also cited the need to prioritize the Clinton email\nproject as a reason for delays in other FOIA cases.\n\n\n\nThe Iowa caucuses are due to be held Feb. 1, 2016 \xe2\x80\x94 just two weeks after\nthe proposed release of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s emails.\n\n\n\nMore Clinton Fees to Be Disclosed\n<http://www.wsj.com/articles/more-clinton-fees-to-be-disclosed-1431993044>\n// WSJ // Rebecca Ballhaus and Peter Nicholas - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON\xe2\x80\x94The Clinton Foundation will disclose this week a list of nearly\n100 paid speeches given by Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton dating to 2002\nfor which the foundation accepted the fees, officials at the charity said\nMonday, providing a window into another source of revenue for a family\nphilanthropy whose fundraising practices have cast a shadow over Mrs.\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s young presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign released her personal financial\ndisclosure form for 2014 through the present, which reported that she and\nher husband had earned $25 million delivering paid speeches. Not included\non that disclosure were payments for at least five speeches that Mrs.\nClinton directed to her family\xe2\x80\x99s foundation.\n\n\n\nThe Clinton campaign and a spokesman for Bill Clinton said that by law, the\nspeeches didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be disclosed because the speaking fees were donated\nto charity. Separately, a foundation official said the decision to post the\nlist was made in prior weeks, before Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s personal financial\ndisclosure form was filed, a requirement that federal law makes of\npresidential candidates.\n\n\n\nThe foundation will report the fees associated with each speech in ranges,\nofficials said. Some of these fees are already known.\n\n\n\nFederal law leaves room for interpretation on whether candidates are\nrequired to include speeches on that form if the funds go to charity.\nGuidelines posted on the website of the Office of Government Ethics, which\noversees personal financial disclosures, say payments of any kind\xe2\x80\x94including\nthose given to a charity\xe2\x80\x94must be reported \xe2\x80\x9cas usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut Vince Salamone, a spokesman for the office that oversees the ethics\nprogram for the executive branch said there are scenarios in which a\ncandidate wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be required to disclose speaking fees. If a person was\nin the role as an \xe2\x80\x9cagent\xe2\x80\x9d for the charity and the money was paid directly\nto the charity, disclosure wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be required, the office said.\n\n\n\nMr. Salamone said in a statement that \xe2\x80\x9cdisclosure of speaking fees is not\nrequired when a public filer or the filer\xe2\x80\x99s spouse is acting as an agent of\nan organization and payment is made directly to that organization.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe added: \xe2\x80\x9cThe rule is different when the speaking is done in a personal\ncapacity and the fees are directed or donated to charity, in which case\ndisclosure would be required.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe spokesman for the Clintons said they had complied with all disclosure\nrequirements. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeaking engagements for which fees are designated for the\nfoundation do not fall within those personal income reporting\nrequirements,\xe2\x80\x9d the spokesman said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe payment generated from that service\nis listed as revenue to the foundation on its tax documents.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSince Mrs. Clinton launched her campaign last month, the foundation has\nbeen taking steps to become more transparent. Starting in July, it will\nbegin releasing donor names quarterly. Previously, the names were released\nannually.\n\n\n\nStill, critics seized on the omission of those speeches from the campaign\nfiling to paint the former secretary of state as secretive. Her disclosure\ncame on the heels of recent revelations that some names of donors to\norganizations affiliated with the Clinton Foundation remained undisclosed.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is just another example of Hillary Clinton trying to play by a\ndifferent set of rules,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allison Moore, a spokeswoman for the\nRepublican National Committee.\n\n\n\nThe new list will include speeches Mrs. Clinton made at colleges and\nuniversities, which could revive criticism of the Clintons for accepting\npayments\xe2\x80\x94even on their foundation\xe2\x80\x99s behalf\xe2\x80\x94from schools that have been\nhard-pressed to keep tuition costs down.\n\n\n\nLast June, Mrs. Clinton faced a backlash when the Las Vegas Review-Journal\nreported that the University of Nevada at Las Vegas was paying her $225,000\nto deliver the keynote speech at a university fundraising event. Students\ncalled for her to reject the fee. A spokesman declined to confirm the\namount of the payment at the time but said such fees are paid through\nprivate donations and that no university funds are involved.\n\n\n\nA review of Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s financial disclosures while she was secretary of\nstate shows she has long followed the practice of omitting speeches where\nshe or her husband directed the payment to the Clinton Foundation.\n\n\n\nIn May 2012, Mr. Clinton was paid $250,000 for speaking at the Luskin\nLecture for Thought Leadership at the University of California, Los\nAngeles. The fee was donated to the Clinton Foundation, a spokesman for the\nuniversity said, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear in Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure forms.\n\n\n\nIn the 11 years during which Mrs. Clinton filed financial disclosures as a\nU.S. senator and as secretary of state, she reported that her husband made\n$105 million in speaking fees. All told, since leaving the White House, the\nClintons have earned at least $130 million in speaking fees.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton also delivered several speeches at universities in 2013, when\nshe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t required to disclose her income\xe2\x80\x94including one at the University\nof Buffalo for $275,000, which she donated to her foundation.\n\n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\n\n\nBill Clinton (5/18/15,  12:57 PM)\n<https://twitter.com/billclinton/status/600389785769881600> Welcome to\n@Twitter, @POTUS!

But liberal activists determined to use the Democratic\nprimary to pressure Clinton to embrace a progressive agenda say the idea of\nthe former secretary of state personally wooing the wealthiest class of\ndonors runs counter to the populist rhetoric she\'s employed this year.\n\n\n\nWithin days of announcing her White House bid, Clinton had called out\nwealthy investors for paying too little in taxes and pledged to get big\nmoney out of politics. At the time, it was a welcome message for liberal\nDemocrats who are uncomfortable with Clinton\'s close ties to Wall Street\nand find the prominent role of super PACs in elections utterly distasteful.\n\n\n\nBut the recent revelation that Clinton will personally fundraise for a\nsuper PAC supporting her campaign -- a decision to play by the rules of a\nsystem she has condemned as "dysfunctional" -- has invited fresh\neye-rolling. It has also exposed a core tension for Democrats, who have\nincreasingly embraced super PACs at the same time that they decry the\nexplosion of soft money in national politics.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s campaign is explaining the decision as a matter of political\nnecessity.\n\n\n\n"With some Republican candidates reportedly setting up and outsourcing\ntheir entire campaign to super PACs and the Koch Brothers pledging $1\nbillion alone for the 2016 campaign, Democrats have to have the resources\nto fight back," a Clinton campaign official said in an email, who spoke\nanonymously to discuss the sensitive topic of fundraising. "There is too\nmuch at stake for our future for Democrats to unilaterally disarm."\n\n\n\nClinton\'s expected involvement with Priorities USA has highlighted the\ncontrast between her and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who is\nClinton\'s only declared rival to date for the Democratic presidential\nnomination, as well as other potential challengers.\n\n\n\nAn independent from Vermont seeking the Democratic presidential nomination,\nSanders has aggressively opposed super PAC donations. A long-shot candidate\nwithout a national fundraising operation, Sanders has no chance of matching\nClinton\'s fundraising haul and has little to lose by going after\nmillionaire and billionaire donors.\n\n\n\nOn Capitol Hill last week, Sanders told CNN that Clinton\'s decision to\npersonally court super PAC donors was "unfortunate."\n\n\n\n"We\'re living in a world since Citizens United where multi-millionaires and\nbillionaires are playing a horrendous role in the political system,"\nSanders said, referring to the Supreme Court\'s 2010 ruling that paved the\nway for super PACs to direct virtually uncapped amounts of money to aid\npolitical candidates. "That\'s why I believe that we need to overturn\nCitizens United and move to public funding of elections."\n\n\n\nPhil Noble, a South Carolina Democratic activist and supporter of former\nMaryland Gov. Martin O\'Malley, a potential Democratic candidate for\npresident, said the development underscores what progressives view as a\n"fundamental disconnect" between Clinton and middle class voters.\n\n\n\n"It\'s not that she raises a bunch of money for a PAC that causes her\nproblems with middle class voters. That is a symptom as opposed to the\nailment," Noble said. "The larger illness is she is out of touch with\nmiddle class voters -- she does have a lifestyle and a history that is\nabout as alien to middle class voters as corporate jets are to a Subaru."\n\n\n\nAnd activists who are pushing Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to\nchallenge Clinton see campaign finance reform as a major issue.\n\n\n\n"Being a true champion for working families like Elizabeth Warren is about\nclearly and unequivocally supporting such critical priorities as a\nconstitutional amendment overturning Citizens United," said Erica Sagrans,\ncampaign manager for Ready for Warren, a movement dedicated to drafting\nSen. Elizabeth Warren into the 2016 race.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s personal involvement with Priorities USA marks the latest chapter\nin the Democratic Party\'s evolving relationship with super PACs.\n\n\n\nDemocrats initially fiercely opposed Citizens United. But for all of their\nrhetoric against super PACs, and as much as the party continues to use the\nSupreme Court decision as a political rallying cry, over the years\npolitical interest has largely won out over progressive idealism.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, President Barack Obama reversed course, declaring after years of\nkeeping his distance from super PACs that his campaign would participate in\nraising money for Priorities USA.\n\n\n\nNow that tension is being brought to new heights as the party\'s next likely\npresidential nominee personally plans to drum up support for a super PAC\nbacking her candidacy.\n\n\n\nClinton allies also see that her fundraising prowess and the depth of her\nconnections with the kinds of donors who can cut multi-million dollar\nchecks will likely make her a formidable competitor against any Republican\ncandidate she may face in the general election. Officials are careful to\nemphasize, however, that Clinton and everyone else involved with her\ncampaign will strictly follow the law as they solicit funds for Priorities\nUSA.\n\n\n\nThe 2016 money race is well underway on the other side of the political\naisle.\n\n\n\nDeclared GOP candidates including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio\nof Florida, as well as expected candidates like former Florida Gov. Jeb\nBush, are on a fundraising tear. And they\'ve shown no signs of distancing\nthemselves from super PAC money. Cruz launched his campaign in March, and\nthe senator\'s allies declared that an affiliated network of pro-Cruz super\nPACs had raised upwards of $30 million in just a matter of days.\n\n\n\nThe stiff competition against Republican money is a reality that some\nprogressive leaders say they cannot ignore.\n\n\n\nFormer Vermont governor and Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard\nDean said it would be unwise for Clinton to reject super PAC money.\n\n\n\n"Unfortunately, if you don\'t play by the same rules everybody else does,\nyou end up losing elections," said Dean, founder of Democracy for America,\none of the groups behind the draft Warren movement. "The key is to change\nthe rules, and I think we have a much better chance of doing that with her\nas president than we do with one of the Republicans."\n\n\n\nBack in Iowa, Hillary Goes Big on Small Business\n<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/05/18/back_in_iowa_hillary_goes_big_on_small_business.html>\n// Real Clear Politics // Alexis Simendinger - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nThe last time Hillary Clinton was publicly photographed riding a bicycle\nmay have been when she was secretary of state, accompanying her husband\nalong a beach.\n\n\n\nThe bike motif, without the sand, will serve as a campaign backdrop this\nweek in Iowa, when Clinton focuses on small business owners and their\nemployees, who say in national surveys they need customers, access to\ncapital, and less government red tape.\n\n\n\nClinton, who kicked off her campaign a month ago and then spent three days\nin Iowa, is returning to hail her team\xe2\x80\x99s grassroots organization in the\nearly caucus state, and to describe her vision for a U.S. economy that\nrelies on small entrepreneurs to create jobs.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, she\xe2\x80\x99ll meet grassroots organizers at the home of a supporter in\nMason City, Iowa, and on Tuesday she\xe2\x80\x99ll participate in a roundtable\ndiscussion with community lenders and business representatives in Cedar\nFalls. That discussion is to take place at Bike Tech, a bicycle and sports\nshop that outgrew its location on Main Street this year and moved to larger\nquarters in a vintage former post office a few streets away.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to be the president for small business,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton declared May 5\nwhile speaking during a similar roundtable at a library in Nevada.\n\n\n\nAfter launching her second bid for the White House in April and committing\nto victory in Iowa next year, Clinton vowed to return to the state as often\nas possible. Caucus-goers proved challenging for her in 2008, and for her\nhusband in 1992.\n\n\n\nIowans insist on taking the measure of presidential aspirants up-close, and\nClinton is determined to deliver the personal attention that requires shoe\nleather, hand-shaking, careful listening, and selfies posed with strangers.\n\n\n\nYounger voters -- who embraced Barack Obama in 2008 -- are among Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\ntargets in 2016. The popular bike shop in Cedar Falls where the candidate\nwill appear Tuesday is a setting meant to enlarge her narrative in a number\nof ways.\n\n\n\nShe wants the attention of young voters, progressive voters, small shops\nand family-run enterprises (which are America\xe2\x80\x99s economic engine, and by the\nway, are led by many swing voters). She wants her message to come across as\n\xe2\x80\x9cMain Street v. Wall Street\xe2\x80\x9d (to blunt critics who say she\xe2\x80\x99s too cozy with\nbig financial institutions and New York\xe2\x80\x99s business elites). And Clinton\nwants support from female voters (a quarter of Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s businesses are\nwomen-owned).\n\n\n\nIn 2008, Clinton lost Iowa in part because voters there said they had\ntrouble warming up to her.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what people have been saying,`Well, you know, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to know\nmore about her, we want to know more about her personally,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she said\nbefore Obama\xe2\x80\x99s victory. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I totally get that. It\xe2\x80\x99s a little hard for me.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not easy for me to talk about myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThis time around, Clinton is campaigning as close as she can get to\n\xe2\x80\x9coutside-the-bubble\xe2\x80\x9d just-folksiness, reminding her audiences that before\nshe was an attorney, first lady of Arkansas, wife of a president, senator\nfrom New York, and secretary of state, she grew up with Midwestern values\nas the daughter of a small businessman who ran a drapery business. She may\nbe a wealthy international icon at age 67, but Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s message is that\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s never relinquished her middle-class, middle-America sensibilities.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama visited Cedar Falls in January, turning to the community as\na favored setting for a pre-State of the Union message, describing the\neconomic imperatives of universal broadband connectivity (Cedar Falls is an\n\xe2\x80\x9ceCity\xe2\x80\x9d leader, according to Google).\n\n\n\nDuring the first week of May to mark Small Business Week, the president\ndescribed his national agenda for small entrepreneurs, hitting everything\nfrom regulations to lending. Clinton is expected to echo those themes as\nshe begins to describe how she would enlarge \xe2\x80\x9cthe economy of the future,\xe2\x80\x9d\nas she\xe2\x80\x99s pledged to do if elected president.\n\n\n\nObama a few weeks ago said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have signed into law 18 different tax cuts\nfor small businesses, which are helping them thrive in the 21st-century\neconomy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy investing in our infrastructure, expanding access to credit, and\nassisting entrepreneurs as they start out and scale up, we are continuing\nto bolster America\'s small business community,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\n\nThe president talks about expanding export markets for U.S. small\nbusinesses, a topic that in Iowa could encourage Clinton to touch on\ninternational trade.\n\n\n\nAs Congress debates legislation to grant the president fast-track authority\nto conclude a trade pact with 11 other nations, Clinton has been\nconspicuously mute. Trade Promotion Authority, which would permit the\nlegislative branch to approve or disapprove a trade deal but not to amend\nit, divides Democratic lawmakers and is vigorously opposed by organized\nlabor. But she promoted the merits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership as\nsecretary of state.\n\n\n\nAs the U.S. economy has continued to recover, small business owners say\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re more optimistic about the future. But that outlook dimmed a tad in\nthe first quarter compared with late 2014, even as it remained at the\nhighest level measured since January 2008, according to a quarterly survey\nreported by the Gallup Organization. Small entrepreneurs are focused on\ntheir prospects for revenues, and on the challenges of accessing capital\nand credit.\n\n\n\nRecently, Clinton said the expansion experienced by many small businesses\nhad \xe2\x80\x9cstalled out,\xe2\x80\x9d an assertion Obama disputed as a blip tied to slower\ngrowth in Europe rather than a U.S. trend.\n\n\n\nIn the Hawkeye State this week, advised by many of the same economic\nexperts who served Presidents Clinton and Obama, Hillary is expected to\nhave her say.\n\n\n\nClinton talks economy, campaign finance on return to Iowa\n<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/05/18/hillary-clinton-second-trip-iowa/27551369/>\n// Des Moines Register // Tony Leys - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nMason City, Ia. \xe2\x80\x93 Hillary Clinton vowed Monday to fight for more fairness\nfor American workers as the economy continues to recover.\n\n\n\n"We need to get back into the habit of actually rewarding workers with\nincreases in their paychecks for the increases in productivity and\nprofitability that they have helped" achieve, Clinton said to applause from\nabout 60 Democratic activists gathered at a house in Mason City.\n\n\n\nThe former senator, first lady and secretary of state, who is the heavy\nfavorite for the Democratic nomination for president, was beginning her\nsecond trip to Iowa since announcing her candidacy last month.\n\n\n\nShe has been focusing on small events, such as the one held here Monday.\n"Not only do I learn a lot, but I also feel like it\'s the best way to make\nthose connections," she told the activists. "\xe2\x80\xa6 It will also give me the\nkind of information I need to be a better president."\n\n\n\nAmong the things she said she\'s heard about on her travels is the\ndrug-abuse crisis, including methamphetamine in Iowa and heroin in New\nHampshire. She noted reports that more Americans are now dying from drug\noverdoses than from car crashes. "This is tearing families apart, but it\'s\nbelow the surface. People aren\'t talking about it," she said.\n\n\n\nClinton said she\'s committed to reforming the political process, including\nby appointing Supreme Court justices who would rule against the kind of\nuntraceable money that has flowed into the system since the Citizens United\ndecision gave corporations more freedom to make donations. She said that if\nit takes a Constitutional amendment to change the situation, "I will work\nfor that."\n\n\n\nBut Clinton, who is being supported by a so-called superPAC, said "we also\nhave to stand our ground, and we have to try to figure out how to get\npeople to work with us for the betterment of our country, the betterment of\npeople who need a good, positive support system."\n\n\n\nOrganizers said the crowd was made up of Democrats invited by the campaign,\nthe local party or the homeowners, Dean Genth and his husband, Gary Swenson.\n\n\n\nGenth, who is vice chairman the Cerro Gordo County Democratic Party, said\nin an interview that he supported Barack Obama over Clinton in the 2008\ncaucuses. Genth said he also liked Clinton then, but he went with the\nchallenger from Illinois.\n\n\n\nGenth, 65, said he believes Clinton has grown since then, including from\nher service as Obama\'s secretary of state. "There is not a living,\nbreathing human being on the face of the Earth with her resum\xc3\xa9 and\nexperience and background."\n\n\n\nClinton has come under fire from Republicans for taking few questions from\nreporters during the early weeks of her candidacy. She took no questions\nfrom reporters at Monday\'s event, and the press was ushered out of the\nhouse as she began to greet voters after giving her 25-minute remarks.\n\n\n\nState Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kauffman renewed the criticism Monday\nwith a statement emailed to reporters covering Clinton. "Hillary Clinton\nstill refuses to answer simple questions about her unseemly financial\ndealings, secret email server, or disastrous foreign policy. Polls show\nIowans already find Clinton untrustworthy and her actions have confirmed\ntheir suspicions."\n\n\n\nClinton spokeswoman Lily Adams issued a statement in response to the\ncriticism: "The focus of our ramp up period is to hear from voters about\nthe issues they care about. She\'s enjoyed engaging in hours of public\nquestion and answer sessions and, as the campaign progresses, looks forward\nto more engagement with voters and the press as well."\n\n\n\nClinton is scheduled to make a stop Tuesday morning at a bike shop in Cedar\nFalls.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton Campaign Begins Drafting Policy Solutions To Heroin Epidemic\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/18/hillary-clinton-heroin_n_7309930.html>\n// Huffington Post // Marina Fang \xe2\x80\x93 May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON -- After hearing story after story from voters on the campaign\ntrail about heroin\'s toll, Hillary Clinton instructed her policy team to\ndraw up solutions to the burgeoning opiate epidemic.\n\n\n\nA Clinton aide told The Huffington Post that the Democratic presidential\ncandidate decided to make mental health and drug addiction a major campaign\nissue after stops in Iowa and New Hampshire, where she kept hearing from\npeople that the problem needs more attention. It\'s the type of issue that\nmay not get much attention inside the Beltway and on Sunday talk shows, but\nopiate addiction has become a devastating problem.\n\n\n\nClinton brought it up on Monday during a stop in Iowa, telling supporters\nthat she wants to "end the stigma against talking about it."\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I started running, when I started thinking about this campaign, I did\nnot believe I would be standing in your living room talking about the drug\nabuse problem, the mental health problem, and the suicide problem," she\nsaid at the home of one of the first gay couples in the state to wed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\nI\xe2\x80\x99m now convinced I have to talk about it. I have to do everything I can in\nthis campaign to raise it, to end the stigma against talking about it."\n\n\n\nA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study of 28 states found that\nheroin deaths doubled from 2010 to 2012. U.S. heroin-related overdose\ndeaths increased 39 percent in 2013 from the year before, hitting 8,257.\nVermont\xe2\x80\x99s governor devoted his entire 2014 state of the state speech to\nheroin. In New York City, there are more heroin deaths than homicides.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is tearing families apart, but it is below the surface," Clinton\nsaid. "We aren\xe2\x80\x99t talking about it because it is something that is hard to\ndeal with."\n\n\n\nThe heroin or opioid epidemic has exposed the U.S. drug treatment system as\ninadequate, both in its capacity to treat those addicted and to do so using\nevidence-based care. Although medically assisted treatments, such as\nmedications methadone and buprenorphine, are viewed by the medical\ncommunity as essential components of an opioid addict\xe2\x80\x99s recovery, they are\ninaccessible to the vast majority in need.\n\n\n\nSome treatment centers and drug courts continue to insist that addicts\nrefuse these medically assisted treatments. Following a HuffPost\ninvestigation into "abstinence-based" opiate treatment, the federal\ngovernment barred state drug programs from getting federal money if they\nforce addicts to wean off of medications.\n\n\n\nClinton has been holding a series of events to discuss substance abuse and\nmental health. She laid the groundwork for these events at a roundtable in\nNew Hampshire last month, one of her first campaign events as an announced\npresidential candidate.\n\n\n\nWhen a voter mentioned that substance abuse was a major problem in the\ncommunity, Clinton called it a "quiet epidemic" and said it\'s "not just\nsomething we can brush under the rug." She commended the Affordable Care\nAct for placing more emphasis on requiring health insurers to cover\ntreatments for mental health and substance abuse, but said there needs to\nbe more policy reform, from local to national.\n\n\n\n"There is a hidden epidemic. We know the drug use problem, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s\npills or meth or heroin, is not as visible as 30 years ago when there were\nall kinds of gangs and violence," Clinton said. "This is a quiet epidemic\nand it is striking in small towns and rural areas as much as any big city.\nI think a lot of people are thinking, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s problem,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s not my problem. And indeed, it is all of our problem and we don\xe2\x80\x99t\nhave enough resources, so that if somebody decides that they wanted to get\nhelp, where do you send them to? What kind of opportunities do they have\nfor treatment? And I am convinced that the mental health issues -- because\nI consider substance abuse part of mental health issues -- is going to be a\nbig part of my campaign, because increasingly it\xe2\x80\x99s a big issue that people\nraise with me."\n\n\n\nClinton also mentioned substance abuse and mental health in a major speech\non criminal justice reform that she made last month in the wake of the\nriots in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray at the hands of police.\nShe emphasized the links between problems in the criminal justice system\nand problems in treating mental health and drug abuse.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe promise of deinstitutionalizing those in mental health facilities was\nsupposed to be followed by the creation of community-based treatment\ncenters,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOur prisons and our jails are now our mental health\ninstitutions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton Returns to Iowa to Help Rally Caucus Volunteers\n<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/clinton-returns-iowa-rally-caucus-volunteers-31123588>\n// ABC News // Julie Pace - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton returns to Iowa on Monday to help ramp up her\ncampaign\'s volunteer network in a state where she struggled to build an\neffective ground game during her first run White House run in 2008.\n\n\n\nClinton will meet with volunteers and campaign organizers in the northern\nIowa town of Mason City. The event is being hosted by Dean Genth and Gary\nSwenson, who were active supporters of President Barack Obama when he\ndefeated Clinton in the 2008 Iowa caucuses.\n\n\n\nWhile Clinton\'s path to victory in Iowa so far seems easier this time\naround, her campaign is eager to show she\'s not taking the state for\ngranted. The campaign has hired 21 caucus organizers and six regional field\ndirectors who are seeking commitments from voters to caucus for Clinton\nearly next year.\n\n\n\nThe early organizing could also yield longer-term benefits for Clinton\'s\ncampaign, should she win her party\'s nomination. Iowa will be among the\ncompetitive battleground states in the general election and her campaign\ncan draw on the voter contacts it makes now next year.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s two-day swing through Iowa marks her second trip to the state\nsince she formally launched her campaign last month. On Tuesday, she\'ll\nhead to Cedar Falls, where she\'ll begin outlining proposals for boosting\nsmall businesses.\n\n\n\nClinton arrives in Iowa under pressure from Republicans who want her to\nclarify her position on a massive Asia-Pacific trade deal being debated on\nCapitol Hill. While Clinton was supportive of the Trans-Pacific Partnership\npact while serving as Obama\'s secretary of state, she has been largely\nsilent on the matter since announcing her campaign.\n\n\n\nObama\'s push for the trade deal has angered some liberal Democrats who fear\nthe agreement with Japan and several other nations would hurt U.S.\ncompanies and workers.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\'s second wave of Iowa courtship arrives in Mason City\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/18/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-elections-iowa-trip/>\n// CNN // Dan Merica - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nMason City, Iowa (CNN)More than 70% of Iowa\'s Democratic caucus-goers chose\nan alternative to Hillary Clinton in 2008, a fact her aides in the state\nare actively looking to address early in her 2016 run.\n\n\n\nClinton will make her second visit to the state Monday when she headlines a\nsmall "house party" in Mason City that campaign aides hope will showcase\ntheir focus on moving Democrats who supported other candidates --\nparticularly then-Sens. Barack Obama and John Edwards - to Clinton\'s 2016\ncampaign.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s Iowa operation has a total of 27 field organizers on the ground\nin Iowa, six regional organizing directors and 21 organizers who live in\ncities and towns across the state. So far, according to campaign aides,\ntheir focus has been on reconnecting with Clinton supporters from 2008,\nwinning over those who rejected her first presidential bid and connecting\nwith those young people and students who are new to the state.\n\n\n\nMonday\'s event in Mason City, which will be hosted by Dean Genth and Gary\nSwenson, is an example of Clinton\'s campaign looking to target former Obama\nsupporters.\n\n\n\nGenth and Swenson were the first gay couple to receive a marriage license\nat the Cerro Gordo County Courthouse when same-sex marriage was legalized\nin the state in April 2009. During the 2008 caucus, both were outspoken and\nearly Obama supporters. They housed Obama campaign staff and volunteers in\ntheir Mason City home and told Obama\'s campaign office in Chicago that they\nwould be willing to do whatever they could to get the senator elected.\n\n\n\n"We were supportive of Clinton but we actually caucused for Obama," Genth\nsaid Monday. "As the caucus campaigning went on we got really involved with\nthe Obama campaign. It was more a function that we were so early on with\nObama, we had already pitched out tent at that point."\n\n\n\nA former business executive, Genth moved from Ohio to Iowa in 2003 after\nmeeting Swenson, a radiologist and breast cancer specialist, in 2002. Genth\nsaid it was love at first sight. The two have long been activists for\nsame-sex marriage and Genth is a member of One Iowa, the state\'s leading\nLGBT rights organization, that spearheaded efforts to legalize same-sex\nmarriage in the state.\n\n\n\nGenth said that while Obama\'s position on same-sex marriage was "not a\ndetermining factor" for their support in 2008, it did play a role.\n\n\n\n"We definitely got signals from Obama where he stood on some of the basic\nprinciples and basic rights," he said.\n\n\n\nAs a candidate in 2008, Clinton opposed same-sex marriage, supporting the\nidea of civil unions instead. She did not proclaim her personal support for\nsame-sex marriage until 2013, after she left her diplomatic position as\nsecretary of state.\n\n\n\nShortly after her announcing her presidential bid, her campaign said that\nClinton now believes same-sex marriage is a "constitutional right," a\ndeparture from her past statements.\n\n\n\nThe steady change in her position hasn\'t bothered Genth. "Some people seem\nto never evolve," he said. "So somebody that does evolve is a great thing."\n\n\n\nGenth is the vice chairman of the Cerro Gordo County Democratic Party and\nhas said he has "reached out to every Clinton campaign person that walks\ninto the area or has a phone number" about getting the candidate to North\nIowa as much as possible.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s campaign aides have regularly said the candidate will focus on\nIowa and come back regularly, but no future trips have been announced.\nClinton will overnight in Iowa on Monday and headline an event on small\nbusiness at a bike shop in Cedar Falls, Iowa on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe state of play in Iowa is also vastly different than it was in 2007 and\n2008. Clinton leads every poll on the Democratic side and many activists in\nthe state, despite hungering for a competitive primary, acknowledge that\nthere isn\'t a Barack Obama-like candidate that could come from behind to\ntopple Clinton. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent, is the only\nother declared candidate for the Democratic nomination, although former\nMaryland Gov. Martin O\'Malley is expected to announce his run later this\nmonth.\n\n\n\nIn an effort to showcase their grassroots organizing efforts, Sarah Marino,\nthe campaign\'s Mason City grassroots organizer, will introduce Clinton at\nthe event on Monday.\n\n\n\n10 questions for Hillary Clinton\n<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/10-questions-for-hillary-clinton/> // CBS News\n// Rebecca Kaplan \xe2\x80\x93 May 19, 2015\n\n\n\nIn the 36 days since Hillary Clinton announced she was running for\npresident, she has answered just 13 questions from reporters. The last time\nshe took a question was a month ago, Apr. 21, 2015, about the book,\n"Clinton Cash," which took a critical look at her family\'s finances.\n\n\n\n(Clinton\'s response was, "Those issues are in my view distractions from\nwhat this campaign should be about, what I\'m going to make this campaign\nabout.")\n\n\n\nIn the intervening month, there have been news developments that have\nelicited reactions from other presidential candidates and potential\ncandidates. Clinton, however, has said little.\n\n\n\nAs she returns to the campaign trail in Iowa and New Hampshire this week,\nhere are 10 questions CBS News might ask:\n\n\n\n1. Do you support the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP)?\n\n\n\nThe Democratic Party is divided on trade. Mr. Obama, Republicans and some\nDemocrats want legislation that would put the Asia-Pacific free trade\nagreement on an expedited path through Congress. Other Democrats think the\nagreement would hurt American workers and the environment. Which Democrats\nwould Clinton side with now?\n\n\n\nShe argued for TPP as secretary of state and in her 2014 memoir, "Hard\nChoices" but has been noncommittal since. She has said on this issue only\nthat "any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase\nprosperity and protect our security, and we have to do our part in making\nsure we have the capabilities and the skills to be competitive."\n\n\n\nAnd as CBS News Correspondent Julianna Goldman reported Monday, Clinton\nearned more than $2.5 million giving speeches to organizations that have\nlobbied in favor of the trade deal.\n\n\n\n2. Should Congress have a say in whether the U.S. signs a nuclear agreement\nwith Iran?\n\n\n\nBoth the House and Senate have now passed bills that would allow Congress\nto review the framework deal that rolls back Iran\'s nuclear program in\nexchange for sanctions relief. The legislation would allow lawmakers to\nblock the president from exiting at least some sanctions if enough members\ndon\'t like the deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House caves on Iran nuclear bill after veto threat\n\nThe White House had resisted congressional efforts to weigh in, arguing\nthis negotiation is the purview of the president, but given the substantial\nDemocratic support, the president is expected to sign the deal.\n\n\n\n3. Does the president need a new Authorization for the Use of Military\nForce (AUMF) to fight the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)?\n\n\n\nIn mid February, the White House sent Congress legislation that would\nformally authorize war against ISIS - six months after the air campaign\nagainst the Islamic group actually began. The administration believes that\nthe 2001 authorization that gave the president the authority to deploy U.S.\ntroops to fight the instigators of the 9/11 attacks also enables him to\nfight ISIS, so a new AUMF hasn\'t topped his agenda. Still, the fight\nagainst ISIS will almost certainly bleed into 2016 and the campaign.\n\n\n\n4. Why are Republican candidates struggling to give a straight answer on\nwhether they would have authorized the 2003 Iraq invasion?\n\n\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush Bush was the first to stumble, saying he would\nhave authorized the war in Iraq. He then claimed he misinterpreted the\nquestion posed by Fox News\' Megyn Kelly, who initially asked whether he\nwould have authorized the invasion, "knowing what we know now." Eventually,\nhe said, "Knowing what we now know, I would not have engaged."\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the Iraq War question could shape 2016 campaign\n\nAnd Florida Sen. Marco Rubio struggled to articulate his position after\n"Fox News Sunday" host Chris Wallace played two video clips in which he\nappeared to take different stances on the 2003 invasion.\n\n\n\nThis is an area where Clinton has been unequivocal. "I thought I had acted\nin good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I\nhad. And I wasn\'t alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong.\nPlain and simple," she wrote in "Hard Choices."\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do independent voters think about foreign donations to the Clinton\nFoundation?\n\n\xe2\x80\x8e5. What can you say to ensure voters that contributions to the Clinton\nFoundation will not affect your decisions as president?\n\n\n\nClinton has been asked about foreign government donations to the Clinton\nFoundation, related to her tenure as secretary of state, and especially on\nwhether foreign entities received special treatment in exchange for\ncontributions to the foundation. She said, "We\'re back into the political\nseason and therefore we will be subjected to all kinds of distraction and\nattacks. And I\'m ready for that. I know that that comes, unfortunately,\nwith the territory."\n\n\n\nAfter she last interacted with the press, the Clinton Foundation admitted\nit had erred in its public disclosure of donors.\n\n\n\n6. What steps would you take to help same-sex couples get married if the\nSupreme Court does rule it is a constitutional right?\n\n\n\nSince former President Bill Clinton, signed the Defense of Marriage Act in\n1996, Clinton has held just about every view on the spectrum of same-sex\nmarriage. In 2000, she said she believed marriage was for a man and a\nwoman. For awhile, she said it fell under the authority of states. In 2015,\nthe video she released to announce her presidential bidfeatured a gay\ncouple. Now, her campaign staff says she supports same-sex marriage and\nwants the Supreme Court to rule that it is a constitutional right.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court divided in historic gay marriage case\n\nBut what if they don\'t? After hearing arguments on the issue in late April,\nthe justices appeared sharply divided over whether gay and lesbian couples\nshould be allowed to marry. If the court rules in June that states have a\nright to declare only men and women can enter into marriage, will Clinton\ntake action?\n\n\n\n7. How would you go "even further" than President Obama on immigration and\nstay within the limits of the law?\n\n\n\nClinton gave an immigration speech in Nevada earlier this month, and\npledged to go "even further" than President Obama did by allowing a larger\npool of people, such as the parents of children brought to the U.S.\nillegally, to apply for a reprieve from deportation.\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton takes on Nevada as controversial book debuts\n\nPresident Obama spent months publicly saying he didn\'t have the authority\nto expand relief for undocumented immigrants before he used his executive\nauthority to protect millions from deportation. And he had his legal team\nspend months making sure the case for that action was airtight and would\nhold up against a potential court battle.\n\n\n\nCongress, meanwhile, is far from acting on immigration and is even looking\nfor ways to roll back programs the president has put into place.\n\n\n\n8. You left the White House "dead broke," in your words. You now command\nupwards of $200,000 a speech. How much money do you think you and your\nhusband need to be comfortable?\n\n\n\nClinton later apologized for the "dead broke" comment, saying she could\nhave been more "artful."\n\n\n\nShe and husband Bill Clinton earned just over $25 million from a total of\nabout 100 paid speeches since January 2014 and $5 million from the proceeds\nof "Hard Choices."\n\n\n\n9. Is it hypocritical for you to accept super PAC support -- and to push\nthe boundaries of the law by coordinating with a super PAC -- while calling\nfor new rules to limit third-party campaign spending?\n\n\n\nLike President Obama before her, Clinton is accepting campaign support from\nsuper PACs -- independent groups that can accept unlimited campaign\ndonations from individuals or corporations -- while at the same time\ncondemning their influence on the political process.\n\n\n\n"We need to fix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable\nmoney out of it once and for all, even if that takes a constitutional\namendment," Clinton said last month in Iowa, calling campaign finance\nreform one of the four key pillars of her campaign.\n\n\n\nEven so, her campaign insists that as long as others in the race for the\nWhite House are exploiting super PACs, her campaign will as well. The\nClinton campaign, however, is actually empowering super PACs even more by\ncoordinating with one specific group. Super PACs are barred from\ncoordinating with candidates, but this group says it has found a loophole\nallowing it to work with the Clinton team.\n\n\n\n10. Are you willing to tell Saudi Arabia that they must encourage equal\nrights for women?\n\n\n\nWomen\'s rights was one of Clinton\'s chief causes as secretary of state -\nand it\'s likely to become a point of contention during the 2016 campaign as\nwell given the lingering questions about the Clinton Foundation\'s\nacceptance of donations from foreign governments. On the day she announced\nher presidential bid, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky - himself a contender for\nthe White House - honed in on Clinton\'s relationship with the Saudis.\n\n\n\n\n\nRand Paul: Hard for Hillary Clinton to say she\'s for women\'s rights\n\n"In Saudi Arabia, a woman was raped by seven men. The woman was then\npublically whipped. And then she was arrested for being in a car with an\nunmarried man. I think we should be boycotting that activity, not\nencouraging it. And it looks really bad for the case of defending women\'s\nrights, if you\'re accepting money," Paul said in an interview on CBS\' "Face\nthe Nation" in April.\n\n\n\nAfter Clinton announced, the foundation announced a new donor policy. Now,\nthe foundation will accept large donations from six foreign governments -\nAustralia, Canada, Germany, The Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton Backs Obama Plan To Reverse Police Militarization\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/18/hillary-clinton-police-militarization_n_7309296.html?1431988769>\n// Huffington Post // Ryan Grim and Ryan J. Reilly - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama\'s executive order banning the federal\ngovernment from transferring certain types of military-style equipment to\npolice forces would remain in place if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency\nin 2016.\n\n\n\nClinton is "supportive of the recommendations and of the need for reform,"\na spokesperson for the Democratic candidate said Monday after Obama\nannounced in Camden, New Jersey, that the transfer of certain military gear\nto police would be sharply curtailed.\n\n\n\nClinton last month slammed police militarization in a major speech on\ncriminal justice issues. "We can start by making sure that federal funds\nfor state and local law enforcement are used to bolster best practices,\nrather than to buy weapons of war that have no place on our streets," she\nsaid in the speech, which followed the death of Baltimore\'s Freddie Gray at\nthe hands of police. "President Obama\'s task force on policing gives us a\ngood place to start. Its recommendations offer a roadmap for reform, from\ntraining to technology, guided by more and better data."\n\n\n\nObama\'s announcement flowed from the task force recommendations that\nClinton cited. Under the president\'s plan, bayonets, camouflaged uniforms,\ngrenade launchers, certain types of armored vehicles, firearms of\n.50-caliber or larger and weaponized vehicles would no longer be\ntransferred to law enforcement agencies. Other military equipment would be\non a controlled list that would require law enforcement organizations to\ndemonstrate need.\n\n\n\nClinton, in her speech, called for every police department to have body\ncameras for officers, and highlighted the need for community policing. "We\nshould listen to law enforcement leaders who are calling for a renewed\nfocus on working with communities to prevent crime, rather than measuring\nsuccess just by the number of arrests or convictions," she said. "As your\nsenator from New York, I supported a greater emphasis on community\npolicing, along with putting more officers on the street to get to know\nthose communities."\n\n\n\nObama on Monday said militarized gear \xe2\x80\x9ccan sometimes give people the\nfeeling like there\'s an occupying force as opposed to a force that\'s part\nof the community."\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services is\npreparing after-action report looking at mistakes by the St. Louis County\nPolice Department in handling protests in Ferguson, Missouri, related to\nthe police killing of teenager Michael Brown in August. Photos of the\npolice department\'s heavily armed officers and military-style gear made\nworld news.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton: "Grateful" For Obama\'s Work on Economy, But "Deck Is Still\nStacked In Favor Of Those At The Top"\n<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/05/18/hillary_clinton_grateful_for_obamas_work_on_economy_but_deck_is_still_stacked_in_favor_of_those_at_the_top.html>\n// Real Clear Politics // Ian Schwartz - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke to a\nsmall group of Iowans at a "house party" event in Mason City. In this part\nof her speech Clinton talked about domestic issues such as the economy and\nthe Affordable Care Act (ACA). The video is from a livestream captured by\nBloomberg\'s Jennifer Epstein on Periscope.\n\n\n\nClinton praised Obama for the "hard work" he\'s done on the economy, but\nlamented the "deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top."\n\n\n\n"We\'re not running yet but we are on our feet," Clinton said about the\neconomy.\n\n\n\n"The deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top, we know that, and\nso we have to be especially focused on how we\'re going to bring about the\nchanges that will ignite opportunity for everybody willing to work hard for\nit," Clinton also said.\n\n\n\nHILLARY CLINTON: I\'m so relieved that as I travel around the country and\ntalk with people, there is a sense that we are on our feet. We\'re not\nrunning yet but we are on our feet. We can see the changes that are\nhappening in people\'s life and can put them in a context as to where we go\nfrom here now as a country. I am very grateful to President Obama for the\nhard work [he\'s done on the economy]...\n\n\n\nI know that although we have begun to move forward again, it is still hard\nto imagine exactly how we\'re going to get to the point where people are not\njust getting by but getting ahead again and staying ahead. Because, look,\nthe deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top, we know that, and\nso we have to be especially focused on how we\'re going to bring about the\nchanges that will ignite opportunity for everybody willing to work hard for\nit.\n\n\n\nUS Reps. Jim McGovern, Joe Kennedy campaign for Hillary Clinton\n<http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/05/us_reps_jim_mcgovern_joe_kenne.html>\n// Mass Live // Shira Schoeberg - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nU.S. Reps. Joe Kennedy and Jim McGovern, both Massachusetts Democrats,\nspent parts of their weekends campaigning for Democratic presidential\ncandidate Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nMcGovern attended a Worcester event on Saturday and Kennedy attended an\nevent Sunday in Newton. Both events were grassroots organizing meetings.\nEarly organizing meetings are a way for a campaign to energize the\nso-called "grasstops," committed activists who are likely to volunteer for\ncampaigns, recruit other volunteers and donate money.\n\n\n\nThe public support for Clinton by liberal congressmen in Massachusetts\ncomes as liberal organizations nationally have organized a movement to\ndraft U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, to run for\npresident.\n\n\n\nWarren has gained clout as a charismatic liberal leader in the Senate\nfocused on economic policy, but she has said repeatedly that she will not\nrun for president. The Clinton campaign is likely hoping that having\nKennedy and McGovern throw their support behind Clinton now could galvanize\nother Massachusetts liberals to do the same and not to hold out hope for a\nWarren candidacy.\n\n\n\nIn addition to Clinton, who is a former secretary of state, U.S. Senator\nand first lady, Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders is running for the\nDemocratic nomination for president and former Maryland governor Martin\nO\'Malley is seriously considering it.\n\n\n\nMore than a dozen Republicans are running or seriously considering it.\n\n\n\nClinton Sets Citizens United as Supreme Court Litmus Test\n<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/clinton-returns-iowa-rally-caucus-volunteers-31123588>\n// ABC News // Julie Pace, Associated Press - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton said Monday that if elected president, she would\nmake opposition to a Supreme Court ruling that cleared the way for\nunlimited political donations a litmus test for nominees to the high court.\n\n\n\n"I will do everything I can do to appoint Supreme Court justices who will\nprotect the right to vote and not the right of billionaires to buy\nelections," Clinton told about 50 supporters at a house party in Iowa.\n\n\n\nWhile Clinton has previously said she would support a constitutional\namendment overturning the 2010 decision known as Citizens United, she has\nnot previously said publicly that she would use the ruling as a benchmark\nfor nominating justices.\n\n\n\nShe added Monday she is consulting with legal experts about other ways the\ncourt\'s ruling in the case could be trumped.\n\n\n\nDespite her staunch opposition to Citizens United, which helped usher into\npolitics groups known as super PACs that can raise unlimited amounts of\ncampaign cash, Clinton is directly courting donors for a super PAC backing\nher candidacy.\n\n\n\nDemocrats were initially reluctant in the elections after the court ruled\nin Citizens United to fully embrace such outside groups, while Republicans\ndid so with fewer reservations and are aggressively raising money for them\nin the early days of the 2016 campaign.\n\n\n\nClinton\'s stop in the northern Iowa town of Mason City marked her second\ntrip to the state since she formally launched her campaign last month. She\nspent more than an hour talking with local officials, campaign organizers\nand volunteers \xe2\x80\x94 the type of small-scale campaigning some Iowa Democrats\nsay she didn\'t do enough of during her first bid for the Democratic\nnomination in 2008.\n\n\n\nClinton placed third in the Iowa caucus that year, behind President Barack\nObama and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards.\n\n\n\nThe hosts of Monday\'s event, Dean Genth and Gary Swenson, campaigned\nactively for Obama in 2008. Genth said he didn\'t choose Obama over Clinton\nfor any ideological reasons, but more because he "captured everyone\'s\nimaginations with his charismatic campaign and his ability to connect to\nthe grassroots."\n\n\n\nWhile Clinton so far doesn\'t face as tough of a primary challenge as she\ndid in 2008, her campaign is eager to show she\'s learned lessons from her\npast missteps. The campaign has hired 21 caucus organizers and six regional\nfield directors who are seeking commitments from voters to caucus for\nClinton early next year.\n\n\n\nThe early organizing could also yield longer-term benefits for Clinton\'s\ncampaign, should she win her party\'s nomination. Iowa will be among the\ncompetitive battleground states in the general election and her campaign\ncan draw on the voter contacts it makes now next year.\n\n\n\nClinton arrived in Iowa under pressure from Republicans who want her to\nclarify her position on a massive Asia-Pacific trade deal being debated on\nCapitol Hill. While Clinton was supportive of the Trans-Pacific Partnership\npact while serving as Obama\'s secretary of state, she has been largely\nsilent on the matter since announcing her campaign.\n\n\n\nObama\'s push for the trade deal has angered some liberal Democrats who fear\nthe agreement with Japan and several other nations would hurt U.S.\ncompanies and workers.\n\n\n\nAs she opened her remarks Monday, Clinton subtly defended her decision to\navoid wading into the trade debate or taking questions from reporters on a\nrange of other issues.\n\n\n\nThough she never mentioned the Republican criticism directly, she said\nsmall events that put her in direct contact with voters are providing her\nwith the foundation for her campaign, as well as "the kind of information I\nneed to be an even better president."\n\n\n\nGowdy: Benghazi report may leave questions unresolved\n<http://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/politics/2015/05/18/benghazi-report-congress-trey-gowdy/27490061/>\n// Greenville Online // Mary Troyan - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 The final congressional report on the 2012 Benghazi terrorist\nattacks may present conflicting information on issues without concluding\nwhich version is true, according to Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of\nthe special House committee investigating the attacks.\n\n\n\nDemocrats on Gowdy\xe2\x80\x99s committee, who have already declared the investigation\na waste of taxpayer money, were further irritated by the possibility that\nthe much-touted House investigation will leave some facts open to\ninterpretation.\n\n\n\nGowdy, R-S.C., said in a recent interview the investigation is a\nfact-finding mission, but every factual dispute may not be settled.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you do a good enough job laying out the facts, the conclusions will\neither speak for themselves or you\xe2\x80\x99ll have competing factual narratives and\nyou can draw your own conclusions,\xe2\x80\x9d Gowdy said.\n\n\n\nThe House Select Committee on Benghazi was created a year ago to conduct a\ncomprehensive investigation into the events surrounding the Sept. 11, 2012,\nterrorist attack on the U.S. facilities in Libya that killed four\nAmericans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. Seven Republicans and five\nDemocrats serve on the panel.\n\n\n\nAt the time the committee was created, Republican leaders said previous\ncongressional investigations, which were limited to specific jurisdictions\nsuch as the military or intelligence agencies, had left questions\nunanswered, and a special committee with wider latitude was needed address\nnew revelations.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI intend for this select committee to have robust authority, and I will\nexpect it to work quickly to get answers for the American people and the\nfamilies of the victims,\xe2\x80\x9d House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio said last year\nwhen he asked the House to create the panel.\n\n\n\nGowdy said the final report could be finished by the end of the year if the\nObama administration cooperates more quickly in producing documents.\n\n\n\nBut he also warned that issues may be left unresolved, especially if\nwitnesses or documents contradict each other.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not my job to tell people what to conclude,\xe2\x80\x9d Gowdy said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have\ntwo witnesses, (and) one says the light was red and one green, I don\xe2\x80\x99t view\nmyself as being the arbiter of who is more credible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe committee is investigating security lapses related to the attack, the\nmilitary\xe2\x80\x99s response to the incident, and whether the Obama administration,\nfor political reasons, intentionally downplayed the event as something\nother than a coordinated terrorist attack.\n\n\n\nCommittee Democrats have grown increasingly critical of how Republicans are\nproceeding.\n\n\n\nAsked to comment on the possibility the committee won\xe2\x80\x99t draw conclusions\nabout disputed facts, the panel\xe2\x80\x99s top Democrat said the investigation is an\nattempt to discredit Hillary Rodham Clinton, a presidential candidate who\nwas secretary of state at the time of the attacks in Benghazi.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the Committee\xe2\x80\x99s report to be credible... we should draw bipartisan\nconclusions based on the facts, state publicly when conspiracy theories are\ndebunked, and set forth concrete recommendations to implement reforms that\nprotect our diplomatic corps around the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Rep. Elijah Cummings,\nD-Md., said in a statement.\n\n\n\nDuring the committee\xe2\x80\x99s most recent public hearing in January, Rep. Adam\nSchiff, D-Calif., said the report needs bipartisan support to be considered\ncredible.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s make it bipartisan so that the country and the families will have\nthe confidence of knowing that this was an objective work product,\xe2\x80\x9d Schiff\nsaid.\n\n\n\nGowdy said the panel has uncovered new evidence and has talked to witnesses\nnever before interviewed.\n\n\n\nBut most of those interviews have been conducted in private. Publicly,\ncommittee members have focused mostly on improving security at diplomatic\noutposts and on disputes with the State Department and Clinton over access\nto emails, documents and witnesses.\n\n\n\nGowdy said he knows not everyone will be satisfied with the panel\xe2\x80\x99s final\nreport, especially extreme partisans on either side.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you do a good enough job getting every bit of information the\nfact-finder needs, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to draw their own conclusions,\xe2\x80\x9d Gowdy\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are going to draw different conclusions. That\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGOP committee member Martha Roby of Alabama said she\xe2\x80\x99s tried to manage her\nconstituents\xe2\x80\x99 expectations about the results of the investigation.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a fact-finding, truth-finding mission, and whatever that reveals\nis what it reveals,\xe2\x80\x9d Roby said. \xe2\x80\x9cTruth is a stubborn thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton Friend\xe2\x80\x99s Libya Role Blurs Lines of Politics and Business\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/us/politics/clinton-friends-libya-role-blurs-lines-of-politics-and-business.html>\n// NYT // Nicholas Confessor and Michael S. Schmidt \xe2\x80\x93 May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nWhen the Clintons last occupied the White House, Sidney Blumenthal cast\nhimself in varied roles: speechwriter, in-house intellectual and press\ncorps whisperer. Republicans added another, accusing Mr. Blumenthal of\nspreading gossip to discredit Republican investigators and forced him to\ntestify during President Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s impeachment trial.\n\n\n\nNow, as Hillary Rodham Clinton embarks on her second presidential bid, Mr.\nBlumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s service to the Clintons is once again under the spotlight.\nRepresentative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, a Republican who is leading\nthe congressional committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi,\nLibya, plans to subpoena Mr. Blumenthal, 66, for a private transcribed\ninterview.\n\n\n\nMr. Gowdy\xe2\x80\x99s chief interest, according to people briefed on the inquiry, is\na series of memos that Mr. Blumenthal \xe2\x80\x94 who was not an employee of the\nState Department \xe2\x80\x94 wrote to Mrs. Clinton about events unfolding in Libya\nbefore and after the death of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. According to emails\nobtained by The New York Times, Mrs. Clinton, who was secretary of state at\nthe time, took Mr. Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s advice seriously, forwarding his memos to\nsenior diplomatic officials in Libya and Washington and at times asking\nthem to respond. Mrs. Clinton continued to pass around his memos even after\nother senior diplomats concluded that Mr. Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s assessments were\noften unreliable.\n\n\n\nBut an examination by The New York Times suggests that Mr. Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s\ninvolvement was more wide-ranging and more complicated than previously\nknown, embodying the blurry lines between business, politics and\nphilanthropy that have enriched and vexed the Clintons and their inner\ncircle for years.\n\n\n\nWhile advising Mrs. Clinton on Libya, Mr. Blumenthal, who had been barred\nfrom a State Department job by aides to President Obama, was also employed\nby her family\xe2\x80\x99s philanthropy, the Clinton Foundation, to help with\nresearch, \xe2\x80\x9cmessage guidance\xe2\x80\x9d and planning of commemorative events,\naccording to foundation officials. During the same period, he also worked\non and off as a paid consultant to Media Matters and American Bridge,\norganizations that helped lay the groundwork for Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2016\ncampaign.\n\n\n\nMuch of the Libya intelligence that Mr. Blumenthal passed on to Mrs.\nClinton appears to have come from a group of business associates he was\nadvising as they sought to win contracts from the Libyan transitional\ngovernment. The venture, which was ultimately unsuccessful, involved other\nClinton friends, a private military contractor and one former C.I.A. spy\nseeking to get in on the ground floor of the new Libyan economy.\n\n\n\nThe projects \xe2\x80\x94 creating floating hospitals to treat Libya\xe2\x80\x99s war wounded and\ntemporary housing for displaced people, and building schools \xe2\x80\x94 would have\nrequired State Department permits, but floundered before the business\npartners could seek official approval.\n\n\n\nIt is not clear whether Mrs. Clinton or the State Department knew of Mr.\nBlumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s interest in pursuing business in Libya; a State Department\nspokesman declined to say. Many aspects of Mr. Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in\nthe planned Libyan venture remain unclear. He declined repeated requests to\ndiscuss it.\n\n\n\nBut interviews with his associates and a review of previously unreported\ncorrespondence suggest that \xe2\x80\x94 once again \xe2\x80\x94 it may be difficult to determine\nwhere one of Mr. Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s jobs ended and another began.\n\n\n\nMr. Gowdy\xe2\x80\x99s committee on the attacks in Benghazi hopes to ask Mr.\nBlumenthal who, if anyone, was paying him to prepare the memos for Mrs.\nClinton and whether they were among his responsibilities at the Clinton\nFoundation. The committee\xe2\x80\x99s investigators are also interested in whether\nthe planned business venture in Libya posed any potential conflicts for Mr.\nBlumenthal or Mrs. Clinton, whose aides the business partners sought\nmeetings with in early 2012.\n\n\n\nThe Libya venture came together in 2011, when David L. Grange, a retired\nArmy major general, joined with a newly formed New York firm,\nConstellations Group, to pursue business leads in Libya. Constellations\nGroup, led by a professional fund-raiser and philanthropist named Bill\nWhite, was to provide the leads. Mr. Grange\xe2\x80\x99s company, Osprey Global\nSolutions, based in North Carolina, would put \xe2\x80\x9cboots on the ground to see\nif there was an opportunity to do business,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Grange said in an\ninterview.\n\n\n\nThe men had little experience in Libya. Exactly how Mr. White was to\nprocure leads in Libya is unclear. He spent much of his career as an\nexecutive at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum, and had raised money for\npoliticians, businesses and charities. His biography also describes Mr.\nWhite as a consultant for Aquahydrate, a bottled-water company whose\nbackers include Ron Burkle, the billionaire investor who had been a close\nfriend of the Clintons.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were thinking, \xe2\x80\x98O.K., Qaddafi is dead, or about to be, and there\xe2\x80\x99s\nopportunities,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Mr. White said in a brief telephone interview, adding,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe thought, \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s try to see who we know there.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. White declined to answer follow-up questions about what role Mr.\nBlumenthal was playing in the business venture. But Mr. Grange described\nMr. Blumenthal as an adviser to Mr. White\xe2\x80\x99s company, along with two other\nassociates: Tyler Drumheller, a colorful former Central Intelligence Agency\nofficial, and Cody Shearer, a longtime Clinton friend whose sister once\nworked for Mrs. Clinton.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just know that he was working with the team to work on business\ndevelopment,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Grange said of Mr. Blumenthal.\n\n\n\nIn the spring of 2011, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Drumheller and Mr. Shearer were\nhelping plan what was to be Mr. Grange\xe2\x80\x99s first trip to Libya, according to\nemails stolen by a Romanian hacker and published by Gawker and ProPublica\nin March. Mr. Blumenthal said he had been advised not to comment on the\ncorrespondence because the theft remained under investigation by the F.B.I.\n\n\n\nIn August, Mr. Grange signed a memorandum of understanding with two senior\nofficials in the Libyan transitional government to provide \xe2\x80\x9chumanitarian\nassistance, medical services and disaster mitigation,\xe2\x80\x9d along with helping\nto train a new national police force.\n\n\n\nThe agreement fell apart, Mr. Grange said, but the partners continued to\nseek other projects in Libya, including a proposal to create the floating\nhospitals to treat the country\xe2\x80\x99s war wounded. But doing business there\nproved difficult: Some Libyan leaders were wary about working with Western\ncompanies, while the contractors could not figure out whom to make deals\nwith.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was just so factionalized over there,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Grange said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never knew\nwho to believe or trust, or know who was in charge of what.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nEven as their plans sputtered, Mr. Blumenthal continued to draw on the\nbusiness associates for information about Libya as he shaped his memos to\nMrs. Clinton. Sometimes the two realms became blurred.\n\n\n\nIn January 2012, for example, Mr. Blumenthal sent Mrs. Clinton a memo\ndescribing efforts by the new Libyan prime minister to stabilize his\nfragile government by bringing in advisers with experience dealing with\nWestern companies and governments.\n\n\n\nAmong \xe2\x80\x9cthe most influential of this group,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Blumenthal wrote, was a man\nnamed Najib Obeida, who worked at the fledgling Libyan stock exchange. Mrs.\nClinton had the memo forwarded to her senior State Department staff.\n\n\n\nWhat Mr. Blumenthal did not mention was that Mr. Obeida was one of the\nLibyan officials Mr. Grange and his partners hoped would finance the\nhumanitarian projects. The day before Mr. Blumenthal emailed Mrs. Clinton,\nMr. Grange wrote to a senior Clinton aide at the State Department to\nintroduce the venture with Mr. Obeida in Libya and seek an audience with\nthe United States\xe2\x80\x99 ambassador there. Mr. Grange said he did not receive a\nreply.\n\n\n\nMr. Blumenthal sent Mrs. Clinton at least 25 memos about Libya in 2011 and\n2012, many describing elaborate intrigues among various foreign governments\nand rebel factions.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton circulated them, frequently forwarding them to Jake Sullivan,\nher well-regarded deputy chief of staff, and requesting that he distribute\nthem to other State Department officials. Mr. Sullivan often sent the memos\nto senior officials in Libya, including the ambassador, J. Christopher\nStevens, who was killed in the 2012 attacks in Benghazi.\n\n\n\nIn many cases, Mr. Sullivan would paste the text from the memos into an\nemail and tell the other State Department officials that they had come from\nan anonymous \xe2\x80\x9ccontact\xe2\x80\x9d of Mrs. Clinton.\n\n\n\nSome of Mr. Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s memos urged Mrs. Clinton to consider rumors that\nother American diplomats knew at the time to be false. Not infrequently,\nMrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s subordinates replied to the memos with polite skepticism.\n\n\n\nIn April 2012, Mr. Stevens took issue with a Blumenthal memo raising the\nprospect that the Libyan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood was poised to\nmake gains in the coming parliamentary elections. The Brotherhood fared\npoorly in the voting.\n\n\n\nAnother American diplomat, after reading the same memo, noted that Mrs.\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s source appeared to have confused two Libyan politicians with the\nsame surname.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton herself sometimes seemed skeptical. After reading a March 2012\nmemo from Mr. Blumenthal, describing a plan by French and British\nintelligence officials to encourage tribal leaders in eastern Libya to\ndeclare a \xe2\x80\x9csemiautonomous\xe2\x80\x9d zone there, Mrs. Clinton wrote to Mr. Sullivan,\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis one strains credulity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Sullivan agreed, telling Mrs. Clinton, \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems like a thin conspiracy\ntheory.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut the skepticism did not seem to sour Mrs. Clinton on Mr. Blumenthal, who\ncontinued to forward Mr. Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s memos, often appending a note:\n\xe2\x80\x9cUseful insight,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cWe should get this around asap.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn an August 2012 memo, Mr. Blumenthal described the new president of\nLibya, Mohammed Yussef el-Magariaf, as someone who would \xe2\x80\x9cseek a discrete\nrelationship with Israel\xe2\x80\x9d and had \xe2\x80\x9cmany common friends and associates with\nthe leaders of Israel.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf true, this is encouraging,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Clinton wrote to Mr. Sullivan. \xe2\x80\x9cShould\nconsider passing to Israelis.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe emails suggest that Mr. Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s direct line to Mrs. Clinton\ncircumvented the elaborate procedures established by the federal government\nto ensure that high-level officials are provided with vetted assessments of\navailable intelligence.\n\n\n\nFormer intelligence officials said that it was not uncommon for top\nofficials, including secretaries of state, to look outside the intelligence\nbureaucracy for information and advice. But Paul R. Pillar, a former C.I.A.\nofficial who is now a researcher at the Center for Security Studies at\nGeorgetown University, said Mr. Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s dispatches went beyond that\nsort of informal channel, aping the style of official government\nintelligence reports but without assessments of the motives of sources.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sourcing is pretty sloppy,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pillar added, \xe2\x80\x9cin a way that would\nnever pass muster if it were the work of a reports officer at a U.S.\nintelligence agency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe long and winding road ahead for Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s e-mails\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/05/19/15-step-hillary-clinton-e-mail-review-process-could-be-done-by-january-2016/>\n// Washington Post // Fred Barbash \xe2\x80\x93 May 19, 2015\n\n\n\nThe State Department said in a court filing late Monday that it will take\nat least until January 2016 for it to review a cache of 30,000 e-mails\nprovided by former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and decide which ones\ncan be made available to the public, and in what form.\n\n\n\nEven then, it said, an \xe2\x80\x9cinteragency review process could impact the\nDepartment\xe2\x80\x99s proposed\xe2\x80\x9d timeline for public release of redacted versions of\nthe e-mails.\n\n\n\nAnd any other requests for Clinton e-mails, it warned, could make the\nreview even slower.\n\n\n\nAt best, according to the plan, some e-mails could land just at the\nbeginning of the Democratic presidential nominating process, which starts\nin February with the Iowa caucuses.\n\n\n\nThe e-mails were turned over to the department at its request by the former\nsecretary of state in December following reports that she was keeping them\non a private server.\n\n\n\nThe court filing came in response to a Freedom of Information Act suit\nfiled by Vice News.\n\n\n\nWhy will it take so long?\n\n\n\nThe State Department filing explained that Clinton sent over the e-mails on\npaper, rather than in some digital form. They consume a total of 55,000\npages in \xe2\x80\x9ctwelve bankers boxes\xe2\x80\xa6that corresponded approximately to the time\nframe of the documents within a given box.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNow each page \xe2\x80\x9cmust be individually hand\xe2\x80\x93processed in order to ensure that\nall information is being captured.\xe2\x80\x9d That alone is a five-step process that\nis \xe2\x80\x9ctime consuming and labor-intensive,\xe2\x80\x9d the filing to the U.S. District\nCourt in Washington said.\n\n\n\nBut that was just the beginning. The state department outlined a 15-step\nprocess involving sign-offs by at least three different offices internally\nand an unknown number of other agencies, each of which will undoubtedly\nimpose its own review procedure on the missives.\n\n\n\nFor example, if the Treasury Department had some role in a subject under\ndiscussion in an email, its lawyers will be given the opportunity to review\nit and perhaps to suggests at one extreme, reasons why it should not be\nreleased or portions that should be redacted.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe review of these materials will likely require consultation with a\nbroad range of subject matter experts within the Department and other\nagencies, as well as potentially with foreign governments,\xe2\x80\x9d the filing\nsaid, adding by way of warning that the department \xe2\x80\x9coperates in\napproximately 285 locations around the globe.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNor did the filing suggest any firmness in the January, 2016 date. Indeed,\na footnote warned that additional requests for Clinton emails that are\nsubject-specific, as opposed to the Vice\xe2\x80\x99s demand for everything, could\n\xe2\x80\x9cslow down the Department\xe2\x80\x99s processing of the collection.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhat Sidney Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s Memos to Hillary Clinton Said, and How They Were\nHandled\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/us/politics/what-sidney-blumenthals-memos-to-hillary-clinton-said-and-how-they-were-handled.html>\n// NYT // Michael S. Schmidt - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, Hillary Rodham Clinton received at least 25 memos about\nLibya from Sidney Blumenthal, a friend and confidant who at the time was\nemployed by the Clinton Foundation. The memos, written in the style of\nintelligence cables, make up about a third of the almost 900 pages of\nemails related to Libya that Mrs. Clinton said she kept on the personal\nemail account she used exclusively as secretary of state. Some of Mr.\nBlumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s memos appeared to be based on reports supplied by American\ncontractors he was advising as they sought to do business in Libya. Mr.\nBlumenthal also appeared to be gathering information from anonymous Libyan\nand Western officials and local news media reports. What follows are\ndescriptions of some of the memos and how they were handled by Mrs. Clinton\nand her aides.\n\n\n\nClinton Says Idea on Rebels Should Be Considered\n\n\n\nIn April 2011, Mr. Blumenthal sent Mrs. Clinton a memo about the rebel\nforces fighting the regime of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. The rebels, Mr.\nBlumenthal wrote, were considering hiring security contractors to train\ntheir forces. Mrs. Clinton forwarded the memo to her aide, Jake Sullivan,\nand said that the idea should be considered. (Pages 1-3)\n\n\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, Mrs. Clinton forwarded 18 memos to Mr. Sullivan, who in\nturn circulated them to senior State Department officials, including\nAmbassador J. Christopher Stevens, who was killed in the 2012 attacks in\nBenghazi, and Ambassador Gene A. Cretz, who preceded him.\n\n\n\nAn Alert to Possible Terrorist Attacks in Libya\n\n\n\nIn May 2011, Mr. Blumenthal sent Mrs. Clinton a memo reporting that\naffiliates of Al Qaeda in Libya were plotting attacks in revenge for the\nUnited States\xe2\x80\x99 killing of Osama bin Laden. Mrs. Clinton forwarded the email\nto Mr. Sullivan, saying that it was \xe2\x80\x9cdisturbing, if true.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sullivan\nquestioned its accuracy, but said he would share with others. (Pages 4-5)\n\n\n\nHighlighting the Role of a Potential Business Partner\n\n\n\nIn January 2012, Mr. Blumenthal wrote to Mrs. Clinton about challenges\nfacing Libya\xe2\x80\x99s new government. In the memo, Mr. Blumenthal said that\nLibya\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister was bringing in new economic advisers, and that a\nbusinessman, Najib Obeida, was among \xe2\x80\x9cthe most influential of this group.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAt the time, Mr. Obeida was a potential business partner for a group of\ncontractors whom Mr. Blumenthal was advising. Mrs. Clinton instructed Mr.\nSullivan to ask for a response from senior State Department officials\nincluding Mr. Cretz, then the ambassador to Libya. (Pages 6-15)\n\n\n\nA Memo Is Passed On, Despite Questions\n\n\n\nIn March 2012, Mrs. Clinton forwarded a memo by Mr. Blumenthal to Mr.\nSullivan, saying that she was dubious about its content. Mr. Sullivan\nagreed, stating that Mr. Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x99s report resembled \xe2\x80\x9ca conspiracy\ntheory\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 but still asked State Department officials to review it. (Pages\n16-17)\n\n\n\nA Warning Is Forwarded to Incoming Ambassador\n\n\n\nIn April 2012, Mr. Blumenthal wrote to Mrs. Clinton warning about the\nimminent rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Libya. Mrs. Clinton forwarded\nthe memo to Mr. Sullivan, who sent it to Mr. Stevens, the incoming United\nStates ambassador to Libya. Mr. Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 response \xe2\x80\x94 that the Brotherhood in\nfact had a relatively small following in Libya \xe2\x80\x94 was passed on to Mrs.\nClinton. (Pages 18-24)\n\n\n\nClinton Suggests Sharing Information With Israel\n\n\n\nAfter receiving an August 2012 memo from Mr. Blumenthal about how the new\nLibyan prime minister wanted to have a better relationship with Israel,\nMrs. Clinton suggested to Mr. Sullivan that they pass the intelligence\nalong to the Israelis. (Pages 25-27)\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s army of trolls\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/hillary-clintons-twitter-trolls-118079.html>\n// Politico // Annie Karni \xe2\x80\x93 May 19, 2015\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s tweets aren\xe2\x80\x99t particularly edgy or provocative. But no\nmatter what she says, they tend to generate a passionate response \xe2\x80\x93 much of\nit negative.\n\n\n\nNo matter the message, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s an opinion on a contentious issue or an\nunremarkable snapshot from the campaign trail, the result tends to be the\nsame: an avalanche of cynicism, snark and some outright bile.\n\n\n\nIn part, it\xe2\x80\x99s a function of the size of her account \xe2\x80\x94 with 3.5 million\nfollowers, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter following dwarves every other contender in the\n2016 hunt. And Twitter trolling, as all of the prospective candidates and\nanyone in public life can attest, is the price of admission.\n\n\n\nStill, when it comes to Clinton, the trolling is of a different scale and\nmeasure, a clear reflection of the strong feelings she provokes among her\nlegion of detractors.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you tell Hillary will fight every day for kids and families?\nBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s what she\xe2\x80\x99s always done,\xe2\x80\x9d @HillaryClinton tweeted May 12, with\na link to a Huffington Post story outlining her legacy as Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 first\nlady.\n\n\n\nThat relatively mundane tweet provoked anger from both the right and the\nleft. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about the ones she voted to send to war in Iraq,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Karen\nGeier, whose Twitter bio identifies her as a digital and social media\nstrategist, a feminist and a proud progressive.\n\n\n\nTed Bingham, a self-described conservative Mormon from Sheboygan, WI,\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cAfter she\xe2\x80\x99s done lying about the 30,000 emails, how she was\nnamed, and her \xe2\x80\x98immigrant grandparents. She\xe2\x80\x99s a total waste!!!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd Christopher Mahoney, who identified himself online as a retired vice\nchairman at Moody\xe2\x80\x99s, replied to Clinton by reaching back to the suicide of\na close Clinton confidante in the \xe2\x80\x9890s: \xe2\x80\x9cEspecially the family of Vince\nFoster.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAmid a long stream of detractors, one fan account, whose handle is @HRC,\ntweeted encouragingly, like a small voice working up the nerve to express\nan unpopular opinion: \xe2\x80\x9cNext Prez.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s online detractors most often paint her as untrustworthy, or raise\nquestions about the foreign money that has flowed to the Clinton Foundation\nwhile she was secretary of state. Some call her names like \xe2\x80\x9cwitch,\xe2\x80\x9d\ndictator,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmonster,\xe2\x80\x9d and even \xe2\x80\x9cHitlary,\xe2\x80\x9d all reminders of how polarizing\nClinton can be \xe2\x80\x94 a feminist hero and glass-ceiling cracker to supporters;\nan untrustworthy, pandering operative to the haters. (Her most devoted\nsupporters sometimes break through the noise with supportive exclamations\nof \xe2\x80\x9cQueen!\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\n\n\nHer large Twitter following is, on the whole, an advantage for Clinton, who\ncan exert more control over her own message and image: a recent picture of\nClinton in Iowa was retweeted 251 times and favorited by 561 Twitter users.\nIn contrast, a recent picture of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie campaigning\nin New Hampshire with his wife, Mary Pat, was retweeted once and favorited\nthree times.\n\n\n\nWith more followers than all the top-tier Republican candidates combined\n(her closest GOP competitor is Sen. Marco Rubio, who has 736,000),\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter account is a powerful messaging tool for pushing out her\nown snapshots from campaign stops, weighing in on national issues in 140\ncharacters, and directing supporters to her fundraising and volunteer pages\nonline.\n\n\n\nBut that formidable footprint comes with a price: she also trumps her\nopponents in terms of her legions of trolls, who sometimes overwhelm the\nconversations she generates, picking at the scabs and scars Clinton has\naccumulated over nearly four decades in public life.\n\n\n\nWhen Clinton recently tweeted \xe2\x80\x9cHealthy women ? healthy communities. Sign up\nif you agree with Hillary,\xe2\x80\x9d one quick response to that relatively anodyne\nmessage was, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cOn average how much does Bill spend on hookers each week?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s physical appearance is not considered out of bounds among her\nTwitter tormenters. One response to photos of Clinton walking around\nBrooklyn last week, dressed in a long green jacket, that were posted on\nTwitter: \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a human pear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOn May 14, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s tweet about \xe2\x80\x9cwords that ring truer than ever today:\n\xe2\x80\x98Human rights are women\xe2\x80\x99s rights, and women\xe2\x80\x99s rights are human rights.\xe2\x80\x99\n#TBT\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 along with a picture of Clinton from her famous 1995 speech on\nhuman rights in Beijing \xe2\x80\x94 drew an especially pointed response. One Rachel\nCohen \xe2\x80\x94 a self-described protestant Christian, conservative libertarian gun\nowner replied: \xe2\x80\x9cOh for the days when you weren\xe2\x80\x99t tired, fat, old and gray.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe campaign doesn\xe2\x80\x99t engage with its trolls \xe2\x80\x94 or even acknowledge them.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton listens to everyone\xe2\x80\x99s voices whether they have substantive\nfeedback during the hours of roundtable discussions she\xe2\x80\x99s had or 140\ncharacters of feedback in response to a tweet,\xe2\x80\x9d said a Clinton campaign\naide.\n\n\n\nA Democratic strategist who is not affiliated with the campaign explained\nthe Clinton approach this way: \xe2\x80\x9cHaters gonna hate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd they do.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillary wants to call someone\xe2\x80\x99s mom on Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day. It could be yours,\xe2\x80\x9d\nClinton tweeted \xe2\x80\x94 seemingly innocuously \xe2\x80\x94 on May 4, with a link to the\ncampaign contest fundraiser.\n\n\n\nNot so innocuous, it turned out.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so thank U R Not my mom or Grandma and U stay away from my MOM!\nDictator Hypocrite!\xe2\x80\x9d replied one woman whose Twitter handle is Judy Ameil.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about calling the moms of those killed at Benghazi? that\xe2\x80\x99s a great\nstart. Instead, it\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be rich donors. #Witch.\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Paul Hicks,\nwho tweets under the handle @PaulAniston and responds often to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\ntweets.\n\n\n\nWhile the attacks seem to be personal and sometimes sexist, the attackers\nclaim they are not.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYep. I troll quite a bit I guess,\xe2\x80\x9d Hicks, who works as a quality control\nengineer, explained in a direct message on Twitter. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t dislike her\npersonally because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know her personally. As with all politicians,\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure she\xe2\x80\x99s very likeable and says all the right things\xe2\x80\xa6. I\xe2\x80\x99m as tired\nof old white men leading this country as the next guy. We need someone\nthat\xe2\x80\x99ll unite the country, protect it & stand up for its citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe constant stream of criticism \xe2\x80\x9ccomes with the territory\xe2\x80\x9d of a\nhigh-profile campaign, said Rebecca Heisler, former social media director\nfor Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 presidential campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cThe key is to create enough\nquality content that you\xe2\x80\x99re not just getting negative feedback, you\xe2\x80\x99re also\ngetting supporters to actively engage and drown out the noise.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nReading the individual comments is counter-productive, she said, but\ngetting a bigger picture of a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s reception online can be helpful\nto a campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are social listening tools where you can monitor more\nbroadly how people are engaging with your content,\xe2\x80\x9d Heisler said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a big difference between social noise and social action,\xe2\x80\x9d warned\nBetsy Hoover, a partner at 270 Strategies, who was President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 2012\ndigital organizing director and worked with Ready for Hillary. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to\nrecognize that and know what you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing and when. Engagement is high and\nthe focus is really high. With Clinton, you have a very focused place for\nthat energy to go in a way you don\xe2\x80\x99t on the other side. It\xe2\x80\x99s much easier to\nbe against something on Twitter than for something, but the people that are\npro-Hillary are donating money, sharing a video, or volunteering in their\ncommunities.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBy now, the campaign has come to expect a stream of trolling \xe2\x80\x94 especially\nwhen Clinton weighs in on divisive issues like abortion.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen it comes to women\xe2\x80\x99s health, there are two kinds of experts: women and\ntheir doctors. True 40+ years ago, true today. - H\xe2\x80\x9d she tweeted last\nWednesday, weighing in on the debate surrounding a bill to ban 20 week\nabortions (it passed in the House earlier that day).\n\n\n\nThe responses were as expected: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you just come out and say you\nhave no problem with killing babies? We\xe2\x80\x99re talking 20 weeks. you\xe2\x80\x99re a\nmonster\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d tweeted \xe2\x80\x9cRyan,\xe2\x80\x9d a self-described \xe2\x80\x9cChristian. Texan.\nConservative,\xe2\x80\x9d who has over 6,000 followers.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush also weighed in on the bill on Twitter: \xe2\x80\x9cI urge Congress to\nsupport the late-term abortion ban today. We need to stand up for life and\nthe most vulnerable among us. #HR36.\xe2\x80\x9d As with Clinton, some of his trolls\nalso started a conversation that seemed to be more about general attacks on\nhis candidacy than the 20-week abortion ban.\n\n\n\nIn the end, though, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s online presence trumped his, even if it came\nwith a stream of ugly comments from those that will never vote for her.\n\n\n\nBush\xe2\x80\x99s comment was retweeted 265 times, compared to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2,345.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton was paid millions by tech industry for speeches\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hillary-clinton-was-paid-millions-by-tech-industry-for-speeches/2015/05/18/f149d598-fd86-11e4-805c-c3f407e5a9e9_story.html>\n// WaPo // Matea Gold, Rosalind S. Helderman, and Anu Narayanswamy - May\n18, 2015\n\n\n\nIn one of her last gigs on the paid lecture circuit, Hillary Rodham Clinton\naddressed an eBay summit aimed at promoting women in the workplace,\ndelivering a 20-minute talk that garnered her a $315,000 payday from the\ncompany.\n\n\n\nLess than two months later, Clinton was feted at the San Francisco Bay-area\nhome of eBay chief executive John Donahoe and his wife, Eileen, for one of\nthe first fundraisers supporting Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s newly announced presidential\ncampaign.\n\n\n\nThe two events spotlight the unusually close financial ties between Clinton\nand a broad array of industries with issues before the government that paid\ntens of millions of dollars to her and her husband, former president Bill\nClinton, in the months preceding the launch of her presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nDisclosure documents filed by Hillary Clinton last week revealed that the\ncouple have earned about $25 million for delivering 104 paid speeches since\nJanuary 2014.\n\n\n\nWhile Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s lucrative speaking career since leaving the White\nHouse in 2001 has been well documented, the new disclosures offer the first\npublic accounting of Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s paid addresses since she stepped\ndown as secretary of state. And they illustrate how the Clintons have\npersonally profited by drawing on the same network of supporters who have\nbacked their political campaigns and philanthropic efforts \xe2\x80\x94 while those\nsupporters have gained entree to a potential future president.\n\n\n\nSilicon Valley is one place where those overlapping interests come\ntogether, according to a Washington Post analysis of the new Clinton\ndisclosures.\n\n\n\nOut of the $11.7 million that Hillary Clinton has made delivering 51\nspeeches since January 2014, $3.2 million came from the technology\nindustry, the analysis found. Several of the companies that paid Clinton to\naddress their employees also have senior leaders who have been early and\navid supporters of her presidential bid.\n\n\n\nThe tech sector was the largest single source of speaking fees for Clinton,\nfollowed by health care and financial services, according to the Post\nanalysis. Bill Clinton also made substantial income speaking to tech groups\nbut focused more heavily on financial services, insurance and real estate\ncompanies.\n\n\n\nA Hillary Clinton campaign spokesman declined to comment.\n\n\n\nWhile it is common for former presidents to receive top dollar as paid\nspeakers, Hillary Clinton is unique as a prospective candidate who received\nlarge personal payouts from corporations, trade groups and other major\ninterests mere months before launchinga White House bid. In some cases,\nthose speeches gave Clinton a chance to begin sounding out themes of her\ncoming campaign and even discuss policy issues that a future Clinton\nadministration might face.\n\n\n\nCompanies that paid her to speak include industry giants such as Xerox,\nCisco Systems and Qualcomm, as well as start-ups and trade groups focused\non biotechnology and medical technology.\n\n\n\nThe blurred line between personal and political is apparent in the cases of\ncompanies that hired Clinton to speak and are led by executives who are now\nprominent backers of her campaign. Salesforce.com, for instance, paid\nClinton $451,000 to deliver two talks last year, and its CEO, Marc Benioff,\nis a major donor to Ready for Hillary, a super PAC that laid the groundwork\nfor her presidential bid. Another major backer of the PAC is Irwin Jacobs,\nhe former chairman of Qualcomm, which shelled out $335,000 for Clinton to\nspeak in late October.\n\n\n\nA spokeswoman for Salesforce declined to comment on how Clinton came to be\ninvited to speak. Qualcomm did not return requests for comment. A\nspokeswoman for Jacobs said that he is retired from the company and does\nnot play a role in its decisions.\n\n\n\nWhen Clinton arrived at eBay for her March 2014 women\xe2\x80\x99s-leadership speech,\nshe had another connection to the company. Eileen Donohoe, wife of the CEO,\nhad worked for Clinton as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Council.\n\n\n\nAbby Smith, spokeswoman for eBay, said that, \xe2\x80\x9cas one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most\nadmired women, Hillary Clinton was the perfect choice\xe2\x80\x9d for the event. Smith\ndeclined to comment on the Donahoes\xe2\x80\x99 fundraiser for the Clinton campaign.\n\n\n\nThe new disclosures showed Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s vast earning power on the public\nspeaking circuit as a former secretary of state who many viewed as the\nDemocratic presidential nominee in waiting.\n\n\n\nIn some cases, organizations that had once paid Bill Clinton to speak now\npaid even more to lure his wife.\n\n\n\nThe Biotechnology Industry Organization paid Bill Clinton $175,000 in 2010.\nFour years later, the group paid $335,000 \xe2\x80\x94 nearly twice as much \xe2\x80\x94 to hear\nfrom Hillary Clinton. Likewise, the Advanced Medical Technology Association\npaid Bill Clinton $160,000 to speak in 2009 and paid Hillary Clinton\n$265,000 to speak in 2014.\n\n\n\nThe warm reception for Hillary Clinton in Silicon Valley comes after she\nwatched a young upstart named Barack Obama lock up many of the industry\xe2\x80\x99s\ntop money players during their fight for the 2008 Democratic presidential\nnomination.\n\n\n\nSince then, the region has experienced explosive growth, making it an even\nbigger target for candidates hunting for political donors. Republicans such\nas Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and former Florida governor Jeb Bush are\nmaking a play to win over the traditionally left-leaning enclave.\n\n\n\nBut Clinton is not giving them much of an opening, assiduously courting\ntech leaders as she contemplated another White House run.\n\n\n\nOne day last July, she tweeted, \xe2\x80\x9cIn #SiliconValley today visiting @Google,\n@Facebook, & @Twitter. Looking forward to seeing everyone and answering\nsome questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton did not receive any speaking fees from those companies, which she\nvisited as part of a tour promoting her latest book, \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut about a month later, she scooped up $625,000 in one day from the tech\nsector \xe2\x80\x94 first addressing a conference in San Francisco sponsored by\nNexenta Systems, a data storage start-up, and then as a surprise guest at\nCisco\xe2\x80\x99s sales conference in Las Vegas, where she was interviewed by chief\nexecutive John Chambers.\n\n\n\nAt the Nexenta conference, Clinton addressed several hot-button policy\nissues in Silicon Valley that the next president will have to confront. She\nspoke of the need to \xe2\x80\x9crebalance\xe2\x80\x9d privacy and security when it comes to\ngovernment surveillance, an issue viewed as both a business and\nphilosophical matter among tech leaders. And she expressed interest in an\nidea proposed by Chambers and other chief executives to allow companies to\nbring profits invested overseas back to the United States at a reduced tax\nrate.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do our economy any good to have this money parked somewhere\nelse in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\n\nThe event also provided Clinton, who was making few public appearances, a\nplatform to weigh in on an increasingly hot national issue. In her first\nremarks about the unrest that followed the shooting death of Michael Brown\nin Ferguson, Mo., she urged Americans not to ignore \xe2\x80\x9cinequities that\npersist in our justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAllison Darin, director of communications for Nexenta, said that the topic\n\xe2\x80\x9chas nothing to do with what we do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut, she added, \xe2\x80\x9cit was obviously compelling news which brought a lot of\nattention to the event, which is exactly what we want.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nTarkan Maner, the company\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, sits on the national finance\ncommittee of the Ready for Hillary PAC and made a $5,000 donation to the\ngroup in September, about a month after Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s speech.\n\n\n\nDarin said Maner\xe2\x80\x99s support for Clinton had nothing to do with the company\xe2\x80\x99s\ninvitation to have her speak. Rather, she said, company officials decided\nClinton would have broad appeal for the audience of 500 top executives who\nattended the conference.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t politically focused at that time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was just\ngood timing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMost of Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s paid speeches were closed to the public and the press.\nBut in the few that were open, Clinton appeared to be road-testing themes\nthat would become a part of her upcoming campaign.\n\n\n\nIn an April 2014 speech at a technology conference sponsored by Marketo, a\nsoftware branding company, she discussed the growing gap between rich and\npoor in the United States. According to news reports, she proposed changes\nto taxation and corporate policies to address the issue.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cInequality of the kind we are experiencing is bad for individuals, bad for\nsociety, bad for democracy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, according to the New York Times. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\nyou look around the world, this is becoming a bigger issue everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s latest financial disclosures also highlight the extent of\npersonal support she and her husband have received from organizations and\nindividuals who have donated to their charity, the Bill, Hillary and\nChelsea Clinton Foundation.\n\n\n\nAt least 72 organizations that have paid the Clintons for speeches since\n2001 have also donated to the Clinton Foundation.\n\n\n\nFor example, Cisco, which paid Hillary Clinton $325,000 for her August\nappearance, has given the foundation between $1 million and $5 million. In\n2011, the company paid Bill Clinton $210,000 to speak at an event on Kiawah\nIsland in South Carolina.\n\n\n\nAs for eBay, the company\xe2\x80\x99s charitable foundation has given more than\n$50,000 to the Clinton Foundation.\n\n\n\nClinton Criticism of Wealth Leaves Us 1% Convinced\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-05-18/clinton-criticism-of-wealth-leaves-us-1-convinced>\n// Bloomberg // C. Thompson and Lauren Arnold - ay 18, 2015\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton sold her soul when they accepted that money.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe speaker here is a Sahrawi Arab from the disputed territory of Western\nSahara named Mohamed Lahwaimed, quoted in a Politico story from last\nFriday. While he\xe2\x80\x99s referring to the $1 million (or more) in donations to\nthe Clinton Foundation from a Moroccan mining company with ties to King\nMohammed VI, he could be speaking as well to a lot of voters in the U.S.\ntoday.\n\n\n\nWonder if she\xe2\x80\x99s listening.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s finally do something about the growing economic inequality that is\ntearing our country apart,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in 2007 during her campaign for the\n2008 election, according to the New York Times. \xe2\x80\x9cThe top 1 percent of our\nhouseholds held 22 percent of our nation\xe2\x80\x99s wealth.\xe2\x80\x9d We\xe2\x80\x99re not sure of the\ntime frame to which she\xe2\x80\x99s referring, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. We get it\nalready.\n\n\n\nHow difficult will it be to run a campaign on a platform of tackling wealth\ninequality, which she is reprising for this run (probably because she has\nto), when we have all just learned that she and her husband can pretty much\njust burp money?\n\n\n\nA haul of $30 million or so from talking to Rotarians in the past 16\nmonths, revealed in a financial disclosure filed to the Federal Elections\nCommission on Friday, has got to be some weight around her neck now. As\nJennifer Epstein and Richard Rubin reported over the weekend, that\xe2\x80\x99s not\neven everything\xe2\x80\x94notably, the almost $105 million Bill Clinton pulled down\nfrom 2001 to 2013.\n\n\n\nThe once-and-perhaps-future first couple\xe2\x80\x99s net worth, Epstein and Rubin\nwrite, is somewhere between $11.3 million and $52.7 million (our range is\nnarrower), and this excludes homes in New York and Washington, retirement\nsavings accounts and other personal effects, as if those would tip the\nscale even more\xe2\x80\x94from, say, astounding to astonishing.\n\n\n\nThe Clintons may have been \xe2\x80\x9cdead broke\xe2\x80\x9d when they left the White House in\n2001, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like they stayed that way for very long.\n\n\n\nSo, what is it about her that is supposed to resonate with the middle-class\nvoters? This will be the talking point from the other party for some time\nto come, one could reasonably assume, and of course it\xe2\x80\x99s a layup for them.\nBut the Republicans might want to watch where they step because there are\nstill steaming piles of Romney and Bush and, hell, even McCain money out\nthere on the trail.\n\n\n\nThe bigger issue probably is that this information is going to be wielded\nagainst her by her own party.\n\n\n\nSo, again, what is it? Where\xe2\x80\x99s she coming from, when she\xe2\x80\x99s taking in money\nso fast and from so far afield, when she says she\xe2\x80\x99s a champion of the poor?\nIs it some kind of noblesse oblige thing? Does wealth not have its place?\n\n\n\nAt Forbes magazine, the argument goes that the inequality Clinton claims to\nattack is, in fact, what\xe2\x80\x99s made it possible for her to be in this position\nin the first place.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Clintons are rich for having been wise enough to make a profession\nof politics in what is the richest, most innovative country on Earth,\xe2\x80\x9d John\nTamny writes.\n\n\n\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re rich because people care about them, and people care about them\nbecause they\xe2\x80\x99re rich, he suggests:\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s most bothersome is that Hillary would bash the very inequality that\nhas made it possible for her and Bill to be prominent global figures, and\nby extension wildly rich global figures. If not for the immense taxable\nwealth in the U.S., and the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 ability to influence its direction\naround the world, very few would give them the time of day.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98In short, the Clintons are nothing without the wealth inequality they\nclaim to disdain. It\xe2\x80\x99s the sole source of their power,\xe2\x80\x9d Tamny writes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nswagger of the world\xe2\x80\x99s foremost political couple was taken from someone\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWill it be taken from her?\n\n\n\nCNN commentator: Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98strong point\xe2\x80\x99 is her last name, husband\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/05/18/cnn-commentator-hillary-clintons-strong-point-is-her-last-name-husband/>\n// WaPo // Erik Wemple \xe2\x80\x93 May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nCNN commentator Tara Setmayer today identified what Hillary Clinton has\ngoing for her. \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 she\xe2\x80\x99s her own worst enemy \xe2\x80\xa6 she\xe2\x80\x99s not her\nhusband, she\xe2\x80\x99s not the consummate politician, campaigner \xe2\x80\xa6 warm and fuzzy\nperson. \xe2\x80\xa6 That is not her strong point,\xe2\x80\x9d said Setmayer, who is also a\ncontributor to The Blaze TV.\n\n\n\nSo what is her strong point? Setmayer: \xe2\x80\x9cHer strong point is that her last\nname is Clinton and that she has a husband that people adore and that she\xe2\x80\x99s\na woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFellow CNN commentator Marc Lamont Hill had a problem with all that:\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s sexist, that\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely sexist. \xe2\x80\xa6 I reject completely the idea\nthat Hillary Clinton has nothing going for her but her last name and her\nhusband,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hill, in a segment moderated by CNN\xe2\x80\x99s Carol Costello.\n\n\n\nAt which point, Setmayer pressed Hill on Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s accomplishments as\nsecretary of state. Hill stumbled a bit on that one: \xe2\x80\x9cOpening up Myanmar,\nresetting Russia, having some of the most important, I think, sanctions\nintensified on Iran that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in decades. I think all of those things\nthat this secretary of state has done that have been effective,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nresponded.\n\n\n\nThe discussion broke out into a very brisk, occasionally boisterous,\nface-off over Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s record. Charges of sexism went back and forth, but\nget ready, viewers: The question of just what Clinton accomplished as\nsecretary of state will get a great deal of rotation on cable news in the\ncoming year and a half.

That question came on April 21.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a wide range of outlets have gone out of their way to document\nevery question Clinton has answered from the press since announcing her\ncampaign. That total reportedly stands at 13 questions, depending on who\'s\ncounting. The Daily News, National Journal, and Politico reported that she\nhas answered only eight inquiries from reporters.\n\n\n\nOne of President Barack Obama\'s closest former campaign advisers, media\nconsultant David Axelrod, said it would be a "terrible mistake" for Clinton\nnot to reverse course and open up to the media.\n\nAxelrod, whose team beat Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary, argued\nthat Clinton doesn\'t want "a major news event" every time she answers a\nroutine question.\n\n\n\n"She has to answer questions, and she has to do it routinely, so it\'s not a\nmajor news event when she takes a few questions from the news media,"\nAxelrod said on NBC\'s "Meet the Press," according to a transcript. "It\nwould be a terrible mistake to not do that."\n\n\n\nFor her part, Clinton\'s campaign and supporters have dismissed the\ncriticism as media navel-gazing.\n\n\n\nA campaign spokesman declined to comment to Business Insider for this\nstory, but another spokesman, Jesse Ferguson, reacted last week on Twitter\nby pointing to Clinton taking questions at length during town hall events:\n"Philosophical Q: If a candidate answers hours of questions from real\npeople on camera but they didn\'t come from press, did they happen?"\n\n\n\nPerhaps seeking to counter potential criticism on the issue, the\npro-Clinton super PAC American Bridge on Monday released a lengthy list of\nquestions Clinton has both asked and taken from "everyday Americans while\non the campaign trail."\n\n\n\n"While other candidates are using the media to further their own agendas\nand attack each other, Hillary Clinton is displaying the qualities of a\ntrue leader by meeting with the people she hopes to champion as the next\nPresident of the United States," the PAC said in a statement to reporters.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton Paid by Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Education Company\n<https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/05/18/hillary-clinton-paid-jeb-bushs-education-company/>\n// First Look // Lee Fang \xe2\x80\x93 May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton received nearly a quarter\nof a million dollars last year for a speaking engagement on behalf of\nAcademic Partnerships, a for-profit education company in which Jeb Bush\nheld an ownership stake and on whose board he served.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s newly-filed personal financial disclosure shows that she was paid\n$225,500 on March 24, 2014 by Academic Partnerships. At the invitation-only\nevent in Dallas, Texas, Clinton reportedly said, \xe2\x80\x9ctoday a student doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nneed to travel to Cambridge, Mass., or Cambridge, England, to get a\nworld-class education.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAcademic Partnerships assists universities in converting their academic\ndegree programs into online versions that can be taken by students around\nthe world.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, Bush joined Academic Partnerships as an investor and as a paid\nadvisor. He helped the company host multiple conferences and has appeared\nin online videos encouraging others to consider the Academic Partnership\nbusiness model. Though he did not share the stage with Clinton, Bush spoke\nat the same conference.\n\n\n\nPreparing for an expected bid for the Republican nomination for president,\nBush resigned from Academic Partnerships in December.\n\n\n\nRand Paul: Bill Clinton put \xe2\x80\x98generation\xe2\x80\x99 of black men in prison\n<http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/242382-rand-paul-bill-clinton-put-generation-of-black-men-in>\n// The Hill // Alexander Bolton \xe2\x80\x93 May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nPHILADELPHIA \xe2\x80\x94 Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul says he will\nbash Hillary Clinton over her husband\xe2\x80\x99s record of putting \xe2\x80\x9ca generation of\nblack men in prison\xe2\x80\x9d if he is the nominee.\n\n\n\nPaul, a freshman senator from Kentucky, says he will compete with Clinton\nin Philadelphia, where Democrats have a 7-to-1 registration advantage, and\nother impoverished cities by highlighting his support for criminal justice\nreform.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were the nominee, we will compete in Philadelphia,\xe2\x80\x9d he told CBS radio\ntalk show host Dom Giordano at the National Constitution Center.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll ask Hillary Clinton, what have you done for criminal justice.

She\xe2\x80\x99s changing her tune because people like\nme have been speaking out against these injustices,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nAs president, Clinton signed the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act, which gave\nsentences fiscal incentives to enact tougher sentencing laws.\n\n\n\nPaul noted that in some predominantly African-American communities such as\nFerguson, Missouri, there are substantially fewer black men than women\nbecause so many black men are incarcerated.\n\n\n\nHe touted bills he has introduced with Democratic support that would give\njudges more discretion in handing out sentencing and reduce penalties for\nnon-violent drug offenses.\n\n\n\nPaul said he would also challenge Clinton about her vision for\nreinvigorating blighted urban centers.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll also ask her what she\xe2\x80\x99s going to do for poor people in Philadelphia.\nI have a specific plan that would dramatically lower the taxes for people\nwho live in zip codes of poverty and high unemployment. I would leave\nbillions of dollars in Philadelphia over ten years. What\xe2\x80\x99s Hillary Clinton\ngoing to do?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nBill Clinton signals he can be Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s second fiddle\n<http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/242456-bill-clinton-signals-he-can-be-hillarys-second-fiddle>\n// The Hill // Niaill Stanage \xe2\x80\x93 May 19, 2015\n\n\n\nBill Clinton is going out of his way to suggest he can play second fiddle\nto Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign.\n\n\n\nThe former president, considered one of his party\xe2\x80\x99s greatest campaigners\nand political minds, has implied he will play the wallflower when it comes\nto his wife\xe2\x80\x99s presidential bid.\n\n\n\nAppearing on David Letterman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLate Show\xe2\x80\x9d last week, Bill Clinton jokingly\nsuggested that if his wife wins the presidency, he\xe2\x80\x99d only move back to the\nWhite House \xe2\x80\x9cif I\xe2\x80\x99m asked.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s happy to give Hillary Clinton advice \xe2\x80\x9cif his advice is asked for,\xe2\x80\x9d his\nchief of staff, Tina Flournoy, told The Washington Post the same week.\n\n\n\nBill Clinton is \xe2\x80\x9cnot directly engaged in the campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d Flournoy added.\n\n\n\nBut many political observers doubt that Bill Clinton can hang back. In\nfact, some find the idea preposterous.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, NBC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press\xe2\x80\x9d host, Chuck Todd, declared that the\nformer president had become \xe2\x80\x9cthe face of the Clinton campaign, in an odd\nway,\xe2\x80\x9d because he had answered 39 on-camera questions since his wife\nformally declared her candidacy, compared with nine answered by Hillary\nClinton.\n\n\n\nOn the same show, David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President\nObama, said that Hillary Clinton would be making \xe2\x80\x9ca terrible mistake\xe2\x80\x9d if\nshe did not quickly get into the rhythm of fielding media questions\nherself.\n\n\n\nVeterans of recent presidential campaigns, such as Axelrod, need no\nreminding of the assets and liabilities Bill Clinton brings to the trail.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s speech at the Democratic National Convention was\nhailed as one of the most effective of the presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nIn 2008, by contrast, his appearances often backfired on his wife, most\nnotably when he compared Obama\xe2\x80\x99s performance against her in the South\nCarolina primary to that of civil rights leader Jesse Jackson in earlier\npresidential races. The remark was widely seen as racially insensitive.\n\n\n\nThe issue faced by Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign is how to take advantage of\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s prodigious skills while steering him around\n\npotential pitfalls.\n\n\n\nStrategists on both sides of the political divide agree that one vital\nissue is the extent to which the former president can be kept focused.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was at the White House, so long as there was a bull\xe2\x80\x99s-eye, he would\ninvariably hit it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chris Lehane, who worked in the Clinton\nadministration before going on to serve as press secretary for then-Vice\nPresident Gore\xe2\x80\x99s 2000 presidential campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bull\xe2\x80\x99s-eye,\nthen it\xe2\x80\x99s harder to know where you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be going.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBill Clinton has tremendous speaking skills and the ability to motivate\nvoters,\xe2\x80\x9d Republican consultant Ron Bonjean acknowledged. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he eventually\nacts of his own accord, and there is a significant possibility that he can\ntake the campaign off message.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe former president has already displayed that downside to some extent,\ndrawing unflattering headlines in recent months on donations to the Clinton\nFoundation and on the massive fees he can command for speeches \xe2\x80\x94 around\n$500,000 per appearance.\n\n\n\nBill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s response when asked by NBC News if he would continue making\nsuch lavishly rewarded speeches \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, I gotta pay our bills\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 only\ndeepened the worry on the part of some of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s supporters that he\nhas, in political terms, lost a step.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBill Clinton could be well-used in 2016, but even if you are as good a\npolitician as he is, your skills atrophy, you get a little bit rusty,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nCal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist\nUniversity. \xe2\x80\x9cBill in a set piece, like a speech to a convention, is always\nmasterful. But out on the stump, and particularly when he is ad-libbing, he\ncan get himself in a little bit of trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nStill, it could be easier for the Hillary Clinton campaign to keep Bill\nClinton on message this time than it was in 2008.\n\n\n\nWhile it has never been a secret that there are separate camps of advisers\nand confidants around each of the Clintons, many of the former secretary of\nState\xe2\x80\x99s aides now are too young to bear the baggage accrued during Bill\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s White House years.\n\n\n\nHer campaign manager,\n\nRobby Mook, is 35 and a member of a different generation than 2008 campaign\naides such as Mark Penn or Bill Clinton loyalists such as James Carville.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think her campaign will be careful not to let him do whatever he wants,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Princeton University public affairs professor Julian Zelizer. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nneed to contain him, and I think no one knows that better than his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBill Clinton is viewed positively by a majority of the public.\n\n\n\nA Gallup poll released last week found that 59 percent of adults in the\nU.S. viewed him favorably compared with 38 percent who viewed him\nunfavorably. Opinions of his wife were more evenly split: 50 percent\nfavorable to 46 percent unfavorable.\n\n\n\nLehane argued that Bill Clinton is the Babe Ruth of politics, adding that\nthe 42nd president might be used sparingly until Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign\nis well underway but that he could be vital in big moments.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are the manager of a baseball team, you\xe2\x80\x99re in the World Series and\nyou see on the bench Babe Ruth, to me you put Babe Ruth in the starting\nlineup,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is more of a question about whether you put Babe\nRuth in spring training.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBut the former president proved once again on Monday that he might get a\nlittle restless as a benchwarmer. After President Obama debuted a new\nTwitter account with the handle @Potus, Clinton responded.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome to @Twitter, @POTUS!\xe2\x80\x9d the tweet read. \xe2\x80\x9cOne question: Does that\nusername stay with the office? #askingforafriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBill Clinton\'s Hud Secretary: Julian Castro Team Hillary\'s Top VP Choice\n<http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/18/bill-clintons-hud-secretary-julian-castro-team-hillarys-top-vp-choice/>\n// Breitbart News // May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nBill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  Henry\nCisneros believes that Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign is intent on picking\ncurrent HUD secretary Julian Castro as her running mate.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I am hearing in Washington, including from people in Hillary\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, is that the first person on their lists is Julian\nCastro,\xe2\x80\x9d Cisneros said in an Univision interview that aired on Sunday.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a second option, because he is the superior candidate\nconsidering his record, personality, demeanor and Latin heritage. I think\nthere is a very high possibility that Hillary Clinton may choose Julian\nCastro.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAs The Hill noted, \xe2\x80\x9cCastro has followed a political path similar to the one\nCisneros traveled in the 1990s\xe2\x80\x9d when \xe2\x80\x9cCisneros served as Mayor of San\nAntonio and was then HUD secretary under President Bill Clinton.\xe2\x80\x9d But\nCisneros \xe2\x80\x9cultimately left the Clinton administration in the shadow of a\nscandal about payments he had made to a former mistress. He later pleaded\nguilty to one count of lying to the FBI and was pardoned by Clinton.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nCastro, who appeared at a March Center for American Progress event with\nClinton, essentially ruled out running for Texas governor in 2018 in a\nrecent interview with MSNBC, saying that was not on his radar screen. When\nhost Jose Diaz-Balart asked him about the vice presidential rumors, Castro\nsaid he had \xe2\x80\x9cno comment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton is reportedly running as \xe2\x80\x9cthe most liberal Democratic front-runner\nin decades\xe2\x80\x9d because she is projecting that minorities will comprise 31% of\nthe 2016 electorate compared to 28% in 2012 and 26% in 2008.\n\n\n\nHouse liberals play hard-to-get with Hillary Clinton\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/clinton-2016-house-liberals-endorsement-progressives-118076.html>\n// Politico // Lauren French \xe2\x80\x93 May 19, 2015\n\n\n\nMore than 30 members of the House Progressive Caucus still aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready to\nback Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, saying she has a ways to go to show she\nwould champion their agenda as president.\n\n\n\nThe resistance comes even as they acknowledge she\xe2\x80\x99ll likely be the party\xe2\x80\x99s\nnominee, and her campaign has mounted an early, aggressive courtship of\nlawmakers.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUltimately, she simply needs to \xe2\x80\xa6 not [be] a Republican for me to endorse\nher,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), co-chairman of the 70-member House\nProgressive Caucus. \xe2\x80\x9cI will support the Democratic nominee, there is no\nquestion about that. The real question is: What is going to make me get\nexcited? I want to hear her talking about the most pressing issue in\nAmerica today, which is the concentration of wealth at the top.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nEllison and other House liberals hope that by holding out on a formal\nendorsement, they can nudge Clinton to the left, not only on income\ninequality but poverty, trade, criminal justice and college affordability \xe2\x80\x94\nessentially, the Elizabeth Warren agenda. Progressive Caucus members have\nasked to meet with Clinton aides soon to discuss their policies.\n\n\n\nSo far, there are close to three dozen House progressives who already have\nendorsed Clinton. But most House liberals want to see a stronger commitment\nto their platform.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want her to declare a war on poverty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rep. G.K. Butterfield\n(D-N.C.), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. For Rep. Ra\xc3\xbal\nGrijalva (D-Ariz.), co-chairman of the Progressive Caucus, it\xe2\x80\x99s climate\nchange and the role of government and trade. \xe2\x80\x9cProgressives are looking for\ndefinitive positions on the issues,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nBoth have withheld their endorsements, at least for now.\n\n\n\nThe resistance to her among liberals isn\xe2\x80\x99t a direct threat to her campaign\nso much as another reminder of the wariness among the party base toward its\npresumed nominee. The lawmakers aren\xe2\x80\x99t so disillusioned that they would get\nbehind Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley or Bernie Sanders. In the end, they\xe2\x80\x99re all but sure\nto come around to Clinton, but like other activists on the left, they want\nher to earn it.\n\n\n\nStill, their lack of enthusiasm for Clinton has practical implications. If\nshe fails to energize progressives, it could depress turnout and hurt\nDemocrats\xe2\x80\x99 chances of eating into the GOP\xe2\x80\x99s 245-seat House majority \xe2\x80\x94 a\nmajor priority for the party in an election year that should favor\nDemocrats.\n\n\n\nAnd as of now, progressives say they aren\xe2\x80\x99t seeing enough from the Clinton\ncampaign.\n\n\n\nThe former secretary of state has, for example, refused to weigh in on the\ncontroversial battle over \xe2\x80\x9cfast-track\xe2\x80\x9d authority for trade deals \xe2\x80\x94 raising\nthe suspicions of some progressives as Clinton was a key player in the\nTrans-Pacific Partnership currently being negotiated by the Obama\nadministration.\n\n\n\nThe fast-track bill is the procedural first step Obama needs to complete\nthe largest trade agreement in American history and a large bloc of\nDemocrats in the House and Senate has been working for months to defeat it.\nThe Senate is set to vote on the bill this week, but the measure\xe2\x80\x99s fate in\nthe House is still uncertain.\n\n\n\nClinton gave a tempered response on trade in April but has refused to\nanswer questions from the media about her concerns or thoughts on the issue\nsince.\n\n\n\nThat, Grijalva said, is not acceptable for a candidate seeking favor with\nprogressives.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is critical,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe campaign and the secretary have to \xe2\x80\xa6 tell\nus where they stand on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA spokesman for Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, Josh Schwerin, said Clinton appreciates\nthe support she\xe2\x80\x99s seen from the left.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton appreciates the support of so many members of the\nProgressive Caucus and looks forward to continuing to work with them\nthroughout the campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d Schwerin said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will build on the proposals\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s laid out on issues like criminal justice reform, immigration and\nhelping everyday Americans get ahead and stay ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd the campaign has signaled in recent weeks that Clinton is eyeing the\npopulist base that helped elect President Barack Obama. Campaign manager\nRobby Mook excited liberals when he said on CNBC that voters are seeking\nout a candidate who is a \xe2\x80\x9cchampion\xe2\x80\x9d for progressive issues like \xe2\x80\x9cdebt-free\ncollege.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton also gave a speech in April on the need to end \xe2\x80\x9cmass incarceration\xe2\x80\x9d\nthat many progressives lauded.\n\n\n\nStill, there\xe2\x80\x99s pressure on lawmakers\xe2\x80\x99 in progressive districts to stay out\nof the endorsement game until later in the election. Grijalva, who\nrepresents the Tucson and Phoenix areas, said liberal voters in his state\nwould question his judgment if he got out early in favor of Clinton.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear more about Sen. Warren than anybody else, people saying that she\nshould be an alternative \xe2\x80\xa6 but if there is any person being talked about\nSecretary Clinton sounding more like, it\xe2\x80\x99s Elizabeth Warren,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were to endorse Hillary Clinton, if someone like Elizabeth Warren was\nin the race, there would be a lot of questions [from progressives.] A lot\nof questions,\xe2\x80\x9d Grijalva added.\n\n\n\nTo be sure, many progressives have already endorsed Clinton. Rep. Karen\nBass (D-Calif.), a member of the Progressive Caucus, tweeted her\nendorsement in the days after Clinton announced. And Rep. David Cicilline\n(D-R.I.) said at the time of the announcement that he \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t wait\xe2\x80\x9d to see\nher elected to the White House.\n\n\n\nBut the majority of the Progressive Caucus isn\xe2\x80\x99t ready to jump on board\nyet. And congressional sources say that while endorsements are inevitable\nfor Clinton, progressives want to see her work to woo them first,\nespecially when one of their own, Sanders, has jumped into the race.\n\n\n\nEven senior leaders in the Democratic Party haven\xe2\x80\x99t given Clinton their\nformal nod. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who helped recruit then-Sen.\nObama to challenge Clinton in 2008, was asked about the 2016 Democratic\nfield during an interview earlier this month on MSNBC.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a few friends out there,\xe2\x80\x9d Reid said. But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t offer an\nendorsement of Clinton and touted the benefits of a competitive primary.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody \xe2\x80\x94 everybody knows I love the Clintons,\xe2\x80\x9d Reid said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nneed to say more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelsoi hasn\xe2\x80\x99t formally endorsed Clinton,\neither. She said in January that Clinton would likely win the general\nelection if nominated, even though the party isn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cdevoid of other voices.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, your question was, do I believe she\xe2\x80\x99s the presumed nominee and will\nshe win if she runs,\xe2\x80\x9d Pelosi said at the time. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the secretary runs, I\nbelieve that she will win and she will be one of the best-prepared people\nto enter the White House in a long time in terms of her experience and her\nknowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n5 Things You Might Not Know About Hillary Clinton\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/us/politics/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-hillary-clinton.html>\n// NYT // Amy Chozick \xe2\x80\x93 May 19, 2015\n\n\n\nShe is not exactly an open book, though she has written six of them.

It was 1998, and Clinton had\npublished Dear Socks, Dear Buddy, a collection of children\'s letters\naddressed to the first family\'s pets. Svokos became so obsessed with the\nbook, she recalls, that she wrote her own letter\xe2\x80\x94not to Socks the cat or\nBuddy the Labrador, but to Clinton herself. When she got a reply on\nofficial White House stationery with the first lady\'s signature, Svokos was\nthrilled.\n\n\n\nClinton was an early feminist icon for many women of Svokos\'s\ngeneration\xe2\x80\x94long before they even began to think of themselves as feminists.\nSvokos, who\'s now 23 and a fellow at The Huffington Post, grew up with\nparents who called themselves feminists and practiced gender equality in\nthe house, balancing household responsibilities and encouraging Svokos and\nher two sisters to "fight for what we deserved." Mostly, she says, feminism\nmeant "girl power" to her\xe2\x80\x94and that meant, in turn, rooting for Clinton when\nshe made her first run for the presidency in 2008. Svokos was in high\nschool then, and her ideas about feminism were still pretty simple; she\nadmired Clinton "because she was a woman, rather than knowing much about\nwhat she stood for."\n\n\n\nEight years later, Svokos\'s notion of feminism has evolved\xe2\x80\x94and the prospect\nof Hillary Clinton becoming president no longer fills her with unbridled\nexcitement. Svokos says her ideas about feminism began to change when she\nstudied economics at Columbia University, beginning in 2010. As she learned\nabout economic inequality in the United States and around the world, she\nsays, she began to see how gender, race, and class were intertwined\xe2\x80\x94how,\nfor instance, expanding access to birth control can stimulate an economy by\nenabling women to pursue their own careers.\n\n\n\nFeminism came to mean something very different from girl power. And Hillary\nClinton came to look like the symbol of an older generation of women more\nconcerned with female empowerment\xe2\x80\x94in particular, with white, middle-class,\nAmerican female empowerment\xe2\x80\x94than with broader issues of social and economic\njustice. Svokos says she\'ll vote for Clinton in 2016, but she\'s not\nexpecting her to make social justice and inequality true priorities if she\nmakes it to the White House. "I find her lacking, in that I realize she\'s\nnot likely to push for the kind of change I\'d like to see," Svokos says.\n"At the same time, though, I believe she knows how to manage politics and\nwill be more than capable in the position."\n\n\n\nAmong feminists of her generation, Svokos is hardly alone in her lukewarm\nfeelings about Hillary Clinton\'s presidential bid. I recently interviewed\n47 young women, most in their early to mid-20s, who call themselves\nfeminists; they talked about what feminism means to them and shared their\nthoughts about Clinton\'s candidacy and public image. While the overwhelming\nmajority of these women said they would likely vote for her in 2016, only\nabout a quarter of them were enthusiastic or emphatic in their support.\nJennifer Schaffer, a 22-year-old weekend editor at Vice, summed up a common\nsentiment among these women: "I\'m glad we have a female presidential\ncandidate," she told me, "but it\'s incredibly difficult to get excited\nabout something that should have happened decades ago." A vote for Clinton,\nmany said, would be a vote by default, because no other viable progressive\nalternatives\xe2\x80\x94female or male\xe2\x80\x94are in the offing.\n\n\n\nWhile it\'s not exactly news that Clinton is a less-than-ideal candidate for\nmany on the Left, the critique of her from those on the vanguard of\ncontemporary feminism is more surprising\xe2\x80\x94and potentially problematic for\nher presidential effort. To win in 2016, Clinton doesn\'t just need\nhalf-hearted support from young women; she needs them to be a base of her\ngrassroots efforts, as fired up as young people were for Barack Obama in\n2008 and 2012. But even as more and more young women are embracing the\n"feminist" label\xe2\x80\x94with pop-culture icons like Beyonc\xc3\xa9 making it central to\ntheir public personas\xe2\x80\x94the feminism that Clinton represents seems\nincreasingly outmoded. While her campaign banks on young feminists like\nSvokos and Schaffer being "Ready for Hillary," these women say they\'re\nready for more.\n\n\n\nHILLARY CLINTON came of age during the peak years of second-wave feminism.\nThe first wave began in the mid-1800s, with women\'s suffrage as the goal;\nthe second stretched from the 1960s to the early 1980s, and focused on\nreproductive and workplace rights. Writer and activist Betty Friedan is\nusually credited with catalyzing the second wave with The Feminine\nMystique. Published in 1963, the landmark book called for women\'s\nliberation from housework, with Friedan famously writing: "We can no longer\nignore that voice within women that says: \'I want something more than my\nhusband and my children and my house.\' "\n\n\n\nAs the feminism of Friedan and second-wave stalwarts like Gloria Steinem\nmoved into the mainstream, some began to criticize it as a movement\ntailored to white women of means. Who, they asked, would clean the homes\nand care for the children of Friedan\'s liberated middle-class housewives?\nWhere was their liberation? Such questions fed into a larger critique of\nsecond-wave feminism: that it saw white American women\'s concerns as\nrepresenting those of all women.\n\n\n\nIn 1989, a term emerged for a feminist philosophy that would include women\nof color and other marginalized groups: "intersectionality." To the\nuninitiated, the word might sound like unwieldy academic jargon. But\nwithout my bringing it up, many of the women I spoke to said\nintersectionality was the foundation of their feminism\xe2\x80\x94and of their\nskepticism about Clinton. First coined by legal scholar and professor\nKimberl\xc3\xa9 Crenshaw, the word refers to the connections (the "intersections")\nbetween different systems of oppression\xe2\x80\x94not just sexism, but also racism,\nhomophobia, transphobia, and classism. It\'s a recognition that a black\nwoman, for instance, is not affected independently by racism and\nsexism\xe2\x80\x94those forms of discrimination are inextricably linked, which makes\nher experience sexism differently from a white woman and racism differently\nfrom a black man.\n\n\n\nThe concept itself was far from new; it stretched as far back, at least, as\nSojourner Truth\'s famous "Ain\'t I a Woman?" speech in 1851, in which she\nhighlighted the dramatic differences between the ways black and white women\nexperience sexism. "That man over there says that women need to be helped\ninto carriages and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place\neverywhere," Truth said. "Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over\nmud-puddles, or gives me any best place! And ain\'t I a woman?"\n\n\n\nNow the idea had a name. But in the 1990s, as intersectionality was gaining\npopularity in academic circles, Hillary Clinton was bringing her own, more\ntraditional brand of feminism to her role as first lady. Her domestic\ninitiatives included adoption, foster care, and child care. In 1995,\nClinton gave her famous Beijing speech to the United Nations\' Fourth World\nConference on Women, declaring that "women\'s rights are human rights." She\nhelped to form the Justice Department\'s Violence Against Women Office and\npartnered with then\xe2\x80\x93Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to found the\nVital Voices Democracy Initiative, a series of conferences devoted to\npromoting female leaders and involving women around the globe in politics.\n\n\n\nIn the early and mid-2000s, after she left the White House and took up\nresidence in the U.S. Senate, Clinton largely shifted away from a\nwomen-centered agenda as she worked to bolster her presidential r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9. At\nthe same time, young bloggers like Lauren Bruce (Feministe) and Jessica\nValenti (Feministing) were bringing feminist theory out of the Ivory Tower.\n"Each month seemed to bring a new site with feminist content," Rebecca\nTraister writes in her 2010 book, Big Girls Don\'t Cry. "At various points\nthere were about six sites calling themselves The F-Word."\n\n\n\nSocial media changed the landscape of feminism. Young women who might not\nlearn about feminism in their schools or communities could find primers on\nTumblr blogs with names like intersectional feminism 101. Their feminist\nawakenings thus involved, from the start, debates about second-wave\nfeminism\'s perceived failures of inclusivity. "Anyone who entered the\nfeminist conversation in the Internet age has immediate access to not only\nresearch about those failures, but also to a lot of the conversations about\nthem," says feminist organizer and writer Shelby Knox, who\'s 28. "The\nbarriers are a lot lower for participation in the movement."\n\n\n\nYoung women could now do more than read about feminist issues and discuss\nthem in class; they could find communities of women on Twitter or Tumblr\nwhose experiences they could relate to\xe2\x80\x94or who could open up new vistas for\nthem on what other women\'s lives are like. They could participate in the\ncreation of a new feminism\xe2\x80\x94one that would be a far cry from Friedan\'s. By\n2011, the writer Flavia Dzodan was famously declaring on her blog: "My\nfeminism will be intersectional or it will be bullshit." Her words became a\nrallying cry.\n\n\n\nAs young women\'s notions of feminism evolved and broadened, so did their\nidea of what constitutes "women\'s issues" in the political arena. "If\nyou\'re taking intersectionality as the foundation of this kind of feminism,\nyou wouldn\'t just be concerned with how any particular policy issue is\naffecting women," says Gwendolyn Beetham, director of the Global Village at\nDouglass Residential College, the women\'s residential college affiliated\nwith Rutgers University. "But you would be asking, \'Which women, and how?\'\nAnd you would be asking this whether or not you are a member of one of\nthose groups."\n\n\n\nTo young women like Sylvie Edman, a 20-year-old student at the University\nof Massachusetts, Amherst, Clinton embodies "corporate feminism," which\nEdman defines concisely: "It\'s empowering women who are already powerful."\nClinton and Sheryl Sandberg, the Facebook COO and author of Lean In, are\noften name-dropped in this context; while they experience sexism, the\nthinking goes, they\'ve been able to dare greatly because of their race and\nclass\xe2\x80\x94while being helped along the way by working-class women and women of\ncolor who didn\'t have the same opportunities.\n\n\n\nSome of the concerns raised by the women I spoke to about Clinton were\ntraditional "women\'s issues" like reproductive justice and equal pay. But\njust as many brought up police brutality, criminal-justice reform, and\nenvironmental issues as primary concerns\xe2\x80\x94and as integral to what they mean\nby "feminism." Some of the most commonly expressed critiques of Clinton\nechoed those of many left-of-center Americans: She\'s "hawkish" on foreign\naffairs, "part of a political dynasty," and simply "not very progressive."\nCollier Meyerson, who writes for the website Fusion, told me that her ideal\ncandidate "wouldn\'t be part of a legacy, and wouldn\'t be a career\npolitician." A candidate more like Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x94"somebody who is rooted\nmore in community-organizing"\xe2\x80\x94would fit the bill better, Meyerson says.\n\n\n\nAyesha Siddiqi, the 24-year-old editor-in-chief of the online magazine The\nNew Inquiry, says that this range of concerns should be no surprise.\n"Feminist issues," she says, "are no more complicated than the issues of\npeople\'s lives." But that philosophy makes young women\'s views of\nClinton\xe2\x80\x94and her campaign\'s efforts to galvanize them behind her\xe2\x80\x94very\ncomplicated indeed.\n\n\n\nAT THE ANNUAL Women in the World Summit in New York this April, Sam\nViqueira stuck out from the crowd. The summit, a high-powered gathering of\nleaders and activists launched by former New Yorker and Daily Beast editor\nTina Brown in 2010, this year featured a keynote address by Hillary\nClinton. Most of the women in attendance looked like Clinton\'s crowd, her\ngeneration: Dressed business casual, the mostly middle-aged women flocked\nto the free coffee and Luna bars on offer, chatted in small groups, and\nsnapped selfies in front of a Dove-sponsored backdrop. The 17-year-old\nViqueira and her high school friend stood off to the side in a small\nlounge, looking like they were dressed for a regular day of school. They\'d\ntaken the train in from Maplewood, New Jersey. "To me, feminism isn\'t only\nabout wanting equality for all genders," Viqueira told me later, "but\nwanting and advocating for the equality of all oppressed groups, which can\nand do intersect."\n\n\n\nIn some respects, Viqueira exemplifies the rising generation of\nfeminists\xe2\x80\x94and their conflicted feelings about Clinton. She grew up with\nthree sisters and parents who were big on women\'s empowerment, encouraging\nthe girls to play sports and study math and science. But she credits social\nmedia with teaching her about the intersection of race and gender, and the\nissues women face outside of the United States; she first read the term\n"intersectionality" online when she was just 15 and now follows a lot of\nyoung women on Twitter who help broaden her perspective.\n\n\n\nThis spring, she\'s taking the first gender-studies class ever offered at\nher public high school. Next fall, Viqueira will be old enough to cast her\nfirst vote. That has led her, like so many other young feminists, to think\nlong and hard about what Clinton would\xe2\x80\x94and wouldn\'t\xe2\x80\x94represent as the first\nwoman president. "It\'s nice to see a strong female candidate running for\npresident," Viqueira says, but she can\'t help wishing it were a woman with\na different track record. She\'s particularly troubled by Clinton\'s support\nof the 1996 welfare-reform bill her husband signed and of the Clinton-era\ncrime-fighting legislation that, among other things, lengthened prison\nsentences for drug offenses. At best, she says, Clinton has been\ninconsistent on social-justice issues; at worst, she has been a hypocrite.\n\n\n\nWhile Viqueira is hesitant to say she\'ll vote for Clinton, she acknowledges\nthat the limited options for progressive-minded voters will probably push\nher in that direction. But it bothers her to see Clinton held up as a model\nfeminist: "I think it\'s problematic to assume that just because she\'s a\nwoman, she\'s the best spokesperson for all women."\n\n\n\nClinton\'s first presidential campaign relied heavily on that assumption. An\ninternal campaign memo from March 2007, written by the campaign\'s chief\nstrategist and pollster, Mark Penn, and published in The Atlantic the\nfollowing year, advised Clinton thusly:\n\n\n\n1) Start with a base of women.\n\na. For these women, you represent a breaking of barriers.\n\nb. The winnowing out of the most competent and qualified in an unfair,\nmale-dominated world.\n\nc. The infusion of a woman and a mother\'s sensibilities into a world of war\nand neglect.\n\n\n\n2) Add on a base of lower- and middle-class voters.\n\na. You see them; you care about them.\n\nb. You were one of them, it is your  history.\n\nc. You are all about their concerns (health care, education, energy, child\ncare, college, etc.).\n\n\n\nFor young feminists, Penn\'s memo, and Clinton\'s campaign, represented the\nantithesis of intersectional thinking. The problem isn\'t merely the\nassumption that women would be Clinton\'s primary base because of their\ngender alone; it\'s also the fact that lower- and middle-class voters are\nitemized as a separate group, with a different (and far more specific) set\nof concerns from those of "women." "With strategies like this," Traister\nwrites, "it was not unjust to suggest that one serious problem with the\nClinton campaign leadership was that it did not think much of the women\nwith whom it was supposed to be making history." Traister notes that "Penn\nassured Hillary that internal polling showed that 94% of young women would\nautomatically vote for the first female president. It was perhaps this\nconfidence that led him to shrug off concerns about reaching them." In the\nend, according to a CBS News poll, Penn\'s initial estimates were way off:\n53 percent of young women backed Obama over Clinton.\n\n\n\nFar from a high-water mark for feminism, Siddiqi, The New Inquiry editor,\nsees Clinton\'s presidential campaigns as "the nadir of the \'Lean In\'\nfeminism moment. This is what you get when that\'s what your feminism looks\nlike," she says. "You don\'t get a victory that all women can celebrate."\n\n\n\nOF COURSE, plenty of young women will be celebrating next November if\nHillary Clinton wins the presidency\xe2\x80\x94including some who see themselves\nrooted in "intersectionality." Gabriel Clarke, a 20-year-old musician and\nstudent at Oakwood University in Alabama, says she had a wake-up moment\nduring protests over the shooting of Michael Brown last summer in Ferguson,\nMissouri. "A young woman grabbed the microphone and said, \'I am a woman,\nbut before I am a woman, I am black.\' And I was thinking, that\'s not how we\nhave to look at these things. That\'s not how we have to be. We have to\nunderstand that we are both of those things simultaneously."\n\n\n\nWomen of color like herself have long been "on the back burner in the\nmovement," Clarke says. It\'s a welcome change that "people are starting to\nsee that you can\'t have a social movement about equality and leave out\neveryone else who\'s not a white woman." But intersectional thinking hasn\'t\ndimmed her passion for electing Clinton. The first time Clinton ran, Clarke\nwas just 13. She had a hard time taking the candidate seriously, she says,\nbecause of the media\'s relentless focus on her hair, clothes, and manner of\nspeaking. But the summer before Clarke went off to college in 2013, her\nimpression was changed by watching the documentary Miss Representation,\nwhich shines a critical light on the way women leaders are portrayed by the\nmedia. "It really opened my eyes and made me see Hillary in a totally\ndifferent way," Clarke says. "They talked more about her pantsuits than her\npolicies!"\n\n\n\nLike most of the one-quarter of these young women who told me they\'re gung\nho for Clinton, Clarke cites the candidate\'s extensive experience\xe2\x80\x94the same\nexperience others use to knock her as a "career politician"\xe2\x80\x94as a prime\nfactor in her support. Clinton, says Clarke, is obviously the\nmost-qualified candidate in the race. "But that\'s the story of being a\nwoman," she says. "You have to be ten times better than everyone else to\neven get your foot in the door." Clarke realizes that many feminists of\ncolor are "very skeptical" of Clinton, wondering "whether she will really\nbe a champion or a voice for them, or only for white women"\xe2\x80\x94and she gets\nthe skepticism. But to her, there\'s something more fundamental at stake: "I\nthink that even her as a symbol for women, that a woman can be president,\nis powerful enough."\n\n\n\nThis time around, the Clinton campaign isn\'t taking that kind of solidarity\nfor granted. Young feminists\' social and economic views may have been\noverlooked in 2008, but in the early stages of Clinton\'s second run,\nthey\'ve been front and center. You could hear it in her keynote at the\nWomen in the World Summit, where Clinton talked about inequities in what\nwomen are paid, taking care to note the "even wider gaps for women of\ncolor." You could hear it in another speech she recently gave in New York\ncalling for police reform and in her frequent invocations of income\ninequality. "Americans have fought their way back from tough economic\ntimes," Clinton said in the April video announcing her campaign. "But the\ndeck is still stacked in favor of those at the top."\n\n\n\nSuch talk is welcomed by Clinton skeptics like Viqueira, the 17-year-old,\nwho sees the candidate "redefining her feminism to be all-inclusive."\nCollier Meyerson says that Clinton\'s announcement video\xe2\x80\x94which, as pundits\nnoted, took pains to feature just about every group of "marginalized"\npeople in America\xe2\x80\x94was a clear attempt to reach people ignored during her\n2008 campaign. "My hope is that she continues with this thread," Meyerson\nsays, "and goes on to pull in people from different socioeconomic classes,\nbackgrounds, and races."\n\n\n\nBy and large, these women say they\'ll need to see more evidence of\nClinton\'s new inclusiveness before their ambivalent support morphs into\nenthusiasm. "So far, she\'s hit on a lot of the things I\'m passionate\nabout," says Laura Brown, a 26-year-old fashion designer and seamstress in\nLos Angeles. "I want to see her prove it. I want to know it\'s genuine and\nnot just part of the game."\n\n\n\nOTHER DEMOCRATS NATIONAL COVERAGE\n\n\n\nWhy Not Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley?\n<http://harvardpolitics.com/united-states/martin-omalley/> // Harvard\nPolitical Review // Quinn Mulholland - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nOn April 10, Elizabeth Warren joined Jon Stewart on the Daily Show and\ndeclared, \xe2\x80\x9cPowerful corporations [and] rich people have figured out that if\nyou can bend the government to help you just a little bit, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\ntremendous payoff, and if you can bend it to help you just a little bit\nmore and a little bit more, the playing field just gets more and more\ntilted, and the rich and the powerful just do better and better.\xe2\x80\x9d A week\nlater, Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley stood before a packed crowd at Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s Institute\nof Politics and proclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cConcentrated wealth has accumulated\nconcentrated political power in the halls of our Congress, and also in\nmany, many, many of our state houses, making it harder than ever to get\nthings done.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBoth of these quotes are emblematic of a nascent populist movement in the\nDemocratic Party. Both reflect a deep concern that all Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have\nan equal shot at prosperity. Both demonstrate a growing opposition to the\ncentrist Democratic policies of the Clinton era\xe2\x80\x94the trade policies and the\nwelfare reform\xe2\x80\x94that seemed to mostly benefit the wealthiest Americans.\n\n\n\nYet it is Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, not Elizabeth Warren, who has a proven record of\naccomplishing real progress on these issues on a state level. It is Martin\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley, not Elizabeth Warren, who became the first major Democratic\npolitician to endorse a national $15 minimum wage at the Institute of\nPolitics on Thursday. And it is Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, not Elizabeth Warren, who\nis seriously considering challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic\nnomination for president in 2016.\n\n\n\nSo why have political pundits come to the consensus that Elizabeth Warren\nis the only one who could give Hillary a run for her money in the\nDemocratic primary? Perhaps it is O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s lack of name recognition. He\nis currently polling at around 0.3 percent in the Iowa Democratic Caucus,\ncompared to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 58 percent, and Warren\xe2\x80\x99s 17 percent. But that number\nis increasing, and O\xe2\x80\x99Malley received a warm reception in recent trips to\nNew Hampshire and Iowa.\n\n\n\nPerhaps it is because O\xe2\x80\x99Malley is not a woman. While a first female\npresident would certainly be a symbolic victory for women, it is unclear\nthat a Clinton presidency would produce many tangible benefits for women.\nIn fact, in terms of policy, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley seems to have proposed just as many,\nif not more, policies to help women as Clinton has. At the Harvard\nInstitute of Politics, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley declared, \xe2\x80\x9cWe must recognize that policies\nthat are good for women and families, like paid leave and safe and\naffordable child care, are also good for our national economy, and for\neconomic growth, because when women succeed, our American economy also\nsucceeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley also proclaimed his support for a federal $15 minimum wage, which\nwould give a much-needed raise to the 3 million Americans who work at or\nbelow minimum wage, 62 percent of whom are women. Clinton has voiced her\nsupport for fast food workers striking for a higher wage, but she has yet\nto establish how much of an increase in the minimum wage she would support.\nDespite his gender, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley could be the candidate that would make the\nbiggest difference for women.\n\n\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s possible candidacy seems to already be pushing Clinton towards\nthe left. She recently declared her support for a Supreme Court decision\nguaranteeing the right to gay marriage nationwide, which she previously\nthought should be dealt with on a \xe2\x80\x9cstate by state\xe2\x80\x9d basis, and she switched\nher position on driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses for undocumented immigrants. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\nchided Clinton for these flip-flops, telling the HPR at a press conference,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad Secretary Clinton has come around to the right position on these\nissues \xe2\x80\xa6 I believe that we are best as a party when we lead according to\nour principles, and not according to the polls.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nYet Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign has challenged the notion that she is a newcomer to\nthe populist themes her candidacy is centered around. Close friends and\nadvisers insist that she has championed populist causes long before\nElizabeth Warren or Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley ascended to the national stage. Even\nso, there is no denying her many ties to Wall Street, which make it hard\nfor statements like \xe2\x80\x9cthe deck is still stacked in favor of those at the\ntop\xe2\x80\x9d to ring genuine.\n\n\n\nClinton will be nowhere near as \xe2\x80\x9cinevitable\xe2\x80\x9d in the general presidential\nelection as she was in the Democratic primary, assuming\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\nprematurely\xe2\x80\x94that she wins it. She will have to face voters on the left\nconcerned with her ties to Wall Street and her flip-flopping on gay\nmarriage and immigration, as well as voters on the right who will have been\ninundated with anti-Hillary attacks for months. Perhaps America is ready\nfor a genuinely populist Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley campaign. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley certainly\nappears to be ready.\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders Wants to Be President, but He\xe2\x80\x99s Already Facebook Royalty\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/us/politics/bernie-sanders-wants-to-be-president-but-hes-already-facebook-royalty.html>\n// NYT // Nick Corasaniti - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 The quotes he posts are rarely pithy, and often sayings he\nthinks up in the shower. The photographs he puts up sometimes show him\nfrowning, while others show him gazing oddly into the horizon. And he does\nnot seem to care about the importance of videos.\n\n\n\nBut somehow, Bernie Sanders, the 73-year-old senator from Vermont, has\nemerged as a king of social media early in the 2016 presidential campaign,\namid a field of tech-savvy contenders.\n\n\n\nHis Facebook posts attract tens of thousands of likes and shares, and\nthreads about him often break through to the home page of Reddit, where the\ncluster of topics rarely focuses on presidential election politics.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a grumpy old guy,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sanders joked when explaining his approach to\nposting online. \xe2\x80\x9cI know that people talk about their cats and \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m walking\nto the grocery story and getting a can of chicken soup\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98this is so\nexciting.\xe2\x80\x99 By and large, we have not done that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s prominence online is all the more improbable given that he\ndoes not do many things the way social media experts say they should be\ndone.\n\n\n\nHe has not shied away from posts of 300 words or more, with a \xe2\x80\x9ccontinue\nreading here\xe2\x80\x9d link to his personal website.\n\n\n\nMr. Sanders, an independent who describes himself as a socialist, has stuck\nto an idiosyncratic method: posting images that share a quote, which he has\neither written himself or dug up from a historical figure and then burned\nonto a photograph. (President Theodore Roosevelt and President Dwight D.\nEisenhower are among those he has recently cited.)\n\n\n\nSocial networking sites like Facebook recommend that when users post text,\nthey do so with searchable words that would be attractive to newsfeed\nalgorithms and search engines.\n\n\n\nBut Mr. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s team rarely uses buzzy introductory text when sharing his\nposts, leaving the chances of their going viral to users who stumble upon\nthem. Fortunately for Mr. Sanders, who is seeking the Democratic\nnomination, he has loyal followers who somehow always know how to find his\nlatest musing.\n\n\n\nTake, for example, a block quote advocating making Election Day a national\nholiday. The quote is posted atop a stock photo of ballot boxes. And it\ncontains no searchable text. Still, it received nearly 100,000 likes and\n22,000 shares. By comparison, Hillary Rodham Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s video announcing her\npresidential candidacy received over 79,000 likes and 41,000 shares.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can post a quote graphic or a long text-only Facebook status, and it\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter what the algorithm favors,\xe2\x80\x9d said Laura Olin, who was\nin charge of the much-praised social media strategy for President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\n2012 campaign.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it sounds like him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9chis people will find it and spread it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd the reason Bernie Sanders posts sounds like him is that, for the most\npart, they are from Bernie Sanders. He often comes to his Senate office\nwith quotes at the ready.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUsually, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the shower where something pops into my head,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\nSanders said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cI play a very, very active role in writing,\nliterally writing, what goes up there on Facebook.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd unlike many candidates, he does not share warm details of his daily\nlife. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t need to know what I buy in the grocery store or what\nthe name of my dog is \xe2\x80\x94 I don\xe2\x80\x99t own a dog, by the way \xe2\x80\x94 but they do need to\nknow why billionaires are getting richer and the poor getting poorer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA former journalist who began sending newsletters to his constituents in\nthe early 1990s, Mr. Sanders relishes writing. He carries yellow legal pads\nwith him wherever he goes, \xe2\x80\x9cfor a little jabbering,\xe2\x80\x9d and their contents are\noften turned verbatim into a posting.\n\n\n\nA typical quote from him on his Facebook page, which often deals with\nincome inequality, says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe must rebuild American manufacturing and\nrewrite our trade agreements so that our largest export is not our jobs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the people that have the most success on Facebook, they\xe2\x80\x99re\ndeveloping an authentic method and sticking to it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anton Vuljaj,\ndirector of advertising at IMGE, a consulting firm. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s matching what\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s saying online to what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing offline.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhile Mr. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s popularity cuts across social media platforms, it\nappears most pronounced on Facebook. He did not start his campaign with a\nbig announcement event, and he did not enjoy the explosion of interest that\nSenator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky experienced\nwhen they declared that they were seeking the Republican nomination.\n\n\n\nMr. Sanders had 1.3 million Facebook interactions, compared with 5.6\nmillion for Mr. Cruz and two million for Mr. Paul, according to data\nprovided by Facebook.\n\n\n\nBut since their announcements, the popularity of Mr. Cruz and Mr. Paul on\nFacebook has tempered, while Mr. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s has risen. In a seven-day\nstretch leading up to May 3, Mr. Sanders had 5.3 million interactions,\ncompared with 1.2 million for Mr. Paul and 1.7 million for Mr. Cruz.\n\n\n\nOn Reddit, he is similarly popular. The site\xe2\x80\x99s home page, which is powered\nby the so-called upvotes of users on a topic thread, is often filled with\nviral news and esoteric, humorous discussions; politics is often found only\non a subreddit. But Mr. Sanders is one elected official who has on occasion\nleapt over the barrier.\n\n\n\nAmong politicians, he is one of the most frequent posters to the site, and\nnearly a quarter of the top most-voted politics posts of all time on Reddit\nare about or by Mr. Sanders.\n\n\n\nBut Mr. Sanders has not eclipsed everyone else in the 2016 field on the\nsocial media front.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) issued a report Monday\nmorning detailing decades of failed trade enforcement by American\npresidents including Barack Obama, the latest salvo in an ongoing public\nfeud between Warren and Obama over the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\n\n\nObama is currently negotiating the major trade pact with 11 other nations.\nWhile the text of the TPP agreement remains classified information, it is\nstrongly supported by Republican leaders in Congress and corporate lobbying\ngroups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The deal is opposed by most\ncongressional Democrats, along with labor unions, environmental groups and\nadvocates of Internet freedom.\n\n\n\nObama has repeatedly insisted the TPP will include robust labor\nprotections, and has dismissed Warren\'s criticisms as "dishonest," "bunk"\nand "misinformation." On Monday, Warren fired back, showing that Obama\nsimply has not effectively enforced existing labor standards in prior trade\npacts. According to the report, a host of abuses, from child labor to the\noutright murder of union organizers, have continued under Obama\'s watch\nwith minimal pushback from the administration.\n\n\n\n"The United States does not enforce the labor protections in its trade\nagreements," the report reads, citing analyses from the Government\nAccountability Office, the State Department and the Department of Labor.\n\n\n\nOf the 20 countries the U.S. currently has trade agreements with, 11 have\ndocumented reliance on child labor, forced labor or other human rights\nabuses related to labor, according to the report. The violations are not\nconfined to exploitation. Since Obama finalized a labor action plan with\nthe government of Colombia in 2011, 105 union activists have been murdered.\nObama called the Colombian deal "a win-win for workers" at the time.\n\n\n\nDespite these trade violations, none of these countries have faced\nsignificant consequences from the United States government.\n\n\n\nWarren\'s report undercuts an Obama public relations offensive that has\nrepeatedly characterized TPP as "the most progressive trade deal in\nhistory." The Senate is currently considering legislation that would grant\nObama "fast track" authority, barring Congress from amending any trade pact\nhe negotiates, including TPP. Liberals are concerned TPP will exacerbate\nincome inequality and undermine key regulations.\n\n\n\nBut while much of the TPP controversy has concerned the legal language\ninvolved in the agreement itself, Warren\'s report highlights a broader\nconcern among progressives. Regardless of what the final TPP deal looks\nlike, presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama himself, have all\nfailed to effectively enforce promises to protect workers, even as rogue\nregimes have continued to benefit from other provisions of the agreements.\n\n\n\n"We have two decades of experience with free trade agreements under both\nDemocratic and Republican Presidents. Supporters of these agreements have\nalways promised that they contain tough standards to protect workers," the\nreport reads. "The rhetoric has not matched the reality."\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration has said it takes labor violations seriously and\nhas pushed countries to improve conditions.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Obama Administration is taking unprecedented actions to promote and\nprotect fundamental labor rights and ensure acceptable conditions of work,\xe2\x80\x9d\nreads a joint report from the Department of Labor and the Office of the\nU.S. Trade Representative from February. Those commitments include\n\xe2\x80\x9cbringing the first-ever labor dispute under a free trade agreement"-- in\nGuatemala.\n\n\n\nBut labor unions and other critics say these measures have been\nineffective. The AFL-CIO has been pressing for action on Guatemalan\nviolations for Obama\xe2\x80\x99s entire term in office, and the dispute remains\nunresolved. Meanwhile, as Warren\'s report documents, Guatemala remains one\nof the most dangerous places in the world for union workers. In 2013 and\n2014, according to the AFL-CIO, 17 labor activists were murdered in\nGuatemala while the Obama administration pursued diplomatic action. Three\nof the slain union workers were reportedly killed during a dispute with a\nlocal government over unpaid back wages.\n\n\n\nMuch of Warren\'s trade critique has focused on the capacity for free trade\npacts to undermine financial regulations. Last week, Canadian Finance\nMinister Joe Oliver gave a speech arguing that a key tenet of Obama\'s 2010\nWall Street reform law violates the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\n\n\nSnoop Dogg: I\'ll be voting for Hillary Clinton\n<http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/242435-snoop-dogg-ill-be-voting-for-hillary-clinton>\n// The Hill // Judy Kurtz  - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nSnoop Dogg is high on Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cGin & Juice\xe2\x80\x9c rapper said he\xe2\x80\x99ll be supporting the former secretary of\nState and Democratic candidate in her 2016 White House bid.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I like to be politically correct, but sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99m politically\nincorrect,\xe2\x80\x9d Snoop Dogg said when asked about his political pick on Bravo\xe2\x80\x99s\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatch What Happens Live\xe2\x80\x9d on Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll say that I would love to see\na woman in office because I feel like we\xe2\x80\x99re at that stage in life to where\nwe need a perspective other than the male\xe2\x80\x99s train of thought.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd just to have a woman speaking from a global perspective as far as\nrepresenting America, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to see that.

"I\'ll ask Hillary Clinton, what have you done for\ncriminal justice ... I\'d ask her, what\'s your plan to help poor people in\nPhiladelphia?"\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia has not elected a Republican to the mayor\'s office since 1951;\nno Republican candidate has come particularly close to the top job since\nthe near-miss 1999 run of businessman Sam Katz. The city\'s strong\nDemocratic vote has kept Pennsylvania in the Democrats\' Electoral\nCollege\xe2\x80\x93in 2012, the Obama-Biden ticket\'s 492,339 margin out of the city\noverwhelmed a Romney-Ryan edge from the rest of the state.\n\n\n\nPaul, who spoke first in what the National Constitution Center hopes to be\na series of candidate events, tried to front the issues where he could run\nto Hillary Clinton\'s left. (The crowd, which frequently interrupted Paul\nwith applause, included more than a dozen college-aged volunteers wearing\nshorts and campaign T-shirts.) He retold the story of Christos Sourovelis,\na Philadelphian whose home was briefly seized in a drug raid that targeted\nhis son, and who subsequently found legal representation from the\nlibertarian Institute for Justice.\n\n\n\n"A lot of us don\'t understand it, but a lot of people who are poor live on\nthe edge," said Paul, describing visits to urban centers that had been\n"decimated" by over-incarceration. He walked through the scenario of a poor\nman with $2,000 to his name being shaken down by police over contraband\nthey\'d claimed to have found on him. "The government will sometimes say to\nthe people in the car, we\'ll let you keep a thousand," Paul said. "They\nnegotiate on the side of the road."\n\n\n\nIn a Q&A that included suggestions from the crowd, Paul tried to focus on\nlibertarian-liberal synergy more than traditional conservative politics. He\nquickly dispatched a question about abortion rights, saying laws should be\nleft to the states, averring that he "didn\'t run for office because of this\nissue." (One of Paul\'s first acts as a newly elected senator, in 2011, was\nthe introduction of an amendment that would have defined personhood as\nstarting at conception.) But he talked more about police militarization\nthat he had in some time.\n\n\n\n"I see no reason to have a 20-ton, mine-resistant, ambush-protection\nvehicle in the streets of any country," Paul said. "We\'ve found that a\nthird of this military surplus is brand new... is this some kind of\nchurning? It\'s not a great idea to show up everywhere with a grand military\npresence, like an army."\n\n\n\nPaul also went long on fiscal policy, saying that Amtrak would be better\noff in private hands. "You would think after having commercial railroads\nfor over 100 years, we could do a better job than that," he said, referring\nto last week\'s derailment just miles north of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n"They\'ve lost money every year they\'ve been existent. I\'m looking at the\neasement and thinking, \'Man, we should sell that.\' [Imagine] if we could\nsell that and let a real company put up a fast train."\n\n\n\nRand Paul Vows to Filibuster to Block Patriot Act\n<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/rand-paul-threatens-filibuster-block-anti-terrorism-act-31126707>\n// ABC News // Steve Peoples, Associated Press - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul vowed on Monday to "everything possible" to block\nrenewal of the terrorism-era Patriot Act, but the Republican presidential\nhopeful conceded it may not be enough.\n\n\n\nSpeaking in front of Philadelphia\'s Independence Hall, Paul lashed out at\nthe National Security Agency\'s bulk collection of American citizens\' phone\nrecords, which many in his own party say are needed to prevent terrorism.\n\n\n\n"We will do everything possible \xe2\x80\x94 including filibustering the Patriot Act\nto stop them," Paul said, acknowledging that a filibuster likely wouldn\'t\nbe enough to block the program. "They have the votes inside the Beltway.\nBut we have the votes outside the Beltway, and we\'ll have that fight."\n\n\n\nThe Patriot Act, which authorizes the surveillance program, will expire on\nJune 1 unless Congress acts.\n\n\n\nGovernment surveillance could play prominently in the GOP presidential\nprimary contest, which is heating up just as Congress debates surveillance\nprograms initiated by President George W. Bush\'s administration and\ncontinued under President Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nSupporters of the surveillance law, including presidential candidate Sen.\nMarco Rubio, R-Fla., say it\'s critical to anti-terrorism efforts. Paul and\nfellow Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, see the law as a privacy infringement.\n\n\n\nNeither Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker nor former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has\nyet to take a formal position on the program, although Bush recently\npraised the Obama administration\'s use of big metadata programs that began\nunder Bush\'s older brother, former President George W. Bush.\n\n\n\nPaul has promised to sign an executive order to end such government\nsurveillance programs on his first day in office, should he win the\npresidency.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Paul said he also opposes a House bill that would end the\ngovernment\'s bulk collection of phone records and replace it with a system\nto search the data held by telephone companies on a case-by-case basis.\nPaul said he feared the bill would transfer too much power to phone\ncompanies and could jeopardize a related lawsuit.\n\n\n\nPaul\'s comments on Monday also put him at odds with Senate Majority Leader\nMitch McConnell, who has introduced a separate version that would keep the\nprogram as is.\n\n\n\n"We do not have the votes to ultimately defeat the Patriot Act," he said.\n"I can delay it. I can force them to debate it so the public at large can\nknow what they\'re doing."\n\n\n\nR\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyward/rand-paul-cites-questionable-benghazi-reporting-in-forthcomi?utm_term=.qfEqY1mRY#.mr5QZ4DYx>and\nPaul Cites Questionable Benghazi Reporting In Forthcoming Book\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyward/rand-paul-cites-questionable-benghazi-reporting-in-forthcomi?utm_term=.qfEqY1mRY#.mr5QZ4DYx>\n// Buzzfeed News // Molly Ward \xe2\x80\x93 May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Rand Paul cites information that has been\ndisputed or found to be baseless by the House Select Intelligence Committee\nabout the 2012 Benghazi attack in his new book Making a Stand: Moving\nBeyond Partisan Politics to Unite America.\n\n\n\nIn a chapter titled \xe2\x80\x9cLibya: A Jihadist Wonderland,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul writes at length\nabout the attack on the Benghazi compound and the ensuing political debate\nover who is responsible for the tragic events.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA story in Forbes magazine said that President Obama, Defense Secretary\nLeon Panetta, and other high-ranking officials watched a live video feed of\nthe attack from a drone that hovered overhead, and did nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul\nwrites. \xe2\x80\x9cThe White House denied that gathering ever happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe Forbes piece Paul cites, written by opinion contributor Larry Bell,\nincludes the same claim.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust one hour after the seven-hour-long terrorist attacks upon the U.S.\nconsulate in Benghazi began, our commander-in-chief, vice president,\nsecretary of defense and their national security team gathered together in\nthe Oval Office listening to phone calls from American defenders\ndesperately under siege and watching real-time video of developments from a\ndrone circling over the site,\xe2\x80\x9d Bell writes. \xe2\x80\x9cYet they sent no military aid\nthat might have intervened in time to save lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nReporting from CBS News cited by Bell states only that a real-time audio\nfeed of the attack was monitored by a diplomatic security official in\nWashington at the time. While the attack was captured on security cameras\nat the compound, the footage was only recovered 20 days later.\n\n\n\nThe Daily Beast reported that there was also footage of the attacks taken\nby a U.S. surveillance drone, but there is no reporting to suggest that it\nbroadcast live.\n\nPaul also writes, \xe2\x80\x9cAnother report stated that the embassy made three urgent\nrequests for military back up during those hours and were denied. The\nadministration refuted that report also.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThat statement was also featured in an article by Bell another piece by\nBell, in which he cites reporting by Fox News that two Navy Seals \xe2\x80\x9cwere\nordered to stand down three times following calls during the attack.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe report on the Benghazi attack released by the Republican-led House\nSelect Intelligence Committee later found that there was no evidence \xe2\x80\x9cthat\nthere was either a stand down order or a denial of available air support.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPaul cites an article by Seymour Hersh in the London Review of Books, in\nwhich he reported that the CIA annex also attacked that night was part of\nan operation to ship guns through Turkey into Syria to assist in arming the\nSyrian rebels.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine, should there be any legitimacy to the reports, that\nthe Secretary of State would be kept out of such a loop,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul writes. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\nthe gunrunning operation in Benghazi existed, then Mrs. Clinton and the\nvery upper reaches of our government had to be aware and perhaps even\ncomplicit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe House Select Intelligence report on the attack \xe2\x80\x9cfound no evidence that\nthe CIA conducted unauthorized activities in Benghazi and no evidence that\nthe IC [Intelligence Community] shipped arms to Syria.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAn aide to Paul\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign said the senator noted the two\nallegations from Bell\xe2\x80\x99s Forbes articles in an attempt to lay out the\nnarrative following the event.\n\nIn addition, the aide noted that reports on documents released on Monday by\nthe conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch provide support for Hersh\xe2\x80\x99s\ngunrunning story ahead of the attack.\n\n\n\nWhy We Must Reform the VA\n<https://medium.com/@JebBush/why-we-must-reform-the-va-8eb7e1dc2b3b> //\nMedium // Jeb Bush \xe2\x80\x93 May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nWhen veterans come home and leave active service, we have a duty to provide\ncare for them for the rest of their lives. This is an obligation we hold\ndear, as President Lincoln made clear in his Second Inaugural: \xe2\x80\x9cWith the\nfirmness in the right as God sees us to give to see the right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\n\xe2\x80\x9clet us\xe2\x80\xa6 care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow,\nand his orphan.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the recent scandals at the Department of Veterans Affairs\ndemonstrate that some in Washington do not take this responsibility\nseriously. Americans are rightly upset.\n\n\n\nA new report out last week showed that every year there was about $6\nbillion in waste, fraud, and abuse in our VA. This has been a systemic\nproblem. Last year, in Phoenix, a whistleblower came forward to show that\nwhile the facility publicly reported on-time delivery of care, in\nactuality, veterans were made to wait on a secret wait list to see doctors.\n\n\n\nOne such veteran was Thomas Breen, who had served in the United States\nNavy. He was so proud of his service, he would only seek treatment at one\nof the VA\xe2\x80\x99s hospitals. After spotting blood in his urine in the fall of\n2013, Thomas was seen by the Phoenix VA hospital and then released to be\nseen at a later date. The wait list for an appointment was months long. As\nhis condition worsened, his family called and called again, insisting on an\nappointment. In December, the VA hospital finally called to schedule an\nappointment. There was no need. Thomas Breen had passed away a month\nearlier, waiting for care that never came.\n\n\n\nSoon after, the VA found that 120,000 veterans nationwide were either left\nwaiting for care or never received care. This came even after the VA\xe2\x80\x99s\nbudget had been increased significantly for years. Where has the money gone?\n\n\n\nThis is a failure of the local VA hospital, but it is also an indictment of\nthe way Washington works. Too many Washington bureaucrats have treated our\nveterans like they are just another line item in a budget, wedged between\nthe Department of the Interior and Department of Commerce.\n\n\n\nWe can do better.\n\n\n\nIt starts with accountability. As of February, only 8 employees out of 75\ncited for disciplinary action in the wake of the VA scandal have been\nfired. We can\xe2\x80\x99t expect the culture of the VA to change until employees are\nheld responsible for failure to deliver what the taxpayers expect and\nveterans deserve.\n\n\n\nAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s time we look at fresh approaches to providing health care to\nveterans.\n\n\n\nMore vets should be able to take advantage of a Congressionally authorized\n\xe2\x80\x9cchoice\xe2\x80\x9d card, designed to give veterans a choice in where they receive\ncare. We can expand their access to neighborhood clinics, instead of making\nthem wait months to see a VA doctor or travel 200 miles to a VA hospital.\nThis would also ease the long queues of veterans waiting to see VA doctors.\n\n\n\nThe VA bureaucracy has been reluctant to change and slow to implement\nreforms that passed in rare bipartisan fashion in 2014 that would bring\nmore veterans choice and increased accountability to the process.\n\n\n\nWe have to approach any reforms to the VA with humility before their\nsacrifice, respect for their service, and reverence for the obligation we\nowe them. When a service member concludes their active duty service, they\nshould know that we are ready to take on the responsibility of their care.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s GOP Rivals Keep Him Front and Center\n<http://www.wsj.com/articles/jeb-bushs-gop-rivals-seize-on-his-iraq-missteps-1431890844>\n// WSJ // Reid J. Epstein - May 17, 2015\n\n\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa\xe2\x80\x94Attacks on Jeb Bush are ramping up even before he enters\nthe 2016 presidential race, with fellow Republicans questioning everything\nfrom his conservative bona fides to whether he is prepared for a long\ncampaign to become the party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee.\n\n\n\nMr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s rivals, 10 of whom joined him for a Saturday night fundraising\ndinner for the Iowa Republican Party, have latched onto the former Florida\ngovernor\xe2\x80\x99s shaky responses last week about the wisdom of his brother\xe2\x80\x99s\nentry into the Iraq war, ensuring the issue will dog him for the\nforeseeable future.\n\n\n\nIt highlights the core challenge of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s expected formal entry into\nthe campaign: a family name that has given him outsize attention and access\nto an unparalleled fundraising network that at the same time could make it\ndifficult for him to forge a political independence.\n\n\n\nIt also shows that even though Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s political standing is weaker in\nIowa than elsewhere, he remains the focus of the race, with the other\npresidential hopefuls implicitly defining themselves against him.\n\n\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has positioned himself as the only likely GOP\ncandidate not presenting an aggressive overseas military posture, suggested\nto the audience of 1,300 Republicans at the state party\xe2\x80\x99s Lincoln Day\ndinner here that Mr. Bush would mount another unpopular war.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe question was asked of one of our candidates this week, was the Iraq\nwar a mistake? Was it a good idea? Would you do it again?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Paul said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a valid question, not because we\xe2\x80\x99re just talking about history, but\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the Middle East, where history repeats itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe other White House contenders spent last week explaining that they\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have started the Iraq war. By the time they arrived in Iowa, the\ncritique expanded to suggest that Mr. Bush, who is expected to raise far\nmore money than anyone else in the field, isn\xe2\x80\x99t prepared to be the party\xe2\x80\x99s\nstandard-bearer.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever we nominate as a Republican Party has got to be ready to answer\nthe tough questions,\xe2\x80\x9d Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who is planning a June\npresidential announcement, said in an interview.\n\n\n\nIn a hallway outside the state party dinner, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick\nSantorum said the episode illustrates the need for the party to choose\nsomeone who has been through the rigors of a national campaign.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt just goes to show you, don\xe2\x80\x99t try this at home, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\nSantorum, who placed second to Mitt Romney for the GOP presidential\nnomination in 2012 and is planning to announce his intentions for a second\npresidential campaign on May 27. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a reason the Republican Party has\ngone back to folks who have gone through it before, because they tend to be\na little better at doing it the next time around.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOnly hawkish Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) defended the Iraq war. But in\ndoing so, he made an implicit reminder of mistakes made by President George\nW. Bush. \xe2\x80\x9cPresident Bush, W., had the same information everybody else in\nthe world did and made the best decision he could,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Graham said. \xe2\x80\x9cBush\nmade mistakes, but he corrected his mistakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe issue has proved to be tricky territory for other GOP contenders. In an\ninterview broadcast Sunday on Fox, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio struggled to\ndeliver a straight response to the question of whether the Iraq invasion\nwas worth it.\n\n\n\nMr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s new political problem began early last week when Fox News\nbroadcast an interview in which Mr. Bush said that, knowing what is known\nnow, he would have launched the Iraq war his brother began. During the\ncourse of four days, his position evolved, beginning by saying he misheard\nthe question to making a categorical statement that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\nlaunched the Iraq war, given today\xe2\x80\x99s information.\n\n\n\nWhen he arrived in Iowa, Mr. Bush had no choice but to own the mistake. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nanswered the question wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he told reporters in Iowa City. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all\ngoing to make mistakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nRobert Gates, who was defense secretary under both Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s brother and\nPresident Barack Obama, said in a CBS interview broadcast Sunday that while\nhe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t impressed by the foreign-policy experience of any of Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s\npotential 2016 rivals, the former governor should have been ready for\nquestions about Iraq.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was an inevitable question that would be asked,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gates said in the\ninterview. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think that the way to deal with it, frankly, is to say,\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t make policy by going back and reliving old decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Bush begins every campaign speech by noting his love for his father and\nbrother. He told a Republican National Committee gathering in Arizona last\nweek that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be \xe2\x80\x9cgoing out of my way\xe2\x80\x9d to criticize either previous\nPresident Bush.\n\n\n\nTim Miller, a Jeb Bush spokesman, said he \xe2\x80\x9cwas the most successful\nconservative big state governor in the country and he is prepared for the\nrigors of the campaign should he decide to run.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAlso weighing on Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s standing in Iowa is his plan, announced by\naides last week, to skip the August state straw poll, a major quadrennial\nfundraiser for the state GOP.\n\n\n\nState GOP Chairman Jeff Kaufmann and Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley on Saturday\nnight made explicit pitches to the other candidates to attend the straw\npoll.\n\n\n\nNow, even Iowa Republicans who figure to support Mr. Bush after he formally\ndeclares himself a candidate said they were baffled by his Iraq stumbles.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been hard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zach Nunn, an Iowa state representative who said he\nis leaning toward backing Mr. Bush and with whom he had his third\none-on-one meeting of the year on Saturday. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s great to be popular. It\xe2\x80\x99s\ngreat to raise money. But for me what\xe2\x80\x99s going to determine who\xe2\x80\x99s the best\ncandidate is, do you have the leadership capability to run the country?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nJeb Bush stands by opposition to same-sex marriage\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/18/politics/jeb-bush-gay-marriage-opposition/>\n// CNN // Alexandra Jaffe - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nWashington (CNN)Jeb Bush stood by his opposition to same-sex marriage in a\nnew interview, saying he doesn\'t believe it\'s a constitutional right and\nthat traditional marriage is central to Catholicism.\n\n\n\n"It\'s at the core of the Catholic faith, and to imagine how we are going to\nsucceed in our country unless we have committed family life, a\nchild-centered family system, is hard to imagine," he said on Christian\nBroadcasting Network\'s "The Brody File."\n\n\n\n"So, irrespective of the Supreme Court ruling \xe2\x80\x94 because they are going to\ndecide whatever they decide, and I don\'t know what they\'re going to do \xe2\x80\x94 we\nneed to be stalwart supporters of traditional marriage."\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule next month on the constitutionality\nof same-sex marriage, and many observers \xe2\x80\x94 even opponents of gay marriage \xe2\x80\x94\nbelieve the court will in some way expand marriage rights to gay men and\nlesbians. Many in the GOP are split over how to tackle such a ruling, as\nEvangelical Christians make up a significant subset of the GOP base and are\nadamantly opposed to gay marriage.\n\n\n\nThose Evangelical Christians remain some of Bush\'s biggest skeptics as he\nmoves towards a presidential run.\n\n\n\nBush didn\'t offer his own prescription for how to respond to the decision,\nbut he again reaffirmed that he doesn\'t believe same-sex marriage is a\nconstitutional right \xe2\x80\x94 "but I\'m not a lawyer, and clearly this has been\naccelerated at a warp pace."\n\n\n\nThe expected presidential contender then took aim at his likely Democratic\nopponent in the race, Hillary Clinton, who surprised many in recently\ncalling for the Supreme Court to back gay marriage, a shift from just two\nyears prior when she said marriage was a matter best left to the states.\n\n\n\n"What\'s interesting is that four years ago Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton\nhad the same view that I just expressed to you. It\'s thousands of years of\nculture and history is just being changed at warp speed. It\'s hard to\nfathom why it is this way," Bush said.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush Says Christian Business Owners Can Refuse To Serve Gay Weddings\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/17/jeb-bush-gay-weddings_n_7301728.html?ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000016>\n// Huffington Post // Marina Fang - May 17, 2015\n\n\n\nLikely Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said that Christian\nbusiness owners should not have to provide services for gay weddings if it\ngoes against their religious beliefs.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, absolutely, if it\xe2\x80\x99s based on a religious belief,\xe2\x80\x9d he said when asked\nby the Christian Broadcasting Network in an interview Saturday if\nbusinesses should be able to decline services to same-sex weddings.\n\n\n\nThe former Florida governor justified his position by claiming that not\nproviding a service does not count as discrimination if business owners\nfeel that it violates their religious rights.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA big country, a tolerant country, ought to be able to figure out the\ndifference between discriminating someone because of their sexual\norientation and not forcing someone to participate in a wedding that they\nfind goes against their moral beliefs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis should not be that\ncomplicated. Gosh, it is right now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe blurry distinction has become a controversial topic, as many\nwedding-related businesses around the country, like florists and bakeries,\nhave turned down gay customers, citing religious freedom. The issue became\npolitically charged in March, when Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) signed the\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act into law, which allows businesses to cite\nreligious rights as a reason for refusing service. Many in the GOP\npresidential field, including Bush, defended the law. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce the facts are\nestablished, people aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to see this as discriminatory at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid in March.\n\n\n\nAfter widespread backlash, Pence was forced to sign a revised version of\nthe law, which delineated that businesses could not discriminate against\ncustomers and clients on the basis of sexual orientation or identity. But\ngay rights advocates argued that the revised law did little to amend the\noriginal one, and that it still leaves much room for interpretation and\nopens the door for discrimination.\n\n\n\nIn Saturday\'s interview, Bush also reiterated his opposition to marriage\nequality, saying that gay marriage is not a constitutional right and that\n"we need to be stalwart supporters of traditional marriage." He did say\nlast month that he would attend a gay wedding if asked.\n\n\n\nBush insists he\'s not writing off Iowa\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/bush-insists-hes-not-writing-off-iowa-118043.html?hp=rc1_4>\n// Politico // Eli Stokols - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa \xe2\x80\x93 His brother won the caucuses here in 2000. His likely\ncampaign manager is a veteran Iowa campaign strategist. And as he stumped\naround the state this weekend, Jeb Bush repeatedly insisted he\xe2\x80\x99s going to\ncompete hard in next year\xe2\x80\x99s caucuses.\n\n\n\nEven so, skepticism runs high about Bush\xe2\x80\x99s intentions for next February\xe2\x80\x99s\ncaucuses.\n\n\n\nBetween his low standing in state polls, the socially conservative bent of\nthe Iowa GOP base and his decision to skip the state\xe2\x80\x99s straw poll in\nAugust, Bush has lots of incentives to give up on Iowa next year.\nRepublicans here know it, which is why the former Florida governor spent\nhis weekend reassuring them he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t already written off the state as a\nlost cause.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to be here. I\xe2\x80\x99m here right now!\xe2\x80\x9d Bush told reporters Saturday\nafter appearing at a fundraiser in Iowa City for Sen. Chuck Grassley. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\nwould I be here if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to compete in Iowa?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n>From Dubuque to Iowa City to the state GOP\xe2\x80\x99s Lincoln Dinner in Des Moines\non Saturday night, Bush threw everything he had into the effort to convince\nIowans that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t plan to blow off the state. His intensely private\nwife, Columba, and his son Jeb Jr., both accompanied him to Dubuque, where\nhe held an hourlong town hall. He took 11 questions from the crowd there,\nand then a few dozen \xe2\x80\x9cselfies\xe2\x80\x9d with attendees before leaving. He met\nprivately with several top donors, county chairs and elected officials \xe2\x80\x94\nsome of whom have been alarmed by Bush\xe2\x80\x99s laissez-faire approach thus far to\nIowa \xe2\x80\x94 prior to his speech at the Republican Party dinner; when it was\nover, he greeted a long receiving line of supporters in his hospitality\nsuite.\n\n\n\nThe decision to do a full day of in-state events \xe2\x80\x94 not just the dinner \xe2\x80\x94\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t lost on Republicans here. David Kochel, the top Iowa strategist now\nworking for Bush in Miami, was happy with Bush\xe2\x80\x99s day introducing himself to\nIowa Republicans.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t know him yet, but there\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to let people get to know\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen they get to know him, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nBush has much more work to do to convince Iowans that he\xe2\x80\x99s truly invested.\nAfter being absent from the state since early March, he felt the lash of\nstate GOP chairman Jeff Kauffman on Twitter last week after reports first\nsurfaced that Bush was planning to bypass the Iowa straw poll in August and\nattend another event outside the state.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe hope Governor Bush rethinks his decision and realizes that grassroots\nwill only grow in Iowa if he waters them,\xe2\x80\x9d Kauffman wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t buy\nthis excuse and neither will Iowans.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWhen reporters asked Bush on Saturday about his reasons for skipping the\nAug. 8 straw poll, he hinted at a broader strategy that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hinge on\nthe Hawkeye State.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not relevant,\xe2\x80\x9d Bush said of the straw poll. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s relevant is\nrunning a campaign, creating a strategy, building a good team towards\nsuccess, which is in the primaries, and doing it in a way that makes it\npossible to win the general, which is the whole point of this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAccording to a number of people close to the candidate, Bush\xe2\x80\x99s strategy\nrests on simply doing well enough in February\xe2\x80\x99s earliest contests to come\nout of South Carolina as one of the two or three leading candidates \xe2\x80\x94 in\nother words, a first-place finish in Iowa isn\xe2\x80\x99t essential.\n\n\n\nWhen Bush met the traveling press in Iowa City on Saturday afternoon, the\nsecond time he got a question about the straw poll and his seriousness\nabout the caucuses, he turned it back around at the reporter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you aspire to fourth place in anything? Or sixth place?\xe2\x80\x9d Bush asked.\nHis point: His own competitive nature wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow him accept such a weak\nperformance. Besides, a win for Bush might be defined as a finish anywhere\nin the top three.\n\n\n\nAs long as Bush doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get embarrassed in Iowa and potentially can win in\nNew Hampshire, the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s anticipated financial advantage could be the\ndifference-maker, especially in March, when crowded primary days take place\nand only the best-funded campaigns will be able to compete across the map.\n\n\n\nTo get to March, Bush still must deliver a respectable performance in Iowa\nin February, and that\xe2\x80\x99ll mean investing the kind of resources here to\nensure a win, place or show finish.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll signal with his time how much of a priority Iowa is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zach\nNunn, a Republican state legislator. \xe2\x80\x9cAny time he comes to Iowa is a\nserious indicator that he sees Iowa as a place he needs to do well.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe most recent polling shows Bush in seventh place among likely Republican\npresidential hopefuls with just 5 percent support among Iowa primary voters\n\xe2\x80\x94 a sign that Bush, who\xe2\x80\x99d made just one trip here before last weekend, has\na lot of work to do here. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s father and brother both had campaigned far\nearlier and more frequently than Jeb Bush at this point in the election\ncycle.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he have a one- or two-state strategy like some other candidates? Of\ncourse not,\xe2\x80\x9d said former Iowa GOP chairman Matt Strawn. \xe2\x80\x9cThe challenge is\nto make sure those activists who are predisposed to support Bush are seeing\nhim here. They want to see a candidate making a commitment to Iowa before\nthey make a commitment to Gov. Bush.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn the end, the size of the GOP field could work to Bush\xe2\x80\x99s advantage. With\nas many as 19 potential candidates, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that evangelicals won\xe2\x80\x99t\ncoalesce around one clear choice and the vote will be splintered \xe2\x80\x94 which\nwould open the door for a steady and solid establishment candidate like\nBush to finish near the top in Iowa.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the evangelical vote gets split up, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that someone can win\nthe Iowa caucuses with 20 percent of the vote,\xe2\x80\x9d Strawn said.\n\n\n\nWhen he opened his town hall meeting Saturday morning at Loras College in\nDubuque, Bush spoke to those who doubt his prospects in Iowa \xe2\x80\x94 or the depth\nof his commitment to playing here \xe2\x80\x94 by pointing to his father\xe2\x80\x99s 1980\ncome-from-behind win in the Iowa caucuses.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just remind everybody that\xe2\x80\x99s interested in political history,\xe2\x80\x9d Bush\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cHe started here in Iowa as an asterisk, literally an asterisk, and\nhe won the Iowa caucuses.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nTeam Jeb: He\'s held to \'different standard\' than Hillary\n<http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/team-jeb-hes-held-to-different-standard-than-hillary/article/2564650>\n// Washington Examiner // Byron York - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nJeb Bush first stumbled on the Iraq if-you-knew-then-what-you-know-now\nquestion in an interview with Fox News\' Megyn Kelly. He stumbled again the\nnext day in a radio interview with Sean Hannity. He stumbled yet again in a\ntown hall taking questions from unscreened voters in Nevada, which was\nfollowed by taking questions from the press. And, after four days of\ntrying, Bush finally answered the question in another session with voters\nand the press in Arizona.\n\n\n\nNotice anything about that? Of course Bush took plenty of deserved\ncriticism for the substance of his answers. But give him this: All of\nBush\'s missteps took place in open, unscripted exchanges with the press or\nwith voters in full view of the press. And when Bush messed up on a serious\nquestion, he did not withdraw or limit access to his events. Some voters\nwho attended really let him have it, like Ivy Ziedrich, the Young Democrat\nwho told Bush, "Your brother created ISIS!" Still, Bush didn\'t subject\nanyone to any sort of pre-questioning. He didn\'t cancel events. He was\navailable the whole time, even as he struggled to find an answer to a\nquestion that clearly troubled him.\n\n\n\nThe contrast between Bush\'s openness and the airtight seal around Hillary\nClinton could not have been greater.\n\n\n\n"Jeb doesn\'t fear taking risks or making mistakes," close Bush associate\nSally Bradshaw told me via email. "He\'s always believed public service is\nabout actually serving the public, and doing so on a very personal level\nrequires putting yourself in the arena." The result of that belief,\nBradshaw continued, is that "He engages. He doesn\'t back away. He doesn\'t\nworry about the impact of having an honest conversation or thinking\nsomething through and taking a thoughtful approach."\n\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the Iraq mistakes, Bush has taken to mentioning Clinton\nat events. "I asked someone to kind of add up the questions that I\'ve been\nasked by people who can ask whatever they want, and of course the press\nthat follows me around from time to time," Bush said at a town hall in\nDubuque, Iowa over the weekend. "And we\'re probably around 800 to 900\nquestions asked and hopefully answered."\n\n\n\n"Just as an aside," Bush added, "Hillary Clinton has been a presidential\ncandidate for a month maybe, and she\'s had 13 questions asked by the press."\n\n\n\nAs the Iraq controversy built, Bush aides increasingly focused on Clinton\nand the contrast between her reclusiveness and Bush\'s openness. "It\ncontinues to be interesting, the extent to which every single verb, noun,\nadverb, and adjective that he utters is psychoanalyzed," one Bush aide said\nof the former Florida governor. "There\'s clearly a different standard from\nHillary Clinton. It\'s remarkable how little she has engaged with the public\nand the press since she became a candidate."\n\n\n\n"Yes, he is held to a different standard," the aide continued. "And that\'s\nokay. But it\'s stunning that she is allowed to evade the press and evade\nthe public in the way that she is being allowed."\n\n\n\nOne example. At the same time Bush was going through the Iraq questioning,\nAnnie Karni, a Politico reporter covering Hillary Clinton, tweeted a photo\nof a man in a suit \xe2\x80\x94 apparently someone associated with Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 standing\nin front of a drape concealing some sort of hallway. Karni\'s tweet said:\n"My view of @HillaryClinton entering her finance meeting in Red Hook."\nClinton was behind that drape somewhere, but the press \xe2\x80\x94 much less the\npublic \xe2\x80\x94 could forget about having any sort of interaction with her.\n\n\n\nIt is literally impossible to imagine Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 besieged by questions about\nthe Clinton Foundation, her secret email system, trade, and other hot\nissues \xe2\x80\x94 making herself available to voters and the press the way Bush has.\nThe 13 questions Clinton has taken over the course of more than a month \xe2\x80\x94\none of which was "How are you liking Iowa?" \xe2\x80\x94 told the public nearly\nnothing about her, her campaign, or any issue of the moment. Before that,\nit has been more than two months since her brief "Guernica" news conference\nin which she took a few questions about the email system. Clinton is under\nincreasing pressure from the press \xe2\x80\x94 journalists are suggesting questions\nthey would ask if they only had the chance and others are calculating the\ntime since Clinton last answered any question at all \xe2\x80\x94 but the fact is, she\nis getting away with it.\n\n\n\nSo yes, Bush had difficulties answering a straightforward question about\nIraq. But voters, and journalists, too, should remember that it only\nhappened because he is out there, making himself available every day. When\nis the Democratic frontrunner going to do the same?\n\n\n\nWhy Marco Rubio could beat Jeb Bush\n<http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/18/opinions/zelizer-rubio-could-beat-bush/> //\nCNN // Julian Zelizer - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\n(CNN)Florida Sen. Marco Rubio poses a major threat to former Florida Gov.\nJeb Bush in the 2016 Republican primaries. Rubio, the affable politician\nwho has been steadily and quietly rising in the polls, has been making an\nimpression these days as the parties are starting to sense that he could be\na very viable presidential candidate.\n\n\n\nRubio\'s emergence runs counter to the thinking of many observers that Jeb\nBush would command a decisive and virtually insurmountable advantage in\nthis campaign, as a result of his fundraising prowess and many endorsements\nfrom members of the party elite.\n\n\n\nIn many respects, Rubio is the perfect candidate for the party at this\nparticular moment in history. Though the 43-year old has flaws, including\nvery limited experience, he brings to the table a number of assets that can\nhelp him through the caucuses and primaries.\n\n\n\nThe most important of his strengths is that he contradicts the image that\nmany Americans now have of the Republican Party: a party of older white\nmales who are not happy about the direction of American society in the past\nfew decades.\n\n\n\nIn part, Americans formed this opinion based on the way that Republicans\nhave handled the issue of immigration. As the nation has become more\npluralistic and diverse, with growing public support for liberalizing\nimmigration policy, hardline conservatives in the GOP have stood in the way\nof progress.\n\n\n\nPutting forth a candidate who comes from a family of immigrants will have\ntremendous appeal to many in the GOP, including conservatives, who want to\nshow that their party is different than the image many have of it. This can\nhave immense power at this crossroads moment when Republicans do have a\nchance to capture the White House after eight years of a Democrat in\ncontrol.\n\n\n\nRubio\'s rags- to-riches story is the kind that campaign staffers love to\ntell.\n\n\n\nEven one of Rubio\'s greatest failures, his effort to push a comprehensive\nimmigration bill, can be interpreted as a virtue. Rubio backed a bill in\nthe Senate that would have resolved the ongoing standoff on immigration.\nBut he vastly underestimated the level of opposition among his House\ncounterparts.\n\n\n\nWhile the failure of the bill deprived him of a major victory, he can use\nhis action as evidence of his commitment to resolving this key issue and\nhis desire to govern, not just grandstand. In an era of gridlock and\npolarization, this will hold appeal, assuming he can get past opponents of\nimmigration reform among GOP primary voters.\n\n\n\nRubio\'s effort to move forward on immigration can help him sell his\ncandidacy to more moderate elements in the party at the same time that he\ncan easily stress his credentials as a true conservative.\n\n\n\nThere is a reason that the Tea Party loved him in 2010. His opposition to\nCommon Core standards, his deregulatory zeal, and his tough positions on\nIran will allow primary voters in states like South Carolina to see that\nthey would not be electing a moderate. He might be one of the few\ncandidates who can sell himself in both ways, as a conservative, but also a\nleader who could govern.\n\n\n\nRubio also can project a hawkish vision of foreign policy, which still\nresonates in the Republican electorate, without being susceptible to the\nunfavorable connection people make between Jeb Bush and the controversial\nlegacy of his brother, former President George W. Bush.\n\n\n\nBalancing inexperience and energy\n\n\n\nIn recent weeks, the former Florida governor stumbled in response to\nquestions about whether he would have invaded Iraq. Saying that he would\nhave invaded, just like his brother, was definitely the wrong answer, and\neven Bush acknowledged as much in follow-up comments.\n\n\n\nBush\'s family connections assure that the Iraq War will continue to plague\nhim as he contends with the more isolationist Rand Paul wing of the GOP on\nforeign policy.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, Rubio can more comfortably advance the three pillars of his\nforeign policy vision -- strong defense spending, moral clarity, and the\nprotection of the world economy. He can do so because he doesn\'t stand in\nthe shadow of the former Republican president.\n\n\n\nRubio is young. Born in 1971, Rubio would bring Generation X into the White\nHouse as a 45-year-old president -- younger than Obama was when he took\noffice -- and this would be significant for both parties. The fact is that\nthe leadership of the Republicans and Democrats is graying.\n\n\n\nThere is a need to infuse younger voices and the ideas of those born after\nthe turbulent divisions of the 1960s into the political arena. Until now,\nDemocrats have done a better job engaging younger voters than Republicans.\n\n\n\nNominating Rubio would send a strong message that the party is moving in a\nnew direction. The senator could speak to generational questions in way\nthat his competitors could not.\n\n\n\nThe flip side of youth, is that opponents could tag Rubio as inexperienced,\nsuggesting he would make some of the kinds of mistakes that people have\nargued took place with Obama. Yet in caucuses and primaries, as Obama\nlearned, the energy of youth can go a long way in campaigns.\n\n\n\nThis a nation that thirsts for what is around the corner, not always what\'s\nbeen around for a long time. In a general campaign, Democrats would be\nhesitant to go too far in making an issue of Rubio\'s age given the age of\nour most recent president when he was elected.\n\n\n\nA maverick, but not an outsider\n\n\n\nBesides being young, the fact that Rubio did slip in recent years outside\nof the "frontrunner" status for the party will end up generating even more\nexcitement about him. Even though he is in Congress, the bastion of\nestablishment politics, he can present himself as something of an upstart\nand a maverick. The media loves a come-from-behind story, and so do voters.\n\n\n\nWhile he can present himself in certain respects as anti-establishment, he\nis not. And this matters, too. Rubio has demonstrated that he can attract\nserious money from Super Pacs which are the new power brokers of American\npolitics.\n\n\n\nWhile he has not reached the point of Bush in terms of a network of donors\nhe has demonstrated some pretty serious legs when it comes to campaign\nfinance. This will be essential in the contest against the war chest that\nBush is amassing. Ironically, the very positive words and support that Jeb\nBush has given Rubio in the past will be extraordinarily helpful in his\ncredibility with donors.\n\n\n\nNone of this is to diminish the weaknesses that Rubio has, including the\nlack of experience, or to overstate the chances that he would have of\ndefeating Hillary Clinton. His friendship with former Rep. David Rivera,\nwho has been under investigation, could be an issue on the campaign trail.\nThe fact that he and Bush are both from Florida might divide the primary\nelectorate and open the door for another Republican to win.\n\n\n\nBut in many respects, for Jeb Bush, and for the Democrats, Rubio is the\nmost dangerous man in the room.\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio has listed himself as \'white\' instead of \'Hispanic.\' News\nflash: He\'s both.\n<http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2015/05/marco-rubio-once-listed-himself-as-white-instead-of-hispanic-news-flash-hes-both.html>\n// Miami Herald // Patricia Mazzei - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio has listed himself as "white"  instead of "Hispanic" in\napplications to renew his Florida driver\'s license, according to records\nobtained by the Miami Herald.\n\n\n\nThat might sound a little like Rubio made a mistake akin to when Jeb Bush\nincorrectly checked off "Hispanic" in his Miami-Dade County voter\nregistration. But it\'s not.\n\n\n\nHere\'s why: Rubio is white. He\'s also Hispanic. And being forced to pick\nbetween the two is a false choice.\n\n\n\n"White" refers to Rubio\'s race. "Hispanic" refers to his ethnicity. There\nare, for example, white Hispanics, black Hispanics, Asian Hispanics and\nHispanics of indigenous descent. Rubio is a white Hispanic.\n\n\n\nMost government forms, however, are not enlightened enough to discern\nbetween a person\'s race and their ethnicity. When the Florida Highway\nSafety and Motor Vehicles Department asks license applicants to fill out an\noptional race field, the choices are Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native\nAmerican, Other and White -- as if a person couldn\'t be more than one of\nthose things at the same time.\n\n\n\nThe information isn\'t mandatory -- it doesn\'t appear on a driver\'s license\ncard -- and some of Rubio\'s transactions with the HSMV over the years don\'t\nlist any race. His 1998 and 2004 renewal applications list "white," as\nshown in the partial 1998 application above (the Miami Herald redacted\nRubio\'s license number as a courtesy; other information was redacted by the\nHSMV). His latest renewal, from 2014, shows a blank space under "race."\n\n\n\nOf course, there\'s no confusion as to Rubio\'s lineage. His name gives away\nhis Hispanic roots, and he has made it part of his political narrative to\ntell the story of how his parents left Cuba seeking a better life for their\nchildren.\n\n\n\nA Rubio spokesman said the Florida senator "doesn\'t recall" how he renewed\nhis license.\n\n\n\n"But this looks like a glitch since he considers himself an American of\nHispanic descent," Alex Conant said in an email. "The fact that he is of\nHispanic descent has been hard to miss since his first campaign given the\nfact that he\'s made his family\'s story a centerpiece of his public life."\n\n\n\nThe race-versus-ethnicity question is far from unusual in Rubio\'s diverse\nhometown of Miami. Some Hispanics have a personal policy of listing their\nrace rather than their ethnicity, since that\'s really what is being asked.\nOthers choose without giving it much thought, depending on the form and\ntheir mood on any given day. Since the options show a lack of understanding\nabout what makes a person Hispanic, why bother taking it too seriously?\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Census has separated race and ethnicity, specifically over the\nquestion of Hispanic origin, since 1997. Perhaps it\'s time for all\ngovernment agencies to do the same.\n\n\n\nSupreme Court Won\xe2\x80\x99t Block Probe of Scott Walker\xe2\x80\x99s Recall Campaign\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-05-18/u-s-high-court-won-t-block-probe-of-walker-s-recall-campaign>\xe2\x80\x99\n// Bloomberg // Greg Stohr - May 18 2015\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court refused to end a state investigation into Wisconsin\nGovernor Scott Walker\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 recall campaign, rejecting an appeal from a\nconservative group that says its constitutional rights are being violated.\n\n\n\nThe rebuff leaves the future of the investigation in the hands of the\nWisconsin Supreme Court, which is considering a separate bid to stop the\nprobe. The criminal investigation, on hold during the court fight, might\ncomplicate Walker\xe2\x80\x99s potential campaign for the Republican presidential\nnomination.\n\n\n\nA court-appointed special prosecutor, Francis Schmitz, is tasked with\ninvestigating whether Walker and his operatives violated state\ncampaign-finance laws by coordinating their efforts with Club for Growth,\nan advocacy group.\n\n\n\nThe Wisconsin chapter of Club for Growth and its director, Eric O\xe2\x80\x99Keefe,\nare fighting subpoenas they received from Schmitz seeking financial\nrecords. The group and O\xe2\x80\x99Keefe sued in federal court to block the probe,\nand a federal trial judge said the First Amendment bars the state from\ntrying to learn whether the organization coordinated with the Walker\ncampaign.\n\n\n\nA U.S. appeals court overturned that ruling, saying federal judges\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t entangle themselves in state criminal proceedings.\n\n\n\nWalker survived the recall vote, which was sparked by his efforts to curb\nthe power of public employee unions, and then won re-election last year.\nWalker and his campaign aren\xe2\x80\x99t directly involved in the Club for Growth\ncase.\n\n\n\nThe case is O\xe2\x80\x99Keefe v.

Turns out, it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t; in response to the\nopen records request, a handful of top staffers hastily added their name to\na list stating that they had signed the waiver. The list didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a date\non it, though, and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an official waiver anyway, merely a piece of\npaper indicating that signatories had signed a wavier previously.\n\n\n\nIn a letter to the attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s office after the election, and after\nWalker\xe2\x80\x99s office had eventually complied with the open records request,\nRiemer wrote that Walker\xe2\x80\x99s intention had been \xe2\x80\x9cto fool me, as Mr. Walker\xe2\x80\x99s\nprimary opponent in the political campaign for County Executive; to fool\nthe Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel; and to fool the voters and the public. The\ndeception worked. We were all fooled.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe attorney general declined to prosecute but accused Walker of\n\xe2\x80\x9cchicanery.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd that was not all.\n\n\n\nIn the course of the campaign, Walker\xe2\x80\x99s team ran a radio ad accusing Riemer\nof engineering a pension settlement to a series of lawsuits that cost the\ncounty millions of dollars. In fact, the lawsuits predated Riemer\xe2\x80\x99s tenure\nwith the county, and his reforms helped save the city up to $25 million a\nyear. When pressed, according to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, Walker\nconceded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe ad\xe2\x80\x99s assertion is not correct as stated,\xe2\x80\x9d but he refused\nto stop running it.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never in my life seen anything like it,\xe2\x80\x9d Riemer, who ended up\nlosing the election by nearly 15 percentage points, said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of\nperson admits that what they are doing is wrong but won\xe2\x80\x99t change it? There\nis a fundamental character flaw here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe what a jerk he was. I was new to politics. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nthink it was fair game for them to say anything about you whether it was\nprovable or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWalker is now on the cusp of announcing a run for president, and early\npolls show him as a front-runner to become the Republican nominee. And part\nof his appeal to the Republican faithful is his record of success in\npolitical campaigns and in public office. This is someone, after all, won\nfour consecutive terms in the state legislature before winning three county\nexecutive races in the Democratic-leaning Milwaukee County and three races\nfor governor in blue-hued Wisconsin. He also became the first governor in\nAmerican history to survive a recall. And unlike some Republicans in\nDemocratic territory who hew to the center after Election Day, Walker\ntacked sharply to the right while in office, winning him plaudits from\nconservative leaders as a true believer.\n\n\n\nBut longtime Walker-watchers in Wisconsin say that behind Walker\xe2\x80\x99s success\nis a long record of bending campaign laws just to their breaking point.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cScott Walker is politics incarnate, with an unslakable thirst for\npolitical power and an eye on the next election,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mike Browne, the\ndeputy director of One Wisconsin Now, a liberal advocacy group. \xe2\x80\x9cThroughout\nhis nearly quarter-century career running for office, he\xe2\x80\x99s shown he\xe2\x80\x99ll do\nwhatever he thinks he needs to do to win, letter or spirit of the laws be\ndamned.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMost notably, Walker has been ensnared in a pair of so-called John Doe\ninvestigations. In the first, while looking into missing funds from a\nveterans\xe2\x80\x99 charity run out of Walker\xe2\x80\x99s county executive office,\ninvestigators discovered that his staff had set up a secretive Internet\nsystem in his government office to allow them to do political work on the\ntaxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s dime. Investigators also found that a railroad executive with\nbusiness before the state had set up a straw donor scheme enabling his\nemployees to donate to the future governor.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation didn\xe2\x80\x99t touch Walker, but a deputy chief of staff was\nsentenced to six months in jail. Another was convicted of embezzlement\nafter it was discovered that he used funds stolen from the veterans\xe2\x80\x99\ncharity to set up Walker for Governor campaign websites. Another top\nstaffer received one year of probation and a $1,000 fine after cooperating\nwith investigators.\n\n\n\nThe second John Doe investigation is ongoing and focuses on whether\nWalker\xe2\x80\x99s campaign illegally coordinated with the Club for Growth during his\n2012 recall campaign. According to heavily redacted documents released this\nweek, Walker\xe2\x80\x99s defense argues that such coordination was not illegal\nbecause Walker was not an official candidate until April of that year\xe2\x80\x94a\nmere two months before voters went to the polls and while Walker was\nraising and spending millions of dollars to ward off his Democratic\nopponent.\n\n\n\nWalker\xe2\x80\x99s trouble with campaign rules began even before he embarked on a\npolitical career in earnest. As a sophomore at Marquette University in\nMilwaukee, he lost a bid for student body president in a race that was\nmarred by allegations that Walker improperly campaigned before officially\nregistering his campaign, that he failed to properly register his campaign\nworkers, and that he went door-to-door to hand out fliers in violation of\ncampus policy. More seriously, after the school paper endorsed Walker\xe2\x80\x99s\nopponent, stacks of newspapers went missing, and the Walker operation was\naccused of engineering the theft.\n\n\n\nWalker dropped out of Marquette just before he was set to graduate and\npromptly mounted a campaign against Gwen Moore, a one-term state\nassemblywoman. In an interview, Moore, now a member of Congress, said her\nRepublican colleagues at the time told her that the reason Walker was\nrunning was that even though the district was majority Democratic, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\nmajority voting-age population was white.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would say his hero was Ronald Reagan. Lee Atwater, Ronald Reagan, that\nwas the regime he looked up to, and he ran a perfect racial dog whistle\ncampaign,\xe2\x80\x9d Moore said.\n\n\n\nThe campaign literature, she recalled, featured \xe2\x80\x9cguns, gangs, drugs, and\nurban unrest.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cried,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I was being associated with the worst\nelements of the community. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe what a jerk he was. I was new\nto politics. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it was fair game for them to say anything about\nyou whether it was provable or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nWalker lost decisively, moved to a new district, and served nearly a decade\nin the legislature before running for county executive. While in office, he\nwas repeatedly dogged by failures to properly file campaign finance\nreports, including leaving off the occupation of more than 50 donors who\ngave more than $100 in violation of state laws.\n\n\n\nFailure to list a donor\xe2\x80\x99s occupation is a problem that Walker\xe2\x80\x99s numerous\ncampaigns have encountered frequently. When he first explored a run for\ngovernor in 2006, the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a nonpartisan watchdog\ngroup that pushes for clean elections, found that 114 donations totaling\nmore than $75,000 failed to list the occupation or employer. In 2008,\nWalker\xe2\x80\x99s office stopped filing its campaign finance reports electronically,\nwhich made life harder for watchdogs, but still in 2009, One Wisconsin Now\nfound that $170,000 worth of contributions were not listed properly,\nincluding two contributions of $10,000, the maximum amount allowed by law.\nThe next year, the group found that more than $500,000 in contributions was\nimproperly reported.\n\n\n\nIn 2005, two Democratic county supervisors filed an ethics complaint with\nthe elections board against Walker for using his campaign arm, Friends of\nScott Walker, to robo-call against them on behalf of his budget without\ndisclosing who was beyond the calls.\n\n\n\nThe elections board ended up fining Walker $5,000, then the second largest\nsuch fine in state history.\n\n\n\nBut it was not the first time Walker\xe2\x80\x99s name would appear before the state\nelections board. Since 2010, when he first began exploring a gubernatorial\nrun in earnest, the state Democratic Party has filed seven ethics\ncomplaints against him.\n\n\n\nThe earliest cites a series of motorcycle rides Walker would take around\nthe state while county executive, ostensibly to promote tourism to\nMilwaukee but which critics said was little more than a way for Walker to\nintroduce himself to voters around the state (or beyond\xe2\x80\x94Walker twice\ntraveled to Minnesota on his annual Harley ride and once to the early\ncaucus state of Iowa).\n\n\n\nTwice the ride was sponsored by AirTran Airways, a low-cost air carrier\nthat at the time had a request pending before the county commission for\nconcourse space at the Milwaukee airport. The sponsorship led critics to\naccuse the candidate of extracting an in-kind donation from a corporation.\nAccording to the complaint, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not Milwaukee County logos\xe2\x80\xa6that\nlavished and marked everyone of the three dozen stops on the tour. It was\nsigns, flags and standards of Air Tran that dominated every single venue on\nWalker\xe2\x80\x99s tour.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe claim that the trip was just for Walker to promote Walker and not\nMilwaukee County was given credence, the complaint alleges, when in 2010 it\nwas rescheduled to coincide with the date and location of the state\nRepublican convention, allowing Walker to roar in to the convention on the\nback of his Harley. Plus, the complaint notes that Walker was accompanied\nby Tim Russell, a longtime Walker insider\xe2\x80\x94and the one who ended up going to\nprison for stealing from the veterans\xe2\x80\x99 charity\xe2\x80\x94who frequently moved between\ncampaign and governmental positions. At the time of the 2010 ride, Russell\nwas the administrator of the county\xe2\x80\x99s housing department.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny reasonable person would conclude that Housing has nothing to do with\ntourism\xe2\x80\x94Russell\xe2\x80\x99s presence indicates that the ride was in fact illegal\ncampaign activity,\xe2\x80\x9d the complaint states.\n\n\n\nAnother complaint alleges that right-wing outside groups like the Koch\nbrothers-backed Americans for Prosperity were illegally coordinating with\nWalker\xe2\x80\x99s recall campaign. The CEO of one such group, the Bradley\nFoundation, was Walker\xe2\x80\x99s campaign chairman, and the chairman of the board\nof the MacIver Institute for Public Policy, a conservative think tank, had\ngiven $16,500 to Walker\xe2\x80\x99s various campaigns.\n\n\n\nA third complaint asks the Government Accountability Board to look into\nWalker\xe2\x80\x99s legal defense fund, one that he has poured $60,000 of his campaign\nmoney into, though state law says such funds can be used only for a\ncandidate or public official who is being investigated or who has an agent\nwho is being investigated. Walker has denied repeatedly that he is a target\nof the John Doe investigation.\n\n\n\nA fourth complaint alleges that in the spring of his recall campaign, in\nthe wake of a federal Bureau of Labor Statistics release that showed that\nWisconsin was the only state to post \xe2\x80\x9cstatistically significant\xe2\x80\x9d job losses\nin the previous 12 months, the Walker administration expedited the release\nof its own jobs figures, which used a different metric from the widely used\nBLS metric. Walker\xe2\x80\x99s numbers showed that the state added jobs, and moments\nafter releasing the numbers, his recall campaign launched a blitz of\ntelevision and radio ads touting them\xe2\x80\x94proof, the complaint alleges, of\ncoordination between the government and political side of Walker\xe2\x80\x99s office.\n\n\n\n A fifth complaint, filed just this year, accuses Walker of dissembling\nwhen he claimed that his recent trip to the United Kingdom was for official\nbusiness and used public funds to promote trade between Wisconsin and the\nU.K. The visit was widely seen as a chance for Walker to bolster his\nforeign policy credentials, and Walker refused to answer media questions\nwhile in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\nAccording to a Democratic Party official, five of the complaints are still\npending. Two more were dismissed. One alleged that Walker brought\nRepublican super pollster Frank Luntz into the state capitol during the\nprotests against the governor\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to end collective bargaining for\npublic employees in the state. Another alleged that Walker tried to\ncoordinate with the Koch brothers directly by discussing by phone how he\nwas handling the protesters, including planting \xe2\x80\x9ctroublemakers\xe2\x80\x9d within\ntheir midst. (That call turned out to be a prank.)\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blatant disregard for campaign finance and ethics laws we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from\nScott Walker over the entirety of his career in elected office is\nunprecedented in Wisconsin politics,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melissa Baldauff, communications\ndirector for the Wisconsin Democratic Party. \xe2\x80\x9cNever before has a Wisconsin\ngovernor required a criminal defense fund, the donors to which still\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t been disclosed, or been alleged by prosecutors to be at the center\nof a nationwide \xe2\x80\x98criminal scheme.\xe2\x80\x99"\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the governor, said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cGovernor Walker has championed big, bold reforms that the left clearly\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t like, but he\xe2\x80\x99s won three times in four years because of his results\nfor the people of Wisconsin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nFew in Wisconsin think Walker will somehow be brought down by any of the\ncomplaints. To the exasperation of state Democrats, none of these\nallegations seem to have much slowed his steady ascent through the\npolitical ranks. Now that he is running for president, Walker finds himself\nfacing a new set of campaign finance regulations.\n\n\n\nIn a presidential campaign, many would-be candidates who are exploring a\nrun take great pains not to admit that they are candidates for office. To\ndo so would mean that they could run afoul of fundraising laws that forbid\ncoordination between candidates and the outside groups supporting them. Jeb\nBush, for example, has dismissed questions about what he would do as\npresident by noting that he is not yet a candidate and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to\nsuddenly trigger a campaign. When he did acknowledge that he was running,\nBush promptly backtracked.\n\n\n\nWalker has no such apparent qualms, referring to himself several times as\n\xe2\x80\x9ca candidate\xe2\x80\x9d and talking about how his sons may take time off from college\nto campaign with him, even though no such campaign officially exists.\n\n\n\nDemocrats have filed complaints to the Federal Election Commission. They\nare unlikely to go anywhere.\n\n\n\nRecords indicate Scott Walker was copied on letter promising loan to donor\n// Journal Sentinel\n<http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-seeks-to-downplay-questions-over-job-agency-b99502337z1-304123551.html>\n// Jason Stein and Patrick Marley \xe2\x80\x93 May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nState records say that Gov. Scott Walker received a copy of a 2011 letter\npledging a $500,000 taxpayer loan to a now-defunct Milwaukee construction\ncompany headed by a Walker donor, seemingly contradicting statements by the\ngovernor and his aides that he was not aware of the award.\n\n\n\nA spokeswoman for Walker said that, in spite of the records, a copy of the\nletter from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. was never delivered to\nthe governor\'s office.\n\n\n\nThe Sept. 9, 2011, letter from Paul Jadin, WEDC\'s chief executive officer\nat the time, was sent to William Minahan, owner of Building Committee Inc.,\na company that is now being sued by WEDC for defaulting on the unsecured\nloan without delivering the promised project and the jobs it was supposed\nto create.\n\n\n\nJadin said in his letter of intent that he was writing "on behalf of\nGovernor Scott Walker" and noted "cc: Scott Walker, Governor" at the bottom.\n\n\n\nWalker\'s top cabinet appointee, then Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch,\nurged WEDC officials to provide the loan, and Walker\'s then-chief of staff\nKeith Gilkes attended an initial meeting on it, according to records\nprovided to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel by the Walker administration.\n\n\n\n"In closing Governor Walker and I are firmly committed to doing everything\npossible to expedite the processing and awarding of this incentive award,"\nJadin wrote in the letter.\n\n\n\nWalker, who with lawmakers created WEDC in July 2011, serves as the\nchairman of the agency\'s board.\n\n\n\nWhile in New Orleans Monday to speak to a school voucher lobbying group,\nWalker said he played no direct role in the loan to foster energy\nefficiency projects for bank and credit union buildings and that Democrats\nare on a "partisan witch hunt."\n\n\n\nSpokeswoman Laurel Patrick said the GOP governor and likely 2016 White\nHouse candidate didn\'t know about the loan and that Walker did not receive\na copy of Jadin\'s letter even though it stated that he did.\n\n\n\n"As we said, Governor Walker was not involved in or aware of any part of\nthe loan process concerning The Building Committee Inc.," Patrick said.\n"That was template language WEDC used initially for award letters. A review\nof our files from that time indicates that we were not receiving copies of\nthose letters."\n\n\n\nPatrick said Walker would hold an "open, thorough, and transparent\ndiscussion" of the loan at WEDC\'s next board meeting.\n\n\n\nDemocrats seek probe\n\n\n\nAlso Monday, two Democratic lawmakers on the WEDC board called for a\nfederal criminal investigation of WEDC and the loan to the Building\nCommittee, which is headed by a donor who made the maximum $10,000\ndonations to the campaigns of both Walker and former Democratic Gov. Jim\nDoyle. There is no evidence so far that the loan led to the promised\nconstruction projects or jobs.\n\n\n\nIt\'s the latest in a string of troubles facing the state\'s main jobs\nagency, which earlier this month faced a tough audit saying it had failed\nto follow state law and its own procedures in its work.\n\n\n\n"The problems at Gov. Walker\'s WEDC appear to go beyond simple\nmismanagement," said Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca (D-Kenosha), who\nappeared alongside a fellow WEDC board member, Sen. Julie Lassa (D-Steven\nPoint). "As board members we are deeply concerned and call for immediate\naction."\n\n\n\nThe offices of John Vaudreuil, the U.S. attorney in Madison, and James\nSantelle, the U.S. attorney in Milwaukee, had no comment.\n\n\n\nPatrick responded that an October 2014 report to the WEDC board, which\nincludes Barca, Lassa and Walker, included the Building Committee in a list\nof past due loans. She said the Democratic lawmakers should have asked for\nmore details on the bad loan at the time, while Barca said it was never\nspecifically flagged to board members in their meetings.\n\n\n\nWalker asked lawmakers on Friday to scrap WEDC\'s loan programs, which in\n2014 ended up deferring payments on 42 out of 220 active loans \xe2\x80\x94 or nearly\none in five.\n\n\n\nBarca said he was skeptical of a statement by Patrick that the governor\ndidn\'t know about the last-minute $10,000 donation that Building Committee\nowner Minahan made to Walker\'s 2010 gubernatorial campaign on election day.\n\n\n\nThe 2011 loan, which was first reported on by the Wisconsin State Journal,\nwas among several WEDC loans noted by state auditors in their recent report\non the agency.\n\n\n\nThe documents provided to the Journal Sentinel show that in June 2011,\nMinahan and Eric Petersen, a lobbyist who represented the business, met to\ndiscuss the loan with Gilkes and Huebsch. At the time, Huebsch also served\non the WEDC board.\n\n\n\nJadin did not respond to a phone message seeking comment.\n\n\n\nPatrick said the project was presented to Huebsch by Building Committee as\na way to create 150 jobs, draw in larger private investment and help many\nbusinesses in the state save money on energy.\n\n\n\nIn a statement made through Administration spokesman Cullen Werwie, Huebsch\nsaid he was approached for help on the project because of several energy\nprograms run out of the Department of Administration, but none of them\ncould help Building Committee. Huebsch, who has since been appointed to a\n$129,000-a-year job at the Public Service Commission, then looked to WEDC\nas another way to help the construction firm, he said in a statement.\n\n\n\n"As the secretary of DOA, I often worked to connect small businesses with\nresources that could lead to job creation," Huebsch said.\n\n\n\nWEDC awarded the unsecured loan only after Huebsch and other agency\nofficials were unable to find funding from state or federal energy\nprograms, the records show.\n\n\n\nEl Sellers, who worked as a salesman for Building Committee in the\nSouthwest, said years before the company faced its financial problems, it\nwas having difficulty getting a building permit in a suburb of Phoenix.\n\n\n\nHe said Monday that company official David Jaeckels told him to make a\npolitical donation to a local elected official and then have the company\nreimburse him for it on his expense report.\n\n\n\nMatt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan, a\nRepublican, said that under Arizona law individuals cannot make political\ndonations in the name of another person and that corporations cannot make\npolitical contributions. Violating these laws can constitute a felony,\naccording to lawscited by Roberts.\n\n\n\nSellers said the donation was $600 to $800, but he could not remember who\nreceived it.\n\n\n\n"I didn\'t think about it twice. I\'m not a child. It\'s money that makes the\nworld go round," Sellers said, adding the company got its building permit\nsoon afterward.\n\n\n\nJaeckels categorically denied the allegation and called Sellers a\n"disgruntled employee."\n\n\n\n"I knew we were involved in talking to a variety of people, but I don\'t\nknow anything about anything like that," he said of having the company\nreimburse Sellers for a donation. "That\'s ludicrous."\n\n\n\nScott Walker touts charters, vouchers in charter-heavy New Orleans Monday\n<http://www.nola.com/education/index.ssf/2015/05/scott_walker_touts_charters_vo.html>\n// NOLA // Jessica Williams - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\'s two sons attend public and private\nuniversities. Matt Walker is a rising senior at the Roman Catholic, Jesuit\nMarquette University. And Alex Walker is a rising junior the University of\nWisconsin-Madison.\n\n\n\nThe young men made different decisions, based on what best suited their\nneeds. That\'s typical for many high school graduates heading to college.\n\n\n\nBut introduce choice in public and secondary schools, and you start to\nshock people, the Republican governor told a room of school choice\nadvocates Monday (May 18) in New Orleans.\n\n\n\nWalker, a likely 2016 presidential candidate, has been championing choice\nand his other Wisconsin initiatives a lot lately. He\'s spoken at dinners,\nconferences and summits all across the nation in recent months, and the\nAmerican Federation for Children\'s Policy Summit in New Orleans Monday was\nno exception. In his 20-minute keynote speech at the Hyatt Regency New\nOrleans, Walker praised charters, vouchers and Wisconsin\'s efforts to\npromote the same. The federation is a strong supporter of both, and -- like\nWalker -- has been no friend to labor unions.\n\n\n\n"School choice" typically encompasses a liberation from public school\nattendance zones. Advocates tend to argue that public money should finance\nadditional options, both public and private. It was perhaps fitting, then,\nfor the federation\'s gathering be in New Orleans, where the vast majority\nof public schools are boundary-free charters, and where still other\nstudents attend private voucher schools.\n\n\n\nChoice is controversial: critics say it affords private entities autonomy\nwith little accountability and can lead to the demise of traditional public\neducation systems, while advocates say innovators need room to do what must\nbe done and public education needs a facelift, anyway.\n\n\n\nFor Walker, however, choice is both a moral and economic imperative. Moral,\nhe said, because every child deserves a great education. Economic, because\non one Wisconsin public agency\'s website alone, there are more than 84,000\njob openings, he noted.\n\n\n\n"That means we can\'t afford to have anybody on the sidelines," he said.\n"That means we need to have people, young people, with access to a great\neducation, in a traditional public school, charter school, choice school\nwith a voucher, private school with a tax benefit, in a virtual school, or\neven a home school."\n\n\n\nImportantly, advocates should remember that strong traditional public\nschools are important, Walker continued. If those systems aren\'t given the\nproper tools -- which he deems are freedom from "big government labor union\nbosses" -- then you risk cases such as Wisconsin teacher Megan Sampson, who\nwas received an outstanding first year teaching award from the Wisconsin\nCouncil of Teachers of English, but who was laid off because of budget cuts\nand the union contract\'s "last-in, first-out" policy.\n\n\n\nHe\'s frequently touted the Sampson story in speeches around the country.\nShe\'s been the face of his signature bill, Act 10, that restricted\ncollective bargaining for most Wisconsin labor unions. "You open the door\nto say... seniority and tenure is gone," he said, to applause from the\ncrowd. "Schools can hire and fire based on merit."\n\n\n\nWalker also has pushed to lift the enrollment cap for vouchers while\nkeeping budgets flat for public schools, moves that have sparked ire in his\nhome state. Still, choice supporters tout his work.\n\n\n\nWhile Walker was the first governor and possible GOP candidate to address\nthe crowd Monday, he wasn\'t the only one. In what appeared to be a late\naddition to the agenda, Gov. Bobby Jindal also was slated to give remarks\nat 5 p.m. Jindal is eyeing the presidency, and announced the creation of an\nexploratory campaign committee Monday.\n\n\n\nChris Christie Now Opposes Creating a Pathway to Citizenship for\nUndocumented Workers\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-05-18/chris-christie-says-he-now-opposes-creating-a-pathway-to-citizenship-for-undocumented-workers>\n// Bloomberg // Terrence Dopp \xe2\x80\x93 May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nThe New Jersey governor says he has changed his mind on the question.\n\n\n\nBy his own admission, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has changed his\ntune.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Christie said that he now opposes providing a pathway to\ncitizenship for undocumented immigrants, something he supported as recently\nas 2010.\n\n\n\n"I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an extreme way to go," Christie said in an interview on FOX\nNews Channel\'s The Kelly File scheduled to air Monday night. "And I think\nthat, quite frankly, what Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s doing right now is pandering.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s pandering. We need to have an intelligent conversation about this\nand bring the American people along to where we can find consensus."\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned over time about this issue and done a lot more\nwork on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie\n\n\n\nChristie, who opted not to run four years ago, is traveling as honorary\nchairman of his political action committee, Leadership Matters for America,\neven though he\'s said he won\'t make a formal announcement on a White House\nrun until later this month or in June.\n\n\n\nHe had a packed day in New Hampshire, starting with a noon speech on\nforeign policy in the waterfront Prescott Park, where John McCain announced\nin 2008. He next held his fifth town hall meeting in three weeks at a VFW\nhall in Hudson.\n\n\n\nThe former federal prosecutor conceded during the interview that the stance\non a pathway to citizenship is a shift from his previous position on the\nmatter. In recent weeks, he has stated that immigrants won\'t "self-deport,"\nadding that there aren\'t enough law enforcement resources to force an\nestimated 11 million people here to leave.\n\n\n\nDuring the interview Christie also knocked President Barack Obama for his\nexecutive action on immigration and said his own shift on the question of\nproviding a pathway to citizenship is an evolution.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned over time about this issue and done a lot more\nwork on it," he said. "And I think everyone has to do what you need to be\nable to get educated on these issues and learn, and back in 2010 I was in\nmy first couple of months as Governor, I\xe2\x80\x99ve now learned some of the\nramifications of some of these things and what I am saying now is we\xe2\x80\x99ve got\nto come up with a solution for it. \xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGov. Christie: American exceptionalism isn\xe2\x80\x99t a punchline \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s a set of\nprinciples.\n<https://medium.com/@ChrisChristie/gov-christie-american-exceptionalism-isn-t-a-punchline-it-s-a-set-of-principles-c2e34107eda5>\n// Medium // Chris Christie \xe2\x80\x93 May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nThanks Renee and thanks Paul for that kind introduction. It\xe2\x80\x99s great to be\nhere.\n\n\n\nToday I\xe2\x80\x99m going to talk about America\xe2\x80\x99s place in the world and how we can\ncreate a new American century \xe2\x80\x94 and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of a better place for\nus to have that conversation. Right across this park is the house of John\nPaul Jones, a proud Irishman and father of the US Navy. And across the\nwater, and over the decades, so many ships have sailed from the great\nPortsmouth Naval Yard in the service of freedom \xe2\x80\x94 and continue to do so.\nThis is a place of history and one that has shaped history at so many\npivotal moments.\n\n\n\nWith that, I want to tell you about another story from history \xe2\x80\x94 a story\nabout a proud son of New Hampshire with a New Jersey connection.\n\n\n\nJohn Winant was a Republican governor of this great state back in the\n1930s. His New Jersey connection? He attended one of New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s great\nschools, Princeton University. He was the first man to serve more than one\nterm as Governor here. And since he was tough enough to survive the\npolitics of Concord, in 1941 the President asked him to take on another\ndifficult job \xe2\x80\x94 US ambassador to Great Britain.\n\n\n\nAs Ambassador Winant, he arrived in London at Britain\xe2\x80\x99s darkest moment.\nLondon was being pounded round the clock by Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s Luftwaffe. German\nU-boats were strangling the country\xe2\x80\x99s food supply. Many people thought that\na German invasion was weeks away.\n\n\n\nFaced with those circumstances, a lesser man might have asked for another\nassignment. Talk about a bad promotion, right? In fact, there were plenty\nof people who thought this was a fool\xe2\x80\x99s errand. The outgoing ambassador,\nJoseph Kennedy \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94 thought Britain\xe2\x80\x99s days were numbered and flew home as\nsoon as he could. He declared that appeasement was the right course of\naction for America. A lot of opinion polls agreed with him.\n\n\n\nWell the new ambassador took a different approach.\n\n\n\nHe flew to England. And the first thing he said when he got off that plane\nwas \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very glad to be here. There\xe2\x80\x99s no place I\xe2\x80\x99d rather be at this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd he meant it. He rallied the morale of the British people, and promised\nthem that America would stand by them. He went out on the streets of London\nand asked people what he could do to help. He counseled President Roosevelt\nnot to give in to appeasement, but to prepare to confront the German menace.\n\n\n\nSo why am I telling you this story? For two reasons.\n\n\n\nFirst, this is a story of New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s impact on the course of history,\nat the moments when our country faced choices that would determine the\ncourse of our future. In this election season, as our country faces new\nchoices and new challenges, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be asked to play that role\nagain.\n\n\n\nBut the other reason? For me, this is a story that embodies the qualities\nthat make our country exceptional.\n\n\n\nNow, American exceptionalism is something that politicians love to talk\nabout. It\xe2\x80\x99s a punch line in a speech that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy.\n\n\n\nBut American exceptionalism isn\xe2\x80\x99t a punch line \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s a set of principles.\n\n\n\nWhen the world faces its darkest moments, we use our strength and resolve\nto light a fire.\n\n\n\nWhen our allies stand up to fight the darkness, we find a way to stand with\nthem.\n\n\n\nWhen a threat appears from over the horizon, our country gets ready \xe2\x80\x94 not\nwhen that threat arrives on our doorstep or when it\xe2\x80\x99s popular.\n\n\n\nAmerica has never been a member of the league of ordinary nations. We have\nnever ignored the crises in the world around us. Because throughout\nhistory, leaders in both parties have based our foreign policy on these\nprinciples \xe2\x80\x94 strength, leadership and partnership with the people and\nnations who share our values. And it\xe2\x80\x99s served the world and us pretty well.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what saved the world 70 years ago. That\xe2\x80\x99s what defeated Soviet\ntyranny. That\xe2\x80\x99s what kept the peace.\n\n\n\nNow, fast forward to today.\n\n\n\nFor the first time since World War Two, Russian troops march across the\nlands of a sovereign European state.\n\n\n\nIn the streets of Baghdad and Damascus, Aden and Tripoli, terror has become\na permanent way of life \xe2\x80\x94 and the sinister black flag of ISIS looms larger\nevery day.\n\n\n\nIn the South China Sea, Chinese vessels raise islands and military bases\nfrom the sea, in disputed waters where they have no right to do so \xe2\x80\x94\nseizing strategic footholds across the region.\n\n\n\nAnd in the holy land, Israeli citizens live their lives in the shadow of\nthe Iranian menace \xe2\x80\x94 while our diplomats toast the promises of the\nayatollahs.\n\n\n\nSo how did this happen? How did it come to this?\n\n\n\nAll these things are happening because American power is in retreat \xe2\x80\x94 and\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve backed away from the principles that made us a source of strength and\nstability.\n\n\n\nNo one understands any longer whom America stands with or against.\n\n\n\nNo one understands exactly what we stand for and what we are willing to\nsacrifice to stand up for it.\n\n\n\nNo one understands if we\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to face the challenges of tomorrow \xe2\x80\x94\nwhile we lurch from crisis to crisis today.\n\n\n\nInstead of consistent, principled policies that made our country respected\nby our allies and feared by our adversaries, we have an intellectual and\nstrategic mess. Once, America sought to lead the world. Now, our President\nleads from behind.\n\n\n\nWell if we want to lead from behind, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be left behind.\n\n\n\nWe give up our claim to be the leader of the free world. We give up the\npartnerships for peace that defined the American century. And we give up\nthe chance of another American century. The world will be more dangerous\nand less prosperous.\n\n\n\nFor six years, a lot of people in our country have been worried about the\npath we\xe2\x80\x99re on. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to feel like that anymore, and I bet you\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t either.\n\n\n\nSo I think we ought to take a different approach.\n\n\n\nWe need to change course as a country and embrace a foreign policy based on\nthe timeless principles that helped America to lead the world.\n\n\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s talk about what a policy agenda looks like for a truly exceptional\nnation, at a time of extraordinary global challenges \xe2\x80\x94 and how we get the\nstrength, tools and partnerships to lead the world\n\n\n\nStronger defense\n\n\n\nUnder our Constitution, the first and most important job of our government\nis to protect every American and our way of life. That means keeping our\nmilitary strong must be at the heart of any global agenda.\n\n\n\nA strong military doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just help us to deal with the threats we face. It\nhelps eliminate them before we even see them.\n\n\n\nOver the last 70 years, our world has entered an unprecedented era of peace\nand prosperity. Nations have risen from the ashes of war; new industries\nhave reshaped the world. Europe became free and united, and democracies\nmultiplied across Latin America, Asia and Africa. And all of this took\nplace only because a strong America served as the anchor and organizer of\nglobal stability. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be a global policeman who solved every\nproblem, but it was enough for our allies to know we had their back \xe2\x80\x94 to\ngive them a zone for peace in which to choose a future for themselves.\n\n\n\nNow, our country reaped the rewards of this strategy for decades because we\nhad responsible leaders in both parties who ensured that the military never\nbecome a partisan plaything. Partisanship is a fact of life in our\npolitical system, and a price worth paying to keep our democracy\naccountable, strong and vibrant. But our armed services were beyond this \xe2\x80\x94\nbecause keeping our country safe should never be up for debate.\n\n\n\nBut lately, things have changed.\n\n\n\nOver the last few years, Washington has grown more and more dysfunctional.\nAnd instead of reaching sensible compromises over spending, the President\nand Congress have made decisions that have compromised our military.\n\n\n\nLast year, the National Defense Panel, a bipartisan commission chartered by\nCongress, concluded that cuts in defense spending imposed by sequestration\nhave been a \xe2\x80\x9cserious strategic misstep.\xe2\x80\x9d By forcing deep, across-the-board\ncuts in military spending since 2011, Congress and the President have tied\nthe hands of our commanders and created a readiness crisis in our armed\nservices. Now we have fighter pilots who can\xe2\x80\x99t get enough hours in the\nskies to train, ships that can\xe2\x80\x99t patrol the routes we need to, and only a\nhandful of Army brigades ready to deploy at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\n\n\n\nIf we want to effectively deliver on our entire national defense strategy,\nthen we need to fix this.\n\n\n\nWe need ground forces that can respond to crises on multiple fronts,\nwithout compromising our capacity for deterrence. The Army and Marines\nshould not be reduced below their pre-9/11 strength, and our active duty\nforces should be at 500,000 Army soldiers and 185,000 Marines.\n\n\n\nOur Navy should have more ships. In this century, to secure our global\ninterests our Navy will be called upon to assume even greater challenges\nand responsibilities. But even as our maritime needs grow, we\xe2\x80\x99re cutting\nback and right now are on a budgetary path to 260 ships or less. That\xe2\x80\x99s\njust wrong. Our Navy bears the greatest burden of our forward-presence\nmissions, and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be equipped to do the bare minimum. We should have\nat least 350 ships \xe2\x80\x94 and our Navy should be an armada without equal.\n\n\n\nAnd we need a larger Air Force. Our Air Force now has the oldest and\nsmallest combat force in its history, and we\xe2\x80\x99re on track to reduce our\ninventory of bomber, fighter and surveillance forces by 50% over the next 4\nyears. Well, when it comes to maintaining our air supremacy, winging it\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do. We should modernize the Air Force and build up to 2,500 combat\ncoded aircraft as part of a total force of 6,000 aircraft capable of\ncarrying out all the missions we know our pilots will face in the years\nahead. Americans were the first to conquer the skies \xe2\x80\x94 let\xe2\x80\x99s not concede\nthem.\n\n\n\nSo we need to give our men and women in uniform the resources they need to\nget the job done \xe2\x80\x94 and we owe it to them. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Congress and the\nPresident should repeal the 2011 Budget Control Act as soon as humanly\npossible, get back to regular order in budgeting and restore funding levels\nto what Secretary Gates proposed in his fiscal 2012 budget \xe2\x80\x94 modest\nincreases in defense spending through the end of the decade that will make\na massive difference to our troops. It\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do \xe2\x80\x94 and we\nshould do it now.\n\n\n\nBut that\xe2\x80\x99s just the start. We also need to innovate to fight the battles of\nthe future.\n\n\n\nFor a long time our military has led the world not just through the skill\nand the courage of our troops, but the ingenuity of our scientists and\nengineers. Our forces are the envy of the world because they\xe2\x80\x99re also the\nbest equipped in the world.\n\n\n\nBut the world is catching up \xe2\x80\x94 and our rivals are working hard to copy and\nsteal our best-kept secrets. Today, Russia has stealth fighters, a new\ngeneration of battle tanks, and a growing military presence in the Arctic.\nChina has its first aircraft carrier, with more on the way, double digit\nincreases in military spending every year, and cutting-edge cyber warriors\nalways, seemingly, one step ahead of our own. And in just the last few\nmonths, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen North Korean hackers targeting Hollywood and the\nRussians reading President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s email. That\xe2\x80\x99s just embarrassing.\n\n\n\nSo we need to work harder to keep our edge. We need to invest in building\nthe military of the future. We need to build a new generation of weapon\nsystems to protect our interests on every front \xe2\x80\x94 on the ground, on the\nseas, in the air or new frontiers even further out. We need to invest in\nunmanned aviation, directed energy weapons and space. We should continue to\nbe leaders in undersea warfare, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we should speed up the build\nrate of our Virginia-class attack submarines and support the replacement of\nthe Ohio class. And when it comes to cyber warfare, we need to be ready not\njust to defend against threats to our vital national systems, we need the\noffensive capabilities to deter our enemies \xe2\x80\x94 or strike back if they don\xe2\x80\x99t\ntake the hint. To keep our country safe in this century, we need to\nmaintain the digital balance of power.\n\n\n\nAnd if we want our armed forces to get the right tools at the right time,\nin a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t waste taxpayer money, we need to fundamentally reform\nour entire DoD procurement process.\n\n\n\nBetween 2001 and 2011, the DoD spent around $44 billion dollars on weapon\nprograms that were eventually cancelled. Weapons that have overrun their\nbudgets by hundreds of billions of dollars and failed to live up to\nexpectations. And across the board, military officials spend millions of\ndollars every year dealing with red tape and byzantine reporting\nrequirements just to get the weapons we need.\n\n\n\nClearly, something isn\xe2\x80\x99t right here in our procurement process.\nBusiness-as-usual bureaucrats in Washington aren\xe2\x80\x99t taking care of business.\nSo we need to adopt real world, private sector practices across our\nprocurement system, and remove wasteful, overlapping functions. Bureaucracy\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t burden our troops, and we should attack it with the same energy\nas any other threat to our defense.\n\n\n\nStronger intelligence\n\n\n\nSo a strong defense needs to be the first cornerstone of our foreign policy.\n\n\n\nThe second is strengthening our intelligence efforts.\n\n\n\nThis is something very close to my heart. Because I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen up close just\nhow important our intelligence community is to defending our way of life.\n\n\n\nOn the morning of September 11, my wife Mary Pat was working just two\nblocks from the World Trade Center. She got evacuated from Manhattan by\nferry, and I was so unbelievably grateful and relieved that she was all\nright. But like many of you, there were other people in our lives \xe2\x80\x94\nfriends, colleagues, loved ones \xe2\x80\x94 who didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it. A friend from our\nchurch. The brother of one of Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s teachers. Parents of their\nclassmates. And for New Jersey as a whole, we lost so many people on that\nterrible day \xe2\x80\x94 the second most deaths of any state other than the State of\nNew York.\n\n\n\nThose weeks after the attacks were such a scary and unpredictable time for\neveryone. But it was also in that time that President Bush nominated me to\nbe US Attorney for the District of New Jersey. I was informed by the White\nHouse on September 10, 2001 that I would be nominated for US Attorney for\nthe District of New Jersey, and I was confirmed to that post on December\n10, three months later. And by then it was clear what I was going to be\nworking on for the next few years.\n\n\n\nIn early 2002, John Ashcroft called all the US Attorneys into the Justice\nDepartment. And he gave us a message from the President. What happened on\n9/11 must never happen again \xe2\x80\x94 and it was up to all of us to prevent it. We\nhad a responsibility to go after the terrorists with every legal instrument\nat our disposal.\n\n\n\nWell I took that to heart. Because I remembered what it felt like to be\nwaiting for a phone call from Mary Pat, hoping and praying that she was\nsafe. I know what it feels like to lose people when they should be safe \xe2\x80\x94\nat work, on our streets. This is not theoretical to me. I lived it in my\nhome. Everything changed that morning in September.\n\n\n\nSo for the next seven years of my life, my office focused on fighting\nterrorism every day.\n\n\n\nWe started by bringing the first post-9/11 terrorism case in the country.\nThis was a case against a man called Hemant Lekhani, an Indian-born British\ncitizen who tried to buy and sell shoulder-fired missiles on the black\nmarket, that could take down a plane. He thought he was dealing with a\nterror organization, but he was actually dealing with a joint operation\nbetween the FBI and the Russians. We investigated that case using tools\nincluding the Patriot Act \xe2\x80\x94 and we ended up getting him convicted and sent\nto jail for the rest of his life.\n\n\n\nAnother case was the Fort Dix Six. These were six radical Islamists who\nwere conspiring to attack soldiers at Fort Dix in New Jersey. They tried to\nbuy weapons and explosives from an underground weapons dealer who was\nactually an FBI informant \xe2\x80\x94 the result of a 16-month operation with the FBI\nand Justice Department to infiltrate the group. It was incredible\ncoordination, and we got the entire group behind bars.\n\n\n\nSo I\xe2\x80\x99ve used all the tools we had to go after terror. I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the Patriot\nAct myself and personally reviewed the applications. I\xe2\x80\x99ve prosecuted\nterrorists, and sent terrorists to jail. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what happens when\nour intelligence community, legal system and law enforcement work together.\nWe can use information to save lives.\n\n\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s why intelligence matters. At the simplest level, intelligence helps\nus prevent the next attack. But at its best, intelligence is a force\nmultiplier for all our national capabilities. If we want to manage events \xe2\x80\x94\nand not have events manage us \xe2\x80\x94 then we need superior knowledge of the\nworld around us.\n\n\n\nStrength and knowledge go hand in hand \xe2\x80\x94 and should always be at the core\nof our strategy.\n\n\n\nNow, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some good successes over the last few years. The way Bin\nLaden was caught shows exactly how our intelligence efforts should work.\nThat took ten years of investment in building our human intelligence\ncapabilities. It took an immense effort to track individual cell phones\nacross Pakistan and Afghanistan. And it was the payoff for years of\ntraining and equipping our SEAL teams to get the job done. President Obama\nand President Bush deserve credit for laying the foundations for that\noperation, and most of all, the brave troops and operatives on the ground\nwho made this happen.\n\n\n\nBut we need more efforts like that. We need to be constantly building those\nfoundations for the threats over the horizon, and the next set of\nchallenges we need to solve.\n\n\n\nToday, we\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing that progress. Instead, Washington is debating the\nwrong question entirely \xe2\x80\x94 which intelligence capabilities should we get rid\nof?\n\n\n\nToo often, the loudest voices in the debate about how to keep our country\nsafe are driven by some purist, theoretical vision of how we should manage\nour intelligence efforts.\n\n\n\nWhen Edward Snowden revealed our intelligence secrets to the world in 2013,\ncivil liberties extremists seized that moment to advance their own narrow\nagenda. They want you to think that there\xe2\x80\x99s a government spook listening in\nevery time you pick up the phone or Skype with your grandkids. They want\nyou to think of our intelligence community as the bad guys, straight out of\nthe Bourne Identity or a Hollywood thriller. And they want you to think\nthat if we weakened our capabilities, the rest of the world would love us\nmore.\n\n\n\nLet me be clear \xe2\x80\x94 all these fears are exaggerated and ridiculous. When it\ncomes to fighting terrorism, our government is not the enemy. And we\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t listen to people like Edward Snowden, a criminal who hurt our\ncountry and now enjoys the hospitality of President Putin \xe2\x80\x94 while sending\nus messages about the dangers of authoritarian government. And, frankly, we\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t need advice from Hollywood, the guys who made our intelligence\nagencies the villains in practically every movie from the last twenty-five\nyears.\n\n\n\nBut instead of taking on the ideologues, the Obama administration and the\nDemocrats have taken the path of least resistance. They\xe2\x80\x99ve apologized for\nour intelligence collection, promised that we will collect it only in ways\nthat protect the privacy of foreign citizens, and cut back on vital funding\nfor our intelligence services.\n\n\n\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ve politicized intelligence oversight and demoralized our intelligence\ncommunity. Last year, Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee\nreleased a one-sided and inaccurate attack on our intelligence services.\nDemocrats behind that report should be ashamed for putting partisanship\nabove genuine oversight in the way they released this. And it\xe2\x80\x99s just\ndisgraceful the way there are folks on the Hill who want American\nintelligence weaker and less informed just to drive their own personal\npolitical agendas.\n\n\n\nSo instead of support, our intelligence services get condemnations. Instead\nof resources, they get regulations. Instead of building a community that\xe2\x80\x99s\ntrusted and equipped to go after the hard targets, we have a risk-averse\nintelligence service. The watchword from this administration isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\n\xe2\x80\x9cCollect all the information you can about a dangerous world,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9ccollect\nonly what you have to have.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe next time there\xe2\x80\x99s a phone call to a terrorist safe house in Yemen from\nSan Diego or New Jersey, would our agents dare to listen in?\n\n\n\nWell, we\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a risk-averse military. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we want a\nrisk-averse intelligence service. So we need to fix this.\n\n\n\nWe need to treat intelligence as a practical issue, not a theoretical one.\nWe need to be practical about preventing real civil liberties abuses\nwherever they occur. That\xe2\x80\x99s what a vigilant, responsible Congress, not a\npartisan one, would accomplish with vigorous oversight. That\xe2\x80\x99s what a truly\napolitical Justice Department would do by pursuing real legal violations by\nany member of our intelligence community who steps over the line.\nProtecting our homeland must be an uncompromising priority.\n\n\n\nThe vast majority of Americans aren\xe2\x80\x99t worried about the government\nlistening in on them, because it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened. But they are worried\nabout what happens if we don\xe2\x80\x99t catch the bad people who want to harm our\ncountry.\n\n\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s how we catch them.\n\n\n\nWe need to toughen our anti-terror and surveillance laws to give our\nintelligence services the legal mechanisms to do their job.\n\n\n\nOver the last couple of years, most of our allies including the UK, France,\nCanada and Australia, have announced plans to toughen their laws to better\ndetect and prevent terrorism and extremism. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re the only major\ncountry talking about going in the opposite direction.\n\n\n\nWe should begin by passing a clean extension of the Patriot Act. At the end\nof May, vital pieces of that legislation are going to expire, including\nSection 215 \xe2\x80\x94 essential for our intelligence agencies to access the data\nthey need to stop suspected terrorists. I used this tool extensively,\naggressively and legally as US Attorney and I can tell you this: it works.\nThis is a big debate in Congress right now, and different courts have\nexpressed their views on the program too. But right now, that debate is\ndominated by the intellectual purists worried about theoretical abuses that\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t occurred \xe2\x80\x94 instead of the real threats that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen from\nGarland, Texas, to Ft. Dix, New Jersey.\n\n\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re an ordinary, law-abiding American, this legislation has\nabsolutely no effect on you \xe2\x80\x94 except it could prevent the next attack from\ntaking place in our country, killing our fellow citizens. Absolutely no one\nhas a single real example of our intelligence services misusing this\nprogram for political or other nefarious purposes. And we have incredibly\nstringent oversight of these provisions. I wish I could say the same about\nthe Internal Revenue Service in this administration. The critics have\nchosen the wrong target. But if they had a leg to stand on, they would ask\nfor greater oversight of Section 215. But they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to because that\nwould mean more responsibility and accountability for them. Simply put,\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re on the wrong side of this debate.\n\n\n\nSo let\xe2\x80\x99s move beyond this. Let\xe2\x80\x99s give our people the tools they need to get\nthe job done.\n\n\n\nPart of that also means properly funding our intelligence services and\nallowing them to keep innovating and improving their capabilities. We need\nto invest in new technologies and infrastructure to support our signals\nintelligence, so that we can actually interpret all the data we\xe2\x80\x99re\ngathering. Today\xe2\x80\x99s problem isn\xe2\x80\x99t having too little information; it\xe2\x80\x99s having\ntoo much. So we need to invest in turning noise into understanding.\n\n\n\nOne of the ways we can do that is by building a stronger and more\nproductive relationship with Silicon Valley. Our entrepreneurs and\ninnovators are some of our strongest assets as a country, and the work\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re doing to connect the world helps to improve all our lives. So we\nshould be clear that we have no interest in reading the Facebook messages\nand tweets of ordinary Americans. We want a strong and secure internet. But\nwe need the tools to find the people who would hurt our country so that\npeople can carry on enjoying the benefits of Facebook and Twitter and\nGoogle. Our government should treat our tech community as our partners, not\nour enemies. And when foreign governments try to use the Snowden leaks to\njustify protectionism and attacks on our companies, we need to fight for\nthem \xe2\x80\x94 and with something more than apologies.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, we need to strengthen our human intelligence capabilities\nin the parts of the world where they\xe2\x80\x99re weakest. Our country has reacted\ntoo slowly to the return of Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s aggression and the rise of ISIS partly\nbecause of our lack of investment in human intelligence. America should\nnever be caught napping because we chose not to invest in dealing with the\nhard targets \xe2\x80\x94 Russia, Iran, North Korea.\n\n\n\nAnd closer to home, we can do more to strengthen our cooperation and\nintelligence sharing with our neighbors, as well as our allies in Europe.\nWe face common challenges and enemies, so we ought to have common\nsolutions. With Canada and Mexico we should be sharing more information\nabout overseas travelers to both countries, and greater cooperation with\nMexico to police their side of the border. And with Europe, in particular\nthe countries in the visa waiver program, we should be doing more to\nencourage the sharing of digital data and information about extremist\nthreats. Ensuring the collective security of our allies should be something\nthey welcome, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the price for all our partnerships.\n\n\n\nStronger alliances\n\n\n\nWith that in mind, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about the final pillar of our stronger\nforeign policy \xe2\x80\x94 building stronger alliances.\n\n\n\nAs Governor, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had the chance to meet with a lot of foreign leaders and\npartners from overseas. Over the last couple of years I\xe2\x80\x99ve met with the\nleaders of our closest allies, from Canada and Mexico, to Israel and Great\nBritain.\n\n\n\nEverywhere I go, I hear the same thing from our allies \xe2\x80\x94 we want America to\nbe a strong global leader. We want you to step up and lead.\n\n\n\nBecause that\xe2\x80\x99s who we are. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just our strength and intelligence that\ndefines us as a country; it\xe2\x80\x99s our willingness to stand with those who share\nour values and interests. We became the leader of the free world because we\nalso chose to become the arsenal of democracy. And when we make a\ncommitment to stand with our allies, our word is our bond. Or at least it\nused to be.\n\n\n\nThroughout history, our leaders and diplomats have lived their lives to\nextend that bond. Our soldiers have died to defend it.\n\n\n\nBut right now, we have a government that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to care about all the\nblood and sweat and treasure that it took to build those alliances. Because\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve broken our word.\n\n\n\nIn 2013, President Obama talked about defending a red line for our nation\nif the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against his\nown people. Well, he used chemical weapons on his people. President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\nresponse? Never mind. His unwillingness to stand behind his own words has\nmade America weaker and less reliable in the world. He damaged the\ncredibility of the Presidency.\n\n\n\nAnd when the world saw that our word was not our bond, are we surprised at\nwhat happened next?\n\n\n\nAre we surprised that Vladimir Putin chose to annex Crimea and invade\neastern Ukraine?\n\n\n\nAre we surprised that Iranian-backed militias are rampaging across Yemen?\n\n\n\nAre we surprised that Bashar al-Assad continues to butcher thousands of\nmen, women, using barrel bombs and conventional munitions dropped out of\nRussian helicopters? Or that with Iranian support, the moderate Syrian\nopposition has been sidelined by extremists and ISIS?\n\n\n\nSo whoever is going to be our next Commander-in-Chief is going to make\nrestoring America\xe2\x80\x99s word a priority. We need to make it clear to our\nfriends and allies that we stand with them in the cause of freedom, and\nagainst all the gathering threats. We will stand together, because we\ncannot stand alone. And we must return America to the leadership role the\nworld needs and expects.\n\n\n\nIn Europe, our first task is to defend the Western alliance against Russian\naggression.\n\n\n\nWe have spent 70 years of blood and treasure, first to defeat Nazism and\nthen to defeat Soviet totalitarianism to establish and maintain a free and\nunited Europe. Now President Obama and Secretary Clinton are giving this\nsacred investment away for nothing with their inane reset button.\n\n\n\nIn March, the Polish government started offering military training to any\ncivilians between the ages of 18 and 50 who wanted it. On the very first\nday they opened up that program, 1,000 people signed up. And then they kept\ncoming.\n\n\n\nWhen Polish civilians are drilling to defend the streets of Warsaw once\nagain, you know our Europe policy is a scary failure to our allies. And we\nneed to have our allies\xe2\x80\x99 backs. And we need to do it now.\n\n\n\nWe need to stand up to Russian aggression together, and make clear that our\ncommitment to our NATO allies in Eastern Europe is absolute. And if Putin\xe2\x80\x99s\nRussia wants to rejoin the community of civilized nations, then they\xe2\x80\x99re\ngoing to have to behave like one.\n\n\n\nWe need to bolster our allies by helping them get access to the weapons\nsystems and training they need to defend themselves. We should strengthen\nNATO\xe2\x80\x99s military presence in the Baltic states, and make clear to all our\nEastern European allies that we will not allow the freedoms they\xe2\x80\x99ve won\nsince the Cold War to be reversed. We should give Ukraine the weapons it\nneeds to defend itself.\n\n\n\nWe should also put the pressure on all our NATO allies to invest more in\ntheir own defense. After the Cold War, too many of our European allies\nrushed to cut their military spending and enjoy the dividend of peace. Well\nnow they need to invest, and fulfill their NATO commitments to spend at\nleast 2% of GDP on defense annually. It\xe2\x80\x99s not because we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to\nhave their backs \xe2\x80\x94 Europe just needs to watch their front as well, and\nclose the big and increasing capabilities gap that we saw between our\nforces and theirs at moments like Kosovo in 1999 and Libya in 2011. And\neven as Europe increases spending, we should work with them to avoid\nduplication in capabilities across the alliance. They don\xe2\x80\x99t all need to\nrush out and buy tanks, but they might benefit from investing more in cyber\nwarfare, missile defense, precision weapons and artillery \xe2\x80\x94 the things we\nneed more of.\n\n\n\nAnd as for Russia \xe2\x80\x94 until Putin chooses the path of peace, we should keep\napplying pressure.\n\n\n\nJust a couple of months ago, the head of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s FSB \xe2\x80\x94 the old KGB \xe2\x80\x94 was\ninvited to the White House for a summit on \xe2\x80\x9ccountering extremism.\xe2\x80\x9d We\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t just invite the fox into the hen house, we let in the bear. That\njust seems crazy to me. Instead, we should immediately put travel bans and\nasset freezes on every member of the Russian parliament and Putin\xe2\x80\x99s entire\ncircle \xe2\x80\x94 including Putin himself. We know who holds the leash on the dogs\nof war. So let\xe2\x80\x99s not mess around on this. And if that still isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough,\nwe should look at tougher sanctions on Russia\xe2\x80\x99s energy and financial\nsectors \xe2\x80\x94 and hit them where it really hurts.\n\n\n\nHow we deal with Russia is a test for how we stand with all our allies\neverywhere. We cannot back down, and we need a leader who won\xe2\x80\x99t back down.\n\n\n\nBut there are other places we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be tested too, and other allies\nwe need to defend.\n\n\n\nAt the top of the list is Israel. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be short and sweet here. Our\ncommitment to Israel must be absolute.\n\n\n\nIsrael is a beacon of freedom in a sea of autocracy, and our friendship\nshould be unshakable. Over the last few years, the Obama administration has\ntaken our Israeli partners for granted and it\xe2\x80\x99s just shameful the way the\nPresident has treated them. When the President is barely on speaking terms\nwith Prime Minister Netanyahu, and waited two days to call and congratulate\nhim after his election, that\xe2\x80\x99s just immature. If we can\xe2\x80\x99t be respectful to\nour best friends in the world, then we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get very far with\nanyone else \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise this administration has such an abysmal\nrecord on diplomacy.\n\n\n\nFinally, Israel and its people must be supported by the United States and\nthe American President. Its existence and security is non-negotiable. The\nIranians and others who think otherwise must be reminded of that simple\nfact.\n\n\n\nAlso damaging to our partnership with Israel, is just the staggering\nstrategic incompetence and disinterest in countering the rising threats\nacross the Middle East and North Africa \xe2\x80\x94 threats that if left unchecked,\nwill compromise Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security and future. If we truly care about\ndefending Israel, then we need to consider what the region will look like\ntomorrow \xe2\x80\x94 and then take action today. President Obama seems unwilling to\nstand up to anyone in the Middle East \xe2\x80\x94 except for Prime Minister\nNetanyahu. It is embarrassing and dangerous.\n\n\n\nWe have a lot of work to do.\n\n\n\nWith Iran, the President\xe2\x80\x99s eagerness for a deal on their nuclear program\nhas him ready to accept a bad deal. The framework we\xe2\x80\x99ve negotiated here\nseems pretty flimsy, and I have grave concerns over how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make\nthe Iranians live up to their end of the bargain and how we can ensure\nproper, verifiable compliance. So until we get that, we should have the\nstrength to keep our guard up and keep our sanctions up. The deal as\nstructured will lead to a nuclear Iran and, then, a nuclearized Middle\nEast. That not only threatens Israel. It threatens the United States and\nturns 70 years of nuclear policy on its head.\n\n\n\nIran has also been pretty busy across the region, and almost everywhere\nIran opposes US goals. In Yemen, they\xe2\x80\x99ve launched a proxy war that has\ndevastated our ally and represents a clear and present danger to world. And\nwhile Iran has supported Iraq in fighting back against ISIS, their motives\nare hardly benign, and we know they have a long-term interest in building a\npower base in Iraq.\n\n\n\nIran might not have the bomb right now \xe2\x80\x94 but their influence is absolutely\nradioactive to the world. So we need to contain it with our moderate Sunni\nArab allies, while at the same time rolling back the shadow of ISIS. We\nneed to do more to organize our allies into a strong coalition on the\nground in Yemen, and to train and equip the moderate opposition to Assad in\nSyria and the tribal elements in Iraq that are a threat to peace. We should\ndevelop new tools to blunt Iran\xe2\x80\x99s regional influence, including ways to\nfight the flow of cash to their puppets: Hezbollah, the Houthis, Syria and\nIraqi militants. We should link our sanctions regime to the threat Iran\nposes to the region, and treat all these threats as connected, which the\nObama Administration doesn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x94 and come up with a real coherent strategy\nwith our Sunni partners.\n\n\n\nThe price of inaction is steadily rising. Just last week we saw the\nembarrassment of almost all the Gulf leaders, including the Saudi King,\npulling out of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s summit at Camp David. Our allies want\npolicies, not photo ops, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not listening to them. And as we fail to\nconfront Iran\xe2\x80\x99s shadowy nuclear program and undisguised quest for regional\npower, we raise the likelihood of states taking unilateral actions or\nseeking extreme solutions. If we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to stop Iran getting a\nnuclear capability, then why would the Saudis or Egyptians or Emiratis\nchoose not to follow? If we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a plan to stop Bashar al-Assad in\nSyria, or Iraq in Yemen, what\xe2\x80\x99s to stop governments lending support to\nproxy forces like Al Qaeda and ISIS?\n\n\n\nIn August the President announced a campaign to degrade and destroy ISIS.\nBut right now they seem to be getting stronger every day, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve just\nwitnessed ISIS taking full control of Ramadi, the capital of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s largest\nprovince. So right now our piecemeal strategy to deal with ISIS doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\ninspire confidence.\n\n\n\nWhen allies lose confidence in us, they take matters into their own hands.\nI think it\xe2\x80\x99s better for America to extend a helping hand \xe2\x80\x94 and help manage\nevents.\n\n\n\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why we also need to strengthen our alliances across the\nAsia-Pacific region.\n\n\n\nThis century, more than any other, will be defined by the Pacific. So I\nthink it\xe2\x80\x99s important we work to build on our relationships with our core\nallies in the region, Australia, Japan, the Philippines and Korea, as well\nas newer partners, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Burma and Vietnam.\n\n\n\nNow, the President has talked about leading a pivot to Asia in our foreign\nand security policy. We\xe2\x80\x99ve taken some of the right steps, like working to\nstrengthen our economic ties with our Asian partners through the\nTrans-Pacific Partnership. But generally, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t matched strategy with\ncapabilities, particularly in terms of our defensive deployments. 2,500\nmarines in Australia, a couple of Littoral Combat Ships in Singapore, and\nexercises in Philippines are a start. But compare that to China\xe2\x80\x99s double\ndigit growth in military spending every year, with thousands of missiles\npointed across the Taiwan Straits, next generation fighter jets and soon,\nlikely a full blue water capable fleet with aircraft carriers. And we still\nface an unpredictable and dangerous regime in North Korea, and extremist\nthreats across the region.\n\n\n\nIf we don\xe2\x80\x99t upgrade our presence in the region, then we won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to\nkeep our commitments to our allies. The President\xe2\x80\x99s pivot to Asia might\njust be a pendulum to Asia. So I think we should match words with deeds,\nand alliances with strength. We need to reposition more of our fleet and\nour forces across the region, and give our allies the capabilities they\nneed to respond to the threats of the future. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to fuel a\nregional arms race, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason we can\xe2\x80\x99t help our allies upgrade\ntheir capabilities with stronger coastal defenses, submarines, maritime\nreconnaissance equipment and other defensive equipment.\n\n\n\nNothing about these policies is about treating China like a foe. China is a\ngreat nation, and we want them to be a partner. Our countries have so much\nto learn and to offer one another, and if we can work together, we can\ncreate a century of greater prosperity and security. But we must never shy\naway from demanding that China live up to the rules of the global\ncommunity, and respect the human rights of its own people and the\nsovereignty of our allies \xe2\x80\x94 and we should make clear that the United States\nwill always stand by its allies, no matter what.\n\n\n\nLet me be clear. Strengthening America\xe2\x80\x99s defenses and our intelligence\ncommunity, and sending clear and resolute signals to allies and adversaries\nalike will not lead to war. It will build the foundations of peace. It will\nlead to fair negotiations, not one-sided ones. It will lead us towards\nstability and away from indecision and chaos. It will strengthen existing\nalliances and build new ones. It will reestablish American credibility in\nthe world \xe2\x80\x94 with everyone.\n\n\n\nAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s word will once again be our bond \xe2\x80\x94 as it always should have been.\n\n\n\nA great generation\n\n\n\nSo that\xe2\x80\x99s how I see an American foreign policy designed for the times we\nlive in \xe2\x80\x94 and for an exceptional country. We need a stronger defense,\nstronger intelligence and stronger alliances. When we add strength to\nknowledge, and work with partners who share our interests and values, we\ncan create a world that is safer, stronger and more prosperous.\n\n\n\nBut there\xe2\x80\x99s one more thing we need to do. We need to banish cynicism.\n\n\n\nToday there are plenty of voices that say that America\xe2\x80\x99s time as a global\nleader has passed. We can\xe2\x80\x99t change the world. We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change the\nworld. The challenges we face are too great \xe2\x80\x94 and our power too small.\n\n\n\nThat might be true of an ordinary nation. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not us.\n\n\n\nPresident Reagan once said that \xe2\x80\x9cabove all, we must realize that no arsenal\nor no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and\nmoral courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries in\ntoday\xe2\x80\x99s world do not have. It is a weapon that we as Americans do have.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe was right. And that will and courage will lead us forward.\n\n\n\nToday, we live in cynical times with cynical politics. If we\xe2\x80\x99re going to\nkeep making progress as a country, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to fix that and get\nour domestic house in order. That\xe2\x80\x99s a longer discussion \xe2\x80\x94 and one that I\xe2\x80\x99m\nlooking forward to having with all of you in the weeks and months ahead.\n\n\n\nBut none of us should doubt our ability to lead in this new century. This\ncan be the second American century. It must be. We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fear that\nchallenge.\n\n\n\nOur forefathers\xe2\x80\x99 generation was called \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest generation\xe2\x80\x9d because\nthey put their lives on the line to protect our way of life \xe2\x80\x94 and because\nthey overcame the greatest challenges. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t achieve greatness\nbecause the challenges were too few. It was because they faced many, and\nthey dared to confront them.\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s only when we dare to face the big challenges that we can achieve\ngreatness. Courage is not the absence of fear \xe2\x80\x94 it is the presence of fear,\nbut with the will to go on fighting.\n\n\n\nWell we have a chance today to face big challenges and to overcome them.

"So we need to contain it with\nour moderate Sunni Arab allies, while at the same time rolling back the\nshadow of ISIS," he said, using another acronym for Islamic State.\n\n\n\nChristie, who served as a U.S. attorney before he was elected governor,\nwill also seek to distance himself from the crowded Republican field by\noffering an unapologetic defense of the U.S.\'s intelligence-collection\nefforts.\n\n\n\nHe will specifically take aim at former National Security Agency contractor\nEdward Snowden, who in 2013 leaked thousands of documents to journalists.\nAmong Snowden\'s revelations: NSA had for years been secretly collecting\nmillions of Americans\' phone records. Christie has previously said that\nprogram should continue.\n\n\n\n"When Edward Snowden revealed our intelligence secrets to the world in\n2013, civil liberties extremists seized that moment to advance their own\nnarrow agenda," he will say, according to the excerpts. "They want you to\nthink that there\'s a government spook listening in every time you pick up\nthe phone or Skype with your grandkids. They want you to think of our\nintelligence community as the bad guys, straight out of the Bourne Identity\nor a Hollywood thriller. And they want you to think that if we weakened our\ncapabilities, the rest of the world would love us more."\n\n\n\n"Let me be clear \xe2\x80\x94 all these fears are baloney," he said.\n\n\n\n"When it comes to fighting terrorism, our government is not the enemy,"\nChristie says in his prepared remarks.\n\n\n\nThe House voted last week to end the bulk phone records collection program\nand replace it with a system to search the data held by telephone companies\non a case-by-case basis\n\n\n\nThe speech will be the third that Christie has delivered in recent weeks in\nthe early-voting state as he lays the groundwork for an expected campaign.\nHis previous speeches focused on overhauling Social Security and lowering\ntaxes on individuals and corporations.\n\n\n\nChristie has been working to try to re-establish his place in the top tier\nof likely candidates after the fallout from the George Washington Bridge\nscandal.\n\n\n\nChris Christie, Rand Paul Bring Patriot Act Debate to Campaign Trail\n<http://www.wsj.com/articles/chris-christie-rand-paul-bring-patriot-act-debate-to-campaign-trail-1431975852>\n// WSJ // Heather Haddon and Janet Hook - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie faulted Washington lawmakers for debating\nthe merits of the Patriot Act and said there were no substantiated examples\nthat the post-Sept. 11 security law has abused the civil liberties of\nAmerican citizens.\n\n\n\nIn a foreign-policy speech delivered in New Hampshire Monday, the potential\n2016 presidential candidate called for a reauthorization of the Patriot Act\nas it currently stands and criticized any attempts to scale back the bulk\ncollection of American phone records by the National Security Agency.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next time there\xe2\x80\x99s a phone call to a terrorist safe house in Yemen from\nSan Diego or New Jersey, would our agents dare to listen in?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\nChristie, during the 45-minute speech in Portsmouth, N.H. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\nwant a risk-averse intelligence service.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s defense of the NSA phone-data collection program puts him\nsquarely at odds with Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a presidential candidate who\nMonday reiterated his threat to mount a Senate filibuster over the issue.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will do everything possible, including filibustering the Patriot Act,\nto stop them,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Paul said, according to the Associated Press,\nacknowledging that he might not have enough allies to succeed in blocking\nthe program. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have the votes inside the Beltway. But we have the votes\noutside the Beltway, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have that fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Paul has made the issue a centerpiece of his campaign, where one of his\nsignature applause lines is to slam the NSA by telling audiences, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you\ndo on your cellphone is none of their damn business.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe issue is being joined on the presidential campaign trail just as\nCongress is debating reauthorizing key provisions of the Patriot Act, with\nsections of the far-reaching law set to expire at the end of May.\n\n\n\nLawmakers are considering scaling back the bulk collection of phone records\nauthorized under Section 215 of the act, with the House of Representatives\nvoting last week to allow monitoring on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\n\nThe prospects for action by the June 1 deadline are uncertain because of\ndifferences between the House and Senate and the prospects of a filibuster.\nAsked if the White House supported a two-month extension of the Patriot\nAct, spokesman Eric Schultz said that Congress should act now.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur strategy on these important security matters is to not kick the can\ndown the road,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Schultz before the president\xe2\x80\x99s afternoon visit to\nNew Jersey on Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has known of this impending deadline for\nmonths and months.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Christie directed most of his fire at Washington Democrats, but also\nsaid that there were leaders from parties \xe2\x80\x9cwho want American intelligence\nweaker and less informed just to drive their own personal political\nagendas.\xe2\x80\x9d He called those criticisms \xe2\x80\x9cdisgraceful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nOther presidential candidates who have weighed in on the issue are Sen. Ted\nCruz, who has criticized the blanket metadata collection, while Sen. Marco\nRubio has defended it.\n\n\n\nMr. Paul said, speaking at a round table in Philadelphia Monday, that he\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want to abolish the NSA or domestic surveillance entirely, but that\nhe wanted the government to seek individual warrants not just authorize\nbulk phone monitoring.\n\n\n\nHe took a swipe at \xe2\x80\x9csome Republicans running for office,\xe2\x80\x9d who suggested not\nseeking a warrant from a judge, but instead \xe2\x80\x9cjust drone them.\xe2\x80\x9d That was an\napparent reference to Sen. Lindsey Graham, who at a candidate forum in Iowa\nSaturday said if there was someone was thinking of joining al Qaeda or\nIslamic State, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to call a judge, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to call a drone\nand we will kill you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nMr. Christie, who is a former U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, spoke Monday\nabout specific instances when he used Section 215, and his prosecutions of\nsuspected terrorists who attempted to buy weapons on the black market.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve prosecuted terrorists, and sent terrorists to jail,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\nChristie, who was appointed to the role by former President George W. Bush.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what happens when our intelligence community, legal system and\nlaw enforcement work together.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe also criticized civil liberty advocates criticisms of the bulk phone\nsurveillance programs as \xe2\x80\x9cexaggerated and ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHe said that the current debate over the act in Washington was \xe2\x80\x9cdominated\nby the intellectual purists worried about theoretical abuses.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely no one has a single real example of our intelligence services\nmisusing this program for political or other nefarious purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\nChristie said.\n\n\n\nIn his first major foreign-policy address this year, Mr. Christie also\ncalled for more investment in the U.S. military, including research to\nprevent cyberattacks and funding for unmanned aircraft commonly known as\ndrones.\n\n\n\nMr. Christie said the Obama administration wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fully supporting Israel\nand America\xe2\x80\x99s allies in the Middle East, and faulted the president for not\ntaking a firmer stance on Syria.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has damaged the credibility of the American presidency,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Christie\nsaid.\n\n\n\nMr. Christie also said that the U.S. should ramp up pressure on Russia\nuntil it stops acts of military aggression in the region, and called for an\nasset ban on President Vladimir Putin, members of the country\xe2\x80\x99s parliament\nand the president\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle of advisers.\n\n\n\nChris Christie Now Opposes Creating a Pathway to Citizenship for\nUndocumented Workers\n<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-05-18/chris-christie-says-he-now-opposes-creating-a-pathway-to-citizenship-for-undocumented-workers>\n// Bloomberg // Terrence Dopp - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nBy his own admission, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has changed his\ntune.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Christie said that he now opposes providing a pathway to\ncitizenship for undocumented immigrants, something he supported as recently\nas 2010.\n\n\n\n"I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an extreme way to go," Christie said in an interview on FOX\nNews Channel\'s The Kelly File scheduled to air Monday night. "And I think\nthat, quite frankly, what Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s doing right now is pandering.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s pandering. We need to have an intelligent conversation about this\nand bring the American people along to where we can find consensus."\n\n\n\nChristie, who opted not to run four years ago, is traveling as honorary\nchairman of his political action committee, Leadership Matters for America,\neven though he\'s said he won\'t make a formal announcement on a White House\nrun until later this month or in June.\n\n\n\nHe had a packed day in New Hampshire, starting with a noon speech on\nforeign policy in the waterfront Prescott Park, where John McCain announced\nin 2008. He next held his fifth town hall meeting in three weeks at a VFW\nhall in Hudson.\n\n\n\nThe former federal prosecutor conceded during the interview that the stance\non a pathway to citizenship is a shift from his previous position on the\nmatter. In recent weeks, he has stated that immigrants won\'t "self-deport,"\nadding that there aren\'t enough law enforcement resources to force an\nestimated 11 million people here to leave.\n\n\n\nDuring the interview Christie also knocked President Barack Obama for his\nexecutive action on immigration and said his own shift on the question of\nproviding a pathway to citizenship is an evolution.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned over time about this issue and done a lot more\nwork on it," he said. "And I think everyone has to do what you need to be\nable to get educated on these issues and learn, and back in 2010 I was in\nmy first couple of months as Governor, I\xe2\x80\x99ve now learned some of the\nramifications of some of these things and what I am saying now is we\xe2\x80\x99ve got\nto come up with a solution for it. \xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nChristie cites experience running against female opponent\n<http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150518_ap_a0423a667e1f4691a00b3eeff006cb5b.html>\n// Philly // The Associated Press - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nHUDSON, N.H. (AP) - New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says his 2013 race\nagainst a female opponent has helped prepare him for a potential campaign\nagainst Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n\n\nThe likely Republican presidential contender was asked during a town hall\nevent in New Hampshire Monday evening why he believed he would be\nwell-suited to run against the favorite for the Democratic nomination if he\nchooses to run and wins his party\'s nomination.\n\n\n\nAmong his reasons, Christie cited his commanding victory over Democrat\nBarbara Buono during his re-election campaign.\n\n\n\n"Everybody thought, \'Oh no, no ... look at this ... this is going to be\nbad. Christie\'s gonna lose his cool. This woman\'s yelling at him all the\ntime. He\'s going to yell back at her. It\'s going to ugly really fast and\nhe\'s going to lose,\'" Christie recalled.\n\n\n\n"I think that experience of campaigning under that kind of stress, in that\natmosphere, against that type of opponent, prepares you extraordinarily\nwell to be able to run against Secretary Clinton, if that\'s what I chose to\ndo," he said.\n\n\n\nChristie, who has been working to move past the George Washington Bridge\nscandal, also suggested that he\'d been held to a different standard that\nClinton, who has come under scrutiny for using a private email server when\nshe was secretary of state. He said that, as a Republican, he believes he\nwould have faced far greater scrutiny had he done the same thing.\n\n\n\nChris Christie will be in New Hampshire when Obama visits NJ: Chris\nChristie in the news\n<http://www.cleveland.com/rnc-2016/index.ssf/2015/05/chris_christie_will_be_in_nh_w.html>\n// Cleveland // Sabrina Eaton - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nToday\'s Chris Christie news: When President Barack Obama visits Camden,\nN.J,, today  to applaud the city\'s police reforms, New Jersey GOP Gov.\nChris Christie will be out of state, campaigning to be Obama\'s successor.\nLt.

Lindsey Graham on White House bid: \'I\'m running\'\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/lindsey-graham-2016-presidential-announcement-june-1-118047.html>\n// Politico // Katie Glueck - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham said Monday that he will announce his decision about\nwhether to run for president on June 1 in his hometown of Central, S.C.,\nbut left little doubt about his intentions by saying \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m running.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m running because of what you see on television, I\xe2\x80\x99m running because I\nthink the world is falling apart, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been more right than wrong on\nforeign policy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said on \xe2\x80\x9cCBS This Morning,\xe2\x80\x9d when asked if he was\nrunning because he was unimpressed with the rest of the field (and\nappearing to dispense with the pretense that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t decided whether to\njump in). \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the fault of others, or their lack of this or that that\nmakes me want to run, it\xe2\x80\x99s my ability in my own mind to be a good\ncommander-in-chief and to make Washington work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGraham, who is one of the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s leading national security hawks, would\nbe a longshot in the crowded Republican presidential field but could be\ninfluential in pressuring the other contenders on foreign policy issues. In\nrecent weeks, the chances of his running, according to Graham, have gone\nfrom 91 percent to \xe2\x80\x9c98.6 percent\xe2\x80\x9d to 99.9 percent. He has also staffed up\nhis exploratory committee.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re all invited to come, spend money when you do, and I will tell you\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do about running for president,\xe2\x80\x9d he said about the June 1\nevent.\n\n\n\nGraham was also asked whether he would have gone into Iraq if he had known\nof the intelligence failures that are widely known now. It\xe2\x80\x99s a question\nthat has tripped up several other 2016 contenders, including Jeb Bush and\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing into Iraq, if I\xe2\x80\x99d known\xe2\x80\xa6then what I know now, would I have launched\na ground invasion? Probably not,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, adding that if he knew the\n\xe2\x80\x9cintelligence was faulty,\xe2\x80\x9d he would have \xe2\x80\x9creconfigured\xe2\x80\x9d his approach to\ntaking on Saddam Hussein, who \xe2\x80\x9cneeded to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut at the end of the day, he is gone,\xe2\x80\x9d Graham said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m worried\nabout an attack on our homeland.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nGraham, a media fixture, is well-known for his assertive national security\nposture and for working with Democrats on issues like immigration reform.\nBut hosting the June 1 event in the town where he grew up allows Graham to\nhighlight his personal story, which isn\xe2\x80\x99t widely known. He was raised in\nthe back of a pool hall and bar owned by his family, and when his parents\ndied young, he brought up his sister while in college and in the military\n(Graham is trained as an Air Force lawyer). That tough background, his team\nbelieves, better positions him to connect in a compassionate way with\nvoters.\n\n\n\nThe senator added that he was also weighing a run both because he wanted to\ntake on \xe2\x80\x9cradical Islam\xe2\x80\x9d and because he wanted to promote more\nbipartisanship.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my view, Democrats and Republicans work together too little,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I would try to change that if I got to be president.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham Is \'Having A Blast\' As He Preps Presidential Run\n<http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/05/18/407662108/sen-lindsey-graham-is-having-a-blast-as-he-preps-presidential-run>\n// NPR // Jessica Taylor and Don Gonyea - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is ready to join the crowded 2016 presidential\nrace \xe2\x80\x94 and he\'s having a blast in doing it.\n\n\n\nThe defense hawk and pragmatic Republican said Monday morning on CBS\'s This\nMorning that he would make an announcement on June 1 about his plans, but\nhe went on to dispense with all pretense of what that decision would be.\n\n\n\n"I\'m running because I think the world is falling apart," Graham said.\n\n\n\nHis 10-minute address at the Iowa Republican Party\'s annual Lincoln Day\nDinner on Saturday was heavy on foreign policy, promising to be a tough\nhand on national security if elected.\n\n\n\nHe took an implicit shot at libertarian-leaning Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, an\nalready-announced presidential candidate with whom he\'s often sparred. In\nhis speech, Paul decried the NSA wiretapping programs designed to stop\nterrorist attacks.\n\n\n\nBut in his folksy manner, Graham took a firm shot while also mixing humor.\n\n\n\n"If I\'m president of the United States and you\'re thinking about joining\nal-Qaida or ISIL \xe2\x80\x94 anybody thinking about that?" he asked to laughs. "I\'m\nnot gonna call a judge. I\'m gonna call a drone and we\'re gonna kill you."\n\n\n\nIt was Graham\'s largest appearance before Iowans so far, and he told NPR in\nan interview ahead of his speech that he knows he\'ll have to work to\nintroduce himself to voters, despite his long tenure in politics. He was\nelected to the House in the 1994 GOP revolution and succeeded GOP Sen.\nStrom Thurmond to the Senate in 2002.\n\n\n\nHe also acknowledged that he\'ll have some work to do with some GOP voters,\nwho know him as an ally of 2008 Republican presidential nominee, Sen. John\nMcCain, R-Ariz., and one of the principal architects of the Senate\'s\nbipartisan immigration reform bill.\n\n\n\n"I\'ve got people who are fans ... I\'ve got people who are critics ... and\nI\'ve got people who say \'I think I know him but I really don\'t know him,\' "\nhe told NPR.\n\n\n\nGraham says he worries that the debate in the GOP primaries will pull the\nparty too far to the right. He says he wants a real debate on immigration,\nsaying reforms are necessary for the economy and for national security. He\nadded that GOP hard-liners on the issue hurt the party\'s chances of ever\nwinning Hispanic votes.\n\n\n\n"I worry that we\'ll marginalize ourselves once again with the fastest\ngrowing community in America, the Hispanic community," he said.\n\n\n\nGraham also defended both former President George W. Bush and Jeb Bush \xe2\x80\x94 a\nlikely opponent of his in the 2016 GOP race. Last week the former Florida\ngovernor gave a series of sometimes conflicting answers as to whether he\nsupported his brother\'s decision to launch the war.\n\n\n\n"When it comes to blaming people about Iraq, the person I blame is Barack\nObama and not George W. Bush," Graham thundered.\n\n\n\nThe South Carolina senator is taking lessons from McCain, his closest\nfriend in the Senate, in his own all-but-certain bid, and he told NPR he\nlearned from McCain\'s primary victory eight years ago that anything can\nhappen in a White House race, particularly one that\'s shaping up to be as\nlarge as this year\'s field.\n\n\n\n"Because you\'re the front-runner doesn\'t mean you\'re gonna stay the\nfront-runner. Because you\'re fifth in a four-person race, doesn\'t mean\nyou\'re out of it," he said. "I\'ve learned never give up. Have a message.\nStick to it, and be yourself."\n\n\n\nPart of that authenticity is telling voters about the hard road that\nbrought him to the Senate. He touched on his back story in his Lincoln\ndinner speech \xe2\x80\x94 how his mother died when he was 21 from Hodgkin\'s disease,\nhis father passed just months later, and he was left to care for his\nyounger sister.\n\n\n\n"The bills wiped us out because we were underinsured. So I don\'t need a\nlecture from Democrats about health care. Fifteen months later my dad died.\nI\'m 22, my sister is 14. My world came to an end upside down. If it wasn\'t\nfor family, friends and faith I wouldn\'t be standing here today," said\nGraham.\n\n\n\nGraham alternated between serious and humorous throughout his speech, which\nwas one of the best received of the evening. Barely a minute into it, he\ntold the crowd that he\'s an attorney \xe2\x80\x94 including for the military where he\nstill serves in the Air Force Reserve. Then he joked about his first client\nas a young lawyer in a divorce case.\n\n\n\n"He asked me a question I didn\'t know the answer to. He said, if we get\ndivorced are my wife and I still cousins," he said, laughing as the crowd\nhowled. "The answer is yes in South Carolina ... I don\'t know about Iowa."\n\n\n\nThe off-beat humor went over well with the crowd, though. His hospitality\nsuite after the event was one of the most-trafficked of the night, with\nIowans who knew little about Graham previously lining up to meet the\nsenator.

Here is how the teams behind some likely and announced\ncandidates are connected to previous campaigns, administrations and\norganizations close to the possible nominees.\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton is relying on a mix of Clinton loyalists, seasoned Obama\noperatives and other key strategists to modernize and force discipline on\nher campaign (in other words, to avoid many of the mistakes of her 2008\nprimary race). At the top are John D. Podesta,  a Clintonite with strong\nties to President Obama; Robby Mook,  known for his no-drama approach to\nmanaging Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe\xe2\x80\x99s 2013 campaign; and Huma Abedin,\nMrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s longtime aide. Campaign veterans loyal to Mr. Obama and Mrs.\nClinton are running Priorities USA Action, the super PAC supporting Mrs.\nClinton, which operates outside the official campaign.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush\n\n\n\nThe former Florida governor is building a sizable political operation in\nanticipation of a likely campaign announcement. His team includes longtime\nadvisers, key operatives from Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s presidential races, and a few\nveterans of George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s campaigns. Sally Bradshaw and Mike Murphy form\nthe core of Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle. Ms. Bradshaw and David Kochel are\nexpected to head the campaign, and Mr. Murphy will oversee Right to Rise,\nthe pro-Bush super PAC.\n\n\n\nTed Cruz\n\n\n\nThe Texas freshman firebrand senator has recruited several operatives with\nties to conservative politicians and former presidential contenders, as\nwell as a handful of Senate aides. Jason Johnson, the architect of Mr.\nCruz\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 Senate victory; Jeff Roe, a strategist known for his aggressive\ntactics; and Chad Sweet, a former investment banker, are in charge of Mr.\nCruz\xe2\x80\x99s campaign effort. Dathan Voelter, an Austin lawyer and friend of Mr.\nCruz, is treasurer of three of the four super PACs supporting the senator.\n\n\n\nRand Paul\n\n\n\nThe libertarian-leaning junior senator from Kentucky is trying to shape his\nown political identity. Most of the influential members of his team have\nlittle or no connection to his father, Ron Paul, a former Texas congressman\nwho twice sought the Republican presidential nomination. Doug Stafford is\nthe senator\xe2\x80\x99s closest political adviser. The campaign manager, Chip\nEnglander, ran Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner\xe2\x80\x99s 2014 campaign. Vincent Harris,\na GOP digital star, was poached from Ted Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s camp. And strategists Mike\nBiundo and John Yob learned the arcane world of delegate math while working\nfor Rick Santorum in 2012. Advisers with connections to both Pauls are\nrunning America\xe2\x80\x99s Liberty PAC, the super PAC supporting Rand\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\n\nMr. Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle includes several strategists with strong ties to\nearly primary states and the Bush family. Terry Sullivan headed Mitt\nRomney\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 primary in South Carolina, and Heath Thompson and J. Warren\nTompkins helped George W. Bush win the state\xe2\x80\x99s 2000 primary. Jim Merrill\ndirected both of Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s New Hampshire primaries. And Todd Harris, who\nwas the chief spokesman for the 2002 re-election campaign of Jeb Bush, is\nfamiliar with Iowa after serving as a news media consultant for Joni Ernst,\nthe state\xe2\x80\x99s newly elected senator.\n\n\n\nScott Walker\n\n\n\nMr. Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, who has not officially announced his\ncandidacy, is supported by people who helped him win three statewide\nelections, as well as a crew of national strategists. His\ncampaign-in-waiting is housed in Our American Revival, a 527 group that can\naccept unlimited donations. Rick Wiley, the executive director of the\ngroup, is expected to be Mr. Walker\xe2\x80\x99s campaign manager. Two advisers who\nhave been with the governor since his first gubernatorial bid are running\nUnintimidated, the super PAC supporting Mr. Walker.\n\n\n\nTOP NEWS\n\nDOMESTIC\n\n\n\nObama to Limit Military-Style Equipment for Police Forces\n<http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/us/politics/obama-to-limit-military-style-equipment-for-police-forces.html?_r=1>\n// NYT // Julie Hirschfeld Davis - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 President Obama on Monday will ban the federal provision of\nsome types of military-style equipment to local police departments and\nsharply restrict the availability of others, administration officials said.\n\n\n\nThe ban is part of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s push to ease tensions between law\nenforcement and minority communities in reaction to the crises in\nBaltimore; Ferguson, Mo.; and other cities.\n\n\n\nHe is taking the action after a task force he created in January decided\nthat police departments should be barred from using federal funds to\nacquire items that include tracked armored vehicles, the highest-caliber\nfirearms and ammunition, and camouflage uniforms. The ban is part of a\nseries of steps the president has made to try to build trust between law\nenforcement organizations and the citizens they are charged with protecting.\n\n\n\nMr. Obama planned to promote the effort on Monday during a visit to Camden,\nN.J. The city, racked by poverty and crime, has become a national model for\nbetter relations between the police and citizens after replacing its\nbeleaguered police force with a county-run system that prioritizes\ncommunity ties.\n\n\n\nMr. Obama is expected to hold up Camden as a counterpoint to places like\nFerguson, where the killing of a young black man by a white police officer\nlast summer and the violent protests that followed exposed long-simmering\nhostility between law enforcement agencies and minorities in cities around\nthe country.\n\n\n\nThe trip and the action on military-style equipment are to coincide with\nthe release on Monday of a report from a policing task force that Mr. Obama\nformed late last year in response to the crisis in Ferguson. The 116-page\nreport calls for law enforcement agencies to \xe2\x80\x9cembrace a guardian \xe2\x80\x94 rather\nthan a warrior \xe2\x80\x94 mind-set to build trust and legitimacy both within\nagencies and with the public.\xe2\x80\x9d It contains dozens of recommendations for\nagencies throughout the country.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are, without a doubt, sitting at a defining moment in American\npolicing,\xe2\x80\x9d Ronald L. Davis, the director of the Office of Community\nOriented Policing Services at the Department of Justice, told reporters in\na conference call organized by the White House. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a unique\nopportunity to redefine policing in our democracy, to ensure that public\nsafety becomes more than the absence of crime, but it must also include a\npresence for justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAfter the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the federal government\nsharply expanded its efforts to provide police departments with automatic\nweapons, armored vehicles and other military-style gear through grant\nprograms at the Homeland Security and Justice Departments and transfers\nfrom the Defense Department. The programs have enjoyed widespread\npopularity among lawmakers eager to take steps to protect their communities\nand constantly in search of ways to steer federal money to their districts\nand states.\n\n\n\nThe report from the task force on military equipment cited the police\nresponse to the Ferguson unrest as an example of how the \xe2\x80\x9cmilitarization\xe2\x80\x9d\nof police departments can lead to fear and mistrust. In addition to\nprohibiting some equipment outright, officials said, Mr. Obama accepted the\ngroup\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to impose new restrictions on other military-style\nitems, such as wheeled armored vehicles, pyrotechnics, battering rams and\nriot gear, and more stringent requirements for training and information\ncollection for departments that acquire them.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe idea is to make sure that we strike a balance in providing the\nequipment, which is appropriate and useful and important for local law\nenforcement agencies to keep the community safe, while at the same time\nputting standards in place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cecilia Mu\xc3\xb1oz, the director of Mr.\nObama\xe2\x80\x99s Domestic Policy Council.\n\n\n\nThe report to be released on Monday represents a two-pronged response to a\nproblem that has emerged as a central predicament for Mr. Obama in recent\nmonths. He has struggled to acknowledge the sense of fear, grievance and\nvictimization by the police that dominates many minority communities\nwithout seeming to forgive violence or condemn law enforcement with a broad\nbrush.\n\n\n\nIn doing so, he is grappling with the limits of his power to force changes\nin police departments around the country, where practices and procedures\nare varied and the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to influence change can be\nminimal. The equipment task force stems from an executive order, and its\nconclusions affect only the material supplied by the federal government,\nwhile the policing recommendations are merely a blueprint for what Mr.\nObama would like to see happen in jurisdictions throughout the country.\n\n\n\nMr. Obama on Monday will announce $163 million in grants to encourage\npolice departments to adopt the suggestions. The administration also will\nlaunch a \xe2\x80\x9ctool kit\xe2\x80\x9d for the use of body-worn cameras; the Justice\nDepartment created a grant program for law enforcement agencies to purchase\nthem.\n\n\n\nMs. Mu\xc3\xb1oz said the task force\xe2\x80\x99s report was \xe2\x80\x9cnot just a blueprint for us and\nfor local law enforcement agencies, but also for community leaders and\nothers and stakeholders,\xe2\x80\x9d giving them \xe2\x80\x9csome very specific things to be\nasking for and, frankly, insisting on in order to improve policing\npractices.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThat is why Mr. Obama made plans to visit Camden, where he wants to\nhighlight a policing model that emphasizes a collaborative approach. Camden\nis also one of 20 cities participating in a new White House initiative to\nenhance the use of police data, by releasing detailed information on such\nthings as traffic stops, officer-involved shootings and the use of force.\n\n\n\nObama foundation brings in $5.4 million\n<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/obama-foundation-5-million-118067.html>\n// Politico // Josh Gerstein - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nThe foundation set up to raise money for President Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s\npresidential library in Chicago brought in $5.4 million in donations and\npledges during its first year in operation, according to a tax form made\npublic Monday.\n\n\n\nObama\xe2\x80\x99s foundation has not announced a specific fundraising goal, but it is\nexpected to seek to raise in excess of $500 million to build the library.\nThey money will funding an endowment to be turned over to the federal\ngovernment along with the facility, and money for the foundation\xe2\x80\x99s\neducational and charitable work.\n\n\n\nThe foundation\xe2\x80\x99s largest donor in its first year was Chicago publisher Fred\nEychaner, who ponied up $1 million. The next largest was a $666,666\ndonation from Chicago hedge fund operator Michael Sacks and his wife Cari.\n\n\n\nThe Joyce Foundation was listed as contributing $1 million, but a detailed\naccountant\xe2\x80\x99s report and a statement from a foundation official said that\namount was a pledge disclosed for tax purposes and only one-third of the\nmoney was actually transferred in 2014.\n\n\n\nThe exact donation amounts were reported in a portion of the tax form the\nfoundation is not required to make public, but posted on its website Monday\nafternoon.\n\n\n\nThe foundation\xe2\x80\x99s largest expenses in its first year in operation were lease\npayments to Jones Lang Lasalle Midwest for $615,523 and veteran Obama\nfundraiser Julianna Smoot\xe2\x80\x99s firm Smoot Tewes Group for $476,551.\n\n\n\nDocuments obtained separately by POLITICO Monday show the foundation agreed\nto pay Smoot\xe2\x80\x99s firm an escalating monthly fee over the next six years \xe2\x80\x94\nranging from $18,000 a month in the last half of 2014 to $30,000 a month in\n2020.\n\n\n\nThe foundation also handed over to Smoot\xe2\x80\x99s firm a \xe2\x80\x9clump sum engagement\nbonus\xe2\x80\x9d of $144,000 and agreed to consider bonuses of up to $100,000 last\nyear and this year, with a possibility of up to $250,000 a year by 2020,\nthe agreement shows.\n\nThe agreement doesn\xe2\x80\x99t detail a fundraising target overall or year-by-year\nbut says the organization is seeking to raise $6 million per year from\nsources in Illinois.\n\n\n\nLast week, Obama and his wife library announced that the library will be\nbuilt in Chicago, although two separate sites on the Windy City\xe2\x80\x99s south\nside remain in play for the facility.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the strands of my life came together, and I really became a man, when\nI moved to Chicago,\xe2\x80\x9d Barack Obama said in a web video. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to\nnow give something back and bring the world back home after this incredible\njourney.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe library will operate in cooperation with the University of Chicago and\nthe University of Illinois, foundation officials said.\n\n\n\nThe foundation turned down bids from Hawaii and New York City to build the\nlibrary, but announced plans for a presence in both places, including a\npartnership with Columbia University \xe2\x80\x94 Obama\xe2\x80\x99s undergraduate alma mater.\n\n\n\nBy comparison, the Clinton Foundation - the charity linked to former\npresident Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary - took in just over $3 million\nin donations in 1998, its first year of operations. It also brought in $3.1\nmillion the following year.\n\n\n\nThe Obama Foundation voluntarily discloses its donors each quarter,\nproviding broad ranges in which each donor contributed. As a result, it was\nknown in January that the foundation raised between about $3 million and\n$6.2 million in 2014, although a precise total was not released at that\ntime.\n\n\n\nObama served on the board of the Joyce Foundation from the summer of 1994\nthrough 2002, earning more than $70,000 in directors fees. He remained on\nthe board as he served in the Illinois State Senate, and at one point he\nconsidered leaving politics to become the group\xe2\x80\x99s full-time president, he\nlater acknowledged. Instead, he stepped down from the board as he was\ngearing up for his 2004 U.S. Senate bid.\n\n\n\nFeds Project Lake Mead Below Drought Trigger Point in 2017\n<http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/feds-project-lake-mead-drought-trigger-point-2017-31135829>\n// ABC News // Ken Ritter, Associated Press - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nFederal water managers released a report Monday projecting that Lake Mead\'s\nwater levels will fall below a point in January 2017 that would force\nsupply cuts to Arizona and Nevada.\n\n\n\nThe effects could be serious. Arizona\'s allocation of Colorado River water\ncould be cut 11.4 percent, or by an amount normally used by more than\n600,000 homes. Nevada\'s share could be reduced 4.3 percent. Think 26,000\nhomes.\n\n\n\nBut officials heading water agencies in the two states and California took\na wait-and-see approach to the projections posted by the U.S. Bureau of\nReclamation.\n\n\n\nThey pointed to fluctuations in precipitation levels just since January.\nThey added that more will be known in August when the bureau knows how much\nrunoff in the upper-basin states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming\nreaches the Lake Powell reservoir.\n\n\n\nThat will determine how much water the agency controlling a Colorado River\nwater system crucial to about 40 million residents in seven Southwest U.S.\nstates will release from Lake Powell through the Grand Canyon to Lake Mead\nnear Las Vegas.\n\n\n\n"A lot is going to depend on precipitation and flows from the tributaries,"\nsaid David Modeer, general manager of the Central Arizona Project, the main\nwater agency in the lower-basin state that would be affected the most.\n\n\n\n"We don\'t think it means a whole lot right now because we have another\ncouple of months to determine the release out of Lake Powell," he said.\n\n\n\nThe so-called interim guidelines issued Monday by the Bureau of Reclamation\npredict water levels will be just 2 feet above a key trigger point next\nJanuary on Lake Mead, the reservoir behind Hoover Dam.\n\n\n\nThe lake was 37 percent full on Monday, said Dan Bunk, the Bureau of\nReclamation\'s water operations manager. Its water surface level of 1,077\nabove sea level was 2 feet above the crucial 1,075-foot line.\n\n\n\nThe so-called interim guidelines chart a wobbly series of historically low\nwater levels at Lake Mead \xe2\x80\x94 dropping to as much as 1,054 feet next summer\nand 1,052 feet in April 2017. But it would be about 1,077 this coming\nJanuary, the point in time when a declaration of water shortage for 2016\nwould be made.\n\n\n\nLake Powell, behind the Glen Canyon Dam straddling the Utah-Arizona border,\nwas 45 percent full on Monday. Bunk said that if Powell remains above its\nown trigger point, water releases to Lake Mead could remain robust and Lake\nMead could remain above 1,070 feet through 2016.\n\n\n\n"We haven\'t made any shortage projection. That would be done in August\n2016," Bunk said.\n\n\n\nLake Mead reached its high-water capacity in 1983 at 1,225 feet. It reaches\nso-called "dead pool" at just under 900 feet, meaning nothing would flow\ndownstream from Hoover Dam.\n\n\n\nLas Vegas and its 2 million residents and 40 million tourists a year get\nalmost all their drinking water from Lake Mead.\n\n\n\nJohn Entsminger, general manager of the regional Southern Nevada Water\nAuthority, said he believed conservation efforts like those now being\nadopted in California have put Las Vegas in a position to handle any\ninitial shortage reductions "without significant impact."\n\n\n\n"There is no doubt that this drought is serious," he said, "and the\nprojections from the Bureau of Reclamation continue to reaffirm that\nreality."\n\n\n\nWilliam Hasencamp, Colorado River resources chief for the Metropolitan\nWater District of Southern California, said he saw reason to prepare, not\npanic.\n\n\n\nDrought-stricken California will continue to be able to draw its 4.4\nmillion acre-foot allocation of Colorado River water even if Arizona and\nNevada are affected.\n\n\n\n"But we lose flexibility, which is a pretty big deal because we serve just\nunder 19 million people," Hasencamp said. "We know a shortage is coming at\nsome point."\n\nINTERNATIONAL\n\n\n\nKerry, in Seoul, slams North Korea\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/kerry-in-seoul-slams-north-korea/2015/05/18/627f9b80-f986-11e4-a47c-e56f4db884ed_story.html>\n// WaPo // Carol Morello - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nSEOUL \xe2\x80\x94 Secretary of State John F. Kerry on Monday accused North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s\ngovernment of committing crimes worthy of referral to the International\nCriminal Court and urged it to end its isolation by dismantling its arsenal\nof nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\nUsing strong language, Kerry said during a stop in Seoul that the Pyongyang\ngovernment led by Kim Jong Un had shown a \xe2\x80\x9cflagrant disregard for\ninternational law while denying its people fundamental freedom and rights.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe world is hearing increasingly more and more stories of grotesque,\ngrisly, horrendous public displays of executions on a whim and a fancy by\nthe leader against people who were close to him and sometimes for the most\nflimsy of excuses,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, referring to a report from South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s spy\nagency that the North Korean defense minister was publicly executed with an\nantiaircraft gun after he fell asleep during a meeting led by Kim.\n\n\n\nKerry vowed to speak out against \xe2\x80\x9cNorth Korea\xe2\x80\x99s atrocities against its own\npeople\xe2\x80\x9d and warned that Kim\xe2\x80\x99s mercurial behavior is likely to lead other\nnations to press for charges against North Korea and its leader at the\nInternational Criminal Court in The Hague.\n\n\n\nKerry\xe2\x80\x99s visit, though planned weeks ago, comes in the wake of fresh concern\nabout Pyongyang\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, North Korea fired what it claimed was a ballistic\nmissile from a submarine, though some analysts doubt that anything more\nlethal than a balloon was shot into the air.\n\n\n\nKerry\xe2\x80\x99s Seoul stop was designed to underline the United States\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cironclad\xe2\x80\x9d\ncommitment to South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s security and to ramp up pressure on Pyongyang\nto return to denuclearization talks it abandoned three years ago.\n\n\n\nSince then, Kerry said, North Korea had rebuffed overtures from the United\nStates, Russia, Japan and China to return to the negotiating table and\ninstead is showing greater belligerence.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have grown the threat of their program and have acted with a kind of\nreckless abandon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at a news conference alongside South Korean\nForeign Minister Yun Byung-se.\n\n\n\nKerry said he hoped the negotiations over curbing Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program,\nnow entering their final stretch, could serve as a model for North Korea to\nfollow if the hermit kingdom wanted to end its isolation.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are more determined than ever to find ways to convince Kim Jong Un and\nNorth Korea that all they are doing now is isolating themselves further and\ncreating greater risks to the region and to their own country,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nHe, however, added a caveat: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to have some indication from the\nleader of North Korea that they\xe2\x80\x99re serious about engaging on the subject of\ntheir nuclear program.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAt the news conference, Kerry also expressed gratitude to South Korea for\nthe care and concern shown to U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert recently when he\nwas attacked in central Seoul by a suspected North Korea sympathizer and\nrequired hospitalization. Lippert, with bandages still on his cheek and\nleft hand from injuries he suffered in the attack, has accompanied Kerry to\nthe meetings and joined him for lunch at a Seoul taco place run by Koreans\nwho had lived in the United States.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to take the opportunity to thank all the people of South Korea for\nthe remarkable outpouring of concern about his health and their affection\nfor him and for our country,\xe2\x80\x9d Kerry said.\n\n\n\nHe also said that the Islamic State militant group\xe2\x80\x99s capture of Ramadi in\nIraq, although a setback, would prove temporary.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNotice what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHuge numbers of vehicle-born IEDs,\nbig trucks, massive explosions. They\xe2\x80\x99ve destroyed the place. That\xe2\x80\x99s hardly\na future.

She is also likely to be the only nominee\nrunning for president that does. That is something all Americans should be\nthrilled about. Her position is clear and rock solid, and they way she came\nto that conclusion is the same way most people do, including some of my own\nfamily members. Like most Americans, her position is one that evolved and\ndeveloped from personal interactions with LGBT Americans and their\nfamilies, and through a long and deep soul searching. I know a little bit\nabout this process: It\'s how my father came to support my right to marry\nand then eventually walk me down the aisle when I married my wife.\n\n\n\nI first met Hillary when she was running for U.S. Senate. At that time,\nsame-sex marriage didn\'t have nearly the public support it has today. As a\ncommunity, we still had a great deal of work to do. Like it was yesterday,\nI remember a small meeting of LGBT leaders in Jeff Soreff\'s apartment with\nthe then-First Lady. The goal of the meeting was for the leaders to better\nunderstand her positions on LGBT issues and to push her to take up more pro\nLGBT positions and champion more LGBT issues. The meeting was noteworthy\nand remarkable for a number of reasons. It was not a large meeting. It was\nintimate and informal and people were very frank in their dialogue \xe2\x80\x94 as was\nHillary. She spoke in a deeply personal way about a gay couple that\nprofoundly opened her eyes and her mind regarding LGBT families. There were\ntwo men who moved into the house next to her parents\' home in Arkansas and\nbecame surrogate sons, helping care for her father when he was dying.\n\n\n\nOf course, Hillary has written about this couple in her book. But to hear\nit in her owns words so long ago and to see the look in her eyes as she\ndescribed her love and respect for this couple spoke volumes about what she\nhad learned \xe2\x80\x94 that families were defined by love and selflessness not\nsexual orientation. As I have seen Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s work with the LGBT community\ngrow, I have often seen her go back to what she learned from that couple as\na guide.\n\n\n\nMuch has been made of Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s support of marriage with some claiming it\nis a poll-driven position. The fact is she came to this position the same\nway most Americans did, through conversations with those of us in the\ncommunity, by getting to know people who were deeply committed and in love\nwith one another, and by recognizing that every couple in American has just\nas much right to happiness as the next person, regardless of sexual\norientation.\n\n\n\nWhile the movement toward equality in the LGBT community has moved rapidly\nover these last few years, we have never had a major party candidate on the\nballot for president of the United States who was willing to state so\nunequivocally her support for marriage equality, long before any votes were\ncast or elections were won. When Hillary Clinton receives the Democratic\nnomination, she will not only be the first woman to receive a major party\nnomination for president of the United States, she will be the first major\nparty nominee to publicly articulate that position before she assumes\noffice. And as a gay American, who has fought for women\xe2\x80\x99s rights and LGBT\nrights my entire life, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more proud.\n\n\n\nWhy is Hillary Clinton Tacking Left?\n<http://www.nationaljournal.com/2016-elections/why-is-hillary-clinton-tacking-left-20150518>\n// National Journal // Ron Fournier - May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton 2.0 is far more liberal than the centrist who ran in\n2008 because: a) her views have evolved with time; b) she\'s long been a\ncloset liberal and this is her authentic self; c) she\'s an opportunistic\nphony.\n\n\n\nAs somebody who has known and observed this complex public figure for\nnearly 30 years, I am open to being convinced that any one of those\nrationales are true.\n\n\n\nBut not all three.\n\n\n\nFor some inexplicable reason, her advisers are talking openly with\nreporters about the political rational behind her policy shift (aka:\nflip-flops), giving credence to the most cynical interpretation of her\nmotives. "Advisers do not dispute that Clinton has a finger to the wind of\nthe national mood," writes my former colleague Anne Gearan in the\nWashington Post, "but they insist her positions are not driven by polling."\n\n\n\nGearan could have put a period after "mood." The rest of the sentence is\npatently false. How do I know? I read the rest of her story, which had the\nfull cooperation of Clinton\'s political network and included this\nextraordinary paragraph:\n\n\n\nClinton\'s advisers want us to believe that her liberal shift is equally the\nresult of politics and principle \xe2\x80\x93 that deep inside their crosstabs\nresides, conveniently, "the real Hillary."\n\n\n\n"Her approach to this really is not trying to take a ruler out and measure\nwhere she wants to be on some ideological scale," Clinton campaign chairman\nJohn Podesta told Gearan. "It\'s to dive deeply into the problems facing the\nAmerican people and American families. She\'s a proud wonk, and she looks at\npolicy from that perspective."\n\n\n\nI can attest to the fact that Clinton is a wonk. She loves the nitty-gritty\nof policy, particularly those policies that influence the lives of women\nand children.\n\n\n\nI can also confirm that the former first lady is ideologically more liberal\nthan her husband. Bill Clinton\'s advisers in Arkansas and at the White\nHouse constantly complained about the friction between his triangulation\nand her absolutism.\n\n\n\nAnd, like most voters, I\'m willing to give any politician some leeway to\n"evolve" on issues, particularly one like gay marriage that has rapidly\ngained acceptance in the public square.\n\n\n\nBut is she really this progressive?\n\n\n\n"Clinton\'s full embrace of same-sex marriage in the first days of her\ncampaign was followed by clear statements in favor of scrapping get-tough\nimmigration and incarceration policies \xe2\x80\x94 many of which took root during her\nhusband\'s administration," Gearan writes.\n\n\n\nShe has also weighed in with liberal takes on climate change, abortion\nrights and disparities in income and opportunity between rich and poor.\n\n\n\nAll are issues that have been divisive in the past for both Democrats and\nRepublicans. But none are now judged to be radioactive for Democrats, which\ngives Clinton more elbow room.\n\n\n\nBy taking such positions, aides and advisers hope Clinton will not only\ninoculate herself against a serious challenge from the left in the\nprimaries, but that she also will be able to push on through the general\nelection. Her campaign believes American public opinion has moved left not\nonly since Bill Clinton won election in 1992 on a centrist platform, but\nalso since Barack Obama won on a more liberal one.\n\nIndeed, polls show that while the United States remains a center-right\ncountry, liberals are on the ascent. Whether or not Clinton strategists are\nbetting too heavily on this trend won\'t be known until November 2016.\n\n\n\nEven after all these years, I don\'t know whether her full-throated\nliberalism is a genuine reflection of her views or an echo of the polls. I\nguess the answer could be "both," but I doubt it. That just seems to be too\nneat of a coincidence.\n\n\n\nI suspect she\'ll try to explain herself, but when? She\'s refuses to talk to\nthe media in any great detail.\n\n\n\nI suppose voters could take her at her word, but why? Trust is an issue.\nLegitimate questions about her government email and family foundation were\nmet with disingenuous responses.\n\n\n\nI imagine she can get over the authenticity hurdle, but how?\n\n\n\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to deal with reporters, don\xe2\x80\x99t run for president.\n\n\n\nYou won\xe2\x80\x99t believe Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s spin on avoiding the press\n<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/05/18/you-wont-believe-hillary-clintons-spin-on-avoiding-the-press/>\n// WaPo // Chris Cillizza \xe2\x80\x93 May 18, 2015\n\n\n\nWith Hillary Clinton rapidly approaching a month since she answered a\nquestion from a reporter, her allies are working to push back on the idea\nthat she is ducking the press.\n\n\n\n"PUTTING THE VOTERS FIRST, HILLARY ASKS THE QUESTIONS THAT REALLY MATTER,"\nread the subject line of an e-mail -- ALL CAPS in the original! -- that\narrived in my inbox this morning courtesy of Correct The Record, a\npro-Clinton super PAC directly coordinating with the presidential campaign\non rapid response.\n\n\n\nThe missive lays out the facts aimed at putting lie to the "she won\'t\nanswer questions" narrative.\n\n\n\nFirst, Correct The Record notes that Clinton has answered 20 questions from\n"everyday Americans": seven during her first trip to Iowa (she\'s back in\nthe state today), five during her New Hampshire excursion and a whopping\neight when she visited Nevada.\n\n\n\nThen the group notes that Clinton has ASKED 117 questions of "everyday\nAmericans." And, yes, it lists every one of those questions -- from "Give\nme a sense of your experience with that?" (Iowa) to "Do you want to share\nyour story?" (Nevada).\n\n\n\nI mean, where to start with this?\n\n\n\n1.  The vast majority of the people who have asked Clinton questions in\nIowa, New Hampshire and Nevada were part of a pre-selected group who sat\nwith her around a roundtable. That\'s not exactly like hosting a town hall\nevent in which none of the questions are pre-screened. And if you look at\nthe questions "regular" people are asking Clinton, they are not exactly the\nmost probing of queries. A sampling: "I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, what can you do\nto bring that heart back to education in the United States?" (Iowa), "What\nare your plans to help my community and help us not live in fear anymore?"\n(Nevada) and "I would like you to elaborate on what you think you might do\nfor childcare in the future if you\xe2\x80\x99re elected?" (New Hampshire) None of\nthose questions are bad, per se, but they also aren\'t pushing Clinton in\nany way, shape or form on any issue.\n\n\n\n2. It makes zero difference how many questions Clinton has asked average\nAmericans. Like, none. If those people were running for president, then I\nwould be super-interested to know how they responded to some (or maybe all)\nof Clinton\'s 117 questions. But, they aren\'t. She is. Citing the number of\nquestions Clinton has asked of people to rebut the idea that she isn\'t\ntaking enough (or any) questions from reporters is sort of like saying you\naced a job interview because you answered every question asked of you with\nanother question. That wouldn\'t make sense, would it?\n\n\n\n3. At issue here is that Clinton is avoiding taking questions from\nreporters. And nowhere in the Correct The Record memo does it have anything\nto dispute that fact. In total as a candidate, Clinton has answered 13\ntotal questions from reporters. It\'s been 39,000 minutes since she last\nanswered a reporter\'s question. And, while I think it is absolutely of\nvalue for Clinton to hear from regular folks about their concerns and\nhopes, it\'s hard to argue from the list put together by Correct The Record\nthat the questions those people have asked Clinton are the same as the one\nreporters would have if given the chance.\n\n\n\nNo, they\'re better, you say! They\'re about policy and not dumb reporters\'\nobsessions, you say!\n\n\n\nTo all of which, I respond: Do you not think it is of value to know how\nHillary Clinton spent her time since leaving the State Department? And how\nthe Clinton Foundation handled its business with various donors who would,\nundoubtedly, still be in the picture if she was elected president? Or what\nshe thinks of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the fight currently\nhappening in Congress? Or Iran? Or the Middle East?\n\n\n\nYou get the idea.  The role of the media in this process is to show voters\nwho these people are, really, and to explain how these people would govern\nthe country if elected. Like the media or not, that\'s a very important role\n-- and one that is essential to a functioning democracy.\n\n\n\nSo, no matter how many Iowans\' questions Hillary answers or how many\nquestions she asks them, it doesn\'t justify her current unwillingness to\nstand before reporters (or even a single reporter) and take their\nquestions. Not even a little.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \n*Alexandria Phillips*\n*Communications | Press Assistant*\n*Hillary for America *\nhttps://www.hillaryclinton.com\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "HRCRapid" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n'
