john.podesta@gmail.comb'Nick, can you get a sense of timing from the NYT, that\'s a big piece.\r\n\r\nAnd reading his note, I\'m not sure they have specific email as much as they have the mere fact that it happened. Truthfully, specific email would be far easier to address, especially if it\'s among what went to the Hill in February.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Robby Mook\r\nSent: Tuesday, March 17, 2015 4:04 PM\r\nTo: Jennifer Palmieri\r\nCc: Philippe Reines; John Podesta; Nick Merrill; Cheryl Mills; Heather Samuelson; Huma Abedin; Jacob Sullivan\r\nSubject: Re: NYT | Email Content\r\n\r\n\r\nAgree\r\nMarissa can sched if you need\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Mar 17, 2015, at 4:03 PM, Jennifer Palmieri <jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com<mailto:jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com>> wrote:\r\n\r\n+ Robby and John\r\n\r\nStrikes me as a big problem that the NYT is having selected emails leaked to them and I I think we should do a call to discuss the proper way to handle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Mar 17, 2015 at 3:39 PM, Philippe Reines <pir@hrcoffice.com<mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com>> wrote:\r\nThere\'s a lot to respond to here, but first and foremost the premise is wrong. There is nothing wrong with anyone having personal email addresses or her emailing someone\'s private account or vice versa. Maybe she was wishing Jake a happy birthday. Or I was sending her a note about her mom. Or she asking Monica about Oscar disappearing. We\'re allowed to have personal lives.\r\n\r\nSecond, it was her practice, as well as ours, to conduct work on the .gov system. In those cases we didn\'t, which could have been for any reason, including State.gov<http://State.gov> being down.  In those cases the onus is on us to make sure that anything that should have ended up in the right place did.\r\n\r\nNow, depending on what they are looking at, you can\'t easily determine if that happened. They are looking at HER email, not ours. They don\'t know what next step we took.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing to ascertain from State is whether they are looking at specific email from the "300" - because in those cases Heather and I went one by one to determine if a) it needed to end up on .gov, and b) it did indeed end up there.\r\n\r\nSince there are less than a dozen instances of this in the 300 it was easy. One is me sending her a clip, no commentary. Another is her emailing me & Huma about something that I subsequently followed up on my .gov account. We did that for each and could share that if need be.\r\n\r\nIf they\'ve somehow seen some of the other 55k, we\'d need to see each to determine what they were.\r\n\r\nLastly, we should warn Monica. Huma, unless you want to Nick or I can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Nick Merrill\r\nSent: Tuesday, March 17, 2015 3:13 PM\r\nTo: Jennifer Palmieri; Cheryl Mills; Philippe Reines; Heather Samuelson; Huma Abedin; Jacob Sullivan\r\nSubject: NYT | Email Content\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the story that I mentioned hearing from State about over the weekend.  Specific questions are below.\r\n\r\nJen when we talked over the weekend you noted that it was fairly irresponsible for them to cherry pick leaked emails and write it up as representative.  And some of the questions below are a little ridiculous to say the least.\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll call State now and see what they know and report back.  I also asked what their deadline was.\r\n\r\nNick\r\n\r\nFrom: <Schmidt>, Mike Schmidt <schmidtm@nytimes.com<mailto:schmidtm@nytimes.com>>\r\nDate: Tuesday, March 17, 2015 at 2:53 PM\r\nTo: NSM <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com<mailto:nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>>\r\nSubject: emails\r\n\r\nNick,\r\n\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re preparing a story on how Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s top advisers at the State Department used their private email accounts for some of their email correspondences with her.\r\n\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, Philippe Reines, Jake Sullivan and Monica Hanley, used personal email accounts to correspond with her on her personal account. She also corresponded with Sidney Blumenthal about inside information he had about Libya.\r\n\r\nWe have the following questions for our article:\r\n\r\nWhy did the advisers use private email accounts \xe2\x80\x93 instead of government ones \xe2\x80\x93 to correspond with Mrs. Clinton?\r\n\r\nWas this the normal practice?\r\n\r\nWhy did Mrs. Clinton suggest that her emails were being captured in the State Department system when she was corresponding at times with her aides on their personal accounts?\r\n\r\nWere Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s advisers given legal advice about whether it was appropriate for them to correspond with her using their personal accounts?\r\n\r\nWhy did Mrs. Clinton rely on the advice of Sidney Blumenthal?\r\n\r\n\r\n'
