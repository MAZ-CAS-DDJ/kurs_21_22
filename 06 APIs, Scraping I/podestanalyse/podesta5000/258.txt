john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John - \n\nWhen Republicans rejected compromise solutions to avoid the "sequester," they ushered in a series of cuts that promise to hurt military families at home and in the field. \n\nAt home, medical care, Department of Defense-run schools, social services like sexual assault prevention and treatment, tuition assistance, child care, and many other programs will get cut.\n\nIn the field, operations and maintenance funding (O&M) -- which is essentially responsible for readiness and deployment -- already faces a $6 billion shortfall, and sequestration could double it.\n\nWe have a powerful voice and unique opportunity to stop these cuts. Sign our petition to congressional leadership calling on an end to the sequester and its impact on military families.\n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/sequester\n\nNine Republican Senators already defected from a GOP plan to end the sequester, in large part because of the cuts impacting members of the military and their families. \n\nThey also rejected a commonsense Democratic plan that would have millionaires and billionaires shoulder a small amount of the burden to avoid sequester. \n\nThe issue is at an impasse right now, and our voices are critical to ensure there\'s a resolution to the crisis.\n\nSign our petition to congressional leadership and make your voice heard today.\n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/sequester\n\nWe\'ll deliver these petitions early next week and let you know about any responses we receive from legislative offices. \n\nBest,\n\nJon Soltz \n@jonsoltz \nIraq War Veteran \nChairman, VoteVets\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://action.votevets.org/unsubscribe\nPaid for by VoteVets Action Fund\n\n'
