So without further ado:\n\nWinners of The Second Annual Great Pumpkin Decorating Contest:\n\nAt last! It\'s the moment we\'ve been waiting for! It\'s been a frightfully long wait, but this time, it\'s no trick! It\'s time to announce the winners of the Second Annual Great Pumpkin Contest. Although with all the fantastic entries, it was dreadfully hard for people to choose, many folks did deliberate and cast their votes!\nWe don\'t want to be horribly rude and keep you waiting, so without further ado, the winners are:\n\n3rd Place:\nTied for third are Johnny Wong\'s "Tom Sawyer" Pumpkin and Betsy Kuhn\'s "Vietnam War Protester" Pumpkin.\n\n\n2nd Place:\nComing in second is Anna Selden\'s "Minion" Pumpkin (from the Despicable Me films).\n\nAnd finally, in ...\n1st Place:\nLindsey Carson\'s "Maleficent" Pumpkin (from Sleeping Beauty).\n\nWe\'d like to thank everyone for their wonderful submissions-you all did a fantastic job!
