[john mccain! john mccain! USA USA USA\n   - GIRL HOLDS UP SIGN: I WANT JOHN - WAR IS OVER [McCain holds out hands\n   to calm down crowd, crowd boos, someone rips sign out of girl\'s hand - she\n   holds up her fingers as peace signs]\n   - You know, you know (someone screaming form crowd)  hi hi (we want John!\n   we want john!) you know, you know, you know, you know my friends there is\n   a perfect example of some people that just don\'t get it. [McCain smiles,\n   crowd cheers]\n   - You know, you know the last thing, these people are trying to stay in\n   their homes and afford their healthcare they don\'t want us to yell at each\n   other. they want us to sit down, D and R and work together. i\'ve had\n   hundreds of Town Hall mtgs, I always give people a chance to talk, I don\'t\n   always enjoy it but I give them a chance.  So if there is anyone else who\n   has a problem,  come to the next town hall.\n   - As a senator, ive seen abuses of pwr and corruption., former members of\n   congress in prison. as pres I will end these abuses, whatever it takes.\n    never again will you spend 3 mil to study DNA of bears in Montana, my\n   opponent voted for bridge to nowhere, not on my watch my friends, ill  sign\n   into law reform for middle class tax breaks,  no to 700 billion dollars\n   going overseas to countries that don\'t like us.  And I\'ll keep families in\n   their homes and help with college and healthcare.  Spending freeze in fed\n   government, mayors and city councils have to do it.  My opponent said we\n   need a scalpel not a hatchet - we need both.  I will review every agency\n   and eliminate those not working for the people .\n   - I will confront the debt  including to Chinese and I will balance\n   budget by first term end   this is the agenda I have set before   and the\n   same candor must be applied to my opponent it is unclear what he has done or\n   what he will do.  He never answers the serious questions.\n   - He has even questioned my truthfulness.  I don\'t need lessons  and I\n   wouldn\'t request them from a Chicago politician.  What was ny opponents\n   record in the years before the  crisis.  People were given mortgages that\n   couldn\'t afford them fannie and Freddie.  I called for tighter restrictions\n   that could have avoided this crisis.  Dems and Obama blocked it.\n   - Barack Obama took campaign money from fannie and Freddie\n   - Obama will fine employers who don\'t offer healthcare.  How big of a\n   fine.  You deserve an answer.  Someone needs to ask Obama about size of\n   fine.  Ask employers how that helps them make new jobs.\n   - During the democratic primary he promised to raise taxes.  Making just\n   42,000 a year and now he claims 90% will receive tax cuts.  90% of small\n   business will be taxed more.\n   -  When im pres there taxes will go down and we will help them make jobs\n   - Obama will increase spending,  trillions in debt, claimed in debate\n   he\'d still end up in a net reduction, I\'ll cut the size of government,\n   - Earmarks, requested nearly a billion dollars .  more than 3mil for a\n   overhead projector, planetarium interesting case, head of planetarium\n   promised to raise money for Obama.  I\'ll put a stop to inside dealings,\n    American people know my record,  they now I\'ll reform Washington because\n   I\'ve done it before,  you don\'t have to hope for change when you vote for me\n   you\'ll know you\'ll get change, Ive been fighting for you my entire life.\n   -  I want to thank veterans in crowd,  Im honored, I salute you ,  I will\n   provide you with the healthcare you need and the benefits you deserve, wwII\n   to Iraq and Afghanistan with honor, I will bring them home with victory and\n   honor not defeat.  We are all reminded every day of the sacrifice of\n   American blood, everytime I encounter a family member,  in new Hampshire a\n   year ago woman at town hall gave her bracelet with sons name   died in\n   Afghanistan   promise me you\'ll do everything in your power to make sure he\n   did not die in vain.  Finest military or nation has ever had.  And when I\n   went to Baghdad, they said let us win.  So I want to be pres because I know\n   I can get a generation to serve their country.  Since I was 17  I swore\n    to support and defend the constitution   you know I will as pres always put\n   my country first.  Thank you and god bless.\n\n*\n\n\n\n-- \nSara DuBois\nTracking / Communications Manager\nProgressiveAccountability.org\nsara@progressiveaccountability.org\n202-609-7681 (office)\n410-967-7306 (cell)\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
