It sounds like we are in a holding pattern again on KXL.\nThat said, I agree with the approach in the memo and think we should deploy\nit at the right time.\n\n\n\nThree things:\n\n\n\n1.        I believe we should establish our Arctic position soon.  I agree\nwith the approach in the memo and would just add at the front \xe2\x80\x9cBased on\nwhat I know now\xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d  This would give her some flexibility later.\n\n2.       I\xe2\x80\x99d like John to take a close look at our revised LCV\nquestionnaire.  Can one of you send it to him, with the modified Arctic\nlanguage?\n\n3.       How are we looking on updating the CEC factsheet?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nJake\n\n\n\n*From:* Pete Ogden [mailto:progden@gmail.com]\n*Sent:* Thursday, August 6, 2015 1:32 PM\n*To:* John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>; Jake Sullivan <\njsullivan@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Cc:* Trevor Houser <tghouser.hrc@gmail.com>; Ben Kobren <\nbenkobren@gmail.com>; Corey Ciorciari <cciorciari@hillaryclinton.com>;\nMilia Fisher <mfisher@hillaryclinton.com>\n*Subject:* post-KXL option memo\n\n\n\nAt Jake's request, we have refreshed here the post-KXL decision options\nmemo and added an additional option calling for an end to offshore drilling\nin the Arctic (attached).
