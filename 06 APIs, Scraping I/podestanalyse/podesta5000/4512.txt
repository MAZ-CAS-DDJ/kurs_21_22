But we haven't gotten the response we need -  we're still $6,814 short for tonight. \n\nIf you want to beat Hayworth and Boehner, it's not enough to just talk about it. You have to donate today. \n\nIf (and ONLY if) everyone I'm including here gives $250, we'll be able to respond to Congresswoman Hayworth's million dollar ads and win. Otherwise... all Boehner all the time. This is the best link to get the money to the stations FAST: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/spmrapidresponse?refcode=20141004pm-ld&amounts=250,500,1000,2500,2600\n\nI'm counting on your help to get us to the winning number.\n\n- Sean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\nThis email was sent to john.podesta@gmail.com. \n\nTo unsubscribe from the Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress email list, please click here:\n\nhttp://action.seanmaloney.com/page/unsubscribe/?email=john.podesta@gmail.com\n\n\nPaid for by Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n\n\n\n"
