john.podesta@gmail.comb'\nDear Ezekial Emmanuel, Nera Tanden, and John Podesta,\n \n    I was preparing to write a correction to the letter  I sent you all \nyesterday when I received this response from Janine Bertram Kemp,  the widow of \nEvan Kemp, a man with a disability and  the former head of the  EEOC.  I \ncan\'t remember ever being more disillusioned in my life. I really  believed in \nthis president,and now Nancy and Min DiParle delivered this  heartless \nmessage to seniors and people with disabilities. I will be taking the  0bama for \npresident sticker off the back of my wheelchair which probably  doesn\'t \nmean much to anybody but me. I worked long and hard to get this  president \nelected.  In all my years of being an activist for decades I\'ve  never been so \nheartbroken. How would you feel of people turn their backs on you,  or your \nson and daughter or mother or father to live in freedom or to be locked  away \nin an institution where abuse and neglect is rampant and seldom enforced.  \nWhen no such abuses exists in nursing homes, they are still no place for a  \nperson with hope for the future or any good years ahead of them. \n    It is a violation of our rights under the Olmsted  supreme court \nposition and the empathy the president said he wants in a Supreme  Court justice \nseems not to exist in this  administration when it comes to  people with \ndisabilities.\n    I am an activist of some note, and if this  administration persists in \nthis heartless refusal to even listen to our cries  for freedom and choice, \nwe will not be closed mouth about it. One can only  wonder how many nursing \nhome contributions were influential in this decision.  For shame.  I am \ngoing to write to Michelle 0bama. I cannot believe someone  is kind as she \nappears to be could support this position.\n \n    Disillusioned and heartbroken,\n    Nancy Becker Kennedy\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"\xe2\x80\x9cIf you hear the dogs barking, keep going. If you  hear them yelling after \nyou, keep going. If you see the torches behind you, keep  going. If you \nwant a taste of freedom, keep going.\nKeep going, keep going, keep going\xe2\x80\x9d\nNever Ever Give Up!"\nHarriet Tubman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Becker  Kennedy\n\n\n\n"Never doubt that a small group of  thoughtful, committed citizens can \nchange the world. Indeed, it is the only  thing that ever has." - Margaret  Mead \n\nThanks  for this Nancy. It\'s worse than not being heard by the \nadministration.  Nancy DiParle told ADAPT we\'d have to "learn to live with institutional \n bias" and they took support for the Community Choice Act off Obama\'s \ndisability  platform.    I mostly don\'t regret working flat out to elect Obama  \nbecause I think he will do some good things for the country. But it is a sad  \ntravesty that the George W. Bush administration did more for us by funding \nMoney  Follows the Person than the Obama administration plans on...which is \nnothing.  I\'ve not given up working for CCA though.    We\'ll keep  on with \nthis struggle.  Warm best,  Janine\n\n\nOn May 27, 2009, at 11:14 PM, _Nancybk@aol.com_ (mailto:Nancybk@aol.com)  \nwrote:\n\n\n\nPlease care.  Have we become so inured to the marginalization of  people \ndisabilities that we are content to let them rot away in institutions,  in a \ncondition that will certainly be condemned by history along with the  \nlobotomies and snake pits of the past. I believe it to be a national source of  \nshame.\n\nI  have had an  Obama sticker on the back of my  wheelchair for two years \nand volunteered hard to get him elected.  Last  week hundreds of our ADAPT \nactivists were jailed without being heard from by  this administration about \nour rights to liberty granted to us under the  Olmsted Supreme Court \ndecision. We should have a right to an option for  community-based services rather \nthan a life akin to a political prisoner in an  institution.\n\nPlease give a damn about our country\'s moral obligation to grant liberty  \nto all people.  Why are people with disabilities the only people not  granted \nrights by our Constitution to life liberty and the pursuit of  happiness?  \nI beg of you, by all that\'s holy, to please care! \n \nMost sincerely,\nNancy Becker Kennedy\n \nHealth  Care Reform and the Disability Community  \n_http://www.huffingthttp://www.http://www.http://www.hhttp://www.http://www.\nhhttp_ \n(http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ari-neeman/health-care-reform-and-th_b_206492.html) \n \n \n (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ari-neeman) _Ari  Ne\'eman_ \n(http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ari-neeman) \n \nFounding President of the Autistic Self-Advocacy  Network \nPosted: May 21, 2009 04:42 PM \n\n \n\n \nAs we speak, Congress is deliberating on vast and important changes to  the \nsystem of health care in the United States. This issue is one of crucial  \nimportance to all Americans, but of particular interest to those Americans \nwho  interact with public health insurance more than almost any other group -- \n people with disabilities. Ranging from veterans with disabilities who \nreceive  care through the Veteran\'s Administration health care system to the \nmany  low-income disabled adults who are eligible for Medicaid, the disability  \ncommunity interacts with the public health care infrastructure in the \nUnited  States in a wide variety of ways. As we consider how to reform, \nstreamline and  expand that infrastructure through any of a variety of means, it is \nincumbent  upon us to remember the key issues for making sure that health \ncare reform  doesn\'t leave disabled adults and youth behind.  \n1. Long Term Services and Supports (LTSS): Ever since  the passage of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act 19 years ago, the main  priority of the \ndisability rights movement in the United States has been  eliminating the \ninstitutional bias in Medicaid. This bias imprisons Americans  both young and old \nin nursing homes and institutions in order to get the basic  services \nnecessary to survive. This is both tragic and unnecessary.  Individuals and \nfamilies are forced to choose between having to fend for  themselves or living out \ntheir lives in institutional care. Both research and  the experience of \ncountless people with disabilities show that, with the right  support, people \ncan live in the community rather than be relegated to  institutions. Community \nliving settings, when properly implemented, improve  quality of life, \nreduce the risk of abuse, make it more likely that a person  with a disability \nwill be able to work and are actually much less costly than  institutional \ncare. \nRight now, the main obstacle to LTSS reform is the bias in Medicaid  long \nterm care policy which reimburses states for costly and segregated  \ninstitutional care but makes it extraordinary difficult to use the same money  to \nsupport adults in the community instead. A person who uses a wheelchair or  an \nadult with a developmental disability such as autism or Down Syndrome can  \nget the government to pay for a costly institutional placement with low  \nquality of life, but often must spend years on a waiting list for far less  \nexpensive services, such as attendant care that could keep them in their home  \nor their family\'s. The abuses that take place within nursing homes and  \ninstitutions are well documented and are truly shocking. This situation  benefits \nnobody but lobbyists for the nursing home/institutions industry,  which has \nbeen quite active in opposing reform on this issue.  \nThe Senate Finance Committee has recognized the need for some action on  \nLTSS, but so far has only recommended limited reforms like increasing the  \nfederal Medicaid reimbursement for Home and Community Based Services by 1%.  \nThe real answer can be found in the Community Choice Act, which would add a  \nbenefit to Medicaid that would require states to allow people who meet an  \ninstitutional level of care to instead control their own supports while  \nchoosing to live at home or with their families. President Obama won kudos  from \nthe disability community by supporting the Community Choice Act during  his \ncampaign, but since then the White House has signaled that this issue will  \nnot be considered as part of health care reform. The Community Choice Act  \nshould be properly considered a civil rights issue, as it means the \ndifference  between segregation or integration for millions of disabled citizens as \nwell  as many senior citizens for whom LTSS reform may be what keeps them out \nof a  nursing home and living a life of dignity. Health care reform that \nfails to  include this issue is health care reform that fails to meet the \nneeds of over  50 million Americans with disabilities.  \n2. Health Care Disparities for People with  Disabilities: Both \nCongressional leaders and the President have  talked about the importance of addressing \nhealth care disparities on the basis  of race, income and geography. But \nwhat about disability health care  disparities? Too often, medical problems \nfaced by people with disabilities are  assumed to be normal and unavoidable as \na result of being disabled. However,  disability and ill health should not \nbe considered synonymous. People with  disabilities face significant barriers \nto access quality health care, due to  both poverty and accessibility \nproblems. In addition, most physicians lack  necessary expertise on common \nco-existing medical issues that people with  disabilities of various kinds face. \nFor Autistic adults and children, who often have sensory hyper- and  \nhypo-sensitivities as well as trouble with social and/or verbal communication,  \ncommunicating medical problems can be exceedingly difficult. For people with  \nDown Syndrome and other developmental disabilities, a doctor\'s expertise on  \nco-existing medical issues can mean the difference between living full,  \nmeaningful and fulfilling lives or facing an early death due to preventable  \nsecondary conditions. For Deaf people, getting access to sign language  \ninterpreters in hospitals and doctor\'s offices is often exceptionally  difficult. \nFor many wheelchair users or people with other mobility  impairments, even \ngetting in the door to the doctor\'s office can be a problem.  If they can, \nthey often face inaccessible examination tables and other medical  equipment \nthat prevents them from getting the same medical care available to  any \nother person. One woman with a mobility impairment was told by her  physician \nthat the scales they possessed were inaccessible to people with her  \ndisability, but that she should consider going to the post office and being  weighed \non the scale for large packages instead!  \nRespectfully, people with disabilities are not postal mail. It is  \ndisturbing to think of the number of preventable medical conditions caused by  lack \nof access to appropriate medical care. This is imposing a cost that can  be \nmeasured both in terms of quality of life and dollars spent later on  \npreventable secondary medical conditions. Congress must recognize people with  \ndisabilities as an underserved population subject to health disparities by  \nundertaking both data collection and serious policy reform to ensure that  \nissues of access, expertise and coverage are address for the disability  \ncommunity.  \n3. Insurance Discrimination: According to the  Executive Director of Access \nLiving, a Center for Independent Living in  Chicago, and past Chair of the \nNational Council on Disability Marca Bristo,  insurance discrimination has \nbeen one of the single largest obstacles to full  integration of people with \ndisabilities in society. States have tried to  address this matter with a \npatchwork of insurance mandate laws, virtually all  of which have represented \ndisability and methodology- According to the  Executive Director of Access \nLiving, a Center for Independent Living in  Chicago, and past Chair of the \nNational Council on Disability Marca Bristo,  insurance discrimination has \nbeen one of the single largest obstacles to full  integration of people with \ndisabilities in society. States have tried to  address this matter with a \npatchwork of insurance mandate laws, virtually all  of which have re\n\n4. Stop discrimination in the provision of  care: Too often, people with \ndisabilities are denied  necessary -- sometimes even life-saving -- medical \ncare because of assumptions  that non-disabled people make about our quality \nof life. For many people,  disability is still considered a fate worse than \ndeath instead of a part of  the human experience. As a result, it has been \ndisabled people who are pushed  over the side first when resources become \nscarce. As recently as last year, a  task force including doctors from the \nCenters for Disease Control and  Prevention, the Department of Homeland Security \nand the Department of Health  and Human Services issued guidelines stating \nthat, in the event of a flu  pandemic or similar emergency, people with \nintellectual disabilities as well  as those with chronic health conditions may be \nexcluded from care. \nThe eugenic impulse that views people with disabilities as "burdens on  \nsociety" or "life unworthy of life" is still regrettably alive and well within  \nour health care system. Just last week, Disability Rights Wisconsin, the  \nstate\'s protection and advocacy system for people with disabilities, filed  \nsuit against the University of Wisconsin hospital as a result of their  \ndecision to withhold medication and basic nourishment from two patients with  \nintellectual disabilities who had pneumonia. These individuals were not in a  \npersistent vegetative state, were not dying and one even asked for food. The  \ndecision to refuse anti-biotics, nutrition and fluids for a treatable \nmedical  condition was made by hospital officials based on their determination of \n "quality of life" for the individuals in question. Health care reform must \n include non-discrimination protections that prevent these types of \natrocities  by health care providers.  \nThese concerns are also relevant because of the likelihood that cost  \ncontainment measures will be included in the health care reform initiative.  \nCongress should avoid repeating the highly controversial Oregon Health Plan of  \nthe early 1990s, whose priority list of services ranked medical conditions \nin  order to ration out care on the basis of a government determination of  \nseverity. Americans, with or without disabilities, deserve not to be pitted  \nagainst each other in their efforts to obtain the health care services they  \nneed. With limited resources, Congress will need to make difficult \ndecisions -  yet discriminating against people with disabilities in the provision of \nhealth  care services should never be considered an acceptable option. \n\nOne of  the key critiques of the Disability Rights Movement has always been \nthat, for  many of us, the problems we face are not inevitably associated \nwith whatever  condition or diagnosis we may possess but are as much the \nresult of societal  discrimination in the form of infrastructures that were \nbuilt without  consideration that people like us might one day use them. Nowhere \nis this  issue clearer than in health care. A health care reform agenda \nthat includes  these concerns can drastically improve the lives of many \nmillions of  Americans. One that simply reinforces the status quo will represent \nyet  another wasted opportunity. It is no longer acceptable to doom a \nconsiderable  portion of the American populace to more discrimination, more \nsegregation and  more disparities in access to meaningful health care.  \nDisability has often been called the great equalizer -- our community  \nreaches throughout every racial, religious, gender and political  \nclassification. Furthermore, though we are wide and varied, including both  people with \nacquired disabilities, such as many of our brave men and women in  uniform \ncoming home from overseas, and others who were born with their  disabilities, \nsuch as myself and the rest of the Autistic community, we can  unite around \nour common dream for full participation, inclusion, integration  and equality \nof opportunity for all. The disability message is a civil rights  message. \nIt is time for Congress and the President to hear our voices: Nothing  About \nUs, Without Us!  \n_http://www.huffingthttp://www.http://www.http://www.hhttp://www.http://www.\nhhttp_ \n(http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ari-neeman/health-care-reform-and-th_b_206492.html) \n\n\n\n\n \n____________________________________\nCooking Dinner For Two? _Sign  Up & Get Immediate Member-Only Savings._ \n(http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100126575x1222652750x1201460983/aol?redir=http://\nad.doubleclick.net/clk;215225797;37274671;q?http://recipes.cookingfor2.pills\nbury.com/?ESRC=934) \n\n\nFrom: _Barnonhill@aol.com_ (mailto:Barnonhill@aol.com) \n\nDate: May 27, 2009 9:05:53 PM  PDT\n\nTo: _j.ahubbard@charter.net_ (mailto:j.ahubbard@charter.net) \n\nSubject:  Health  Care Reform and the Disability Community\n\n\n\n\nthis was excellent and I sent all but the last paragraph to  \n_www.whitehouse.gov_ (http://www.whitehouse.gov/)  (because of lack of  space) Telling \nObama that it is what we face from a lack of good health  care!
