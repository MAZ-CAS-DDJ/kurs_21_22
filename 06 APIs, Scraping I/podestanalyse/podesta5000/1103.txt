john.podesta@gmail.comb'Simas called--few updates:\n\n--This week, they\'re releasing a letter from former DNC chairs endorsing\nthe deal\n--Deval Patrick and Tom Daschle are going to roll out a progressive\ncoalition supporting it\n--They\'ve been told she\'s going to get asked about TPA/TPP at the Saunders\nevent...I don\'t think Lee would ever try to screw her, but I can see\nsomeone else doing it.\n\nThree questions:\n1. Do we think this thing is actually going to move--or can we just hang\nback?\n2. If we do think it\'s moving, do we want her to announce her support via\nletter before we announce the campaign so we can press "reset" with labor\nduring annoucement?\n3. What should we prep her to say at the AFSCME event?\n'
