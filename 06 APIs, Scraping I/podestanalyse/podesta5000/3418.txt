I want to assure you,\nthat we not only have a role model, but we will hire people and we will make\nsure people come to our administration wherever there is discrimination.  We\nwill eliminate it, we will fight it, and* if necessary we\'ll take them to\ncourt.*  We\'ll do those things.\nTo View: [tba-- YouTube is down for maintenance]\nTo Download: http://issuealliance.box.net/shared/g1j0utaqbe\n\n...versus...\n*Flashback:** McCain Tells 14-Year-Old Equal Pay Vote Wouldn\'t "Do Anything\nTo Help The Rights Of Women," Only Trial Lawyers*\nQUESTIONER: Thank you. I was wondering, Senator McCain, why, um, when you\nhad the opportunity to vote to give equal rights to women, equal pay, I was\nwondering why you didn\'t show up to vote and you said that if you did, you\nwouldn\'t support it?\n\nJOHN MCCAIN: I think you\'re referring to a vote recently that would\'ve\nallowed, which would\'ve eliminated the statute of limitations on lawsuits\nof, for charges or allegations of discrimination. Uh, I think that if you\neliminate the statute of limitations and make it, uh, unending then you may\nbe violating the rights of the individual who\'s being sued as well, whether\nthey be a man or a woman. So, I believe that the Supreme Court\'s decision\nwas correct, that there is a statute of limitations as, as to when charges\nor allegations or legal means are taken, uh, and* I believe that it was a\ncorrect decision of the United States Supreme Court and I don\'t believe that\nthis would do anything to help the rights of women except maybe help trial\nlawyers* and others in that profession. And that\'s my view. [applause]. If\nyou\'d like to follow up, I\'d be glad to hear your response to that. If\nyou\'d\x97obviously we disagree but if you\'d\x97would you\x97wou--would you like\ntomake another comment?\n\nQUESTIONER: I have someone here who I think would like to\x97who I think would\nbe very more much articulate than me with answering th\x97\n\nQUESTIONER 2: [to scattered booing] That\'s ok, she\'s fourteen years old, ok?\n(Town Hall; Rochester, MI 05/07/08)\nTo View: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB7aHj8aKV0\n\n\n-- \nSara DuBois\nTracking / Communications Manager\nProgressiveAccountability.org\nsara@progressiveaccountability.org\n202-609-7681 (office)\n410-967-7306 (cell)\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
