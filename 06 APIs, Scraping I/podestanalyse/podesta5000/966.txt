john.podesta@gmail.comb'John -- trust me when I say this:\n\nJohn Foust can deliver a major upset to the GOP and turn Northern Virginia "blue."\n\nBut he needs you with him right now. Polls show him deadlocked with Barbara Comstock, but his record is being smeared 24 hours a day on Virginia T.V.\n\nSo, I\'m asking. Can you pitch in for John before tonight\'s fundraising so he has the resources to set the record straight?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/foustq42014?refcode=em_FR_2014.10.25_b1_tk_ldnd&amp;amp;amount=25&amp;amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;amp;firstname=John&amp;amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;amp;city=Washington&amp;amp;state=DC&amp;amp;zip=20016&amp;amp;phone=2162818851&amp;amp;occupation=&amp;amp;employer=&amp;amp;recur_weekly=true\n\nSome of John\'s strong supporters have agreed to match dollar for dollar any funds raised from this email.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/foustsep2014?refcode=em_FR_2014.10.25_b1_tk_ldnd&amp;amp;amount=25&amp;amp;amounts=15,25,50,100,250,500,1000&amp;amp;email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu&amp;amp;firstname=John&amp;amp;lastname=Podesta&amp;amp;city=Washington&amp;amp;state=DC&amp;amp;zip=20016&amp;amp;phone=2162818851&amp;amp;occupation=&amp;amp;employer=&amp;amp;recur_weekly=true\n\nThanks for everything,\n\nTim\n\n\nThis message was emailed to: podesta@law.georgetown.edu\n\nTo unsubscribe from this email list, please paste this URL into your browser: \nhttp://act.foustforvirginia.com/unsubscribe\n\nPaid for by John Foust for Congress\n\n'
