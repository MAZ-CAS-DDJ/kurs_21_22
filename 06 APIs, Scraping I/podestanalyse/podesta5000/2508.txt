L\xc3\xb3pez, a lawyer from\nPuerto Rico and national co-chair of the Futuro Fund, which helped raise\n$32 million for Obama in 2012 from Latino donors. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has a wealth of\nexperience, he\xe2\x80\x99s insightful and has the trust of the candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter the 2012 election, L\xc3\xb3pez said he turned to Villarreal for advice and\nhad a long, fruitful conversation with him on how to continue \xe2\x80\x9cmoving the\nneedle forward on Latino issues.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs long as he is someone in the room, seated at the table with her, his\nword carries weight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nDemocratic operatives and donors know that repeating Obama\xe2\x80\x99s success with\nLatino voters, when he got 71% of their support, would be a boon to her\ncampaign and have publicly and privately called for Clinton to both take\noutreach to the growing Latino electorate seriously as well as fill the\ncampaign at all levels with Hispanic staff with expertise in their\nrespective areas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuilding a successful strategy to reach Latino donors and voters starts\nwith having members of the community in key decision making roles. I\napplaud the Clinton campaign for bringing on Jose Villarreal,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nCrist\xc3\xb3bal Alex, president of the Latino Victory Project, which has helped\nelect Latino Democrats. \xe2\x80\x9cMuch of this election cycle will be focused on how\neffectively campaigns can register, educate and turn out Latino voters. And\nthe Clinton team is taking this challenge seriously.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nClinton has also brought together the duo of operatives who helped Obama\nwin 70% of the Latino vote in Nevada\n<http://www.buzzfeed.com/adriancarrasquillo/hillary-clinton-reunites-obamas-latino-team-in-nevada-with-s#.wnG6a158wB>,\nstate director, Emmy Ruiz, and organizing director, Jorge Neri, BuzzFeed\nNews reported last week.\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups "HRCRapid" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to hrcrapid+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to hrcrapid@googlegroups.com.\nTo view this discussion on the web visit https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/hrcrapid/CANu9wN6ZG%2BG1it7LjG5OwvOH4o76dsfWo0997FD0zAHLvzUj6g%40mail.gmail.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.\n'
