john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John:\n\nIn January, Big Oil was handed a gift that will help them try to fill\nCongress with their cronies.\n\nThe Supreme Court has handed Big Oil a blank check to spend unlimited\namounts on elections.\n\nWe must fight back.\n\nSend an urgent message to your members of Congress today to demand\naction.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=PYbw-hVCtHeDeAGGmd2hbQ..\n\nA disastrous Supreme Court ruling has removed any restrictions on how\nmuch money big corporations like ExxonMobil can spend to elect their\nfriends and defeat our allies in Congress.\n\nThis means that profit-driven Big Polluters can now spend unlimited\namounts on elections, drowning out the voices of the majority of\nAmericans who support clean energy and a healthy environment.\n\nCongress must rectify this issue right away. Will you contact your\nmembers of Congress to insist they pass legislation reinstating\ncorporate spending limits on elections?\n\nClick here to demand that Congress take swift action.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=8ruNOVopa3D9vQ0wME6VBQ..\n\nWe know that Big Oil has deep pockets. Now, this ruling has allowed\nthem to dig even deeper to influence elections, and destroy our clean\nenergy future in the process.\n\nConsider what kind of damage this ruling could cause: In the 2007-2008\nelection cycle, before this catastrophic Supreme Court ruling,\nExxonMobil spent just $800,000 on election activities due to existing\nrestrictions. With these limits no longer in place,\nExxon\'s record-breaking profits could be tapped without\nrestraint. If Exxon diverted just two percent of their $45 billion in\n2008 profits to electoral activities, they could outspend the Obama\nand McCain campaigns combined.\n\nWe can\'t let this stand.\n\nSend an urgent message to your members of Congress right away.\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=szR8jylovW4emIW20Fel1w..\n\nThis Supreme Court decision is part of the disastrous legacy of one of\nBig Oil\'s best friends - George W. Bush. It was Chief\nJustice Roberts and Justice Alito, Bush-appointed justices, who were\nthe key swing votes in this outrageous decision.\n\nPresident Obama criticized this ruling in his State of the Union\naddress, saying it would "open the floodgates for special\ninterests" to spend without limits in our elections, and called\non Congress to pass a bill that fixes this wrong-headed decision.\n\nPlease, take a minute to contact your members of Congress now.\n\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=eltFku75qgjDcHRzOWnyXw..\n\nAfter you take action, please spread the word. Thank you. \n\nSincerely,\n\nGene Karpinski\nPresident\nLeague of Conservation Voters\n\n\n\n\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=bOpmK9x2Qzv37zMFceHOrw..\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=Y5oZm77un9xHoIq-5e_ZGeAWZY5tOF8f&cid=0\n\n'
