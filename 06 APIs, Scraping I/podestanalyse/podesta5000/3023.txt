john.podesta@gmail.comb'John --\n\nVirginia has GOP nominee E.W. Jackson, who calls progressivism "an agenda worthy of the Anti-Christ." Colorado has right-wing recall activists declaring it\'s "time to hunt Democrats."\n\nAnd now Michigan has a House Education Committee chairperson who talks about laying off teachers by saying "Pigs get fat, and hogs get slaughtered:"\n\nClick here to watch the video, and then please sign our petition denouncing Michigan Republican Lisa Lyons\' extreme attacks on teachers and working people!\n\nMichigan teachers earn an average starting salary of $34,724 \xe2\x80\x93 less than half of what Republican Rep. Lisa Lyons makes as a state legislator. But according to Rep. Lyons and her GOP allies, that makes teachers "pigs" to be "slaughtered." And she\'s not the only Republican who thinks so.\n\nMichigan House Republicans were so proud of Rep. Lyons\' remarks that they posted them to the GOP Caucus\' official website.\n\nThe only way to stop attacks like these is if we come together to make sure Republicans pay a price for their extreme rhetoric \xe2\x80\x93 thank you for speaking out.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKevin Boyd\nRegional Strategist\nThe Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee\n\nWatch the Video:\n<http://dlcc.wiredforchange.com/o/6377/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=145&Email=john.podesta@gmail.com>\n\nContribute:  \n<https://secure.dlccweb.com/o/6377/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=7327&Email=john.podesta@gmail.com>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic Legislative Campaign Committee\n1401 K Street NW Suite 201, Washington, DC 20005\nDLCC(at)dlcc.org\n\nContributions or gifts to the DLCC are not tax deductible.\n\nThis message was sent to: john.podesta@gmail.com.\nIf you received this message in error, we apologize.
