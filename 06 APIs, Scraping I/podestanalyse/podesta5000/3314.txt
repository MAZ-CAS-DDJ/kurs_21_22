The 3 alternative ideas Brian and I had collected were:\n\n   - she\'s vetted -- he\'s not -- so the polls mean nothing\n   - the person the Rs (and trump) are worried about running against is\n   HER, not him.  that\'s why they\'re running ads against her.  that\'s why\n   they\'re running ads to HELP him.  that\'s why the RNC has released press\n   statements and even tweets admitting that they are behind sanders.  because\n   the person they don\'t want to run against is Hillary.\n   - relying on polls to show you are worthy of being president is what\n   Trump himself does\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Mar 4, 2016 at 1:50 PM, Ron Klain <ron.klain@revolution.com> wrote:\n\nI really do think Joel\xe2\x80\x99s idea is very sharp here.  It shuts Sanders up.\nAnd in fact, it makes his line about the polls into a trap that allows HRC\nto talk about voters and people rallying to support her.  A version of this\ncan also be a pushback when Sanders hits her on superdelegates.\n\n\n\n*From:* Sara Solow [mailto:ssolow@hillaryclinton.com]\n*Sent:* Friday, March 04, 2016 1:49 PM\n*To:* Ron Klain; Brian Fallon\n*Cc:* Joel Benenson; Karen Dunn; Kristina Costa; Mandy Grunwald; John\nPodesta; Jim Margolis; Tony Carrk; Jake Sullivan; Jennifer Palmieri;\nChristina Reynolds; Dan Schwerin; rklain@aol.com\n*Subject:* Re: Debate Book - for tomorrow\'s prep\n\n\n\nAdding Brian, because he and I were just brainstorming how to approach\nthis.

I think Sen Sanders would also have to\nacknowledge that I have  not outpolled him significantly among\nAfrican-Americans & Latinos, but among all voters over that age of 30, who\ntotal 83% of all Democratic votes cast,  I beat Sen Sanders by 2 to 1 or\n1.4 MM voters.  I have also won our primaries in key swing states like\nVirginia, Iowa and Nevada and about 8 states Sen Sanders has won fewer\nvoters than either Trump or myself.\n\n\n\nThe point is that winning in Nov.  will take building a strong, diverse\ncoalition. We are going to have to do what both Bill Clinton and Barack\nObama did to win \xe2\x80\x93 appeal to and actually turnout the diverse coalition of\nvoters we need to win the presidency.  So far, it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that my\nmessage, my campaign is doing a much better job of building that coalition\nand actually getting our voters to the polls. \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\n*From:* Sara Solow [mailto:ssolow@hillaryclinton.com\n<ssolow@hillaryclinton.com>]\n*Sent:* Friday, March 04, 2016 1:09 PM\n*To:* Ron Klain; Karen Dunn; Kristina Costa; Mandy Grunwald; Joel Benenson;\nJohn Podesta; Jim Margolis; Tony Carrk; Jake Sullivan; Jennifer Palmieri;\nChristina Reynolds; Dan Schwerin\n*Subject:* Debate Book - for tomorrow\'s prep\n\n\n\nDear all,\n\nHere is the Debate Book -- this document is exactly what HRC currently has\nin hard copy.
