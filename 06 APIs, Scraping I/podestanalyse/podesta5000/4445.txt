He's aware of her meetings today and has basic sense of plan but could use a conversation with you. He's in mexico and then montana till beginning of the year fyi.\n________________________________\nFrom: Robert Mook <robbymook@gmail.com>\nSent: Wednesday, December 17, 2014 8:01:13 PM\nTo: Huma Abedin\nCc: John Podesta; Cheryl Mills n\nSubject: Re: Update\n\nWe had a good meeting today to ratify the research plan and discuss staffing structure and talent.  Few things to report out:\n\n1. We seem to have a settled on a team for the research project--we just need to lock in the media people.  Attached is the latest draft of the one pager.  I'm hoping to get the team discussing and editing the project design over the holiday so we can present a proposal to HRC at the beginning of Jan.  Fingers crossed.\n\n2. Good discussion about digital and tech.  I think we have some good digital options...she approved setting up an interview process for CTO candidates, since we want someone outside politics for this role and we need outside advice on candidates.\n\n3. Self research: Cheryl, she wanted to keep Heather and the team going from DC.  I flagged that we will likely need to expand the team to 5-10 people, which she seemed fine with.  I also flagged that self research is so integral to rapid response, vetting, content, etc that we'd probably want a contingent in HQ to prevent bottlenecks.  We agreed I'd loop back with you to discuss options--I think a hybrid model may work.  Let's discuss.\n\n4. We had a good discussion about communications.  John there are some WH people I'd like to discuss.  I'll follow up.  Any names welcome!\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Dec 17, 2014 at 1:41 PM, Huma Abedin <huma@hrcoffice.com<mailto:huma@hrcoffice.com>> wrote:\nMeant to email sooner that she was seeing Pollack and Anzalone today.\nShe seemed to like both of them and basically told them both they would be part of this initial plan. No promises.\n"
