We hosted a big crowd on Shelter Island and are now recovering.\n\nI wanted to let you know that Blackstone President Tony James and Tim Geithner are hosting a small dinner for your economic team on January 20th. Schmidt, Shapiro, Sullivan and Harris are confirmed. Ann is tentative but will attend if she's in town that night. Tim and Tony were hoping you would join. Small. Off the record. No agenda other than hopefully a dynamic conversation about economic policy. This will either be at Tony's apartment or a location closer to the campaign.\n\nLet me know if you can make it. Even a drop-by would be great.\n\nRegards,\nChristine\n917-697-8795\n\n\n________________________________\n\nThis e-mail communication is intended only for the addressee(s) named above and any others who have been specifically authorized to receive it and may contain information that is privileged, confidential or otherwise protected from disclosure.
