We\xe2\x80\x99ve said it all before about him.\r\n\r\nFrom: speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com [mailto:speechdrafts@hillaryclinton.com] On Behalf Of Jennifer Palmieri\r\nSent: Thursday, March 17, 2016 7:04 PM\r\nTo: John Podesta\r\nCc: Corey Ciorciari; Ben Krauss; Emily Aden; Harrell Kirstein; Speech Drafts\r\nSubject: Re: HRC Op-Ed on Gun Violence\r\n\r\nMy theory is that we do not want to be in a one on one with Trump - but want to hit him occasionally.  In which case, we also need to be hitting Sanders occasionally so we can credibly say we are not only focused on the general.\r\n\r\nFor example, we were going to do a press call tomorrow in AZ with locals about guns (number one testing contrast issue).  So I thought good to do here.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is too hard here - but thought we should have some measure of contrast.\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Mar 17, 2016 at 6:58 PM, John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>> wrote:\r\nShould we directly hit Sanders in this NYDN oped right now?

Since it is the NYDN I think we should add the terrorist watch list piece.  I defer to you on where but we could stick at the end of this riff as a proof point against the NRA?\r\n\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been fighting for this issue for years.  So have families across the country.
