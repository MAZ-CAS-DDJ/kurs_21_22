john.podesta@gmail.comb"John,\n\nThe response to yesterday's email has been overwhelming. LCV has raised $15,135 towards the $22,000 goal! Volunteers have already started making thousands of phone calls to\xa0 targeted voters -- but we'll need more resources to ensure we reach all 50,000 voters we need to contact.\n\nWill you chip in with a\xa0$500.00 donation to help us meet our $22,000 goal today?\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=nHq-DJo4lsjzu7O8ySzZFQ..\n\nThanks!\n\nKerry Schumann\nExecutive Director\nWisconsin League of Conservation Voters\n\nDear John,\n\nThe Wisconsin recall fight is ground zero for the future of sound environmental policy.\n\nWe need to raise $22,000 in 36 hours to contact 50,000 more voters. Will you help?\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=0DG-rimBmCboQ0f1V9-7YQ..\n\nThe state of Wisconsin has emerged as ground zero for efforts to take back our democracy from corporate special interests. As you've probably heard, Tea Party-backed lawmakers, led by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, are pushing one of the most egregious anti-environment agendas in the nation. And if they succeed unchallenged, other states may soon see similar efforts.\n\nBut we're fighting back - and we need your help: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=2Y7HmcL--1qqCaxO34g61Q.. .\n\nIn just a few weeks, Wisconsin will hold special recall elections for a handful of the most anti-environment state legislators. This is our first opportunity, since November 2010, to deal a blow to a Tea Party movement that saw too many victories last year. LCV and our state partner, the Wisconsin League of Conservation Voters, are already on the ground making calls and talking door-to-door with Wisconsin voters. I've never seen such a quick campaign mobilization. Can you help with a donation right now?\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=DOObfM2S1OiQpLNjB3rDPg..\n\nThere's a great chance we'll win this summer and flip the Wisconsin State Senate back to a pro-environment majority, but to do it we need expand our voter contact efforts right now. For each of these races, the outcome could be decided by just a few DOZEN votes! That's why we're working with Wisconsin LCV to identify and target another 50,000 voters in swing districts from the City of Milwaukee to all the way up to Polk County.\n\nTo get staff and volunteers into those districts immediately, we need to raise another $22,000 in the next 36 hours. Can you help with a donation right now?\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=9CdZhB8SrUTuHwny6gNXiA..\n\nThe Koch Brothers and their dirty polluter allies are investing millions to keep the Wisconsin State Senate's anti-environment majority. They invested heavily in Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and other Tea Party governors during the 2010 elections and there are not about to see their investments fall short. \n\nSo far, Scott Walker has delivered handsomely for dirty polluters. Walker's anti-environment attacks include:\n\n*  Shutting down Wisconsin's $400 million wind industry\n*  Rejecting $800 million in mass transit funding (absolutely disgraceful when gas is at $4 per gallon)\n*  Providing campaign donors special exemptions to build on Wisconsin's wetlands\n\nIf Scott Walker and the Koch Brothers win this summer it will open the floodgates to unchecked dirty polluter campaign money. If they win in Wisconsin, every sound environmental policy in every state will be under threat. But just as important, Wisconsin LCV is backing a strong slate of pro-environment candidates who will fight for important environmental protections and vital clean energy policies.\n\nCan you donate\xa0$500.00 right now to help us mobilize 50,000 more voters in Wisconsin and stop the Koch Brothers and other dirty polluters?\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=P_V9FKoK5J1WEIaeusY3Qg..\n\nWe're at a critical juncture in this fight. Here's what it takes to win:\n\n*  A $10 donation will put 10 mail pieces in the mail boxes of 10 targeted voters\n*  A $30 donation help us make 50 phone calls\xa0\n*  A $50 donation will help us knock on 50 doors\xa0\n*  A $100 donation will help us put 100 yard signs on front lawns in critical swing districts\n\nThanks for your support in this fight. There are just a few weeks left, but with your support, we can win this summer.\n\nGene Karpinski\nPresident\nLeague of Conservation Voters\n\n\n\nPaid for by the League of Conservation Voters Wisconsin Fund, Patrick Collins, Treasurer.
