Here\'s what he said\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/us/politics/13text-mccain.html?pagewa\nnted=2&bl&ei=5087&en=c9a6104ee896e341&ex=1216180800> :\n\n\tQ: President Bush believes that gay couples should not be\npermitted to adopt children. Do you agree with that?\n\n\tMr. McCain: I think that we\'ve proven that both parents are\nimportant in the success of a family so, no I don\'t believe in gay\nadoption.\n\n\tQ: Even if the alternative is the kid staying in an orphanage,\nor not having parents.\n\n\tMr. McCain: I encourage adoption and I encourage the\nopportunities for people to adopt children I encourage the process being\nless complicated so they can adopt as quickly as possible. And Cindy and\nI are proud of being adoptive parents.\n\n\tQ: But your concern would be that the couple should a\ntraditional couple\n\n\tMr. McCain: Yes.\n\nMcCain not only expressed his opposition to adoption by "gay couples"-as\nif that weren\'t bad enough. He said he wants "both parents" involved and\ntherefore doesn\'t believe in "gay adoption." This approach rules out\nadoption by gay individuals-even though these adoptions are permitted in\nevery state except Florida. In fact, it seems to rule out adoption by\nsingle heterosexuals too.\n\nThere\'s a reason that nearly every child welfare organization in the\ncountry, from the American Academy of Pediatrics\n<http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/109/2/341?ijkey=\na5082159586c809125f91f2d51a76f8fe9e60e20>  to the Child Welfare League\nof America <http://www.cwla.org/programs/culture/glbtqposition.htm>\nopposes bans on adoption by gays and lesbians, and no state\n<http://www.hrc.org/issues/parenting/adoptions/8464.htm>  has followed\nFlorida\'s lead in banning these adoptions. About 130,000 children\n<http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/stats_research/afcars/trends.htm>\nwait in the foster care system each year for a permanent, loving home.\nAnd every year ,half of these children\n<http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/stats_research/afcars/trends.htm>\nare never placed, and 20,000 children\n<http://www.fostercarealumni.org/resources/foster_care_facts_and_statist\nics.htm>  "age out" of the foster care system without ever finding a\npermanent home.\n\nChildren are placed in foster care on a case-by-case basis. Every\npotential parent undergoes extensive screening before a child is placed\nwith them. A ban on certain adoptions eliminates potential parents and\nwastes child welfare agencies\' time and resources implementing it-in\nTexas alone, a ban would cost more than $75 million\n<http://www.aclu.org/images/asset_upload_file480_27496.pdf>  over 5\nyears.\n\nDoes John McCain really think hundreds of thousands of children should\nsit in foster care and orphanages while we wait for "Ozzie and Harriet"\nfamilies to appear? As someone who himself made the admirable decision\nto adopt a child, Senator McCain surely knows better.\n\nhttp://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/2008/07/14/radical-stance-on-gay-adopt\nion/\n\n-----\nAdam Jentleson\nCommunications and Outreach Director\nThe Hyde Park Project, Center for American Progress Action Fund\n202-247-8614\n\n\n--~--~---------~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail ryan@campaigntodefendamerica.org with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
