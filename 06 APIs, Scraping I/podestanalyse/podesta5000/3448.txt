john.podesta@gmail.comb'votevets.org [ http://www.votevets.org/ ] About VoteVets.org [ http://www.votevets.org/about/ ] \n\nDear John,\n\n [ https://secure.ga3.org/03/votevetsads2010 ]Yesterday, I told you that we\'d be releasing one of the strongest ads that we have ever done. Today, I wanted you to see it.  The ad, running in Missouri, features an ill 9/11 first responder, who is also a Navy veteran, taking on Congressman Roy Blunt for his vote against the 9/11 First Responders health bill.\n\n*VIEW OUR POWERFUL AD HERE AND KEEP IT GOING* [ https://secure.ga3.org/03/votevetsads2010 ] \n\nThe veteran in the ad speaks quietly, yet strongly, about how he feels about Blunt\'s vote against helping 9/11 First Responders with their medical expenses, while voting himself a Congressional pay raise eight times. Now forced to breathe with the help of an oxygen tank, the First Responder says that it "makes me sick to my stomach."\n\nWe felt the same way. Blunt had two chances to support that legislation. He voted no the first time. He didn\'t even bother to show up to vote the second time. Sickening, indeed.\n\n*VIEW ALL OF OUR NEW ADS AND HELP US KEEP UP THE WORK* [ https://secure.ga3.org/03/votevetsads2010 ]\n\nBy clicking above, you can view our new ad, as well as the three we released yesterday (if you haven\'t watched those yet). Please consider donating what you can, to help us with our work. Most importantly, please pass this new ad, and all of our new ads, to friends and family. Together, we can get the truth out about who is with our veterans and who is not.\n\nThanks for your support.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJon Soltz\nIraq War Veteran\nChairman, VoteVets.org\n\n\nPaid for by VoteVets.org Action Fund\n_________________________________________\n\n\n\nVoteVets.org \n\n [ http://www.facebook.com/pages/VoteVetsorg/8501031021 ]  [ http://www.twitter.com/votevets ]  [ http://www.youtube.com/votevets ] \n\nYou are subscribed to this list as john.podesta@gmail.com.
