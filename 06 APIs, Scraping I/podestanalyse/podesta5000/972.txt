john.podesta@gmail.comb'Hi everyone!\n\nIt\'s been a very busy, eventful and productive winter for Chelsea and the entire Clinton Foundation. In the last 10 days alone, we held the 8th annual Clinton Global Initiative University<http://www.cgiu.org/> meeting at the University of Miami, launched a social media effort on International Women\'s Day<http://notthere.noceilings.org/> that generated more than 220 million impressions, and released the much anticipated No Ceilings: Full Participation Report<http://noceilings.org/>.\n\nNot only that, Chelsea and her family were thrilled to announce that Donna Shalala will be joining the Clinton Foundation<https://www.clintonfoundation.org/press-releases/donna-shalala-named-president-and-chief-executive-officer-clinton-foundation> as its next President and CEO. Donna will bring more than 30 years of experience in improving communities and changing lives for the better when she arrives at the Clinton Foundation this summer, after she finishes her term as President of the University of Miami.\n\nOn Friday, March 6th, Chelsea arrived in Miami to kickoff CGI U. As many of you know, CGI U is one of Chelsea\'s favorite events every year. She\'s taken on a significant role in the planning and shaping of this incredible meeting, which this year brought 1,100 students from 80 countries (many during their spring break) together to talk about the Commitments to Action they\'ve made that are changing the world. If you ever want to feel like an underachiever, you should talk to a CGI U student. TIME wrote a piece about Chelsea and CGI U you can read here<http://time.com/3736221/chelsea-clinton-global-initiative-hillary/>.\n\nChelsea\'s first event at CGI U was serving as a judge at the second CGI U Codeathon. Chelsea has been a major supporter of the Clinton Foundation\'s Codeathon<https://www.clintonfoundation.org/our-work/clinton-health-matters-initiative/programs/healthy-codeathon-series> series, which began as part of the Clinton Health Matters Initiative<https://www.clintonfoundation.org/our-work/clinton-health-matters-initiative/>. This Codeathon challenged student developers, designers, and technologists to build unique digital prototypes inspired by CGI U Commitments to Action in the following areas: education, public health, and environment & climate change. All the participants were under the age of 25. The winning team created a platform called "MathMagic" which helps students learn and engage with math. Of the platform, Chelsea said, "this kind of just warms my math-loving heart." You can learn more about the Codeathon from the Miami Hurricane<http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2015/03/06/codeathon-participants-create-significant-platforms-for-cgi-u-commitments/>.\n\nFollowing the Codeathon, Chelsea opened CGI U<http://new.livestream.com/CGI/CGIU2015/videos/79311902>, led a panel on the power of big data<http://new.livestream.com/CGI/CGIU2015/videos/79375641>, and then, along with her mom, provided a preview<http://new.livestream.com/CGI/CGIU2015/videos/79433062> of the No Ceilings announcements to come on Sunday and Monday.  During CGI U, Fusion visited with some of CGI U\'s stand out commitment makers and sat down with Chelsea, you can watch both pieces here<http://fusion.net/video/61031/meet-the-students-letting-you-test-for-hiv-with-an-app-and-helping-you-survive-the-apocalypse/> and here<http://fusion.net/video/61582/chelsea-clinton-on-being-a-mom/>.\n\nOn Sunday, March 8th, Chelsea and her mom changed their social media profile pictures in honor of International Women\'s Day and our "Not There" effort, which brought together global icons, brands, and celebrities to make a powerful statement that when it comes to gender equality, we\'re just "Not There."  The effort reached more than 220 million people on twitter. You can read more about it in Refinery 29<http://www.refinery29.com/2015/03/83388/chelsea-clinton-interview-not-there-no-ceilings>, The New York Times<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/business/media/not-there-campaign-removes-women-from-ads-for-international-womens-day.html?_r=0> and Vogue<http://www.vogue.com/12263486/not-there-gender-equality-vogue-covers/>.\n\nAs we hope you saw, a week ago today Chelsea joined her mother and Melinda Gates to launch No Ceilings: The Full Participation Report. Before headed to the event, Chelsea went on Live! with Kelly and Michael<http://livekellyandmichael.dadt.com/features/video-archive/?bcpid=2680593440001&bckey=AQ~~,AAAAABGr2I4~,jeitpkmmkDnTW6JnJVnqQi9M3dulEdKq&bclid=1842962140001&bctid=4101124705001> to talk about "Not There" and the report release.  The more than 20 years of data compiled in the report and on NoCeilings.org  show that more must be done to achieve \'full and equal participation\' of women and girls worldwide, but that progress is possible when families, communities, and nations commit to this goal. Chelsea spoke to The Washington Post<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/03/10/chelsea-clinton-on-why-women-in-the-u-s-shouldnt-mistake-progress-for-success/>, Fortune<http://fortune.com/2015/03/05/chelsea-clinton-men-have-to-lead-the-way-to-global-gender-equality/>, Wired<http://www.wired.com/2015/03/chelsea-clinton-no-ceilings/>, Levo League<https://www.levo.com/videos/chelsea-clinton>, E! News<http://www.eonline.com/news/634284/chelsea-clinton-wants-you-to-support-strong-women-and-here-s-how-watch-now> and a few others about the new report as well.\n\nI know what you\'re thinking. You\'ve read all the way to the bottom, and there\'s still nothing about elephants! Don\'t you worry, we\'ll have more on that in the coming weeks. Until then, check out Chelsea on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on March 23rd, where she will launch the "Serve a Year" campaign, part of our ongoing efforts to bring together the entertainment industry, companies, and non-profits to popularize the concept of young Americans participating in service opportunities.  The Foundation is also continuing its investment in data and analytics to ensure our work is as effective and efficient as possible, stay tuned for more on that as well.\n\nThanks as always, and please, don\'t hesitate to be in touch with questions, ideas, suggestions, or anything else on your mind.\n\nBest,\nKamyl\n\nPrize for the loyal readers who made it all the way down: Instead of an elephant update, how about an Elmo update. Chelsea joined the famous Muppet to help the Clinton Foundation\'s Too Small to Fail initiative and Sesame Street launch a new text-to-parents program in partnership with the free mobile health information service, Text4baby. The program will distribute research-based tips to new parents about the importance of talking, reading and singing with their newborn children. You can watch Chelsea and the one and only Elmo talk about the program together here<http://www.people.com/article/chelsea-clinton-talks-baby-girl-charlotte-elmo>.\n\n\n'
