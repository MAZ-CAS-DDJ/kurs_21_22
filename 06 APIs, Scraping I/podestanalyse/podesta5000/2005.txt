john.podesta@gmail.comb'John:\n\nThank you.\n\nYour support, as we approached our media buy deadline last week, was amazing. Thanks to you, we are continuing to stand up for Democrats and the president against whatever dishonest attacks the GOP launches.\n\nTo everyone who gave, thank you. We wanted to share four of our latest ads with you that your support has helped us launch in some of the most competitive districts across the country.\n\nOne of the first special elections we got involved in after forming House Majority PAC, was the race to fill Gabby Gifford\'s seat. We knew that we had to protect Gabby\'s legacy and elect Ron Barber. We did that, but he\'s the GOP\'s TOP target, which is why we just launched our latest ad to stand with Ron.

Gwen Graham - Former Florida Governor Bob Graham\'s daughter - is in a tight race with Steve Southerland.

That race is one we can\'t afford to lose. Because the GOP nominee is a "self-described" Clinton hater - who wasted millions in witch hunts against Bill and Hillary Clinton. Her being in Washington means another supporter of the Tea Party\'s witch hunts.

But we have to keep our momentum going, John. We need your constant support between now and Election Day to help Democrats WIN.
