john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\n\nI am writing to follow-up on our conversation regarding Inaugural events.  As discussed, I have booked a large number of Progressive major funders at both the Willard and the Sofitel (which are 2 blocks apart) and think it would be great to do a breakfast each morning for them and other major funders who are in town.  The idea would be to make the 3 breakfasts a historic look at 3 Parts of the Presidency.  We have a really great turnout with people like Ann Getty Earhardt, Vincent Mai, Jeanne Levy Church, etc.\n\nWe thought we would do one breakfast on the history of Presidential speechwriting and a look at the Inaugural Address.  Michael Waldman could moderate and he could recruit additional former speech writers to participate in a panel with him.\n\nWe could do one on The Fourth Estate and how it has treated the American Presidency over the years.  I thought maybe David could moderate and get journalists that have covered many Administrations.\n\nI was hoping you might be interested in participating in a panel on the History of the American Presidency and A Look at How Obama Relates to Former Presidents.  Other potential speakers could include, but that would totally be up to you.\n\nJohn Alter\nDoris Kearns Goodwin\nMatt Pinsker\nRichard Reeves\nMichael Beschloss\nDavid Gergen\n\nThese are all just ideas for each of these breakfasts and if you have other suggestions or and if you think there are topics or speakers that would interest these people more -- I am totally open to anything.  I just want these people to really feel taken care of.\n\n\nPlease let me know what you think and if you would be able to participate.  I think it will be fun and interesting for them -- and in no way related to fundraising for a change!\n\nThanks!\n\nMary Pat\n\nAllison Thompson\nAccount Executive\nThe Bonner Group\n202-737-5877 office\n202-341-9333 cell\n\n\n\n'
