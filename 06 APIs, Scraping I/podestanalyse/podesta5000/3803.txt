All countries comprising this unique area had differing interests and international ambitions. The settlements of 1945 and the Cold War shaped the \xe2\x80\x9cAlps-Adriatic\xe2\x80\x9d region and made it a hotspot of the early Cold War. While Italy quickly gained the status of a key strategic partner of the West, Austria was hampered in its policies by quadripartite occupation and an uncertain future. Yugoslavia, starting off as the Soviet Union\xe2\x80\x99s best disciple, was isolated after the Stalin-Tito split in 1948, turning to the West in subsequent years. Thus, while \xe2\x80\x9cfrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an Iron Curtain\xe2\x80\x9d descended across Europe, the three countries dealt with in these two papers were all part of the larger Trieste region.\n\nThe papers presented address questions concerning the positioning of Austria, Italy and Yugoslavia towards conflicts arising during the first decade following World War II. By doing so, it will be possible to determine how much the fields of conflict were interconnected and how this interconnection shaped the fate of the countries involved. Thus, the analysis will show that although the countries involved were not in a position to determine Great Power policies, they had, nevertheless, an important margin of maneuver and played a key role in shaping the fate of Cold War Europe. At the center of analysis and comparison will be not only international, but also transnational factors. This approach will demonstrate the importance of the \xe2\x80\x9cAlps-Adriatic\xe2\x80\x9d region in the context of European and Great Power politics in the early stages of the Cold War.\n\nPresentations:\nKarlo Ruzicic-Kessler: Trieste: An international and transnational approach\nMaximilian Graf: Austria and Trieste: Interconnected histories of the Early Cold War\n\nRSVP NOW \xc2\xbb <http://pages.wilsoncenter.org/20151116Graf_CWIHPEvent.html>\n\nForward to a Friend <http://go.wilsoncenter.org/v/Ubqq00U0DV0MVS00r8000Hy>\n\nEVENT INFORMATION\nMonday, November 16th, 2015\n12:00PM-1:30PM\n4th Floor Conference Room\n\nDIRECTIONS <http://www.wilsoncenter.org/directions>\nWilson Center\nRonald Reagan Building and\nInternational Trade Center\nOne Woodrow Wilson Plaza\n1300 Pennsylvania, Ave., NW\nWashington, D.C. 20004\n\nPhone: 202.691.4000\n\ncoldwar@wilsoncenter.org <mailto:coldwar@wilsoncenter.org>\n\nPrivacy Policy <http://www.wilsoncenter.org/privacy-policy>\n\n<div style="text-align: center">Subscriber: podesta@law.georgetown.edu.
