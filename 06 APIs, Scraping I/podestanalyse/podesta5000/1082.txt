We will begin reporting progress for CGI Latin America next month.  Results reflect activity through April 30th.\r\n\r\nAnnual Meeting\r\n\r\n *   Sponsorship:\r\n    *   Rockefeller Foundation renewed and increased its sponsorship from $350K to $1 million.\r\n    *   NRG renewed its sponsorship at $375K.\r\n    *   Ford Foundation renewed its sponsorship at $400K.\r\n    *   HP has agreed to provide at least $100K cash in sponsorship support (in addition to in-kind technology support).  HP has been a sponsor for many years, but did not provide cash in 2012 due to financial challenges at the company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Membership: The overall positive trend continued during the month, with paid memberships at 294, an increase of 51 over last year at this time.  New memberships are 22 ahead of 2012, while renewals are ahead by 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nCGI America\r\n\r\n *   Sponsorship:  Sponsorship stands at $2.3mm versus a final sponsorship level of $2.1mm for 2012.  We have a few serious prospects still in the pipeline and hope to improve sponsorship further over the next month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Paid Attendance: Total paid attendees stands at 239, versus 140 at this time last year.\r\n\r\n\r\nCGI U\r\n\r\n *   The final sponsorship amount is $1.635 million versus $945k for the event last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nBob\r\n\r\n'
