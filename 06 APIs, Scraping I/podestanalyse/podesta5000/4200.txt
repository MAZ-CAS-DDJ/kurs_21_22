john.podesta@gmail.comb'LAST NIGHT\nBernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton essentially tied in the Iowa Caucuses.\nNew York Times: The Iowa Democratic caucuses were a \'virtual tie\'\nThroughout the campaign, both candidates have taken dead aim at the Citizens United ruling and pledged to stop Big Money Republicans from buying elections:\n\nBernie Sanders\n"The Citizens United case allows the wealthiest people in this country to essentially buy elections and buy candidates [...] I promise you that no nominee of mine to the Supreme Court will be voting to support Citizens United -- they will be voting to overturn Citizens United."\n\n***\n\nHillary Clinton\n"We need a Supreme Court that protects the right of every citizen to vote, not the right of every corporation to buy elections. And I said from the very beginning of my campaign, even if it takes a Constitutional Amendment, we will overturn Citizens United."\n\nWe\'re proud to have the leading Democratic candidates fighting for campaign finance reform.\n\nBUT with the Bernie and Hillary virtually tied -- and the New Hampshire Primary exactly one week away -- we need to hear from you. \n\nPlease take 1 minute to complete our short Presidential Campaign Questionnaire today >>\n\nEND CITIZENS UNITED\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN QUESTIONNAIRE\nJOHN PODESTAPARTICIPANT: #1650293\nREPLY REQUESTED\n\nhttp://act.endcitizensunited.org/Questionnaire\n\nThank you!\n\n-EndCitizensUnited.org\n \n\n\nTAKE THE QUESTIONNAIRE \xe2\x86\x92\nPAID FOR BY END CITIZENS UNITED PAC\n\nhttp://act.endcitizensunited.org/page/s/less-emails\n\n'
