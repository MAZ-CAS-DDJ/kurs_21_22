China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) has been reforming the oversight of clinical trials, has published a series of relevant guidelines, and has established the "drug clinical trial registration and information disclosure platform" to make information more accessible to the public. All these actions have been making the clinical trials conducted in China more consistent with internationally recognized principles.\n\nBiography\nMinjie Gao is a drug inspector from Center for Certification and Evaluation, Shanghai Food and Drug Administration. Ms. Gao is an expert in Chinese laws and regulations about drug registration and drug clinical trials. She works on drug applications review and on-site inspections in Shanghai. She also conducts GCP inspections for CFDA. To promote the efficacy of routine work, she and her colleagues have conducted a series of related studies on, for example, supervision of clinical trials, pharmaceutical pre-approval inspections, and regulatory policies of excipients.
