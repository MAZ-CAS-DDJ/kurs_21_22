john.podesta@gmail.comb'Thanks.  Later in the week is fine; I also responded to Eryn earlier today that I might be able to move my trip one day before or one day afterwards if that helped with scheduling.  Enjoy Beijing!\r\nJose W.

Thanks no doubt to your recommendation I have joined the CAP board of trustees, which I\'m finding extremely rewarding.\r\n\r\nI\'m writing because I\'m planning to be in DC on Thursday April 9th and was hoping to have the chance to meet with you. Would you be free that day for bkfast, lunch or just coffee?---Best, Jose\r\n________________________________\r\n This message may contain confidential and privileged information.
