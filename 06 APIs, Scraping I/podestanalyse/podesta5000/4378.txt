You'll see a riff here on the debate and Planned Parenthood for\n> HRC to use in her town hall in Concord:\n>\n>\n>    - How many of you watched the debate last night?  Eleven candidates in\n>    a race to the bottom, especially on women\xe2\x80\x99s health and women\xe2\x80\x99s rights. The\n>    fact-checkers are already having a field day.  But the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99\n>    comments aren\xe2\x80\x99t just factually inaccurate, they\xe2\x80\x99re deeply out of touch and\n>    out of date.\n>    - They want to defund Planned Parenthood so badly that they\xe2\x80\x99re going\n>    to try to shut down the entire federal government, no matter the\n>    consequences for our country.  We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a women\xe2\x80\x99s health service\n>    that provides half-a-million breast cancer exams every year.\n>    - Here in New Hampshire, you know all about this.  Last month, your\n>    Executive Council cut off funding to Planned Parenthood in this state.  Let\n>    me rephrase that:  three men on the Executive Council voted to deny women\n>    across New Hampshire the healthcare they need and deserve.\n>    - I\xe2\x80\x99d like them to meet the mom who caught her breast cancer early\n>    thanks to a screening\xe2\x80\xa6 or the teenager who avoided an unintended pregnancy\n>    because she had access to birth control\xe2\x80\xa6 or the survivor of sexual assault\n>    who turned to Planned Parenthood for emergency contraception, STD testing,\n>    and support.\n>    - These attacks are just wrong.  And it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to work.  Carly\n>    Fiorina was way off the mark on a lot of issues last night, but she did say\n>    one thing that was absolutely correct: Women all over this country hear\n>    very clearly what Republicans are saying.  We\xe2\x80\x99re listening and we\xe2\x80\x99re not\n>    going to forget.\n>\n>\n>\n>\n"
