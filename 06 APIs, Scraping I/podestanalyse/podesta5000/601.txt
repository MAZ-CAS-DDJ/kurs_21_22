I\'ve gotten to know Daniel Lubetzky over the last few years . My firm invested in his " not for profit only " business Kind Healthy Snacks . The company , headquartered in NYC , is phenomenally successful and Daniel is quite a phenom himself . Outside his business he has devoted a big portion of his life to bringing about a peaceful two state solution in the Mid East .\n\nDaniel was born in Mexico , his Dad was a holocaust survivor . He started and funded PeaceWorks Foundation and it\'s flagship OneVoice Movement to help moderate Israelis and Arabs seize back the agenda for conflict resolution away from violent extremist . His advisory board members include Stu Eizenstat , Martin Indyk , Dennis  Ross and other friends of ours . He ask me who was the most EFFECTIVE LEADER I knew in Washington . I said " In or out of office , hands down it is John Podesta ". He\'d like to meet you some time . I think you\'d find it most worthwhile and interesting to boot . No hurry , you\'ve got lots on your plate . But when you have time , I recommend you spend a small amount of it with Daniel .\n\n  Best to you old friend .   Erskine\n\n\n\n\n'
