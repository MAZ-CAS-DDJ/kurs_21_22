Second, it must also strengthen\nour national security. We should be willing to walk away from any outcome\nthat falls short of these tests.  The goal is greater prosperity and\nsecurity for American families, not trade for trade\xe2\x80\x99s sake. She will be\nwatching closely to see what is being done to crack down on currency\nmanipulation, improve labor rights, protect the environment and health,\npromote transparency, and open new opportunities for our small businesses\nto export overseas.  As she warned in her book, Hard Choices, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nbe giving special rights to corporations at the expense of workers and\nconsumers."\n\n\n-- \nMilia Fisher\nSpecial Assistant to the Chairman\nHillary for America\nmfisher@hillaryclinton.com\nc: 858.395.1741\n'
