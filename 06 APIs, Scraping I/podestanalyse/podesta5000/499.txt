john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\n\nGreat to see you last night. Enjoyed your talk. I loved your comment "Politics is about friction; it\'s more about where you disagree than where you agree." I agree with this insight. To me, I might add, politics is about friction and about the way you react to friction.\n\nJohn, please let me know how I can be helpful to you as you pursue the many things that you are involved in.\n\nHope to see you again soon.\n\nMark\n\nMark T.
