We will make the movie available beginning on Christmas Day to all of our Xbox Video users.\n\n\n\nWe are of course more than mindful of the security implications of this decision, especially at a time when we\'re seeing already seeing increased cyber-attack attempts on our services.  But as I\'ve thought about the issue, I\'ve concluded that one of our core principles is at stake and we should be bold in supporting the right of American citizens to exercise their Constitutional rights.  This is consistent with Microsoft\'s core purpose, business, and values.  I\'ve therefore directed our teams both to make the film available and I\'ve asked a number of our employees to spend some of their holiday time getting on high alert with respect to our operational security.  As I\'ve said in an email to them, "It\'s time for all of us to rise to the occasion knowing that we as a company stand for core values and principles that are worth protecting."\n\n\n\nWe\'ll announce with Sony tomorrow the availability of "The Interview" on Xbox Video.  This service has a very broad reach.  It\'s available to over 25 million Xbox users in the United States, which is larger than any cable television network in the country.  In addition, it will be available through the Xbox Video app on tens of millions of PCs, tablets, and smartphones that run Windows 8 or higher.  (We\'ll have a final estimate of the total audience reach by tomorrow morning when the announcement is made.)\n\n\n\nOn behalf of all of our employees and customers, I want to convey our personal appreciation to the President for his leadership on this issue.  He has inspired us to take action, and I know that we\'ll need his continued leadership and support as this issue continues to evolve.\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\nSatya\n'
