john.podesta@gmail.comb'::: ProgressNow - Advancing Progressive Agendas, State by State ::: \n\n\n\nDear Friends and Colleagues,\n\nBelow is a great example of how our Wisconsin affiliate is working to\nkeep voters informed, even if it is the somewhat disheartening topic\nof student loan debt. By not only providing information but also\nmethods to become involved, we hope to spur engagement among young\nvoters. This is just 1 of our 21 states doing what we do every day\n- make progress happen, and happen NOW.\n\nAs always, let me know what you think, or even better, contribute to\nus here.\n\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=L6qowpjB4KQ7XWxts-hP5A\n\nBest,\nDenise Cardinal\nExecutive Director\nProgressNow\nProgressNow Education\n\nOne Wisconsin Now Congratulates Graduates With Information on Student\nLoan Debt\n\nWith college graduations starting this week, One Wisconsin Now wants\nto be sure that students are aware of the realities they face, and the\neffect their student loans have on the economy. The Congressional\nBudget Office is now projecting the government will make a $51 billion\nprofit from student loans in fiscal year 2013, roughly $6 billion more\nthan Exxon-Mobil, the most profitable corporation in the U.S. in 2012,\naccording to a report in\xa0the Huffington Post. One Wisconsin Now\nExecutive Director Scot Ross commented, "It is obscene that our\ngovernment is projected to make more off the loans students have taken\nout to pursue their higher education, than the most profitable\ncorporation in the country made in net profits last year."\n\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=WgoEslb2ZsXxfECLGnO3hg\n\nOriginal research by the One Wisconsin Institute (the ProgressNow\nEducation affiliate in WI) found that the impact of the\ntrillion-dollar student loan debt crisis goes far beyond students and\ntheir families. Graduates with a Bachelors degree report making\naverage monthly payments of $350 for an average term of 18.7 years.\nThe economy-wide detrimental impacts of this debt include over $200\nmillion in lost new auto sales every year and significantly lower\nrates of home purchasing and ownership among graduates earning solid\nmiddle class incomes but are saddled with student loan debt. Wisconsin\nRepresentative Mark Pocan, speaking for the Progressive Caucus,\nacknowledged the Institute\'s research on the House floor (see\n10:10) this past Wednesday May 22. To learn more about this research,\nyou can watch Executive Director Scot Ross on MSNBC.\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=liQM20JZ1M7rgEDR0AYYSg\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=6jLcgGMIT8LAKEc315cT4A\n\nhttp://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=rdkPX4Q2nvPtoH9uEIvyYg\n\nHowever, the One Wisconsin Institute is not just sitting on the\nsidelines. Instead, the Institute has begun a six-year strategic plan\nin conjunction with the ProgressNow network to raise awareness of the\ndire economic impact of the trillion-dollar student loan debt crisis\nand to encourage policy solutions at both the state and federal level.\nThis includes implementing research and communication campaigns, with\nthe hope of not only informing the public but also encouraging voter\nturnout and engagement among younger voters in 2014 and 2016\nelections.\n\n\n\n:::\n\nCopyright 2012 ProgressNow\n\nChange your e-mail preferences or unsubscribe: http://www.pnstate.org/site/CO?i=l6OyHTOu1xS6HqZdCK1yaVlmtpdJC4J2&cid=0\n\n'
