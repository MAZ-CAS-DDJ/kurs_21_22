john.podesta@gmail.comb'Senator Charles Schumer, Catsimatidis April 7, 2015\n\nApril 7, 2015\n\nJohn\n\nI am sure you know by now, Senate Leader Harry Reid is retiring and\nhas recommended our own Senator Charles Schumer to replace him.\n\nI have know the Senator for over 30 years and he has always been a\ncommon sense person.  I believe this will be good for the Country and\ncertainly great for New York.\n\nSo I hope you will respond to this soon.  The apartment is filling up\nespecially since the announcement.  I also hope you will consider\neither writing or raising the larger contributions of $2700 or $5400.\n\n-\n33tmwred@gmail.com?subject=Senator%20Charles%20Schumer%20at%20Catsimatidis%2C%20April%207%2C%202015&body=Yes%2C%20I%20will%20attend%20the%20reception%20at%20John%20and%20Margo%20Catsimatidis RSVP April 7, 2015 Schumer\n\nHope you will join us and look forward to seeing you.\n\nJohn Catsimatidis\njacny@aol.com\n\nUnited States Senator\n\nCharles Schumer\nTuesday April 7, 2015\n5:30PM - 7:00PM\nat the home of\nJohn and Margo Catsimatidis\n63rd and 5th Ave.\nManhattan\n\nSuggested levels of contributions:\nChecks and credit cards are made payable to\nFriends of Schumer\n$1000, $2,700 or the maximum $5,400\n\n-\n33tmwred@gmail.com?subject=Senator%20Charles%20Schumer%20at%20Catsimatidis%2C%20April%207%2C%202015&body=Yes%2C%20I%20will%20attend%20the%20reception%20at%20John%20and%20Margo%20Catsimatidis RSVP April 7, 2015 Schumer\n\nContact\n212-956-5803\ncontact:  Matt Wanning\n33tmwred@gmail.com\n\nFriends of Schumer\n192 Lexington ave\nsuite 1001\nNew York  NY  10016\nForward this message to a friend -\nhttp://oi.vresp.com/f2af/v4/send_to_friend.html?ch=033aabe079&lid=572783623&ldh=b809c5b342    Contributions or gifts to Friends of Schumer are not tax\ndeductible.
