Michele Bachmann\n(MN-6), Steve Chabot (OH-1), Tom Feeney (FL-24), John "Randy" Kuhl\n(NY-29) for voting against meaningful legislation to establish and fund\na 21st century G.I. Bill that ensures our fighting men and women\nreturning home from Iraq and Afghanistan no longer have to worry about\npaying for a quality college education.  The spot entitled \'Lip Service\'\nwill air over the Memorial week recess on a mix of cable and broadcast\ntelevision targeting Kuhl in Buffalo, Rochester, and Elmira, NY; Chabot\nin Cincinnati, OH; Bachmann in Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN; and Feeney in\nOrlando. The goal of the Bush Legacy Project\n<http://www.presidentbushlegacy.com/bushlegacy>  is to cement into\nhistory how two terms of failed conservative policies - supported by\nBush and his allies in Congress including Sen. John McCain - have\nweakened America\'s security abroad while neglecting and undermining\nimportant priorities here at home. *See sample script below.  \n\n \n\nWith no help from these Bush clones in Congress, the U.S. House recently\npassed an amendment <http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll330.xml>  to an\nIraq/Afghanistan/Domestic priories supplemental appropriations bill that\nrestores full, four-year college scholarships and makes the veterans of\nIraq and Afghanistan part of an American economic recovery, just like\nthe veterans of World War II were. The U.S. Senate followed suit today\noverwhelmingly passing similar legislation by a 75-22 margin\n<http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cf\nm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00137> , despite President Bush\'s\nrepeated veto threats\n<http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-now-webbgi.m22,0,5797943.story> .\n\n \n\n            "For all the lip service these Representative pay back home\nto the sacrifices our troops are making overseas in Iraq and\nAfghanistan, they sure have a funny way of showing their support in\nWashington," said Jeremy Funk, spokesman for Americans United for\nChange. "They stood with President Bush and opposed a 21st century G.I.\nBill that reflects the needs of a struggling economy and skyrocketing\ntuition costs.  That these Members can vigorously support spending of\n$12 billion a month to continue this President\'s failed Iraq war\npolicies but not a fraction that amount on these brave soldiers\'\neducation when they return home signals just how radically skewed their\npriorities really are. In fact, the first two years of the new GI bill\nwould cost what we spend in just two days in Iraq.  For all these Bush\napologists\' rhetoric about supporting the troops, when faced with a\nsimple choice of voting for \'em or against \'em -- they vote against\n\'em." \n\n"The original GI Bill launched millions of families on a course to\nachieving the American dream - and set the American economy on the right\ncourse after a draining war.  It returned $7 to the economy for every $1\nspent on it," added Funk.  "Current GI educational benefits pay only\nabout 60 percent of a public college education and 30 percent of a\nprivate college education.  That\'s simply not enough, especially in an\neconomy slipping further and further towards a full scale recession.\nEnsuring that these men and women returning from Iraq and Afghanistan\ndon\'t have to worry about how they\'re going to afford a quality\neducation is the very least we can do to truly show our appreciation and\nsupport.  But, for whatever reason, these Representatives just said \'no.\nIt\'s a real question of priorities, and theirs are all mixed up.\'" \n\n\n-30-\n\n \n\n"Lip Service" - Bachmann\n\nAd Back-Up\n\nAmericans United For Change\n\nTV (:30)\n\n \n\n\nSCRIPT\n\n\nFACTS\n\nANNCR:  "When they came home, America gave them more than a parade." \n\n \n\n"We gave them opportunity, a chance to go to college.
