The\nnext step in the agency review process is the 20 pager.  I think it\nwould be helpful if you have time early next week to go over with me and\nSally what would be most helpful to you and John to have addressed in\nthe 20 pager on WHO - let me know what works for you.  Thanks C\n\n________________________________\n\n\n"EMF <HHLAW.COM>" made the following annotations.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------\nThis electronic message transmission contains information from this law\nfirm which may be confidential or privileged.
