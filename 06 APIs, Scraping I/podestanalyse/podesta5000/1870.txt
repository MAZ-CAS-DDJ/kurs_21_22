john.podesta@gmail.comb'I\'m there. A little resistance from some of my colleagues, but I think\nthat\'s where we are headed.\n\nOn Friday, January 22, 2016, Terry Shumaker <tshumaker@bernsteinshur.com>\nwrote:\n\n> *CONFIDENTIAL*\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> http://www.unionleader.com/Push-on-for-Democrats-to-debate-in-NH-before-Primary\n>\n>\n>\n> Hi John:\n>\n>\n>\n> It appears from the above piece in today\'s Union Leader that the calls for\n> a debate here between IA and NH Primary are on the rise. Former Congwoman\n> Shea-Porter, a supporter, has endorsed the idea. I believe HRC should\n> embrace this idea quickly so that Sanders does not get all the credit.\n> Today here would be a great time for her to announce her support for the\n> idea.  My reasons for this include:\n>\n>\n>\n> * NH has had a Democratic debate after Iowa for over 3 decades; people are\n> used to this, and we don\'t want to be blamed for it not happening or\n> perceived as being dragged to it by not deciding quickly; sometimes\n> presidents need to act decisively (actions at a debate probably won Reagan\n> the White House)\n>\n> *The DNC debate calendar with ours the Sat. before Christmas was very\n> unpopular here\n>\n> * We need to shake up the race here and this would help do it\n>\n> * Hillary does really well in debates as she did before NH in 2008\n>\n> * We need Sanders\' legislative record, half baked proposals and lack of\n> foreign policy knowledge exposed, and a debate is probably the best way to\n> do it before NH votes\n>\n> * Would help shake the "establishment" image if HRC were to buck the DNC\n> establishment and side with the voters of NH against Washington\n>\n> * Are DWS and the DNC (on which I served) really going to bar all 3\n> candidates from the two remaining debates if they all participate here? I\n> think not. And if they do, other debates will spring up. Seems the\n> candidates are really in charge.\n>\n>\n>\n> Thanks for your time and ear on Wed.-- and for reading this.  My cell is\n> 603-496-9919 if you have any questions.\n>\n> Best regards,  Terry\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> ____________________________\n>\n> Amb.
