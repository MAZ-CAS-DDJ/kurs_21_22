john.podesta@gmail.comb'Looks good. One change I wouldn\'t use sustainable financing. Could be\nmisinterpreted.  I\'d use financing for sustainable development in the two\npositive references and maybe decreasing financing for projects that add\nconsiderable climate risk in the negative reference\nWhat do others think?\nOn Jun 22, 2015 1:36 PM, "Melanie Hart" <mhart@americanprogress.org> wrote:\n\n>  Hello John,\n>\n>\n>\n> Below is the refined question you just conveyed via phone:\n>\n>\n>\n> *****\n>\n> As you know, 2015 presents an historic opportunity for the international\n> community to reach ambitious new agreements on the intertwined  global\n> challenges of climate change and sustainable development.
