She\xe2\x80\x99s been twice this fall, she looks at ease in the state \xe2\x80\x94\nand despite the theories, Iowa Democrats are onboard.\n\n\n\nDAVENPORT, Iowa \xe2\x80\x94 She recalled campaign visits to the Teamsters hall, and\nremembered \xe2\x80\x9cbarbeque and blues festivities\xe2\x80\x9d at the River Music Experience.\nShe stressed what a \xe2\x80\x9cgreat personal pleasure\xe2\x80\x9d it was to be back in Cedar\nRapids, and how impressed she\xe2\x80\x99s always been \xe2\x80\x9cby the history and beauty\xe2\x80\x9d of\nDavenport. And she told a crowd at the first of two rallies in Iowa on\nWednesday afternoon just how hard it\xe2\x80\x99d been to watch severe flooding here\nscourge the cities and towns she\xe2\x80\x99d spent months getting to know during her\npresidential campaign six years ago.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton paused on the solemn note at a Cedar Rapids labor hall.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI watched with such distress,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99ve been somewhere and\nyou envision the places you\xe2\x80\x99ve visited, it\xe2\x80\x99s heartbreaking to watch the\ndestruction.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t look like Clinton had an \xe2\x80\x9cIowa problem\xe2\x80\x9d here on Wednesday. And\nstate Democrats don\xe2\x80\x99t seem think there is one, either.\n\n\n\nThe former presidential candidate knows the place pretty well for someone\nwho, as local Democrats have said in the past, could never quite gel the\nway she needed to with the state that historically gets to go first in the\nnominating process. Since that crippling third-place finish in the caucuses\nbehind Barack Obama and John Edwards, then both senators, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s\nmissteps in Iowa have been retraced again and again.\n\n\n\nThere was a perception that Clinton couldn\xe2\x80\x99t connect in 2008. She worked\nrope lines more than she talked one-on-one with voters. Her events were\ntightly controlled. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t take questions. And hanging over her\ncampaign was an unhelpful internal memo, leaked to the press months before\ncaucus night, advising she forgo Iowa altogether.\n\n\n\nIn the past year, the theory has persisted: State Democrats are wary or\ndisinterested about the prospect of another go-round with Clinton; they\nwant to weigh their options, find a challenger, or at least see her work\nharder for it than in 2008.\n\n\n\nBut Clinton has returned twice to the state in as many months this fall \xe2\x80\x94\nfirst for Sen. Tom Harkin\xe2\x80\x99s annual Steak Fry fundraiser, and again on\nWednesday to headline twin rallies for Rep. Bruce Braley, the Democrat in a\ntoss-up race for U.S. Senate.\n\n\n\nState leaders said in interviews this week that Clinton has easily\nreestablished a connection here and fostered fresh goodwill, particularly\nin her efforts to help Braley. And at her events on Wednesday, Clinton\nshowed she could play to the crowds, making references to local political\nestablishments in her speeches, calling out individual Braley volunteers by\nname to thank them, making time for an unannounced stop at a restaurant in\nIowa City, and joking about that special kind of devotion to presidential\npolitics for which the early-voting state is known.\n\n\n\nHer problems here were always overstated, said Teresa Vilmain, the 2008\ncampaign\xe2\x80\x99s state director. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who focuses on that story line is having\na slow news day,\xe2\x80\x9d Vilmain said. \xe2\x80\x9cIowans are still excited to see her and\nhear from her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nA poll this month found 76% of likely Democratic caucus goers view Clinton\nfavorably.\n\n\n\nJanet Petersen, an Iowa state senator who supported Obama in the primary,\nsaid Clinton has \xe2\x80\x9cbuilt up a lot of goodwill\xe2\x80\x9d by campaigning for Braley.\nShe discounted the idea that Clinton has any outsize hurdles to overcome in\nthe state.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s always interesting to see what the national media is covering with\nthe caucuses. It\xe2\x80\x99s generally not what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing on the ground,\xe2\x80\x9d Peterson\nsaid.\n\n\n\nClinton\xe2\x80\x99s first event of the day was a Cedar Rapids rally with Braley \xe2\x80\x94 who\nis close to tied in polls with his Republican opponent, state Sen. Joni\nErnst \xe2\x80\x94 at the local 405 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical\nWorkers. The brown and beige-colored union hall where Clinton spoke to a\ncrowd of about 400, as estimated by the Braley campaign, is also\nheadquarters to the Hawkeye Labor Council, a coalition of 45 unions in\nseven counties. Clinton made a point to mention that. (Ahead of 2008, the\npresident of that council, Justin Shields, co-chaired her state campaign.)\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some teamsters here today,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said looking out at\nthe audience.\n\n\n\nAfter the rally, Clinton rolled out of the union hall parking lot in a\nblack van amid a string of seven other cars, and headed for Iowa City.\nThere, she made a off-schedule stop with Braley at the Hamburg Inn\nrestaurant. Clinton ordered a chocolate bourbon pecan pie milkshake, or pie\nshake, and sat down at a table just below a framed photo of Harkin. (Her\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s picture was hanging not too far away.) A group of young women one\nspot over struck up conversation. Clinton talked about her new\ngranddaughter, and whether she\xe2\x80\x99d watch the seventh game of the World Series.\n\n\n\nThe ordeal didn\xe2\x80\x99t last long. (Clinton has made similar drop-ins during\ntrips to rallies in Colorado and Illinois this month.) But the brief stop\namounted to rare time with voters, not spent from the lectern or a hurried,\nhectic ropeline. And to longtime political observers in Iowa, it signaled a\nchange in Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s approach.\n\n\n\nJohn Deeth, an Iowa political blogger, used to feature a count on his\nhomepage of the number of days Clinton had spent away from Iowa. The final\ntally: 2,446.\n\n\n\nWhen he saw news of the Hamburg Inn stop, he tweeted a picture of a beret\non a plate, set with silverware as if for a meal. \xe2\x80\x9cTonight I\xe2\x80\x99ll be dining\non this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\nDeeth was not able to cover Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s visit, though he has long argued that\nher campaign was far too scripted. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, after six years of loudly\ndemanding that Hillary do exactly this, I\xe2\x80\x99m stuck at the office when it\nhappens,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote on his blog.\n\n\n\nAt her rally in Davenport, Clinton kept up the personal touch, calling out\ntwo volunteers from the Braley campaign to thank them by name. \xe2\x80\x9cIs Bobby\nDodd here? Where is Bobby Dodd? Oh, Bobby. Bobby is 91 years old and\nvolunteering,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about Judy? Judy Moss? Is she here?\nJudy? Thank you, Judy!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton seemed to suggest she\xe2\x80\x99d be ready for the Iowa test next time\naround. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know any place in America that takes politics more\nseriously. You take politics seriously because you take public service\nseriously.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you like to test your candidates, don\xe2\x80\x99t ya?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. The crowd\nlaughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wanna force them to be the best they can be. I have\nexperienced that myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you wanna know if somebody is here asking you for your votes \xe2\x80\x94 they\nhave to answer some tough questions. About what they would do if you gave\nthem your vote. Not in Iowa do people get away with not answering\nquestions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept\xe2\x80\xa6 questions that are far in the future,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said with a grin\nand a quick glance at Braley. It was the only reference that day to her\npossible campaign.\n\n\n\nThis month, in trips to about a dozen states to campaign for Democratic\ncandidates running in the midterm races, Clinton has kept the focus off\nherself. She has tamped down the coy references to her potential\npresidential run, which came up frequently in interviews during a publicity\ntour to promote her memoir this summer.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s made it very clear that she\xe2\x80\x99s stumping for other people right now,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Liz Mathis, a state senator who was a caucus leader for Clinton.\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s been very careful to step back and let other people shine. She uses\nher clout in the right way.\xe2\x80\x9d Once Clinton \xe2\x80\x9creestablishes herself as \xe2\x80\x98the\ncandidate,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Mathis said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll see full commitment, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that\nrelationship come together with Iowans.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPeople in Iowa politics haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten the difficulties Clinton had in\nthe state. This summer, a state newspaper wrote a pointed second-person\neditorial, warning Clinton to show Iowans she wanted it, \xe2\x80\x9csooner rather\nthan later this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nAnd officials with the pro-Clinton group, Ready for Hillary, first landed\nin Iowa in January to commit early to the state and gather a list local\nsupporters who would back a campaign. (They have not made the length of\nthat list public.)\n\n\n\nJerry Crawford, a mainstay in Iowa politics who supported Clinton in 2008\nand has advised Ready for Hillary, said that voters in the state do enjoy a\ncontested race.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the one hand, no candidate in the Iowa caucuses has ever approached\nthem with as much organized support as Ready for Hillary has created for\nClinton,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the other hand, caucuses are by nature contentious\nand contrarian events that appeal most to the philosophical edges in each\nparty. That is how Rick Santorum won Iowa.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nClinton won\xe2\x80\x99t have a coronation in Iowa. But any challenger will \xe2\x80\x9chave\ntrouble beating her,\xe2\x80\x9d Crawford said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is beloved by mainstream party\nregulars.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nPetersen, the state senator, said that eventually Iowans will want more\ndirect contact with Clinton. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re used to getting that chance,\xe2\x80\x9d\nPeterson said. \xe2\x80\x9cWith Ready for Hillary, they don\xe2\x80\x99t speak on behalf of the\ncandidate. That\xe2\x80\x99s not who Iowans want to engage with. They want to get to\nknow the candidate and hear her vision.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she\xe2\x80\x99s showing us that she\xe2\x80\x99s going to be back,\xe2\x80\x9d Petersen said.\n'
