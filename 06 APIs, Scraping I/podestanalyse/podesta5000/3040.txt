That's been our practice for quite some time to ensure that we not out of line with HRC.\nWe are also always in touch with the NSC/WH/State where appropriate.\nAdditionally, Huma gets our block and as some of you know (and participate in) participates in a weekly call with me, Maura and Bari.\nLet me know, however, if these processes don't work or if you have any questions re: WJC.\nThanks\n\n"
