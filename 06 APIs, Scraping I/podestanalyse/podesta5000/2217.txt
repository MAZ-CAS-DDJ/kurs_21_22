Our speaker will be Professor Charles Mooney, Jr. from Penn.  He will be presenting about a proposed sovereign debt restructuring mechanism (\xef\xbf\xbdA No-Tribunal SDRM\xef\xbf\xbd).  Professor Mooney\xef\xbf\xbds paper is attached, as is a background paper he\xef\xbf\xbds written on the topic (\xef\xbf\xbdMooney KISS for GULC\xef\xbf\xbd).  Hard copies of A No-Tribunal SDRM should be available with faculty assistants (I understand distribution was delayed for Hotung).  I look forward to seeing you at the workshop tomorrow.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nAdam\r\n\r\n\r\n'
