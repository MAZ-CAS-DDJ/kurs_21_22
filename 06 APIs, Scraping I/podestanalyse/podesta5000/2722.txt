I think our basic posture is right. We think the Iraqis and the Administration should get this done. We have one President at a time and we don\'t propose to get into the middle of the negotations. . If we get briefed now and we don\'t like it, what do we propose to do -- tell Hadley we can\'t support it? I think they should do the deed and hopefully its something we can support.\n\nThe alternative puts us in a position we\'re they\'re using our clout without having any influence on the conduct of the negotation.\n\nFrom: Denis McDonough\nSent: Tuesday, November 11, 2008 11:39 AM\nTo: Jim Steinberg; Mark Lippert; Susan Rice\nSubject: FW: US-Iraq SOFA\n\nTeam -\n\nPlease don\'t forward.\n\nI think we should send a team over to the NSC today to get this brief.\n\nI want to be responsive here, but before we can take any proactive steps we need to see the agreement as it stands now.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nDenis.\n\nFrom: Lute, Douglas E.

Let us know how we can help, in particular if you or your team would like us to take you through the details of the SOFA so you can be comfortable enough to support the agreement.\nThanks.\nDoug\n\nDouglas E.

The U.S. negotiators have provided the Iraqis with a text we consider final, accompanied by a letter from President Bush urging the Prime Minister to lobby Iraqi officials to approve the document and send it to the Council of Representatives for approval.  Intensive lobbying by Ambassador Crocker and our negotiators is currently taking place in Baghdad.\n\nWe believe we have negotiated an agreement that provides President-Elect Obama the authorities and protections he needs to exercise the full perogatives as Commander in Chief.  We would like to offer, at your earliest convenience, a full briefing to the transition team staff on the details of the SOFA.  Ambassador Crocker and General Odierno would appreciate the opportunity to brief you personally, via SVTC, at a time that\'s amenable.  Representatives from both Mr. Obama\'s  and Mr. Biden\'s Senate offices are scheduled to receive a briefing on the text on Wednesday the 12th, and the text has and will continue to be available to those named staff in the Senate\'s secure facility.\n\nThe Iraqis are keenly interested in understanding President-Elect Obama\'s position on the SOFA.  Indeed, a number of senior Iraqi officials - including a number of Prime Minister\'s most senior advisors -- are claiming that Mr. Obama will not support a SOFA signed by President Bush and interpreting the few messages publicly available as a pretext to reject the agreement on the table.  After the transition team has had time to review the SOFA text, we ask that the Obama team express support for the SOFA, lest the Iraqis use previous positions or the absence of comment to scuttle the deal.\n\nBy way of suggestion, we offer the following as possible reassurance to the Iraqis, perhaps in letters to Talibani and Maliki:\n\n"We believe that any Status of Forces Agreement, or Strategic Framework Agreement, should  include commitments  by the U.S. to begin withdrawing its troops and to foreswear permanent bases.  Any such agreements must provide strong protections and authorities for our troops.  We will respect the agreement as negotiated and not insist it be ratified by the US Congress.  We hope it can be concluded as soon as possible. "\n'
