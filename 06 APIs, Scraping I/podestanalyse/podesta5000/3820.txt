Hunt\n\nDecember 12, 2014, 11:05 a.m. EST\n\n \n\nSenator Tim Kaine is staying with his embrace of Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, even though his fellow Virginia Democrat Jim Webb looks like he will run too.\n\n \n\n"I am going to stick with Hillary," Kaine, also a former governor of Virginia, said in an interview for Friday\'s "Charlie Rose" PBS program. He said he believes the former secretary of state is "the best qualified person to be a great president."\n\n \n\nMany Democratic politicians are jumping on the Hillary bandwagon, but Kaine is a particularly interesting example for two reasons. One, he was an important supporter of Barack Obama in 2008 when the Illinois senator defeated Clinton for the nomination. He was on the final short-list of possible Obama running mates that summer. Second, Webb was Kaine\'s predecessor in the Senate; Kaine won the seat in 2012 when Webb retired.\n\n \n\nLast month, Webb launched an exploratory committee to consider running for the Democratic presidential nomination. Clinton, if she runs, would be a prohibitive favorite to get the nod, though some Democrats, including a few Clintonites, believe Webb could score political points against her. Webb is an economic populist, critical of Wall Street; she has close Wall Street ties. Webb also is a decorated Marine combat officer who is much more skeptical than Clinton about foreign interventions.\n\n \n\nKaine was optimistic that Ms. Clinton would run: "I don\'t have any inside intelligence, but my intuition says yes."\n\n \n\nThe full interview can be seen tonighton PBS and will later be rebroadcast on Bloomberg Television.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWall Street Journal: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Messaging Has Familiar Ring to It\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\nBy Peter Nicholas\n\nDecember 12, 2014, 6:52 p.m. EST\n\n \n\n[Subtitle:] Similar Language From Past Campaigns Shows Challenge in Posing Fresh Ideas\n\n \n\nSounding a theme that seemed suited to a presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton said the \xe2\x80\x9cbasic bargain\xe2\x80\x9d of America is that people who \xe2\x80\x9cwork hard and play by the rules\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 get the chance to build a good life.\n\n \n\nAt another event, she railed against policies that give \xe2\x80\x9ctax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas.\xe2\x80\x9d In one appearance, she trumpeted data-driven, \xe2\x80\x9cevidence-based decision-making\xe2\x80\x9d in government.\n\n \n\nMrs. Clinton is giving hints of the themes and agenda that would animate her campaign if she were to run for president, offering the barest sketch of what could evolve into her basic stump speech. Yet, the ideas are, in a sense, frozen in time. Mrs. Clinton has offered the same thoughts\xe2\x80\x94in virtually identical language\xe2\x80\x94at earlier stages of her political career.\n\n \n\nShe talked about the \xe2\x80\x9cbasic bargain\xe2\x80\x9d in 2007, using nearly the same wording in the Web video announcing she was running for president. Her husband, Bill Clinton, used the formulation years earlier.\n\n \n\nMrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s call for \xe2\x80\x9cevidence-based decision-making\xe2\x80\x9d dates at least to 2006. And ending tax breaks for so-called offshoring dates to Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 campaign but also to 1992, when Mr. Clinton included it in his own campaign manifesto.\n\n \n\nThe familiar language underscores a central challenge that Mrs. Clinton would face as a candidate: How does someone who has been a household name for nearly a quarter-century, as a first lady, senator and secretary of state, inspire voters with fresh ideas.\n\n \n\nClinton loyalists say her near-universal name recognition cuts both ways. It is one reason she has vaulted to the top of every poll of Democratic voters. But that familiarity could be a handicap, they say, if people see her as a throwback to another era.\n\n \n\nMrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s office declined to comment.\n\n \n\nThe 67-year-old isn\xe2\x80\x99t a candidate yet and has ample time to refine a message\xe2\x80\x94and she may yet decide that the ideas she has long championed are right once again for the moment. But some Democratic strategists are saying Mrs. Clinton must spell out a more concrete case for why she wants the presidency and where she would lead the country.\n\n \n\nDavid Axelrod, who helped design the strategy that led Barack Obama to victory over Mrs. Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primaries, said recently that her \xe2\x80\x9ccandidacy is out in front of the rationale for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\nRepublicans have also tended to run on familiar themes, most prominently calls for limited government. But many potential GOP candidates have begun laying out policy specifics, or they are officeholders with recent records to run on. Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, has been largely absent from the political realm for six years, which draws additional attention to her language in her few forays into public policy.\n\n \n\nIn recent speeches, Mrs. Clinton has brought a new element to her thoughts on policy: her status as a grandmother. Even if babies aren\xe2\x80\x99t grandchildren of former senators and presidents, they should have the same educational opportunities and prospects as 3-month-old Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, she says. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt that grandmothers are often objects of affection.\n\n \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always said that Hillary Clinton would be elected president if she becomes a grandmother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe Andrew, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re both wise and warm. The challenge Hillary Clinton always had was not being personally accessible, not being as warm as people would like her to be. Being a grandmother helps\xe2\x80\x9d overcome that perception, he said.\n\n \n\nBut at this stage, some of Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s speeches seem to borrow from past addresses.\n\n \n\nIn a radio address he gave in 2000, then-President Clinton used the \xe2\x80\x9cbasic bargain\xe2\x80\x9d idea that Mrs. Clinton repeated many years later, at the steak fry and political fest in Iowa three months ago hosted by Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.\n\n \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always believed that if you work hard and play by the rules, you ought to have a decent chance for yourself and for a better life for your children,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Clinton said. That is the \xe2\x80\x9cbasic bargain,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n \n\nMrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s criticism of policies that give \xe2\x80\x9ctax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas,\xe2\x80\x9d made at an event this fall for a Democratic Senate candidate, has long been part of the Clinton policy arsenal. In their 1992 campaign manifesto, \xe2\x80\x9cPutting People First,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill Clinton and running mate Al Gore called for \xe2\x80\x9cending tax breaks for American companies that\xe2\x80\xa6ship American jobs overseas.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\nMrs. Clinton also mentioned the idea in her 2008 campaign, releasing a 30-second ad in Ohio that promised to \xe2\x80\x9cend tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\nSpeaking in May, Mrs. Clinton described \xe2\x80\x9cevidence-based decision-making,\xe2\x80\x9d the idea being data and objective fact should trump ideology. It is a familiar refrain. In a 2007 interview with Newsweek, she said she believed in \xe2\x80\x9cevidence-based decision making, not ideological bases.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\nLawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor and co-founder of the Mayday PAC, a group that seeks to change the way campaigns are funded, said that Mrs. Clinton faces the risk of sounding stale. He said the midterm losses should show Democrats that \xe2\x80\x9cthey need to excite the Democratic base. And to excite the Democratic base you need to be something more than the 1990s Clinton polished up with a new website.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\nClinton backers say they are confident she can inspire voters. Mrs. Clinton, should she run, \xe2\x80\x9cwill present a forward-thinking agenda filled with fresh and bold ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrienne Elrod, a spokeswoman for Correct the Record, a pro-Clinton group.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWashington Post blog: The Fix: Aaron Blake: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton is the preferred candidate of millionaires? That\xe2\x80\x99s doubtful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\nBy Aaron Blake\n\nDecember 12, 2014, 2:35 p.m. EST\n\n \n\nHere is a headline that you might see in an ad from a Democratic presidential candidate running against Hillary Clinton:\n\n \n\nThis comes courtesy of CNBC, which commissioned a poll asking 500 people \xe2\x80\x9cwith investable assets of $1 million or more\xe2\x80\x9d (this is one poll that, safe to say, we\xe2\x80\x99d all like to be a part of) which of nine potential presidential candidates they prefer. And it has been bouncing around social media this week as we all feverishly try to imagine a scenario in which Clinton might actually not beat the motley crew of Democrats who will run against her.\n\n \n\nHow could Sen. Elizabeth Warren see this and not immediately decide to form a presidential exploratory committee, you might ask.\n\n \n\nThis poll is also far less than meets the eye.\n\n \n\nHere are the choices offered, along with what percentage of the vote each candidate got:\n\n \n\n[GRAPH]\n\n \n\nFirst of all, yes, Clinton is No. 1. This is also not how people are going to vote for the new president. The only place where this kind of election takes place is Louisiana, and even then, there\xe2\x80\x99s a two-candidate runoff if nobody gets to 50 percent.\n\n \n\nClinton especially benefits from this format because:\n\n \n\n1) She\xe2\x80\x99s more well-known than the other candidates, save Vice President Biden. The rest of the field, quite simply, aren\xe2\x80\x99t household names.\n\n \n\n2) While the Democrat/Republican split is pretty even overall, Clinton is far more of a favorite on the Democratic side. Hence, she takes 72 percent of Democrats -- about like she does in primary polling -- while the Republicans all split up the vote pretty evenly -- Jeb Bush at 36 percent, Chris Christie at 19 percent, Scott Walker at 18 percent. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s share of the overall total is thus inflated.\n\n \n\n3) There are more Republicans than Democrats. Yes, it probably only makes a small difference, but there are three Democrats, one Democratic-caucusing independent/socialist senator, and five Republicans. Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s more people splitting up one party\xe2\x80\x99s vote.\n\n \n\nPresident Obama was the rare Democrat to win the vote of the wealthiest Americans in 2008, winning people making more than $200,000 per year (this is not the same as millionaires, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the best approximation we have), 52-46. But it didn\xe2\x80\x99t last. In 2012, Mitt Romney won people making more than $250,000 by a 13-point margin.\n\n \n\nEven Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s husband -- with a moderate/pro-business reputation -- lost the wealthiest Americans by 16 points in 1996 -- and it might have been by more if extremely wealthy Ross Perot hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been on the ballot.\n\n \n\nOne wonders what would happen if Romney were included in the CNBC poll or if he were matched up against Clinton one-on-one. We\xe2\x80\x99re guessing Clinton would no longer be the \xe2\x80\x9cmillionaires\xe2\x80\x99 choice for president.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAssociated Press: \xe2\x80\x9c2016 Contenders Quiet on Police Shootings Protests\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\nBy Steve Peoples\nDecember 13, 2014, 9:33 a.m. EST\n\n \n\nSince grand juries in Missouri and New York declined to indict white police officers in the deaths of two black men, protesters nationwide have demanded a reckoning and an acknowledgement that "black lives matter."\n\n \n\nYet so far, there are few signs such a conversation will come in a place where it might most make a difference - the next campaign for president.\n\n \n\nMost of the current White House prospects have avoided speaking in depth or detail about the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner.\n\n \n\nFrom those who have, it only has been only brief, measured responses about a criminal justice system that many African-Americans view as stacked against them.\n\n \n\nRepublican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a former U.S. attorney, has just said he would not second guess a grand jury.\n\n \n\nGOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who recently visited Ferguson, Missouri, and has begun to court black voters, blamed Garner\'s death on the politicians behind New York\'s high cigarette taxes.\n\n \n\nThe presumed leading Democrat, Hillary Rodham Clinton, said the families and communities deserved a "full and fair accounting."\n\n \n\n"We have allowed our criminal justice system to get out of balance," Clinton said. "And I personally hope that these tragedies give us the opportunity to come together as a nation to find our balance again."\n\n \n\nClinton and her potential challengers have not set forth a course to do that. They have given no indication they might join in protests that have reached into popular culture, with NBA and NFL players participating.\n\n \n\n"Both parties are reluctant to bring up race in an explicit way unless they\'re forced to," said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a University of California political science professor and editor of the Journal of Race, Ethnicity, and Politics.\n\n \n\nJesse Jackson did make civil rights a central theme of his bids for the Democratic nomination in the 1980s. Fellow Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack Obama gave major speeches on race during their campaigns.\n\n \n\nBut not since John F. Kennedy and his successor, Lyndon Johnson, has a party nominee cited civil rights as a reason why voters should elect him.\n\n \n\nThat\'s largely because today\'s political leaders see more risk than reward in tackling race, Ramakrishnan said. It is easier to accept a system in which Democrats expect to win vast majority of the African-American vote and Republicans do little to engage black voters for fear the GOP will alienate other parts of the party\'s base, he said.\n\n \n\nDemocratic presidential candidates have won no less than 70 percent of the black vote since Kennedy in 1960. Obama, the first black president, won 95 percent and 93 percent of the black vote in 2008 and 2012 respectively, according to exit polls.\n\n \n\nThe African-American vote isn\'t "in play the same way other swing electorates might be in play," Ramakrishnan said.\n\n \n\nThe political rewards are elusive, but the risks are real. The few conservatives who have weighed in on the issue in some depth and done so in a way that sided with police have drawn scathing criticism from black leaders.\n\n \n\nNew York Republican Rep. Peter King, who has been teasing a 2016 presidential run, focused on Garner\'s obesity as a contributing factor to his death, which happened after Garner was placed in a chokehold by a police officer.\n\n \n\nAnother potential Republican contender in 2016, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, charged that Obama was wrong to meet with "thugs" and "mob members" involved in the protests in Ferguson.\n\n \n\n"I think that those type of statements are despicable," said the Urban League\'s president, Marc Morial. "It demonstrates a lack of sensitivity to humanity."\n\n \n\nMorial and other African-American leaders said they also overwrite the positive signs that black voters see from Republicans such as Paul and Texas Gov. Rick Perry.\n\n \n\nPerry has criticized mandatory minimum prison sentences and encouraged alternatives to incarceration for drug offenders, which are among the criminal justice reforms supported by black leaders.\n\n \n\n"Right now, Republicans seem genuinely conflicted," said Benjamin Jealous, the former head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. "You\'ll see somebody do something hopeful, and then you see them revert."\n\n \n\nWhich isn\'t to say Democrats are doing much better, they argue.\n\n \n\nJealous points to Clinton and her record on sentencing reform, which he characterized as weak. "That\'s the opportunity ultimately for somebody like Rand Paul," Jealous said.\n\n \n\nWhile the protests create a sense that a window has opened for, as Clinton put it, the "nation to come together," the differences in public opinion don\'t suggest an easy way forward.\n\n \n\nPolls show little agreement among Americans about whether the grand juries made the right decision in the Brown and Garner cases, how much race was a factor and the degree to which relations between police and people of color can improve.\n\n \n\nWithout a clear road map, said Carol Swain, a professor of political science and law at Vanderbilt University, it\'s unlikely any presidential candidate will choose to engage the nation in such a conversation as the 2016 election season begins.\n\n \n\n"Both political parties should have an interest in this," Swain said. "But for decades, no one has known what to say or do."\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Hill blog: Briefing Room: \xe2\x80\x9cBachmann: \'Cromnibus\' was \'most consequential vote\' of my career\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\nBy Ben Kamisar\n\nDecember 12, 2014, 3:04 p.m. EST\n\n \n\nRetiring Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) on Friday expressed dismay that the House passed a $1.1 trillion "cromnibus" spending bill, calling it the "most consequential vote" of her career.\n\n \n\nAsked by CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer to name the "most important vote" she took in her career, Bachmann pointed toThursday night\'s vote to keep the government funded and avoid a shutdown.\n\n \n\n"The one I took last night," she said on "Wolf." "It was the most consequential vote because it really is a constitutional crisis."\n\nThe spending package combined an omnibus for much of the government with a shorter continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security for three months, setting up a fight over President Obama\'s executive action on immigration.\n\n \n\nBachmann characterized the bill as a vote for "amnesty."\n\n \n\n"Remember, amnesty is not a law that Congress passed, the president just spoke it into existence," she added. \n\n \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no compromise. This was a top-down, jam it down your throat bill, on both sides of the aisle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bachmann.\n\n \n\nBachmann said she and Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) asked Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to allow lawmakers a vote on language that would challenge the president\xe2\x80\x99s action deferring deportations for millions of illegal immigrants.\n\n \n\nShe railed on House leadership for joining with President Obama and other Democrats in whipping support for the bill.\n\n \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was the political establishment on both sides of the aisle,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey worked out a deal, the cake was baked.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\nThe four-term congresswoman did not seek reelection in November. She told Blitzer she was excited to \xe2\x80\x9ctake the handcuffs\xe2\x80\x9d off and travel the country meeting with conservative groups of the 2016 presidential race. Bachmann ran for president in 2012, winning the Ames Straw Poll in Iowa.\n\n \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI occupy a very unique space, I\xe2\x80\x99m the only woman on the Republican side who has ever been in presidential debate,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresumably, we will have a woman again on the Democratic ticket in 2016, so [I] want to weigh in on that race.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\nBachmann\xe2\x80\x99s been a vocal critic of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is largely seen as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.\n\n \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been on the front line for eight years,\xe2\x80\x9d Bachmann said.\n\n \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile Mrs. Clinton was secretary of State, I was a member on the Intelligence Committee, I was in Congress at the time, dealing with this issue of Benghazi and all the rest.

"If we want our freedom to be in deed as well as word in America, we have to make people feel that everybody matters again."\n\n \n\nClinton, who was in Miami for the Clinton Foundation "Future of the Americas" summit, argued that the two issues at play in the protests were whether law enforcement made the correct decisions and how police departments can improve their relationships with communities.\n\n \n\nIn the last three weeks, grand juries have cleared police officers in the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York.\n\n \n\nClinton argued that in both cases, policing was an issue.\n\n \n\n"There is not any question in Ferguson, whatever the findings of the grand jury, if the law enforcement officer had not gone after the man and felt compelled to shoot him, he would be alive," Clinton said.\n\n \n\nAnd on Garner in Staten Island, Clinton was clear to point out that "police policy was against putting someone in a choke hold."\n\n \n\nDuring the interview with Juan Carlos Lopez at the University of Miami, Clinton spoke at length about foreign policy throughout the Americas and the recent release of the CIA torture report.\n\n \n\n"I think this is just the beginning," the former president said. "There will now be a real effort to find out what the details were and whether or not any other action is appropriate in that."\n\n \n\nClinton has been getting used to playing second (or possibly third) fiddle in his family. Clinton\'s wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is widely seen as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in 2016 and the recent birth of Chelsea Clinton\'s first child, Charlotte, has been the fascination of many.\n\n \n\nAs is the case with every interview, Bill Clinton was asked about his wife\'s presidential aspirations and when, in particular, Hillary Clinton expects to announce her candidacy.\n\n \n\n"I don\'t even know if she is going to run," Bill Clinton said. "But if she, sometime next year I think she will make a decision and announce it."\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWashington Post blog: Post Partisan: Carter Eskew: \xe2\x80\x9cHillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s biggest challenge\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\nBy Carter Eskew, Glover Park Group founding partner\n\nDecember 12, 2014, 2:23 p.m. EST\n\n \n\nTo Hillary Clinton, the current recriminations within the Democratic Party must sound familiar. In the two years leading into the 1992 presidential election, the Democratic Party sought answers to why it had lost so decisively the elections of 1984 and 1988. Salons were held; new think tanks were formed; new candidates emerged.\n\n \n\nThe debate then, as now, centered around whether the party had lost touch with the middle class. For Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), one of the most prominent Democrats to recently autopsy the mid-term elections, his answer in 2014 is the same as it was for Bill Clinton in 1990: yes. In fact, Schumer\xe2\x80\x99s recent speech at the National Press Club echoed Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign policy speeches at Georgetown in late 1991 and early 1992. According to Schumer, \xe2\x80\x9cthe grand optimism of the American dream is in jeopardy\xe2\x80\x9d; in 1991, Clinton said: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6the very future of our country, the Americans dream, is in peril.\xe2\x80\x9d Schumer\xe2\x80\x99s speech goes on to blame the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 defeat on a series of missteps from the roll-out of Obamacare to scandals at the V.A. that undermined Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 unique selling point: an activist government to protect and advance the middle class. Moreover, Schumer noted that the party\xe2\x80\x99s decision to make health care the centerpiece of its new agenda sent the wrong signal to a middle class that was more concerned about jobs and economic recovery.\n\n \n\nWhat is more interesting about Schumer\xe2\x80\x99s speech is what is missing: any new ideas for a Democratic agenda. In Schumer\xe2\x80\x99s view, Democrats lost, basically, because they were incompetent and misguided in their zeal for health care reform. In 1991, Bill Clinton went beyond criticism to lay out an agenda: tax cuts for the middle class and modernization of government and welfare reform within a frame of a \xe2\x80\x9cnew covenant\xe2\x80\x9d between government and its citizens. (The irony, of course, is that his presidency was similarly derailed by its zeal for health care reform.) It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to remember, in light of all the Clinton controversies, just how fresh a thinker he appeared in the early 90\xe2\x80\x99s. While his image as a slick rogue would overwhelm him, Clinton, as we all know, was a student of policy with a rare ability to package and sell it to voters in a way that seemed not only relevant but optimistic.\n\n \n\nThe difference between a senator, like Chuck Schumer and a presidential candidate, like Hillary Clinton is that a senator can stop at an intelligent description of the problem while a presidential candidate has to offer solutions. This is really the whole ballgame for Mrs. Clinton in 2016: She has unrivaled experience, the gender factor and the overwhelming support of the Democratic Party. Now she needs some fresh ideas.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBreitbart column: Citizens United Chairman David Bossie: \xe2\x80\x9cCitizens United Going to Court Over \xe2\x80\x98Stonewalled\xe2\x80\x99 Hillary Records\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\nBy David Bossie\n\nDecember 13, 2014, 6:37 a.m. PDT\n\n \n\nThis week Citizens United sued the State Department in federal court over its unlawful withholding of documents relating to Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s tenure as Secretary of State.\n\n \n\nWe are currently in pre-production for a sequel to our landmark film Hillary: The Movie. This film will take a hard look at Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s career and will tell the truth about her failed record as Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Secretary of State.\n\n \n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve filed numerous Freedom of Information Act (\xe2\x80\x9cFOIA\xe2\x80\x9d) requests for documents relating to Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s time at the State Department. These requests have gone largely unanswered. What is the State Department trying to hide? Why won\xe2\x80\x99t the Obama Administration prioritize transparency when it comes to taxpayer-funded public documents? The public has a right to know \xe2\x80\x93 yes, even if it is about Hillary Clinton!\n\n \n\nOur lawsuit involves a FOIA request that was filed in July. By law, the State Department had twenty business days to produce the documents or explain why it would not do so. That date has long since passed. We\xe2\x80\x99ve waited five months since our initial request before filing this lawsuit.\n\n \n\nCitizens United requested records from the State Department about Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s overseas travel. All we want to know is who accompanied Hillary on these trips and how much it cost the American taxpayer. Did any wealthy Clinton campaign or foundation contributors get rewarded for their largesse? These questions deserve immediate answers in light of the reports that surfaced during the Clinton Administration in the 1990s. These reports suggested that big Democrat contributors were allegedly rewarded with flights on official Commerce Department trade missions overseas. Selling access to big donors was a regular news item during the dark days of the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 tenure in the White House.\n\n \n\nSadly, stonewalling and slow-walking the production of public Clinton documents and records is all too familiar as well. As the former Chief Investigator for the U.S House Oversight Committee at the time, I can tell you firsthand that well-orchestrated delay tactics with document requests and subpoenas was the order of the day. And, of course, it continues to be the modus operandi of Hillary Clinton and friends all these years later.\n\n \n\nAs an example, Citizens United sent a narrow, non-controversial FOIA request to the State Department in January 2010. We received a small production of documents in response to this request in August 2014. The American people should not have to wait four and half years for public records from our government. This is simply unacceptable.\n\n \n\nOur government is supposed to be of the people, by the people, and for the people. The FOIA process helps ensure transparency in government, and only through that transparency can we the people hold the government accountable. It\xe2\x80\x99s time for the State Department to stop stonewalling and turn over these documents. Sign our petition to break through the stonewall.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCalendar:\n\n \n\n \n\nSec.
