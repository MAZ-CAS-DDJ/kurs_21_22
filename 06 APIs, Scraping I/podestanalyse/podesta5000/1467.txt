john.podesta@gmail.comb'John:\n\nI hope you are well.\n\nAs you may know, President Clinton and I have decided to proceed ahead with the diesel replacement work that you and I discussed a few months ago. We have agreed that we would constitute a board that would oversee that work as well as other non C 40 CCI work. Bruce has told me that you would head that board.\n\nCould we schedule a call so that I can bring you up to date and we can discuss how to organize the board and who should be on it?\n\nThanks\n\nIra\n'
