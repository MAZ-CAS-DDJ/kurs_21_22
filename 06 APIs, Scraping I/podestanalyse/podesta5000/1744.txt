He relayed that\nDarcy Bacon, with whom you worked with Peter Hart in 1984, is volunteering\nto help during the transition. Darcy was until recently working for NPR and\nMark Shields. He also says Jerry Jasinowski, former head of NAM, wants to\nhelp.\n\nI'm sure you are getting all kinds of messages like this. I thought these\nwere of a high or personal nature that you should be aware personally. If\nthere is a point of contact that I can link these folks and others up with,\nI'll get you out of the middle. I'm working closely with Rand on homeland\nmatters. We'll be ready to go on November 5.\n\nPJ\n"
