We want to make sure we design our database and website to be compatible with it, so it would be good if you could get us a contact person there.\n \n2) Through third parties, Clay Johnson has offered to meet with both candidates' transition teams.  If Johnson is going to be the Administration's designated person, that would be good to know.\n \n3) You asked about whether the FBI has the resources to do background investigations.  Based on the attached memo, it doesn't sound like it.\n \n--Chris\n \n \n"
