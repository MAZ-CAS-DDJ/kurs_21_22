With that in mind I have made an observation that I would like to share in hopes of assisting your campaign.  With respect to the GOP race, it appears that people are voting for the front runner not because of wanting him in office but more so not wanting a traditional politician or someone of the "establishment."  Rather than trying to make the front runner more "unlike" those running, it perhaps would be beneficial to provide information which aligns him more with the traditional politicians and then debate him on a different playing field.  The voting against the establishment is certainly apparent in Mr. Sanders\' appeal even though he is certainly part of the establishment.  In sum, don\'t drive a further wedge between Washington and the GOP front runner.  Don\'t fight on his turf, fight on yours.  Just a suggestion.  Good luck!\n'
