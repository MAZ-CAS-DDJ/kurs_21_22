john.podesta@gmail.comb'John, I just hung up the phone with Debbie Stabenow who agrees completely \nwith my analysis.  You may want to speak to her as well, but I think it \nwould serve our candidate for you and me to have a conversation about this \nasap for there are several complex factors that will be more easily \nexplained by phone.  Can we talk first thing (I am on the west coast) \ntomorrow morning?\n\nIf not, and for now, I will try to summarize here:\n        * The reasons that Debbie needs to keep trying to advance a \ncompromise to Roberts are (a) his bill contains some real conflicts with \nthe Organic Food Production Act and current National Organic Program that \nwould cause serious disruption, and (b) farm state Democrats like \nDonnelly, Bennet, Warner Klobuchar, Heitkamp and of course Coons and \nCarper and others are under enormous pressure from conventional Ag \ninterests to come up with some kind of acceptable solution that pre-empts \nVermont\'s and other states\' laws from taking effect and if Debbie \nwithdraws from the compromise negotiations, she fears that other Dems who \nare less savvy about some of the issues here will end up negotiating a \nworse agreement than she would be able to get.  Therefore, she has no \nchoice but to keep pushing for something that is less damaging than \nRoberts but which will still fall short of a real path to mandatory \nlabeling.  Gary\'s Truth-o-meter note: the main reason these Democrat and \nRepublican Senators are so eager to pre-empt Vermont is that they have \nbeen persuaded that the food industry cannot be subject to a "patchwork \nquilt" of 50 different state labeling laws.  This is a scare tactic that \nhas no basis in fact because the state labeling advocates have now ensured \nthat every one of the states likely to pass labeling this year (MA, RI, NY \nand others) are using identical bills as VT\'s.  So there is zero chance of \na patchwork quilt but that of course does not stop the opposing lobbyists \nfrom repeating this ad nauseum. \n\n        * The reasons that Tom is so passionate about getting a compromise \nworked out is that he has become convinced that allowing VT\'s law to take \neffect must be avoided because the AG commodity community has spooked him \nthat mandatory labeling will cause an avalanche of consumers seeking to \nfind non-gmo alternatives and we will have resultant supply shortages and \nprice inflation. He points to USDA reports that sugar cane supplies are \nnot keeping up and calls this the tip of the iceberg.  Gary\'s \nTruth-o-meter note:  the main reason that sugar cane may not be keeping up \nwith demand is because companies are moving away from high fructose corn \nsyrup and this has nothing to do with GMO\'s.  Moreover, actual experience \nin countries like Brazil is that labeling does not stimulate any sort of \nradical changes in consumer behavior, ie there will be no run to find \nnon-gmo supplies and a comprehensive 5-year study of consumers released \nlast year shows definitively that consumers do not see disclosures as \nwarning symbols and labels will not change most consumers\' behavior.\n\nConclusion:  Unfortunately, I cannot persuade Tom on this point, despite \nthe ample evidence to the contrary so there is no doubt that he will \nrecommend that the President sign even a bad bill if it gets to his desk. \nAnd equally unfortunately, Debbie is caught between a rock and a hard \nplace when it comes to saving the organic standards and also holding her \ncaucus together, so I do understand why she needs to keep trying to lead \nthe effort to find a compromise solution, even while she agrees that the \npassage of such a bill could unfortunately give Bernie a major PR, \nfundraising and political opportunity. \n\nProposed Solution:  If I am right about all of this, then there are really \nonly two ways for us to avoid delivering Bernie a giant opportunity to \ncall for a national rally of 100,000 angry citizens in DC and dominate the \nmedia with this example of all that is wrong and impotent with the \nObama/Clinton approach. And both solutions are needed. These are:\n        A) Immediately upon the introduction of the Roberts bill tomorrow \nnight or sometime shortly after that, Hillary should pre-empt Bernie by \ncoming out very strongly against the bill and in favor of mandatory GMO \nlabeling because consumers, and particularly mothers absolutely have the \nright to know. I know this will pit her in opposition to Tom, but her \nfailure to do this, or to allow Bernie to do it first, will only feed his \nnarrative and demonstrate that she is a hostage to big food and chemical \ncompanies (Ask her yourself, but you will see that Debbie agrees with me \non this), and\n\n        B) President Obama should break with his Ag Secretary and \ncommunicate asap to the Senate that he will veto any bill that does not \ncontain a mandatory on-package labeling provision. This would have the \neffect of giving farm state Democrats the courage to not cave in to \nRoberts or the compromise and would also serve to prevent Bernie from \nclaiming the high ground and trying to paint HRC into a corner.\n\nAgain, I am happy to talk in the am if you want. I urge you to take this \nvery seriously because I am certain I am right about Bernie and his \nfollowers, and we simply must avoid handing him this plum. \n\nGary Hirshberg\nChairman, Stonyfield Farm\nChairman, Just Label It\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:   John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>\nTo:     Gary HIRSHBERG <GHIRSHBERG@stonyfield.com>\nCc:     Jake Sullivan <jsullivan@hillaryclinton.com>\nDate:   03/13/2016 02:34 PM\nSubject:        Re: Urgent need to talk and for you to act with the WH\n\n\n\nHas Vilsack signed off on this?\n\nOn Sunday, March 13, 2016, Gary HIRSHBERG <GHIRSHBERG@stonyfield.com> \nwrote:\nJohn, the Roberts bill will be introduced on Monday night and it is now \nhighly likely that a very bad "compromise" version will pass the senate \nthis week and be approved by the House and on its way to the White House \nwithin a very short period. I can promise you that if President Obama \nsigns this terrible legislation that blatantly validates Bernie\'s entire \ncampaign message about Wall Street running our government, this will give \nBernie a huge boost and 10,000 -20,000 outraged citizens ( who WILL turn \nup because they will be so angry at the President for preemption vt) will \nbe marching on the Mall with Bernie as their keynote speaker. In short, I \nfeel certain that Obama (who famously promised on camera to implement \nmandatory GMO labeling) signing this bill will result in adding at least \nanother month or more of money and attention to the Sanders campaign. \n\nTo avoid this, this bill can still be stopped if the WH and Clinton \ncampaign come down now on the 12-14 farm state dems who Roberts will need \nto pass this compromise.\n\nI am on a plane until 6:30 pm EST but can talk after that. I am also \npassing the same message to David Simas. \n\nIt will be terrible to hand Sanders this advantage at such a fragile time \nwhen we really need to save our $$$ for the Trump fight. We should discuss \nwith your team immediately. \n\nGh\n\nSent from my iPhone\n'
