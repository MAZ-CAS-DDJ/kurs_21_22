Help LCV Victory Fund keep up the momentum through Election Day: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=KOMLBehEzfqbsPSHksc5Zg .\n\nJohn,\n\nDonate before the September 30th FEC deadline! Help LCV Victory Fund reach our $120,000 goal:\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=s5Ic3k7wZE9A5YQM3PdUvQ .\n\nPolls are fluctuating wildly right now. A poll released just yesterday gave Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown a 4-point lead over Elizabeth Warren.\n\nAnd what about the day before? A poll released on Wednesday put Warren at 47 percent and Brown at 42 percent.\n\nNow, I'm as bad as anyone. As LCV Victory Fund's Vice President of Communications, every morning I pour through the latest polling data. Frankly, I'm a little obsessive about it. I'd be kidding myself if I said I could ignore all of these\ndaily polls, but the truth is that the key Senate races we're focused on are going to remain tight all the way to Election Day, no matter what today's polls say.\n\nDonate to LCV Victory Fund. So far, friends like you have helped LCV Victory Fund raise more than $62,000. That puts us halfway to our $120,000 goal by the September 30th FEC deadline. Will you chip in to get us even closer?\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=ko54Tg7lp97MkIyTy4wBaA\n\nKarl Rove and his big polluter buddies aren't buying the polls either. They know most of these Senate races are basically tied and that there are no clear front runners, especially 46 days from Election Day. And believe me - anything can happen during these final few weeks.\n\nRove isn't leaving anything to chance and he has plenty of money to burn. That's why he's still dropping millions on massive TV advertising campaigns in states like Wisconsin, where the latest polls show environmental champion Tammy Baldwin surging against former Governor Tommy Thompson. Just this week, Rove's Crossroads GPS made a $1.8 million TV ad buy targeting Baldwin. And there's more to come from Rove in Wisconsin, Virginia, Montana, Ohio, Nevada, Connecticut, Arizona and elsewhere.\n\nI know we can't match Rove dollar-for-dollar. That's just never going to happen. But our path to victory doesn't depend on spending tens of millions on TV ads. Our campaign teams are taking our environmental message door-to-door and neighbor-to-neighbor. We're mobilizing a grassroots army in key battle ground states\nto win on Election Day.\n\nCan you help us make our September 30th fundraising goal with an urgent donation to LCV Victory Fund today?\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=Dq5rcGUeoh4H-Md-MI315A\n\nWe're competing in several critical Senate races across the country. Here's an update on just a few of the states where we're mobilizing:\n\nIn Virginia, we just launched a 2.2 million piece mail program to defeat former Senator George Allen. This is one of the largest mail programs of the entire 2012 election cycle. Why? Because the race between Tim Kaine and George Allen is one of the closest in the country right now. And the 2006 Virginia Senate race was decided by just 9,329 votes. I guarantee you that the 2012 Virginia race will be\njust as close.\n\nIn Montana, LCV has already knocked on the doors of more than 100,000 voters in our effort to help re-elect Senator Jon Tester, a strong clean energy champion. As Vice President Biden might say, this race has literally been tied all year. Remember - when Jon Tester won his Senate race in 2006 it was by just 3,562 votes. This year will be just as tight. That's why it's critical we have the resources necessary to keep engaging voters at the door in Montana.\n\nDon't miss this opportunity. Help LCV Victory Fund win these races on November 6th. There is too much at stake. Will you chip in?\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=hEA8D0iMVBcpKHLaSYl0uQ\n\nThank you for your support of LCV Victory Fund.\n\nBest -\n\nMike Palamuso\xa0\nVice President, Communications\nLCV Victory Fund\n\nPaid for by LCV Victory Fund, 202-785-8683, and not authorized by any\ncandidate or candidate's committee.\n\n\nUpdate Your Profile\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=BAe6bHgBKTu0qVpLEQ3DFQ\n\nTo Unsubscribe Click Here\nhttp://action.lcv.org/site/CO?i=E-gjTMK82hxJy5DnoYClDoG4hy7AduY9&cid=0\n\n1920 L Street, NW Suite 800\nWashington, DC 20036\n202-785-8683\n\n"
