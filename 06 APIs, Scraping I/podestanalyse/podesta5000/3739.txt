We must ensure that our young people have access to affordable college opportunities and job training. These are the building blocks that will set our children on the path to success. \n\nhttp://go.anthonybrown.com/community\n\nSee you on the campaign trail,\n\nAnthony----\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.\n\nTo unsubscribe, go to: \n  http://go.anthonybrown.com/unsubscribe\n\n'
