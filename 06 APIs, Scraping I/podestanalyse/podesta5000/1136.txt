Schiff Responds to Report of Whistleblower on Benghazi Committee\n> \n>  \n> \n> Washington, DC -- Today, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), a member of the House Select Committee on Benghazi and Ranking Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, released the following statement after a report that a Republican investigator was fired in part because he would not go along with Republican plans to target Secretary Clinton:\n> \n> "Even before Kevin McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s comments laid bare the true intent of the committee, it\xe2\x80\x99s been clear that Secretary Clinton has been the true target of this investigation, and the Republican whistleblower who has come forward only provides further evidence of what has been long evident. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to shut down the Benghazi Select Committee. Only by ending this expensive and politicized investigation can we begin to undo the damage already done through this unprecedented use of Congress\'s power for nakedly political purposes."\n> \n> ###\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> -- \n> John Lawrence\n> Visiting Professor\n> University of California\n> Washington DC Center \n> \n> Read the DOMEocracy blog: johnalawrence.wordpress.com\n> \n'
