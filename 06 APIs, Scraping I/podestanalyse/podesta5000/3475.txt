Every year, a highlight of the orientation week is the morning of faculty talks and tours. The students very much enjoy hearing about hot issues in your field or visiting a museum or other D.C.-area attraction that you find interesting. They also enjoy getting to know you and each other in a casual setting before classes start. I hope you will consider offering a talk or tour this year, whether it's your first or already an orientation tradition.\n\nThis year the first-year JD Orientation runs from Tuesday, August 24 through Friday, August 28, and classes begin on Monday, August 31. The talks and tours are scheduled for Thursday, August 27. The talks start at either 9:30 a.m. or 11 a.m., and typically last 60-75 minutes with time for questions built in. JD and LL.M. students come to those on a drop-in basis. Tours leave at various times during the morning and end by early afternoon. JD students sign up for those ahead of time and space is limited. As always, Merced in my office and the Special Events team will coordinate all the meals, tickets, room reservations, transportation and other logistics ahead of time.\n\nI've attached a schedule of the talks and tours from the August 2014 Orientation to give you an idea of the range of topics and tours we've recently offered. If you'd be willing to give a talk or lead a tour, please let me know by return email what you have in mind.\n\nMany thanks for all that you do to make the orientation week a success!\n\nMitch\n\nMitchell C.
