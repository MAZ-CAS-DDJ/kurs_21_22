But we know better.\xa0\n\nWe\n need to send a message that families across Maryland are done waiting\n - the time to act on comprehensive immigration reform and the issues\n that impact working families is now.\n\nTell Paul Ryan we are done\n waiting. Donate $5 right now so we can meet our\xa0deadline on\xa0Saturday\n night and send a message that the time to step up for working families is\n NOW.\xa0\n\nSpeaker Ryan may not want to work with Democrats. But I am\n willing to work with leaders on both sides of the aisle to get things\n done for families in Maryland. It's how I've served my constituents in\n Anne Arundel and Prince George's Counties, and it's what I will\n continue to do in Congress.\n\nLet's not let partisanship stop us from doing\n what's right for Maryland families.\n\nThank you for your\n help,\n\n\nJoseline\n\nhttp://www.joselinepenamelnyk.com/\n\nPaid for by Joseline\n Pe\xf1a-Melnyk for Congress\nP.O.
