David and Steve may want to give additional\njustification, but all of us agree that it is not in anyone\xe2\x80\x99s interest to\nengage with or respond to purposefully inaccurate right wing bloggers as it\nwill only result in additional rounds of stories that will do nothing to\ncorrect the record.  Our internal digital analysis has shown that this\nstory line has flatlined over the last several days and we do not believe\nthat inducing another spike in the online discussion will be beneficial.\n\n\n\n*From:* Tony Podesta\n*Sent:* Monday, May 04, 2015 10:43 AM\n*To:* Missi Tessier; David Marin\n*Cc:* Stephen Rademaker\n*Subject:* Fwd: Podesta in the News Today\n\n\n\nWeren\'t the Russians already owners when we started\n\nThis implies we worked on cifius\n\nDon\'t think we should let anything pass\n\nViews\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n\n*From:* Gregory McGowan <gmcgowan@podestagroup.com>\n*Date:* May 4, 2015 at 4:26:00 PM GMT+2\n*To:* Everyone <PA-Everyone@podesta.com>\n*Subject:* *Podesta in the News Today*\n\nPODESTA IN THE NEWS: 05.04.2015\n\n\n\n*Note: numerous blogs are continuing to repost last week\xe2\x80\x99s DeSmog Blog\narticle\n<http://www.desmogblog.com/2015/04/30/hillary-clinton-john-podesta-tony-podesta-lng-export-terminal-qatar>\nas well as the following Breitbart piece that was published over the\nweekend.*\n\n\n\nClinton Guru Podesta\xe2\x80\x99 Brother Lobbied for Scandal-Ridden Uranium One\n<#14d1fa13f250841b_a>\n\nBy: Ben Shapiro, Breitbart\n\n\n\n\n\nBreitbart\n\n\n\nMay 1, 2015\n\n\n\nClinton Guru Podesta\xe2\x80\x99 Brother Lobbied for Scandal-Ridden Uranium One\n<http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/01/clinton-guru-podesta-lobbied-for-scandal-ridden-uranium-one/>\n\n\n\nBy: Ben Shapiro\n\n\n\nIf you love the team that put together the Clinton Foundation and all of\nits various corrupt dealings with foreign nations, you\xe2\x80\x99ll love the Hillary\nClinton 2016 campaign. It now turns out that John Podesta, chair of\nHillary\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign \xe2\x80\x93 and the same man who called the\nallegations of Peter Schweizer\xe2\x80\x99s Clinton Cash \xe2\x80\x9cconspiracy theories\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 has a\nbrother who runs a company, The *Podesta Group*, that lobbied the State\nDepartment on behalf of Uranium One while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of\nState and beyond.\n\n\n\nUranium One is, of course, the uranium firm that sent a \xe2\x80\x9cflow of cash\xe2\x80\x9d to\nthe Clinton Foundation as the Russian government gained increasing\nownership of the company; the State Department had to sign off on the\nRussians\xe2\x80\x99 encroachment into the American uranium market. The Clinton\nFoundation did disclose its relationship with Uranium One in Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s\nState Department disclosures. According to the Daily Caller, Uranium One\n\xe2\x80\x9cpaid the *Podesta Group* $40,000 to lobby the State Department, the\nSenate, the National Park Service and the National Security Council for\n\xe2\x80\x98international mining projects,\xe2\x80\x99 according to a July 20, 2012 filing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nHillary\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with John Podesta goes back to the first Clinton\nadministration. During Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s second term, Podesta acted as chief\nof staff. After leaving, he created the Center for American Progress, a\nClinton-backed leftist think tank designed to forward the political goals\nof the Clintons. As the Christian Science Monitor reported when Podesta\njoined Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign back in January:\n\n\n\nPodesta is the guy people call on when the going gets tough: He served as\nBill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff from 1998 to 2001, helping control a series\nof crises including Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s impeachment trial. The Obama administration\nbrought him on to help the President steer a path through Congressional\nimpasses and to avert embarrassments like the Affordable Care Act\xe2\x80\x99s botched\nrollout.\n\n\n\nPodesta\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the Clintons didn\xe2\x80\x99t waver during Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s time\nin the White House; his own ties with the Obama administration grew\nstronger when he became a senior advisor to the Obama administration in\nlate 2013, before resigning this year to join Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\n\n\n\nPodesta isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only member of the Clinton team embroiled in Clinton\nFoundation corruption. Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s new top fundraiser is Dennis Cheng, the\nformer chief development officer for the Clinton Foundation, which means he\ndid all the fundraising for that organization. Cheng has not been asked any\nquestions thus far about his relationship with the Clinton Foundation or\nthe new Clinton 2016 campaign.\n\n\n\nJust as President Obama magically transformed his campaign organization,\nObama for America, into a political action group, Organizing for Action, to\nlobby for his preferred governmental policies, Hillary Clinton has\ntransformed the Clinton Foundation and its constellation of allies into her\n2016 campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*GREGORY* *MCGOWAN* *ASSOCIATE*\n\nO 202.448.5204 / C  / W www.podestagroup.com\n\n1001 G Street NW, Suite 1000 West, Washington, DC 20001\n<https://www.facebook.com/thepodestagroup>\n\n\n  <https://www.facebook.com/thepodestagroup>\n'
