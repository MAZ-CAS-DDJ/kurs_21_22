Many of you know Donald from his previous service on the CAP Board and from his dedicated work in progressive politics and philanthropy. Donald served as a valued CAP director from May 2009 to May 2012, when he resigned from all boards in order to demonstrate his commitment to an independent news source as a new owner of Maine Today Media.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Now, he is in a position to rejoin. Donald has also had a long and distinguished career in finance.  Significantly, he has never stopped being part of the American Progress family and I am confident that his perspective and commitment will be an important part of advancing our work.  If appointed, he will participate in the spring meeting on May 26, 2015. \n> \n>  \n> \n> If you agree with my recommendation, please (1) email Alex DeMots to let him know at your earliest convenience at ademots@americanprogress.org, and (2) print and sign the attached proposed Unanimous Consent and return it to Alex via facsimile (202-315-0453) or as a pdf via email. \n> \n>  \n> \n> Alternatively, if you would like to discuss this recommendation, please do not hesitate to contact me.   \n> \n>  \n> \n> Thank you for your consideration.\n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n> \n> Attachment:  Proposed Unanimous Consent\n'
