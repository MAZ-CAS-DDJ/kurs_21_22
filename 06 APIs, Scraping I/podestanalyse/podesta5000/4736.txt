You may have noticed\nthat I am visiting DC on Friday the 7th. I shall be giving a talk in the\nafternoon at USIP.\n\nHowever if by any chance John Podesta had a few minutes it would be really\ngood if I could see him. Usual topic of how to deal with the Talibs. But I\njust got back from the region yesterday and so have some fresh feedback if\nhe is interested. Methinks Mr. Podesta does not get to meet anyone with the\nkind of access to the T\'s which I have so I think he would find it useful.\n\nAny suggestions on how to get to see him? Apart from the 3-4.30 meeting in\nUSIP I am pretty flexible on Friday.\n\nregards\n\nMichael\n\n   --\n\nMichael Semple\nVisiting Professor\nInstitute for the Study of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice\n(ISCTSJ)\nQueen\'s University Belfast\n\nEmail <Emailtalkforpeace@gmail.com> 1:\ntalkforpeace@gmail.com<talkforpeace@gmail.com>\nEmail <Emailm.semple@qub.ac.uk> 2:   m.semple@qub.ac.uk <m.semple@qub.ac.uk>\nWeb: <http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/isctsj/>\nhttp://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/isctsj/\n\nSkype: michael.semple\nUK/NI Cell: +44 7780646972\nRoaming Cell: +353 87 2716876\nPak Cell: +92 300 8545571\nUS 617 6699233\n'
