Updates about the tech team Iowa\nenvoy and deploy of the Reporter (caucus app) and Aurora (caucus dashboard)\nwill be in next week\'s report. Congratulations to everyone!\n\nYou can now checkout per Q1 project current status\n<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tAi6O0ap-2JrJ_SBTufzSA1fT_jVA-Dp_L5kdM6oyUQ/edit#gid=1065016584>\nand owners. This spreadsheet will be updated weekly in sync with this\nreport.\n\nArchive of previous Weekly Reports\n<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QfJQgg1QImpPVyDPwCTsFGVIOK8ZkA1lntkRqsn3dJc/edit#>\n\n\nWeek starting January 25th\n\nWins:\n\n   -\n\n   SMS tool: The organizing tech team did a two week sprint to build a tool\n   that can pull a list of people from VAN and allow field staff to SMS them\n   one at a time. In the three days leading up to the caucus, Iowa sent 49,669\n   GOTC messages to 26,435 people!\n   -\n\n   New Analytics tool: Analytics got data from a new critical and recurring\n   data source to help in our tv buys decisions for super Tuesday and beyond.\n   Tech was asked to help ingest this data and developed a new system to\n   process the huge amount of data 1000x faster than previous tools (400\n   million lines processes in 13 minutes).\n   -\n\n   Recurring Upsell: Team Donate shipped an A/B test where we upsell donors\n   to create a recurring subscription. This test increased recurring opt-ins\n   by a whopping *105%*! It is now running for 100% of users.\n   -\n\n   Parity in New Donate:  Team Donate has taken another big step towards\n   parity with the old donate platform by adding ACH support to \xe2\x80\x9cNew Donate\xe2\x80\x9d\n   pages.\n   -\n\n   Improved Quick Donate:Team Donate tested further tweaks to the lucrative\n   \xe2\x80\x9cSave Payment Information\xe2\x80\x9d upsell after completing a donation. These tweaks\n   are now implemented for all traffic as they produced an 8% increase in\n   opt-ins.\n   -\n\n   HVF for events: We\xe2\x80\x99ve added HVF support for ticketed events. This means\n   that HVF events created on the new Events system can offer ACH as a payment\n   option. This one is for you, Robby! Dreams do come true.\n   -\n\n   Digital can customize hillaryclinton.com home page: Without help from\n   Engineering, the Digital team can now change the photo, call to action, and\n   destination on the homepage.\n\n\nUpdates:\n\n   -\n\n   Call Tool: The voter engineering team continues to make progress on our\n   call tool. We\xe2\x80\x99re working on being able to pull virtual phone bank\n   information directly from VAN, and then record call responses!\n   -\n\n   Email Update: We Launched Email Tagger, a tool to allow Digital to tag\n   emails so that we can perform quantitative analysis across subjective\n   qualities of an email. For example, how well do "funny" emails perform? How\n   do emails that use the slogan "I\'m with her" do compared to ones that use\n   the slogan "flighting for us"?\n   -\n\n   Uniform-VAN Sync Updates: Last week was a big week for Uniform + VAN\n   sync. Uniform now allows form submissions to sync to activist codes in one\n   or more state VANs, this includes activist codes that are newly created\n   and/or shared across states. We now have several forms (GOTV forms,\n   Supporter Housing forms, etc) out in February & March states that utilize\n   this Uniform <> VAN sync functionality.\n\n\nHiring\n\n   -\n\n   Welcome Henry Bridge: Henry will be the PM Lead for a new area of\n   projects we\'re carving off related to Email and Audience Services. In\n   short, Henry will partner with Engineering to define the products that work\n   behind-the-scenes to power the intelligence of the messages/emails, web\n   apps, and mobile apps we deliver to our supporters. In addition, for as\n   much bandwidth as he can spare, Henry will be doing the frontend\n   engineering for his own projects.\n   - Welcome Matt Vermaak (Senior iOS Engineer): Before joining us, Matt\n   was an iOS contractor at GrubHub. He\'s joining us to work on mobile\n   projects (namely the Hillary app!) but he also has some backend chops and\n   already hit the ground running by helping make HFA Stork production ready.\n'
