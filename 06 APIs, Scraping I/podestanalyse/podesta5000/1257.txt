Many great press hits\nare already coming out and can send a wrap up but I think also a successful\nday in hearing more about what the community needs to help Flint.\n\n*Event at Franklin-Wright Settlements with Mayor Duggan (Detroit, MI)*\n100 folks\nOpen press; local FOX, freep, mlive, detroit news, student paper, lots of\nphotos, cbs radio\n\nNew/Notable/Flags\nNo flags in her event.\nNo flags in her answers to media, just noting more political than the ones\nearlier but her answers were solid.\n\nREADOUT\n\nShort tour to see the classrooms (adorable little kids), college prep\nprogram, and health center. Then into program.\n\nWelcome by Monique who runs the program\nIntro by Mayor Duggan, funny stories about introducing President Clinton in\n91 and HRC in 92/93 and now he get\xe2\x80\x99s to introduce Chelsea\nShort remarks from Chelsea about civic engagement including story about\npeople asking her to run for office\nthen q&a which started out with what was it like to grow up daughter of a\npresident, be in white house, then got into some great questions on:\n\n   - how to help the world,\n   - what advice for young voters and first time voter\n   - What advice for young people.\n   - What do you think should be done to help detroit (she flipped this on\n   the student and asked what she thought and got a nice exchange)\n\n10 min gaggle at end with the locals who were there. Questions included:\n\n   - what she saw and did today and difference she can make here (flint),\n   - why important to be here (flint), analysts say her mom has a trust\n   issue and what would she say on that personally (doesn\xe2\x80\x99t resonate; also\n   used long history on lead poisoning and with CDF fighting for kids aka a\n   forty year record as proof that she\xe2\x80\x99s consistent and trustworthy),\n   - gov snyder call to resign (accountability is important but where mayor\n   and dr mona want attention and resources is to test water, treat, help\n   those affected),\n   - How do you feel about attacks (I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember a time when not\n   attacked; frank white story; for me its about helping people understand\n   what she has and always has fought and stood for and her record)\n   - Couple years ago you came for boxing gym (NOTE: this was an nbc story\n   she did) but what can your mom or govt do for detroit kids or education\n   (fed govt can play a role with title 1 funding)\n   - what would her dad do for campaign or should he step back (he\xe2\x80\x99s been\n   out there talking to people about why she would be best president and he\n   knows something about that \xe2\x80\x93 economics example, and why she is even more\n   qualified than he was!)\n\n\n\nFrom: Erika Gudmundson <erika@chelseaoffice.com>\nDate: Thursday, February 11, 2016 at 5:37 PM\nTo: Huma Abedin <ha16@hillaryclinton.com>, Bari Lurie <\nbari@chelseaoffice.com>, Jennifer Palmieri <jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com>,\nKristina Schake <kschake@hillaryclinton.com>, "synergy@hillaryclinton.com" <\nsynergy@hillaryclinton.com>, "creynolds@hillaryclinton.com" <\ncreynolds@hillaryclinton.com>, "slatham@hillaryclinton.com" <\nslatham@hillaryclinton.com>\nCc: Ann O\'Leary <aoleary@hillaryclinton.com>, Amanda Renteria <\narenteria@hillaryclinton.com>\nSubject: Re: 02.11.16 - Chelsea (MI day)\n\n*Stop by UA Local 370 (Flushing, MI)*\nChelsea arrived and was greeted by Harold who runs the local and his family\n- as well as Flint Mayor Weaver who was able to make it!\n\nShe proceeded to the warehouse where the volunteers who distribute bottled\nwater and faucets (new faucets are required in order to allow the right\nfilters to fit in many cases). Shook hands and thanked the volunteers who\nwere a part of the Union. Harold took her around the warehouse a bit to\nexplain their work.\n\nUA 370 endorsed but we made sure no campaign signs here or at previous\nstop, by the way.\n\nMost press stayed with us and we did interviews again: CBS, Flint\'s NBC,\nFox, the Washington post stringer, U Michigan student paper the Michigan\nDaily, MIRS which I\'m told is like Michigan\'s CQ.\n\nNo flags - great easy interviews similar to the ones earlier. One or two\nquestions on claim that it\'s politicizing it but she said this is deeply\npersonal for my mom who has been working for kids and families for more\nthan 40 years including at CDF where lead poisoning meant kids couldn\'t\nalways go to school. It\'s personal for her mom. Should be personal for\neveryone. Focus needs to stay on Flint and if anything election year can\njust help shine a light on what\'s going on.\nAlso she got very personal and talked about how she is a mom- and talked\nabout how if she lived in flint it\'d be her daughter drinking the water and\nshe may have miscarried. It\'s horrible and unconscionable.\nWaPo was mostly on flint but w twists like does it make her mom a better\ncandidate, and one question on young female voters. Talked about how issues\nlike this should be important to young women and moms and really all of us.\nAlso of course Chelsea kept saying focus should be on flint and listening\nto what community says its needs and wants.\nMIRS was a little weird - not bad. But weird. On how is this campaign\ndifferent from her dad\'s etc, lots of comparing her parents. Light hearted\ninterview and she did fine. Just strange bc he started by saying I don\'t\nhave any questions about flint.\n\nAnyway... with that we may have done all the press in this part of the\nstate of Michigan! En rte Detroit for last event w Mayor Duggan.\n\nAttached are photos from today - sorry not great.\n[image: image1.JPG]\n\n[image: image2.JPG]\n\n\nOn Feb 11, 2016, at 5:23 PM, Erika Gudmundson <erika@chelseaoffice.com>\nwrote:\n\n*Tour of Children\'s Clinic with Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha (Flint, MI)*\nChelsea arrived at the clinic and met privately for a little over 30 mins\nwith Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha who runs the clinic. Ann and Amanda (adding)\nwere in the meeting. She got a tour of the facility which included the\nfarmers market which is attached. The clinic will start writing\nprescriptions for fresh fruits and vegetables for kids impacted. Also saw\nthe patient wing and met with staff in the residents room.\n\nB roll of farmers market and the residents room with about 7 cameras, 5\nprint, handful of stills. Washington Post local stringer was only national.\n\nDid refinery29 sit down interview as well as short stand ups with Detroit\nNBC and Detroit FOX. Also with MLive, Detroit News and Free Press. No\nflags. Think it\'ll be really excellent coverage on the issue. Virtually no\ncampaign or political questions- all flint focused. She referred a lot to\nlistening to the community and how heartbreaking and outrageous it is.\n\nReporters also interviewed Dr Mona and a couple of the staff or nurses.\n\nIn fact, aside from blowing up the schedule completely because twice as\nmuch press showed up as I thought (I am avoiding eye contact with Bari who\nI can feel glaring at me right now to wrap!), it was a very excellent tour\nand press coverage I think will be fantastic.\n\nAnn and Amanda may be able to fill in on how the meeting went.\n\nOn Feb 11, 2016, at 12:57 PM, Erika Gudmundson <erika@chelseaoffice.com>\nwrote:\n\n*Finance Event at Davidson Home (Birmingham, MI)*\nClosed Press\n75 folks\n\nNew/notable/flags:\n- new: "we are not electing a monarch, we are electing a president" to make\npoint about knowing what will happen via courts or leg vs exec action\n- Sanders was on people\'s minds more than I\'ve seen before in Q&A. She\nmentioned Sanders by name a few times on health care, college\naffordability, how to pay for things, his record in senate, young people.\n- new / flag: "In senate career he (sanders) sponsored three pieces of\nlegislation and two were to rename post offices in VT." And "I think Obama\nin his two years in senate was more effective than sanders in his career\nthere."\n- comment/question on flint and Snyder, no flags in her response but she\ndid contrast sanders\' response of calling for resignation and opening a\ncampaign office with her mom\'s. Leaned into future announcement of\nimmediate work her mom will do to help.\n\nREADOUT\n\nWelcoming remarks by Ethan Davidson\n\nCCM standard intro remarks including\n- SCOTUS and including her mom\'s citizen United remarks about it being\nagainst her,\n- health care and perfect not being enemy of the good as well as not\nstarting over (mentioned sanders by name saying this is a difference) because\nof what\'s actually achievable in current political climate,\n- normalization of hate speech and SoS record of talking about women and\nLGBT and making it people\'s jobs. Experience matters.\n\nQ&A\nQ: young women and sanders - why?\nA: never want to speak for someone else. Part of it is emotional appeal of\nfree college for young people even though sanders has yet to detail exactly\nhow that will work. My moms plan just takes longer to explain. (Explains\nher mom\'s policy.) For so many people this is their first election; my mom\nan advocate for automatic registration at 18. For people who haven\'t voted\nbefore and believe in Sanders\' vision, may not understand that Obama had 60\nvotes for ACA, he only had 60 votes. And many D lost their jobs. Sanders\nintro\'d 9 times and never had dem cosponsor. There\'s idealism that I really\nrespect but hope people can think about what\'s achievable. And how we pay\nfor it. Sanders\' plan by own estimation is 13T and others put higher. Close\nto our GDP in entire year. Not what people think about.\n\nQ: experience is why she should be president\nA: and how change is made. Progressive is someone w record of making\nprogress. In senate career he sponsored three pieces of legislation and two\nwere to rename post offices in VT.\n\nQ: people see your mom as establishment even though they agree w what she\nsays. And people don\'t know what socialism is. People are So angry at\nestablishment.\nA: sanders has been in office almost as long as I\'ve been alive.\nEstablishment doesn\'t want to make change. President Obama isn\'t part of\nestablishment. ACA and economy. John Lewis is leading voice for more than\nthree decades - is he establishment. Is PP establishment? Is HRC? This is\nreally and unhelpful construct. I get it. Someone who has been in elected\noffice for longer than her mom has and these people supporting my mom have\nmade more change. Who are the change makers? On women\'s rights or gay\nrights or gun control, what my mom has done vs sanders has done, she has\nbetter record.\n\nQ: kids don\'t remember how successful your dads presidency was. Have her\ntalk about issues like this\nA: What I talk about, she does talk about. May not be covered.\n\nQ: if college is free there\'s no capacity\nA: no incentive to keep costs down\n\nQ: need a catchy phrase like yes we can to organize young people. She is so\nmuch better than 2008\nA: thank you. 2008 was different but Obama in two years was more effective\nthan sanders in his career.\n\nQ: sanders is inspiring and we see people like that win. But Hillary is one\nof most inspiring people and she champions service.\nA: she talks about a lot but may not get coverage. Lots of support from\nAmericorps alum.\n\nQ: flint resident. Don\'t forget about flint when not in headlines.\nA: completely agree. It\'s why she talks about flint. She said, Within a\nweek she will articulate what she will do as president but also\nimmediately. Water distribution and on health. Generations long. What your\nsenators are doing is important. Looking now for headstart funding. That\nwill happen on Monday. Sanders opening campaign office on Monday. Different\nkind of engagement.\n\nQ: he called for Snyder to resign but we want him to fix it\nA: that\'s (resigning) not an answer either. And mayor only there since\nNovember.\n\nQ: from county clerk: infrastructure difficulties but no records and using\nand missing literally pieces of paper. Give counties money for tech to find\nwhere future issues will be. Will give you my card.\nA: I agree\n\nQ: elementary school and in Detroit teachers have to keep kids safe and\nalive instead of teach. Pre K instead of focus on college afford.\nA: record of pre k to little rock. HIPPY. She talks about a lot - how to\nmake universal and affordable. Seems more distant to young people. On\nelementary thru HS, she fought for in senate every year to provide more\nfunding to title 1 schools and districts.\n'
