john.podesta@gmail.comb"Thank you John and Marlon. I am sharing this with our Democratic State Chair John Currie and our Democratic State Political Director Jennifer Holdsworth. They are doing outstanding work on their time to replica our 2008 primary victory by securing the county lines especially, Essex, Bergen , Hudson, and  Passaic.  That is  our path to victory and the electoral college votes. The bottom  line is to finalize the appointment as State Campaign Chair and State Director for the State Chair Currie. Through the additional leadership of Josh , Michael Kempner, Phil Sellinger and  myself ,we will continue to work on the finances with Anne. As the Secretary knows ,we will deliver as in 2008 however these are the players to get the total job accomplished for 2016. Best, John\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6..p.s.

This is a great achievement at this stage of the campaign. Please keep in mind that the Chair has the totally backing of the N.J. Democratic leadership including Josh , Michael, and myself ,for the Hillary campaign manager/state directorship. No one else has this backing and support. We are cutting through the campaign red tape directly to you ,the decision makers. Please let the Secretary know of our support and the outstanding evolving leadership /organization of our Democratic State Committee. We will deliver as we did in 2008 the 15 electoral college vote for Hillary Clinton. This appointment is a must. Best, John.\r\n\r\nJohn F.X.
