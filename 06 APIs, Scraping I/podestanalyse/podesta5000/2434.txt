john.podesta@gmail.comb'John, \n\nThe boy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know the word quit. That\xe2\x80\x99s how we raised him. It\xe2\x80\x99s also why you\xe2\x80\x99ve received so many emails and calls from him over the last few days.\n\nHe is determined to make it to Congress to fight for the changes we want to see. More funding to improve our schools. Reforms to our criminal justice system. And for someone to bring some sense to these people in Congress who always want to shut down the government.\n\nGlenn\xe2\x80\x99s race can\xe2\x80\x99t be won without you, which is why I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you to donate to his campaign before tonight\xe2\x80\x99s midnight deadline here, www.act.myngp.com/forms/5701968945981294592.\n\nMy humble thanks,\n\nVivian Ivey\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n|    Paid for by Glenn Ivey for Congress    |\n---------------------------------------------\n\nGlenn Ivey for Congress\nPO Box 674\nBladensburg MD 20710 United States\n\nIf you believe you received this message in error or wish to no longer receive email from us, please http://iveyforcongress.ngpvanhost.com/unsubscribe?mmid=-6799305612736460800&tiid=-3232605366721837056.'
