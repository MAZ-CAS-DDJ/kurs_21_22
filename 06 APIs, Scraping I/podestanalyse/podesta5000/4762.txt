john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\n\nCNN failed to ask a single questions about veterans in the last debate.  There was a huge outcry from veterans and organizations that represent us.  \n\nI personally was very critical of Jake Tapper (directly to him).  He responded by creating a web page on cnn.com focused on vets, asking questions on state of the union, etc.  \n\nI doubt Anderson Cooper will go through the debate without asking a veterans question.  But at any point, Secretary Clinton could really make a statement by pointing out the lack of questions in last GOP CNN debate and mention the need to care for the veterans we have.  It fits in nicely anytime there is  discussion on ISIS, Syria, Afghanistan, etc.  \n\nA powerful line is:  \xe2\x80\x9cthe republicans in congress sure seem focused on creating new combat veterans in wars all over the world.  i only wish they spent a fraction of that time caring for the ones they already created.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI know incredibly late in the process and so many issues you have to navigate so I understand that not likely to get injected.  But I wanted to send along.\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n '
