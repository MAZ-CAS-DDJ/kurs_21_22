john.podesta@gmail.comb'Dear John,\n\nSince the minute President Obama took office, the Republicans have launched a highly coordinated attack to paint him as very "different" than "real" Americans. Do you remember the barrage of attacks Donald Trump lead about the legitimacy of his birth certificate?\n\nNo one had ever asked that question of a white President. They won\'t either.\n\nThey have pretended it is all about policy differences, but for many, their true motives come from racism, fear, and hatred. It\'s disgusting. Now, they are hiding behind false logic by using the pretext of a Supreme Court nomination to say President Obama doesn\'t have the same powers and responsibilities as white presidents before him.\n\nI know that you\'re as tired as I am of seeing conservatives play the same old song and dance about President Obama. Luckily, we have the tools to fight them -- your voice. If we can work together to retake the House and the Senate in 2016, we can restore true equality and racial justice to our political system. We can ensure that the Republicans finally pay a real political price for their recurring racism against President Obama and minorities across the country.\n\nOur fundraising deadline is Monday and we need to raise $10,000 by then to ensure I\'m in Congress to fight for justice, fairness, and equality for all. Can you contribute $10 to help us hit the goal? \n \n\nsecure.actblue.com/contribute/page/feb2016_eom_honda?refcode=em20160226-eom&recurring=yes\n\n\nI experienced insidious racism first hand when my family was forced from our home and into internment camps. Millions of people face it every day -- in depressed wages, police brutality, and the politics pursued by Republican politicians. President Obama faces it in the way he has been treated as our Commander-in-Chief.\n\nNo one should be made to feel different. You deserve leaders who will fight to make America just and equal. I\'ve always promised to fight for that in Congress, and I know I am not alone because you\'re standing with me. Let\'s work together to make sure every one of us -- from President Obama to the most vulnerable amongst us -- is treated with the same respect and decency regardless of race, sex, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity.\n\nShow conservatives that love is stronger than hate by giving $10 or more today.\n\nIn solidarity,\n\nMike Honda\n\nPaid For By Mike Honda for Congress\n\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.
