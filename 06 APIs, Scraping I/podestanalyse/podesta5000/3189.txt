According to TV Program dedicated to US Arsenal as many as 7000 UAV are being stored unused in Magazines instead of attacking targets in Afghanistan with the following emerging advantages:\n1) Severing Terror Organizations' from their Financial Sources\n2) Salvation of millions of potential Drug Addicts from awful agony and death.\n3) Acceleration of Troops pulling out from Afghanistan due to Intensification of Aerial raids.\n4) Restoration of US Deterrence as a result of UAV strengthening.\nI believe in Terror Overwhelming defeat under those circumstances.\n5) I remember UN 1946 Chapter 51 (self defense right that every country deserves) but being surprised by US failing of its Exercise in spite of its Technical Preponderance\n6) Despite my Thorough UAV Special Version Design for Narcotic Vegetation Eradication even one word of Acknowledgement has not reached my mailbox hitherto.\n7) Ignominious for a Super Power isn't it?\n\nSincerely,\n\nGideon  Rodeh \n\n\n\n \n\nl\n"
