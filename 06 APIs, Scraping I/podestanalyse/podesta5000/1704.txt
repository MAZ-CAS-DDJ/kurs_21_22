Their hard work and sacrifices around the globe keep us safe here at home, and they deserve our gratitude.\n\nThe Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Guardsmen of today face different threats and challenges than the troops of the past. Yet they are all united in their commitment to our country and their selfless desire to serve a greater cause.\n\nAs we remember their service on Veterans Day, we should also reflect on the debt each of us owes to those who have served, as well as their families. It's important for all of us to honor our veterans and ensure that when our servicemen and women return home, they are greeted with respect, honor, and opportunity.\n\nTo all our veterans and all their families -- happy Veterans Day from all of us in Colorado.\n\nThank you,\n\nMichael\n\nPS -- On a personal note, if this is a topic that interests you, I highly recommend the book Thank You For Your Service by David Finkel. It's a harrowing and essential read that lays bare the challenges our veterans face when they return home.\n\n***Paid for by Bennet for Colorado***\n\nThis e-mail was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.\n\nClick here to unsubscribe: \nhttp://www.bennetforcolorado.com/subscriptions/?email=podesta@law.georgetown.edu\n\n"
