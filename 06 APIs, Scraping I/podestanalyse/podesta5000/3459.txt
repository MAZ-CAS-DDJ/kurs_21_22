But it is a very tricky issue, if you want to do anything more than have Hillary weigh-in against BDS. The real question is whether to acknowledge for many of the leaders no change in Israeli policy will satisfy them. But their ability to get supporters on US campuses and in European public opinion and EU foreign ministers (e.g. labeling West Bank products) comes not from anti-Israel or anti-Semitic views, but because of sincere concerns with Israeli settlement policy (this is also why the Pew poll shows less than 50 percent of self-identified Democrats support Israeli policies, compared to 80 percent of Republicans).\n> Although I know Hillary is close to Haim Saban, his partnership with Sheldon Adelson, who has a Likud agenda, may not be the best offensive against BDS.\n> Obviously, she should not in any way criticize this initiative, quite the contrary. But she should stress the critical importance of AVOIDING MAKING ISRAEL A PARTISAN ISSUE.\n> \n> The JPPI which Dennis Ross and I co-chair has just done a massive study of BDS for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, so I am steeped in the issue.\n> \n> I think it is important for Hillary not to alienate or criticize liberal Democrats and liberal Jews, but to make the point that joining the BDS campaign is NOT the appropriate way to respond to concerns about Israeli settlement policy, and it  also creates a DOUBLE-STANDARD, since it fails to recognize Palestinian obduracy to the Kerry initiative and to make the tough compromises on their "right of return" necessary for a deal. \n> \n> I  will share some talking points I will present Tuesday in Israel to the General Assembly of UJA. I am in Princeton now for a wedding and leave on a late flight for Israel. I am copying my assistants and asking them to send you my Leo Baeck Institute  speech (2014) and my May 2015 speech in Vienna for the late Hans Suchapira, because both contain polling data and personal anecdotes about the very real increase in anti-Semitism and anti-Israel feeling in Europe, quite apart from the Moslem youth dimension.\n> \n> If you want to talk, I am available until 4:30 pm today and you can reach me in Israel Monday night.\n> \n> Best wishes,\n> \n> Stu\n> \n> ----- Original Message -----\n> From: Jake Sullivan [mailto:jake.sullivan@gmail.com]\n> Sent: Sunday, June 21, 2015 12:16 PM\n> To: Eizenstat, Stuart\n> Subject: BDS\n> \n> Stu - hope you are well.  \n> \n> I was talking to HRC today about the idea of having her meet with some Jewish leaders later this week about BDS/delegitimization efforts.
