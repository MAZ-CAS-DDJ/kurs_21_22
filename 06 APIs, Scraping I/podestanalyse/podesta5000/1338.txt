According to the debate\'s official program, it is sponsored by several extremist groups, including the Oath Keepers militia group and the radical anti-communist John Birch Society. You can see a picture of the programhere<http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/program.jpg>. Here\'s the John Birch Society\'s booth at the site of the debate:\n[cid:image001.jpg@01CC0B47.7AE78AC0]<http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/johnbirch_crop.jpg>\n\nABC News reports that The John Birch society, famous for its vocal opposition to the Civil Rights movement, represents "the far-right fringe of American politics<http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2010/02/farright-john-birch-society-2010.html>." The Southern Poverty Law Center has listed the John Birch Society as a group that "advocates or adheres to extreme antigovernment doctrines<http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2006/spring/the-year-in-hate-2005/active-patriot->." The group was so radical - calling President Eisenhower a communist infiltrator and claiming that the Soviets used fluoridated water to control Americans\' mind - that they were effectivelyexiled<http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2010/02/farright-john-birch-society-2010.html> by conservatives until 2010. They even recently called Nelson Mandela "a communist terrorist thug<http://www.jbs.org/jbs-news-feed/5755-qinvictusq-and-the-truth-about-mandela->."\n\nHere is the Oath Keepers booth at the debate site:\n[cid:image002.jpg@01CC0B47.7AE78AC0]<http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/oathkeepers_crop.jpg>\n\nAs ThinkProgress reported<http://thinkprogress.org/2010/05/31/oath-keeper-sheriff/> on the Oath Keepers:\n\nThe Oath Keepers\' website is riddled with paranoid rhetoric about government officials "disarm[ing] the American people," "confiscat[ing] the property of the American people, including food and other essential supplies," and "blockad[ing] American cities, thus turning them into giant concentration camps." In early 2008, the Oath Keepers\' founder warned that a "dominatrix-in-chief" named "Hitlery Clinton" would impose a police state on America and shoot all resisters. After primary voters chose a different candidate, the Oath Keepers simply rewrote their paranoid fantasy to include a taller, African-American lead. At a Center for American Progress Action Fund event remembering the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing, former President Clinton described the Oath Keepers as a "hatriot" group that embraces the same violent rhetoric that fueled Timothy McVeigh.\n\nAre Tim Pawlenty and the other candidates at tonight\'s debate aligning themselves with the extreme views of these groups?\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the "big campaign" group.\n\nTo post to this group, send to bigcampaign@googlegroups.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send email to bigcampaign-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\n\nE-mail dubois.sara@gmail.com with questions or concerns\n \nThis is a list of individuals.
