john.podesta@gmail.comb'John,\n\nI have the best supporters in the world. And, yeah, I know I\x92m bragging, but you never cease to amaze me.\xa0\n\nSo it shouldn\x92t have surprised me when I got a call from a supporter who was fired up after hearing noise about a potential rematch.\n\nWell, this supporter was so eager to fight back, she and her husband offered to match every dollar we raise online in the next 36 hours up to $10,000! \x93We need to build this campaign now,\x94 she told me.\n\nClick here to rush $35 before tomorrow at midnight and your contribution will be doubled to $70. Help us tell the GOP that this seat isn\x92t up for grabs.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/seanmaloney?refcode=20130528d&amounts=35,50,100,250,1000\n\nIt\x92s true, Washington Republicans are already setting the stage for a rematch. Speaker Boehner\x92s Super PAC has already run television ad attacking me for opposing Medicare cuts.\n\nShowing our strength is the best way to keep out those shadowy special interests that dumped millions into the race last year for my opponent.\n\nThat\x92s why these generous supporters want to partner with all of us to send a message. So whatever you give in the next 36 hours, it\x92ll be doubled.\n\nClick here to donate today and your contribution will be matched, dollar-for-dollar.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/seanmaloney?refcode=20130528d&amounts=35,50,100,250,1000\n\nLike I said before, you guys are the best and none of this is possible without you.\n\nThank you. \n\nSean \n\nPaid for by Sean Patrick Maloney for Congress\n\nSean Patrick Maloney for Congress\nPO Box 270\nNewburgh, NY 12550\n\nTo unsubscribe from this mailing list, click here - http://images.myngp.com/unsubscribe.aspx?crypt=Casv%2frrJxGAq9DTl%2f1OHiEqlBmoYAWIQefwMWwlI0Go%3d\n\nPowered by NGP VAN, Inc.\n\n'
