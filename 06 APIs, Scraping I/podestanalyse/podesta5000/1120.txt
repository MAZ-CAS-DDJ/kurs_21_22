Infuriatingly for them (and me too, but for very different reasons), Donald Trump continues to dominate the airwaves with free media coverage and climb in the polls.\n\nSuper PACs can only do so much, and uber-wealthy donors are starting to realize their millions can only get them so far. \n\nSmall-dollar donors who contribute using ActBlue don't have to worry about wasting their money. We process contributions and get checks out to campaigns and committees in the same week, so those grassroots dollars get put straight to work.\n\nIt's going to take unprecedented resources to expand our servers to process the millions of contributions we'll be handling this year and move that money quickly. Will you chip in $15 a month to help us handle all of the contributions Democrats will need to get elected in 2016?\n\nBecause you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:\nExpress Donate: $15 a month [ https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ineffective?express_lane=true&amount=15&recurring=true&refcode=rec_shi_a&refcode2=15_t ]\nExpress Donate: $25 a month [ https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ineffective?express_lane=true&amount=25&recurring=true&refcode=rec_shi_a&refcode2=25_t ]\nExpress Donate: $50 a month [ https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ineffective?express_lane=true&amount=50&recurring=true&refcode=rec_shi_a&refcode2=50_t ]\nExpress Donate: $100 a month [ https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ineffective?express_lane=true&amount=100&recurring=true&refcode=rec_shi_a&refcode2=100_t ]\nOr donate another amount [ https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ineffective?amount=15&recurring=true&refcode=rec_shi_a&refcode2=x_t ]\n\nSuper PACs might allow mega-donors to contribute without a legal limit, but they're turning out to be pretty ineffective. \n\nEspecially since super PACs are meant to be separate from their official campaigns, so the candidates themselves don't have any access to those millions of dollars.\n\nThat's not the case for Democrats who use ActBlue to fundraise. The contributions they receive get put directly into campaigns and committees who rely on small-dollar support to do their work. \n\nWe're providing a fast, easy, and entirely efficient way for Democrats to connect with millions of grassroots supporters, but we're a non-profit and we can't continue this work through 2016 without support from small-dollar donors like you.\n\nWill you chip in $15 a month to help us scale up and provide even better tools for Democrats as we move through this election season?\n\nBecause you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:\nExpress Donate: $15 a month [ https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ineffective?express_lane=true&amount=15&recurring=true&refcode=rec_shi_a&refcode2=15_b ]\nExpress Donate: $25 a month [ https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ineffective?express_lane=true&amount=25&recurring=true&refcode=rec_shi_a&refcode2=25_b ]\nExpress Donate: $50 a month [ https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ineffective?express_lane=true&amount=50&recurring=true&refcode=rec_shi_a&refcode2=50_b ]\nExpress Donate: $100 a month [ https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ineffective?express_lane=true&amount=100&recurring=true&refcode=rec_shi_a&refcode2=100_b ]\nOr donate another amount [ https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ineffective?amount=15&recurring=true&refcode=rec_shi_a&refcode2=x_b ]\n\n>From all of us at ActBlue, thanks. \n\n-- Julia, Chris, Chelsea and the rest of the team----\n\nActBlue is the nation's largest source of funds for Democrats.
