Twenty years ago in Beijing she famously said, \xe2\x80\x9cHuman rights are women's rights, and women\xe2\x80\x99s rights are human rights.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn honor of International Women\xe2\x80\x99s Day, I wanted to share this new video with you. It follows Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s dedication to women\xe2\x80\x99s rights, from that speech in Beijing 20 years ago, through her time as Senator, Secretary of State and beyond.\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO\n\nIn those 20 years we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of progress, but there\xe2\x80\x99s still work to be done. I know we\xe2\x80\x99re up to the task. Hillary Clinton said the rights of women and girls remain \xe2\x80\x9cthe great unfinished business of the 21st century.\xe2\x80\x9d I think it\xe2\x80\x99s time we get down to business.\n\nJoin me in sharing this inspiring video. Let\xe2\x80\x99s work together to build on the progress already made by strong women like Hillary Clinton.\n\n  \n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s get down to business,\n\nBarbara Boxer \n \n\nP.S.
