Adding Milia's gmail for awareness.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Mary Podesta [mailto:podesta.mary@gmail.com] \nSent: Wednesday, June 03, 2015 10:50 AM\nTo: john.podesta@gmail.com\nCc: Eryn Sepp\nSubject: FW: Greetings from Singapore\n\nDid you respond?

I just wanted to drop in a quick note and see how you're doing. I am now based in Singapore, and will be coming to the States for a few days next month. I just realised that I don't have John's new email address, so took the liberty of contacting you. I hope you don't mind.\n\nI will be in DC from June 8-10, and New York from June 10-12. It would be great to see you and John if you are in those cities during that time. My husband is also coming with me, so I would love to introduce him to both of you since he has heard so much.\n\nHope we can have the opportunity to catch up next month!\n\nWarm regards,\n\nSeher\n\n"
