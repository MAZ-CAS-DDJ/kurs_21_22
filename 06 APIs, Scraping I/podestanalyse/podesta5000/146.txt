If she wins, Democrats have a great chance of taking back the Senate.\n\nBut the only way we can do this is by growing our grassroots network. Arizona is big -- so we're going to have to knock on lots of doors, make a lot of phone calls, and feed a lot of hungry volunteers to win.\n\nWe need to hit our $30,000 October goal to make it happen. Can you give $5 or more today?\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ake151031?refcode=ake151031_A&amount=25.00&firstname=John&recurring=true\n\nIf we miss this goal, we're also missing the opportunity to get our message out. We can't let Ann down.\n\nContribute today to help us reach $30,000 and take back the Senate.\n\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/ake151031?refcode=ake151031_A&amount=25.00&firstname=John&recurring=true\n\nThanks for your support!\n\nTeam Kirkpatrick----\n\nThis email was sent to podesta@law.georgetown.edu.\n\nTo unsubscribe, go to: \nhttp://kirkpatrickforsenate.com/subscriptions\n\n\nPaid for by Kirkpatrick for Senate\n\n"
