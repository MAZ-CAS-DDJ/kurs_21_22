Would love to have you.\r\n\r\nOne frustration following your departure has been the painful process of getting QER converged. The principal conclusion/recommendations are little changed from the meeting you were in at Jeff's office late January. We miss having you as a closer. We are pissing away an opportunity for a little bipartisan work with Congress as they have grown tired of waiting. On the plus side, we did get the defense nuclear waste out. Cheers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: John Podesta [john.podesta@gmail.com<mailto:john.podesta@gmail.com>]\r\nSent: Saturday, April 04, 2015 03:47 PM Eastern Standard Time\r\nTo: EJM\r\nSubject: Congratulations\r\n\r\n\r\nGlad you are getting some well deserved credit.
