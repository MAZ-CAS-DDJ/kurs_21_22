Tomorrow night we'll have a call where we'll review data in more\ndepth.\n\n*Nevada *\n\n   - We are up by seven points (50-43)\n   - Our lead is buoyed by high levels of supports from Latino and Af-Am\n   voters. We are in a dead heat with white voters\n   - Our biggest concern is enthusiasm and caucus knowledge. Sanders\n   supporters are more likely to know the ins and outs of the caucus. To\n   mitigate this, in the upcoming days our field team is focusing on caucus\n   education among our supporters.\n\n*South Carolina*\n\n   - We lead Sanders by 30 points (57 to 27)\n   - Like Nevada, our support is particularly high with people of color and\n   we are roughly tied with white voters. The difference between the states is\n   that far more African-American voters will participate in South Carolina\n   than Nevada.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions\n\n--elan\n"
